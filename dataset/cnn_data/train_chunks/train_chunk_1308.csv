"A hero dog saved the life of her companion by refusing to leave his side for three days after he was shot 38 times with a lead pellet gun. The two-year-old pointer cross found the four-year-old setter cross with only his head above water after being left for dead in a ditch on the Greek island of Zakynthos. The loyal dog went three days without food and barked continuously on a nearby grass verge to try and alert passers-by to her companion's plight. Scroll down for video . The dogs became inseparable after being rescued from a ditch on the Greek island of Zakynthos. Two-year-old pointer cross Juliet (right) found four-year-old setter cross Romeo (left) after he was shot 38 times . An X-ray of four-year-old  dog Romeo (above) shows the 38 lead pellets lodged in his body after the attack . It worked and a walker finally came to the rescue of the dogs, with both being taken into care by Greek vets. The dogs became inseparable and have now been nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, after moving to Holbrook Animal Rescue in Horsham, West Sussex. Kind-hearted members of the public who read about the tale on Facebook donated to a Go Fund Me page which enabled the rescue centre to fly them over to Gatwick Airport. They had previously been looked after by rescuers Zante Stray during their time on the Greek island. Romeo, who was hit 38 times with a lead pellet gun, was put on strong medication for ten days and his condition has now started to improve. Laura Santini, of Holbrook Animal Rescue, said: 'Romeo was very sick and poorly for a while but thankfully he is much better now. 'He got shot and was in danger but I think she would have starved before leaving him. She was there for three days and that is a long time for a dog not to eat. 'He was underwater, he was dying and it was dismal. It is amazing the vets managed to save him. Laura Santini, of Holbrook Animal Rescue in Horsham, West Sussex, said it was rare for dogs to bond to such an extent. She said Romeo (left) and Juliet (right), named by the centre) had been inseparable since arriving . The dogs, who were both believed to be stray while living on the Greek island, are now back to good health . 'The rescuers weren't expecting to take Juliet as well when they turned up but there was no way she was going to be left behind. 'We all thought they would probably start to play with the other dogs and make new friends but the more I look at them I don't think they will ever be apart.' The 49-year-old said it was rare for dogs to bond to such an extent. She said: 'They are as lovely as they were described to us and there was no exaggeration as to how close they are. 'I think they were friends before the accident. It is very rare for two dogs who don't know each other to be so inseparable. I think they must have lived together. 'They are unusual. We rescue hundreds of dogs and it is rare to get such a bond. 'It is one of the cutest stories I have ever been involved in and I am glad it has worked out happy in the end and we have got them here safely.' It is believed both dogs were strays but it is not clear who carried out the brutal attack. The rescue centre is now appealing for a new owner for the dogs to come forward.","Two-year-old pointer cross found fellow dog dying in ditch on Greek island .

"A happier hen makes really tasty eggs. At least that's the reasoning behind this humorous video of of a behind-the-scenes look at the 2015 Nice Pecks calendar. The Happy Egg Company took on board findings from research that showed the happier the hen is, the tastier the eggs will be, and rounded up some handsome cockerels trying their hand at eggs-treme sports. Eventually this cockerel gets into the football boots for his special sporty shot . It was a bit of a try, but this character settled down and got involved in a nice rugby picture . The artistic sports scenes will then be made into a special calendar for the hens down at the Happy Egg farm to provide them with some special enjoyment. First up is the star striker cockerel, who fits perfectly into a pair of football boots. Then it's the rugby-loving cockerel's turn in the spotlight, who struts his stuff, flaps his wings, and is snapped  perfectly for a shot kicking the egg-shaped ball through the posts. It is hoped the cockerel calendar will be enjoyed by the hens at the Happy Egg Company . There were a few tense moments on the pommel horse, but this cockerel soon faced the camera and got snapped . It was game, set and match for this stud, as he settled up next to the tennis ball . Celebrity and sports photographer Ian Derry, who was involved in the production of the calendar, said: 'I've photographed many famous people and many famous athletes. 'It was a good day, we got some great shots of some very athletic feathered sportsmen, that should keep the girls happy down at the farm.' Also included for the calendar is a gymnastics scene, and a tennis shot. Skateboarding was another sport to feature on the calendar of eggs-treme sports . This cockerel fancied going surfing in one of the more unbelievable scenes .","A happier hen makes tastier eggs, research has shown .

"He is known as the 'mystery artist' at his local pub because he often draws on their blackboard menu for fun. Now 16-year-old Jack Magee's name could become far more widely known after he won this year's British Cartoonists' Association's (BCA) Young Cartoonist of the Year competition. His cartoon, inspired by the discovery of Richard III's skeleton under a Leicester car park, tickled and impressed the judges, beating hundreds of other entries to the title in the under 18 age group. It shows the 15th century king buying a ticket for '500 years' from a pay and display machine. Impressive: Schoolboy Jack Magee's winning entry in the under-18 Young Cartoonist of the Year competition was inspired by the discovery of Richard III's skeleton under a Leicester car park . Yesterday talented schoolboy Jack said: 'It only took me about 45 minutes to do. 'I'd like to get into this as a career and we're getting to that stage in school where they're trying to push us into job choices. I have suggested being a cartoonist and I don't think the teachers hear that very often.' The artistic endeavours of Jack, a pupil at Earlston High School in the Scottish Borders, have previously been mainly appreciated by regulars and staff at the Buccleuch Arms, near his home in Melrose. He takes chalks in with him on meals out there with his parents and draws cartoons on their menu blackboard. The pub's owners have been so impressed with his work they started photographing them and posting them on the pub's Facebook page, dubbing him the 'mystery artist'. Jack's parents Maggie and Alain, both 52 and conservation advisers, say he has been 'drawing since before he was walking'. Mrs Magee said: 'He picked up a pen when he was a baby and started drawing on the back of an envelope. He's been doing it ever since and has been known to draw on napkins in restaurants too.' Past masters: Previous winners of the competition in Jack's age group include 2009 champion Nick Edwards, who went on to win an Emmy for his work on animated television series Uncle Grandpa (pictured) Venue: Jack and his fellow competition winners will be presented with their £250 prizes and certificates at the Cartoon Museum on Wednesday . Previous winners of the competition in Jack's age group include Nick Edwards, in 2009. In inspiring news for Jack and all aspiring young cartoonists, 24-year-old Mr Edwards' career has taken off since and he won an Emmy in August for 'outstanding individual achievement in animation' as a character designer for an episode of the American animated television series Uncle Grandpa. This year's under 30 age group in the BCA's Young Cartoonist of the Year was won by James Hunter, 26, a graphic designer from East London, who entered a cartoon of a man shooting himself with a 'bang' flag gun. He said: 'Like many of these things, I just drew it and showed it to a few friends who liked it. I was absolutely stunned to hear that it won. I've been drawing most my life but have only been submitting cartoons to magazines for about a year and have yet to be published.' A third prize, awarded in memory of former Private Eye cartoonist Kevin Woodcock, went to Sean Coen, 28, a receptionist and postroom worker, of Camden, London, for his 'Thought I'd upload all this **** to the icloud' cartoon. The judges in the annual competition were the cartoonists from nearly every national daily newspaper, including the Daily Mail's incomparable Mac, and Oliver Preston, chairman of the Cartoon Museum in London, whose work has appeared in publications ranging from The Field to The Spectator. The winners will be presented with their £250 prizes and certificates at the Cartoon Museum on Wednesday.","Jack Magee beat hundreds of entries in the contest's under 18 age group .

"Gareth Bale responded to his Real Madrid critics with one of the passes of the season and a sensational free-kick in his side's 3-0 win over Espanyol but still couldn't please everyone at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Welshman was accused of being selfish after Real Madrid's first defeat in 22 games last weekend away to Valencia but there was nothing selfish about his glorious 40-yard crossfield pass on 12 minutes that dropped on Cristiano Ronaldo's toe enabling him to cross first time for James Rodriguez to score Real Madrid's opener. And then on 20 minutes Bale took a free-kick from 30-yards out and hammered it home off the inside of Espanyol keeper Kiko Casilla's left-hand upright with Ronaldo looking on.

But in the second half Bale raced down the right and when he failed to play in Ronaldo who was charging through the centre the Portuguese reacted furiously shouting 'puta' (f***) and some supporters inside the stadium jeered Bale for having shot wide and ignoring Ronaldo. After the game, Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said he will take action if he sees any sign of selfishness among his players. 'Bale has played a very, very good game. He's played with intensity and he's scored,' Ancelotti said. 'It could be that at that moment the fans have asked for a pass to Cristiano which hasn't happened and like all strikers who are in front of goal he tried to score.' He added: 'Altruism is a very important component of the team this season. 'If there is any play which seems selfish we'll clearly fix it. We have fans who demand a lot. Bale is a fundamental player like Cristiano and for that the fans demand much more than of others.' Ronaldo who should pick up his second consecutive Ballon d'Or on Monday amost scored the third just before the break but delayed his shot and then failed to find a team-mate with a clever back heel into the area. Supporters inside the Santiago Bernabeu sang 'Ronaldo Ballon d'Or' throughout and were upset midway through the second half when he was booked for protesting the bizarre sending off of his best friend at the club Fabio Coentrao. The fellow Portuguese international needed treatment after a 50-50 clash with Espanyol's former Swansea midfielder Jose Cañas. After what looked like a harmless collision that left both players needing lengthy treatment referee David Fernandez stunned everyone pulling out a straight red card for Coentrao while not even showing a yellow to Cañas.

Bale and Ronaldo combined before sliding a pass for Rodriguez to open the scoring at the Bernabeu with a sidefoot finish . The extra man did nothing to aid Espanyol as they tried to get back into the game. It was after the sending off that Bale's miss – and failure to pass to Ronaldo – came and it was also when substitute defender Nacho appeared at the back post to head in Alvaro Arbeloa's cross from the left. The win for Madrid ended what had laughingly been called a crisis. They had lost their Spanish record-breaking run of straight wins the previous weekend at Mestalla and then lost the first leg of their Copa del Rey last-16 game against Atletico Madrid. It was suggested the World Club Cup winners badge now emblazoned on their shirts after they beat San Lorenzo in Morroco in December had cursed them but the badge had not weighed too heavy here as they made light work of Espanyol. They can now sit back and watch Barcelona entertain Atletico Madrid on Sundayat the Camp Nou knowing that whatever the result they will gain ground on at least one of their title rivals. Then on Thursday they will have the opportunity to come back from the 2-0 first leg reverse in the Copa del Rey against Diego Simeone's side.

"One of Britain’s biggest rural police forces will run out of cash to fight crime and protect the public within three years, its chief constable has warned. Neil Rhodes claimed Lincolnshire Police will effectively go out of business if the latest round of cuts takes place. He said the force would be ‘unsustainable’ by 2018, with a shortfall of £10.4million, meaning a fifth of frontline officers would have to be axed. Warning: Neil Rhodes, who leads Lincolnshire Police, (left) has warned Home Secretary Theresa May (right) that his force will collapse within three years unless it gets more cash . In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, he said he would have to scrap neighbourhood policing, with bobbies on the beat replaced by ‘just a few’ community support officers. Response times to 999 calls would rise and the ‘range of offences where a meaningful investigation will be possible will reduce’, Mr Rhodes added. Crimes such as theft would have to be largely ignored, and investigations into historic sex abuse and cyber-crime could not be pursued. The officer, who has more than 28 years’ experience, said he would not have spare staff to help at major events or emergencies outside his area. ‘If we were a business, then it would be being funded at below the cost of being in business,’ he said. ‘The cupboard is bare and it is likely that we will be the first force in the country to fall over.’ Last month Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary warned the ability of six forces, including Lincolnshire, Dorset and Suffolk, to provide an effective service would be at risk after cuts left a ‘very thin blue line’. Lincolnshire Police is particularly vulnerable as it covers the third largest area in England and Wales – 2,292 square miles – and has one of the smallest forces, due to the county’s few cities and relatively low population. Support: Mr Rhodes also said his officers would no longer be able to travel the country to support others during major events or emergencies, such as the Olympics or London riots . It has the third highest number of crimes per officer. The force has already cut 1,220 officers to 1,100, but Mr Rhodes said a further 236 frontline staff would have to go. Lincolnshire Police has been criticised in the past for the way it spends money. In 2008 bonuses of £40,000 were shared between three chiefs when the force was rated one of the worst in the country. Blundering officers who put the wrong fuel into police cars ran up a £10,000 repair bill in 2009. And in May this year, the Police Federation attacked the force’s plan to spend £600,000 recruiting 1,000 ‘volunteers’, saying the cash would be better spent hiring 25 frontline officers. But Mr Rhodes claims costs have already been reduced by collaborating with other forces and outsourcing non-frontline roles to private firms such as G4S. ‘In 2016-17 Lincolnshire Police will be … on the edge of viability,’ he wrote. ‘In the following year it will be unsustainable. To cut officer numbers by the amount needed would … compromise both public safety and officer safety.’ Last year, HMIC said it had ‘concerns’ about the force’s ability to maintain services after ‘significant’ budget cuts from 2015/16 with ‘one of the lowest spends on policing, small workforce numbers, low costs and limited further opportunities for economies of scale.’ Yesterday Alan Hardwick, the area’s police and crime commissioner, said: ‘My chief constable tells me that on an average Saturday night at 11pm, he has only 18 constables available to deploy in the city of Lincoln, and only ten in Boston.’ The Government announced a 20 per cent cut in police funding in 2010. The number of officers fell from 141,600 at the general election to 125,400 in March.","Lincolnshire Police chief says his force could be unsustainable by 2018 .

"A senior police officer has been arrested on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs. Chief Inspector Paul Cahill, 43, was allegedly found slumped over the wheel of his car. He has previously worked as a tactical adviser to the Metropolitan Police firearms unit, one of the toughest roles in policing. An outspoken campaigner for gay rights, he was awarded an MBE for services to diversity in the 2003 New Year Honours. The officer, who has been named in press reports as chief inspector Paul Cahill (pictured), was arrested in Wandsworth Road, south west London, after reportedly being found 'slumped over the wheel of his car' Cahill was arrested last Monday, December 1, after being found in his car in Wandsworth, South-West London. Colleagues found what they believed to be a stash of drugs during a search of the vehicle and his pockets. He was arrested on suspicion of possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply and driving while unfit through alcohol or drugs. Cahill was taken to a police station and released on bail pending forensic tests on the substances seized. It is understood that further suspicious substances, also believed to be Class A drugs, were found during a search of his home. The drugs have not been specified but Class A includes cocaine and heroin. Tattooed Cahill is a senior officer in Westminster, where he leads a proactive unit cracking down on crimes including drug dealing in the West End and Soho. Mr Cahill hit the headlines in 1997 after posing on the cover of Gay Times magazine in full police uniform . He joined the police in the 1990s and later revealed that it was ‘virtually not acceptable to be gay’. He became a gay icon when he appeared on the front cover of Gay Times in full sergeant’s uniform in 1997, the year after he had been the victim of a homophobic attack. He was also chairman of the Gay Police Association for more than a decade. He made his mark by working as a liaison officer with Soho’s vibrant gay community. Chief inspector Cahill was part of the Met Police's Westminster borough command and led a team carrying out pro-active operations to clamp down on crime, including drug offences, in the West End and Soho . One move was to use gay officers to forge closer links with pubs and clubs around Old Compton Street in the aftermath of the Soho nail bombing in 1999. He was nominated for an MBE by the then commissioner, Sir John Stevens, because of the success of his work. The honour was for ‘services to diversity in the police and the wider community’. Last night a Met spokesman said: ‘The officer has been suspended.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Chief inspector arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply .

"A letter from the head of a New York police union told officers they were facing a 'verified' threat by a militant prison group and warned cops Saturday to wear bulletproof vests and carry extra magazines. An NYPD spokesperson stated there was not a 'credible, specific threat' after Sergeants Benevolent Association president Ed Mullins warned of an organized action to shoot an on-duty officer. The New York Daily News reports Mullins sent the warning based on information that 10 members of the Black Guerrilla Family planned to shoot an NYPD officer. Warnings: An NYPD spokesperson stated there was not a 'credible, specific threat' after Sergeants Benevolent Association president Ed Mullins warned of an organized action to shoot an on-duty officer . 'Please WEAR your VESTS and carry your firearm off-duty along with additional magazines,' a letter signed by Mullins read. 'Your priority is to go home at the end of your tour!' The paper reports the threat was based on information gathered Friday by an undercover officer. A spokesperson for the NYPD forwarded a statement from the department stating that the information was not a 'credible, specific threat' to NYPD officers. 'The threat information referenced in a recent news story relates to another East Coast City and does not make reference to New York City or its police,' the statement read. 'We continue to monitor and investigate any threat information as it surfaces. We will continue to advise all members of the service of any credible information relating to officer safety.' The Black Guerrilla Family is a militant prison group founded in 1966 at San Quentin State Prison that eventually developed a strong membership in Maryland as well.

"A British jihadi has died after setting off a suicide bomb in Iraq killing 'dozens' of people, according to pro-Islamic State reports. The bomber, named as Abu Abdullah al-Britani, was said to have caused the blast near the city of Samarra, around 78 miles north of the country's capital Baghdad. He reportedly detonated a bomb in a car, targeting a group of police officers in the city's Al Mu'tasim district. Suicide bomber: Abu Abdullah al-Britani (pictured) is said to have caused the blast near the city of Samarra, around 78 miles north of the country's capital Baghdad . Scene of the attack: Abu Abdullah al-Britani died after setting off a suicide bomb in the Iraqi city of Samarra (pictured) killing 'dozens' of people . Samarra, which was once the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate was named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, has been the scene of fierce fighting in recent days between Iraqi Security Forces and ISIS supporters. Militant bases nearby were the focus of US air strikes on Friday. However, pro-ISIS sources were claiming that the part of the city where the bombing is said to have taken place was now under the control of the Islamic militants. Reports of the blast, and of the district being under ISIS control have not been verified. The ISIS-linked Al-Battar Media Foundation tweeted: 'Dozens of apostates killed in the operation of Abu Abdullah al-Britani in al-Mu’tasim area near #Samarra#IS #ISIS.' Militants: Some 32 British nationals are known to have died fighting for IS forces in Iraq and Syria . Other reports said that the source of the blast had been a car bomb and the targets had been police officers. Charlie Winter, a researcher with anti-extremist think thank the Quilliam Foundation, tweeted: '#Iraq: Another Briton dies in #IS VBIED op - Abu Abdullah al-Britani targeted a police gathering near #Samarra.' A British jihadi with the same name was reported as being killed in an airstrike in Syria last month and a number of IS fighters from the UK are believed to use the moniker. Some 32 British nationals are known to have died fighting for IS forces in Iraq and Syria. Reports of the blast came after at least nine people were killed after militants attacked a police station the village of al-Salman, around 60 miles away from Samarra. The al-Salman attack came a day after a bombers targeted Shia areas around Baghdad, killing ten people . The attack started at dawn with a suicide car bomber hitting the blast walls that surround the police station in the village, just outside the town of Tarmiyah, a police officer said. An assault by armed militants then followed. The attack killed five police officers and four civilians, leaving 11 other people wounded. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Iraqi forces, backed by US-led airstrikes, are fighting the extremist Islamic State group, which now controls about a third of the country. The al-Salman attack came a day after a string of bombings targeting Shia areas around Baghdad killed ten people amid tight security measures to protect pilgrims heading to the holy city of Karbala to attend the religious commemoration known as Arbaeen. The event, which draws hundreds of thousands of Shia pilgrims, marks the passing of 40 days after the anniversary of the seventh century martyrdom of the revered Shia saint Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.","Bomber named as Abu Abdullah al-Britani reportedly caused deadly blast .

"'Cost of living' crisis: Labour leader Ed Miliband controversially promised to freeze energy bills if his party wins the General Election next year . Complaints by consumers about their energy supplier have tripled in the past year and are on target to hit 50,000 for 2014, according to figures from the industry ombudsman. In the year to November the Energy Ombudsman received 47,731 complaints, compared with 16,155 for the same period last year. At least 3,500 have been registered every month this year. Energy costs have been at the centre of the ‘cost of living’ crisis that has dominated politics since Labour leader Ed Miliband controversially promised to freeze energy bills if Labour wins the Election next year. The Government responded by persuading energy companies to lop £50 off the average cost of energy bills, which are just over £1,300 a year. An inquiry by regulators into the entire energy market is also under way. There were more than 5,100 complaints in November. Almost 4,400 were about bills. Inaccurate bills accounted for 737 complaints that month. The other main causes of complaints over billing occurred when no bill was received or the charges were disputed. Inaccurate meter readings also accounted for a large proportion of complaints. The number of complaints relating to switching providers, a common cause of dispute in recent years as it has become easier to do and more frequent, fell in November. The top grievance about transferring providers was that the request to switch had not been acted on. Chief Ombudsman Lewis Shand Smith said: ‘While November’s figures show consumers are increasingly willing to escalate complaints when they feel they have been wronged, it is encouraging to see a drop in the number of problems relating to transfers and sales.’ The figures are not broken down for individual energy providers. But in customer service rankings published by consumer organisation Which? in September, npower had the most complaints and ScottishPower was second. Last month, ScottishPower was told by regulator Ofgem to improve customer service within three months or else it will be banned from actively recruiting customers, while npower faced a similar situation earlier this year. Both companies have paid millions of pounds in fines for poor customer service. More than two million households have deserted the Big Six energy suppliers – npower, British Gas, ScottishPower, SSE, E.ON and EDF Energy – which dominate the UK market, for smaller, independent providers. Comparison sites show that consumers can save about £200 a year by switching. Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: ‘Improving customer service is key.’ Problems: One of the main causes of complaints over billing occurred when no bill was received or the charges were disputed.

"Alex Salmond relaunched his political career yesterday with a boast that his party could hold the balance of power at the next General Election. The former first minister announced that he intends to stand for Parliament by seeking the SNP’s nomination in the constituency of Gordon. But he said his Scottish nationalists could emerge as power brokers if no party wins an overall majority in Westminster. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond, who quit as SNP leader hours after losing the independence referendum, said he would 'step up to the plate' and stand for election in the Gordon constituency. He announced the decision at the Buchan Hotel in Ellon (pictured) In return for propping up a Labour government, he said another independence referendum is likely to be among the SNP’s top demands. Claiming there is the ‘prospect of real power for Scotland’ if the SNP wins a significant number of Commons seats, he warned of turning Westminster ‘upside down’. Mr Salmond stood down as SNP leader and First Minister last month and speculation over his political future has continued ever since. Today he revealed will stand in the Gordon constituency, a seat that shares some areas with his Aberdeenshire East Holyrood constituency, and is currently represented by Liberal Democrat Sir Malcolm Bruce, who is retiring in May. Mr Salmond said: 'In the weeks since the referendum the people of Scotland have refused to give up on the hope of a better Scotland. 'For those who voted Yes the referendum offered the possibility of real change. For many who voted No they insist on the vow being properly redeemed. 'Therefore it is incumbent on all of us to step up to the plate – to match the spirit being shown by the people. Therefore I can tell the constituency today that I am a candidate for the SNP nomination for Gordon.' Some polls have put the SNP well ahead in Scotland, threatening to reduce Labour to a rump of just a handful of seats. It raising the prospect of the SNP holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories fail to secure an overall majority. But Mr Salmond insisted the SNP would not do a deal with the Tories in 'any shape or form'. 'There are other possibilities, and in these possibilities a strong group of SNP MPs will have the capacity to rumble up Westminster.' Mr Salmond said it was 'unlikely' he would sit in a Cabinet with Labour, but ruled nothing out . Asked whether he would sit in a Cabinet with Labour, Mr Salmond told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: 'That is unlikely I would have thought but I'm not ruling it out, I'm just saying it's unlikely. 'I'm actually the only person who has actually run a minority government in these islands incidentally. 'I had four years of doing that in the Scottish Parliament so you learn a great deal when you're on the receiving end of being a minority government and therefore you have some evidence as to how to accept the best possible influence to secure the best possible result for progressive thought across these islands.' Mr Salmond also played down the prospect of leading the SNP MPs in Westminster. He said: 'I have been First Minister of Scotland. I have no interest in titles and fully support Angus Robertson who is an excellent leader of the SNP at Westminster, a close friend and a fine MP. 'I am perfectly content as a constituency member of parliament and will seek to have a role in negotiating the progress for Scotland which would arise from a powerful group of SNP MPs and our allies. Nicola Sturgeon has replaced Mr Salmond as SNP leader and Scottish First Minister . Mr Salmond was previously an MP for Banff and Buchan between 1987 and 2010 and will set out his plans in a speech in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, today. Since the referendum, support for the SNP has swelled and the party's membership has grown from 25,000 to more than 92,000. Recent polls have also predicted large gains for the party at next year's general election, with one showing the SNP leading Labour by 46 per cent to 26 per cent in Scotland. Mr Salmond, who remains an MSP, has regularly been asked about his future since stepping down as First Minister but has so far refused to confirm his plans. The Gordon seat, which will now become one of the most-watched in next year's general election, was won by the Lib Dems with a majority of 6,748 over the SNP in 2010. Incumbent MP Mr Bruce said: 'People in Gordon rejected the First Minister's independence plans overwhelmingly at the referendum. 'I am sure that they would be delighted to have the chance to reject him again in May. Bring it on.' Lib Dem candidate Christine Jardine, who hopes to replace the retiring Mr Bruce as the local MP, said the area had been 'short changed' during Mr Salmond's time as First Minister. 'I'm delighted the former First Minister is set to put an end to the game-playing,' she said. 'The people of Gordon deserve better, just as they deserve an MP who will stand up for what's important to them, not chase their personal political agenda at the cost of what's best for the people of the North East. 'I intend to be a strong voice for all the people of Gordon.' Alex Salmond is, in his own head at least, Mr Scotland. He was so destined for the role he made sure he was born on Hogmanay, December 31, that great night of Scottish celebration. He could only have been more pleased if he had shared a birthday with Robert Burns. But then Salmond is a man who is often pleased with himself. Clubbable to his fans, smug to his critics, there are many who will have delighted at his demise today. At Alex Salmond's press conference to announce his resignation as First Minister, journalists from unfriendly newspapers were locked out of the room in Bute House . Yet his abilities to charm his supporters and outfox his opponents transformed Scottish politics. It is a mark of the man that at the press conference to announce his resignation as First Minister hours after his referendum defeat, journalists from unfriendly newspapers were locked out of the room in Bute House. The referendum campaign was dominated by claims he sought to bully or intimidate those who did not share his enthusiasm for breaking up the Union. You were either on his side or against him, as the BBC's Nick Robinson discovered when he dared to question the details of his plans for independence. Critics were dismissed as scaremongers. Facts dismissed as lies, experts flatly ignored. That was how he ran things, spending 20 of the last 24 years as SNP leader. When he took charge in 1990, the Scottish Nationalists had just three MPs in Westminster. There was no such thing as a Scottish Parliament. Now there are six MPs in Westminster, an unprecedented overall majority in Holyrood, and having secured an historic referendum on independence. He said he wanted to put the future of Scotland in the hands of the Scottish people. They took his dream of separation and tore it to shreds. But he is a man who refuses to take no for an answer. Born in Linlithgow in 1954, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was educated at Linlithgow Academy and St Andrew's University, where he first joined the SNP. Graduating with a degree in economics and history, he worked as an economist for both the Government Economic Service and the Royal Bank of Scotland before being elected as an MP for the Banff and Buchan constituency in 1987. In 1981 he married Moira, 17 years his senior They have no children, and she is rarely seen in public, though she was on hand to smuggle a Saltire past Wimbledon security in her handbag for Salmond to wave when Andy Murray was crowned champion in 2013. Mr Salmond, who will turn 60 on New Year's Eve, said he had decided to 'step up to the plate' in the interests of Scotland . His election at Westminster followed a turbulent period for the SNP, which saw its number of seats fall from 11 to two in the 1979 general election. As a young and brash newcomer, Salmond played a role in the breakaway faction of the party known as the '79 Group' which sought to take a more left-wing stance. His brief expulsion as a result did not hinder his advancement within the party in the long-term, with his election to leader coming in 1990. With the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Salmond went on to serve as leader of the opposition at Holyrood, while retaining his seat at Westminster. He stood down as SNP leader in 2000 and left the Scottish Parliament in 2001. Returning as leader in 2004, he guided the SNP to a narrow Scottish election win in 2007 and then led a minority government as he became Scotland's first SNP First Minister. With the Tories all-but wiped out in Scotland, and Labour's big beasts serving in Tony Blair's Cabinet in Westminster, few could match Salmond's abilities. While New Labour viewed Holyrood as a small pond compared to the shark-infested waters of Westminster, Salmond was the biggest fish north of the border. He rebranded the Scottish Executive as the Scottish Government, greeting David Cameron in Edinburgh like a visiting dignitary, not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. After the 2011 elections, he bounced Westminster into accepting his claim to have a democratic mandate for a referendum. A year later he bounced David Cameron into accepting the timing of the referendum, and giving 16 and 17-year-olds the vote. A Star Trek fan, a keen golfer, an enthusiastic gambler, Salmond has a competitive streak to almost everything, even dieting. When trying to slim on the 5:2 diet, he boasted how he had shed the pounds faster than Chancellor George Osborne. He will turn 60 on Hogmanay this year, and his frequent jokes about his age on the campaign trail hinted at a private unease at this looming milestone. Yet even as he stood down as First Minister, he made clear voters had not seen the back of him. 'I am not going to withdraw entirely from public life,' he said. Now we know he will stand to become an MP in Gordon, certain to lead the SNP group in the Commons. The man who likes to challenge the history books could be about to write another new chapter.","Former First Minister to stand for election in Gordon constituency .

"Andy Murray has ended the most barren spell of his professional career by reaching his first final since winning Wimbledon 15 months ago. Murray came from a set down to beat Juan Monaco 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 in the Shenzhen Open in China to set up a showdown Sunday morning with Tommy Robredo. ‘He was dominating the match,’ said Murray, who has never endured such a lengthy period without reaching a final from the moment he won the first of his 28 titles in 2006. Andy Murray is through to the Shenzhen Open final after defeating Juan Monaco in three sets . Sunday's match with Tommy Robredo will be Andy Murray's first appearance in a final for 15 months . ‘I found it very tough in the sun — it’s extremely hot and humid and I’m not used to that where I come from.’ The 27-year-old Scot’s return to form in China also boosts his prospects of qualifying for November’s season-ending World Tour Finals in London. Murray’s place at the O2 Arena is in serious doubt. Only the top eight in the world qualify and he has nosedived to 11th in the rankings during a disappointing year. Rafael Nadal, whose place at the O2 had also been in doubt because of a wrist injury, makes a return to action this week at the China Open. Victory at the Shenzhen Open would enhance the Scot's hopes of reaching the ATP World Tour Finals . Nadal has not played since a shock fourth-round defeat by Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon. The world No3 injured his wrist while practising on his home island of Mallorca in late July and was forced to drop out of the US Open, where he was the defending champion. ‘I cannot say I’m 100 per cent because I still feel something when I start for the first five minutes of the practice,’ said Nadal. ‘But in general the injury is not limiting me to compete.’ Nadal has a tough opening game against France’s Richard Gasquet, while Murray, seeded six in Beijing, takes on Poland’s Jerzy Janowicz in the first round. Former world number one Rafael Nadal hasn't played competitively since Wimbledon in the fourth-round . Meanwhile, Petra Kvitova backed up her lopsided win over Eugenie Bouchard at Wimbledon with another emphatic victory over the Canadian to capture the inaugural Wuhan Open. Kvitova, who dropped just three games thrashing Bouchard at the Wimbledon final, was made to work harder this time before winning 6-3, 6-4. Bouchard’s cause was not helped by an injury when she jammed her finger with her racket on a follow-through. ‘I have hit a million forehands in my life and I still can’t hit one without hitting myself,’ she said.

"Schoolies celebrations may be winding down this week but it has not stopped some partying hard until the very end. More photos of school leavers getting up to no good have hit social media, with more Victoria and New South Wales teenagers heading to their chosen party destinations - including the Gold Coast and Byron Bay - as celebrations go into their third and final week. Though Queensland Police's official role on the Gold Coast ended on November 29, there has still been an increased officers' presence as school leavers that are of age descended.

Tamer photos show a man with just his pants on passed out on his bed halfway through texting his 'missus' on his mobile phone and a second one is seen buried up to his neck in sand on the beach.

An emerging trend with Schoolies is travelling overseas to celebrate the end of their high school careers. One school leaver posted a photo of himself cross-dressing by donning a bikini with white-polka-dotted red bottoms and a green top in Fiji. Other pictures that littered Instagram and Facebook were of people passing out in unusual positions or places, including one man lying down in the garden bed after he wet himself and another asleep in a trolley.

In the seven days from November 21 to November 28, 131 school leavers were arrested on a total of 152 charges, according to Queensland police media. At the conclusion of that week, Gold Coast District Officer Acting Chief Superintendent Des Lacy said he was overall pleased with the behaviour of the majority of this year’s Schoolies. 'While the number of schoolies attending the hub this year was up on last year the number of arrests were down,' Acting Chief Superintendent Lacy said. 'This is a clear result of effective policing strategies and a continued strong collaboration between police and a range of organisations including the event organisers, government departments, the local council, and volunteer agencies such as the Red Frogs.' Acting Chief Superintendent Lacy said the police's focus would shift to policing licensed venues in the last two weeks of celebrations as a majority of interstate Schoolies were over 18, with an increased police presence remaining at Surfers Paradise.","Schoolies week continues with celebrations ending on December 14 .

"Pete Evans has been slammed by medical professionals for promoting fluoride-free water . Pete Evans has been accused of expressing views that date back to the 'Stone Age' after the celebrity chef threw his weight behind a campaign on fluoride-free water. Not a stranger to controversy, the My Kitchen Rules judge has come under fire yet again for what some have perceived as extreme dietary views after revealing that his family steers clear of consuming Australian tap water. Evans' remarks have enraged medical professionals who have described his standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice. Evans proudly adorns a 'Fluoride Free WA' t-shirt on Facebook to promote the Perth-based lobby group's cause. 'Alkalised water (maybe I just should've just said filtered water?) - we have a portable mineral pot ($500) water filter which rids tap water from potential carcinogens (chorine, chemicals, bacteria etc),' he said in a post on his Facebook page. 'I realise there's plenty of controversy around alkalised water, but I would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water, as it works out cheaper in the long run, and is environmentally friendly.' Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone hit back at the outspoken chef telling Daily Mail Australia that Evans needed to stick to what he does best. Some slogans on the Fluoride Free WA Facebook page that Evans is a passionate advocate for . Evans and his family don't drink tap water . 'All evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities, the World Health Organisation, and by the Australian Dental Association points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay,' Dr Bartone said. 'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.' 'People like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking.' Evans has previously been slammed for his endorsement of the controversial Paleo diet, which his family abides by, that includes meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit but excludes dairy or cereal products and processed food. 'I'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because I choose to eat and feed my family what I believe to be a nutrient dense diet,' he said on his Facebook page. 'I can't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive?' He says his decisions are an important part of being a parent - adding that 'ignorance is not bliss'. 'I'm a father and I take that privilege very seriously, so for me striving for optimum health and trying new things whenever possible, so that I can be a responsible role model for my daughters and still be able to surf right up until the end, is the ultimate goal,' he posted. Evans (left) says his role as a father is to strive for optimum health for his children . Evans made the most of the warm weather with his daughter, Indii, at Bondi beach . However, Dr Bartone sees Evans' stance as abusing his high profile media personality. 'It is influencing vulnerable others - people who are time-poor - and will unfortunately just look at celebrity endorsement and think it must be good and follow the argument without delving into the facts, he said. 'It affects the health message we are trying to impart on our patients and the community at large - especially in times when know that health and well-being is crucial and key to a number of illnesses and health factors that have a huge cross burden on society.' This comes as Byron Shire Council's ban on fluoride in water has seen children by the age of six in the northern NSW coast area have almost three times as many decayed teeth as other parts of state where fluoride has been in the water for decades. He says his dietary decisions are an important part of being a parent - adding that 'ignorance is not bliss' Evans has also been under fire for endorsing the Paleo diet which doesn't allow dairy or cereal and processed products . Dr Bartone said the fear that people in the community express is that excess fluoride intake will cause damage which he says is not possible through water consumption. 'It's a theoretical argument that has unsubstantiated evidence - it just wouldn't happen,' he said. 'If some people purchased fluoride tablets that is probably one really unlikely way but possible way in which you get excess fluoride.' Dr Bartone said taking excess fluoride can cause damage to kidneys and other organs and possibly lead to weakening of the bones. Daily Mail Australia contacted Evans for comment but had not heard back before publication.

"This is the five-year-old boy who was stabbed to death in a 'sickening and violent' attack at his home in Scotland. Scott Chirashi had suffered a 'significant injury' and could not be saved by emergency services, after they were called to a flat in Alva, Clackmannanshire, on Friday morning. His mother, Farai Chirashi, 32, was detained by police and is due to appear in court tomorrow in connection with his death. It is understood she is being held under the Mental Health Act. Scott Chirashi, five, was found stabbed to death at his home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, on Friday morning . Members of the emergency services who attended the scene are believed to have been offered counselling, according to the Daily Record. One of the medics told the paper the boy had suffered a 'sickening and violent death'. The boy's older sister, believed to be named Natasha, was reportedly inside the house at the time of the incident, however, police have denied this claim. The family, who are originally from Zimbabwe, had lived in the town for years and moved to three years ago, along with Scott's father, Tichakunda Chiriseri. Tributes were left outside the home of a five-year-old boy who was found dead on Friday morning . The little boy, who has been named locally as Scott Chiriseri, had sustained 'significant injuries' in incident . They were reportedly members of Alva Baptist Church before the couple split 'a few' months ago. It has since emerged that Mr Chiriseri had joined a controversial religious organisation run by a self-styled prophet shortly before the break-up. The Stirling-based Agape For All Nations Ministries Internationals church is headed by former academic Dr Joseph Masocha, and describes itself as a 'fast-growing church established in 2007'. Dr Masocha, a former university lecturer who is also from Zimbabwe, sparked outrage after claiming he is a prophet 'annointed by God'. Neighbours demanded the council give him an ASBO after claims he was baptising people and carrying out exorcisms in his back garden. A spokesman for the church confirmed Mr Chiriseri was a member and said they were offering him counselling after his son was found dead. He said: 'It's obviously a very difficult time. He had been a member of the church for months and we understand he wasn't at the house because he had separated from his wife. 'I believe they split up a few months ago and she is not a member of our church.' Forensics teams remained at the scene in Alva, Clackmannanshire, while continuing their investigations . Residents have left floral tributes and teddies outside the flat, including one from Alva South Bowling Club . Residents have been left shocked and devastated by the death of the 'popular' little boy and several turned out to lay tributes at a makeshift shrine beside the flat yesterday. One mother, who asked not to be named, told the Scottish newspaper: 'Scott was in my son’s class. He was very popular and had a great personality.' Chigozie Ononiwu, a Nigerian IT worker who lives nearby, told the paper his son was in the same class as Scott at Alva Primary School. 'I cried when I heard what had happened to Scott. He was a lovely little boy and was due to come over to our house this weekend.' He added that it had been difficult to explain what had happened to his own son, who is 'very upset'. A Zimbabwean friend of the child's mother, who she met in 2006 at Stirling University while studying for a general nursing degree, said she was shocked to hear of Scott's death. She explained that the 32-year-old, who lived in Botswana before moving to Scotland, had been looking after her mother in Harare after the death of her father. She said: 'I know she loved that boy so much, I can’t believe it.' A police officer can be seen leaving another teddy among the other floral tributes after the 'horrific' stabbing . 'Shine bright and fly high' writes Brogan and his mother - a message among the dozens of tributes . William Wood, 30, the family’s former landlord, paid tribute to the dead boy. He said: ‘They were a lovely family from Zimbabwe, religious, did not drink alcohol of any sort, quiet, good neighbours, no trouble at all – among the best tenants we ever had. ‘Scott used to play with my wee boy who is around the same age – he was just three when we knew him. He was just a lovely, normal three-year-old. ‘We knew the parents as Fari and Titch. They had lived in our property for three years. We are really, really shocked.’ Local councillor Archie Drummond said the death had shaken the local community. He said: 'This has come as a real shock to this tight-knit town.' Tributes were left at the scene yesterday including a teddy bear with a message, which read: 'Dear God, Why???' Members of the emergency services who attended the scene are believed to have been offered counselling . A medic who dealt with the incident reportedly said the boy had suffered a 'sickening and violent death' A forensics team seen entering the flat in Alva, Clackmannanshire, after the death of the five-year-old boy . Another, from the bingo club at  Alva South Bowling Club, said: 'Sleep well little one,' while an array of teddies, flowers and candles were scattered at the front of the house. At the same time, forensics officers could be seen going in and out of the building and searching the grass outside the flat, apparently looking for the weapon involved. Emergency services were called to the address at 8.50am on Friday after a member of the public dialled 999. Chief Inspector, Stephen Sneddon, speaking on Friday said: ‘Emergency services in the Forth Valley responded to an address in Carnaughton Place, Alva, around 8.50am today in response to a call about the welfare of a five-year-old boy. 'On arrival, police officers found the child with a significant injury to his body. He was later pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service. A woman, believed to be the mother, is being questioned by police after he was found stabbed to death . Police said that they will be carrying out inquiries in the area and asked for the public's continued support . ‘Inquiries into the full circumstances surrounding this incident are ongoing and a woman is currently detained in connection with the investigation. ‘We are not currently looking for anyone else and I want to reassure the local community that there is no risk to them. ‘Police officers will be carrying out various inquiries in the area and I would ask the public to continue to give us the full support they have shown so far, to allow us to conclude these investigations as soon as possible and allow the area to return to normal. ‘This is a quiet area and I would emphasise that this is a very unusual incident which poses no risk to others.’ Local Susan Smith, 48, said yesterday: ‘I walked past this morning and police officers in their white forensic suits were out scouring the grass in front of the place.’ An onlooker said: ‘Officers have been going in and out all morning, looking grim-faced. People say the woman being held is a young mum. It’s an awful tragedy.’ A spokesman for the Crown Office and Prosecutor Fiscal Service said: 'A 32-year-old woman has been detained in relation to the death but she has not been charged.' Police said there was one other child in the household, who was not at home when the incident occurred. Officers refused to say if the mother and dead child were known to social workers. When officers arrived at the flat Place at 8.50am, the boy was found with 'significant injuries' Police are not looking for anyone else in connection to the incident, which was described as an awful tragedy .

Heather Mack, 19, looks out from a cell at the Indonesian prosecutor's office as she is transferred to the island’s notorious Kerobokan Prison today . They were transferred to the custody of prosecutors but were reunited in the prosecutor's office while awaiting transfer. They kissed and cuddled, and Schaefer stroked Mack's belly several times. From her cell, Mack told reporters: 'My baby is a girl, she is fine. I want her to stay in Bali so she can visit me anytime while I'm in jail.' The couple now await a court appearance when they are expected to be charged with premeditated murder. Prosecutors have 20 days to decide whether to formally charge the couple and bring the case to court. If they believe it is too weak, they can ask police for more evidence. Bali police Col. Djoko Hariutomo said that officers had questioned 12 witnesses and that their case included information from the FBI. The couple were seen kissing and cuddling and Schaefer stroked six months pregnant Mack's belly several times . Mack, who is six months pregnant, will be under medical observation at the notorious prison . She told reporters from her cell today: 'My baby is a girl, she is fine. I want her to stay in Bali so she can visit me anytime while I'm in jail' Officers brought the physical evidence to the prosecutors in large sacks, including the iron grip of a fruit bowl alleged to be the weapon used in the slaying and several computer hard drives containing hotel surveillance camera videos. The pair were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the body of Heather’s mother, Chicago socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62, stuffed into a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel. Police claim the pair plotted Mrs Mack’s murder following an earlier argument between Heather and her mother over money. But the lawyer for the teenager claims that the killing was not premeditated and that Heather had hid in the bathroom while her mother was bludgeoned to death in her hotel room. Police claim the couple plotted to murder Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured, following an earlier argument between Heather and her mother over money . The pair have been transferred to the notorious Kerobokan Prison (pictured) while they await a court hearing . According to a statement Miss Mack has given to police, she had no part in her mother’s murder, but went along with helping her boyfriend move the body out of a sense of duty because he was the father of her unborn baby, who is due in March. The account she has given to police - which her lawyer Mr Raja Nasution hopes will result in her receiving a lesser charge  - paints a picture of a terrified young woman who waited in terror in the bathroom of room 317 while her boyfriend and her mother had a furious argument which resulted in Mrs Mack being beaten to death. Senior Police Commissioner Djoko Hariutomo told MailOnline: ‘If they are both convicted of murder they could face the death penalty. There is evidence here of premeditation.’ Tommy Schaefer, center, sits at the Indonesian prosecutor's office as police handed the murder case to the prosecutor in Bali, Indonesia . Miss Mack has told a different story, explaining that she was horrified when her boyfriend struck her mother and ran from the bedroom . They are said to have argued when Schaefer entered Mrs Mack’s room, his anger exploding when she referred to her daughter as expecting the child of a ‘n*****’ But Miss Mack has told a different story, explaining that she was horrified when her boyfriend struck her mother and ran from the bedroom. ‘Mr Schaefer had arrived at the hotel from the US at two o’clock in the morning of August 12 - just six hours before the murder - and Mrs Mack did not know he was coming,’ said Mr Raja. ‘In order to appease her mother, Heather suggested he go to her room and take with him a gift.’ That ‘gift’, police say, was a heavy fruit bowl from his room and, they insist, Schaefer did not intend to give it to her as a present because he was hiding it under his shirt, planning to use it to kill Mrs Mack following a fierce argument shortly after he arrived at the hotel. The argument is said to have continued when Schaefer entered Mrs Mack’s room, his anger exploding when she referred to her daughter as expecting the child of a ‘n*****’. He is said to have angrily told Mrs Mack that her late husband was a ‘n*****’ and she is alleged to have replied: ‘Yes, but he was a rich one.’ A police spokesman said today that Miss Mack will continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant . Chicago socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62, was found dead inside a suitcase that was loaded into a taxi outside a luxury hotel on the Indonesian island . It is understood that Miss Mack has told police that her mother had reached out and grabbed Schaefer around the throat - and it was at that moment that he struck her on the head with the fruit bowl - before continuing to batter her with it as her daughter hid in the bathroom. As part of Miss Mack’s defence, her lawyer will argue that she had Mrs Mack’s blood on her shirt because she hugged her mother’s body. ‘Heather acted robot-like,’ said Mr Raja. ‘She wanted no part of what had happened but Mr Schaefer was the father of her child and she went along as if in a trance when he forced Mrs Mack’s body into the suitcase.’ Police have revealed that because the suitcase would not close properly with the body inside, the couple tied a sheet around it to keep the lid down - then placed it under their suitcases on a luggage trolley before accompanying a bellboy with it to a waiting taxi. The couple then left the hotel but found they could not leave the country as their passports were in the hotel's safety deposit box, which only Mrs Mack had permission to open. After checking into another hotel, the pair were arrested. . A police spokesman said that  Miss Mack will continue to be under medical observation while in Kerobokan Prison because she is pregnant.

"Olympic events will be able to be staged in more than one city or even in different countries in the future after new rules were agreed by IOC members. The 127th IOC session meeting in Monaco on Monday passed recommendations on bidding for Games despite concerns being expressed that the changes could damage the atmosphere of the Olympics. The new rules will also make it less costly for cities to bid to host Games, with the IOC picking up the bill for some of the costs. Swiss President Didier Burkhalter delivers an opening speech during the 127th IOC session in Monaco . Despite the passing of certain recommendations on Games bids, some IOC members expressed concerns . The rules were passed unanimously but there were some concerns expressed by IOC members about holding Olympic Games in different cities or countries. Prince Imran Tunku from Malaysia raised the prospect of two cities bidding to be joint hosts of the Winter Olympics with ice-based events held in one city and snow-based events in another.

"New Delhi has banned the ride-sharing service Uber from the city after a woman was allegedly raped by one of its drivers. Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, is expected to be charged today with raping the finance company employee on Friday night. He was hired to ferry her home from a dinner engagement. Police said they were considering legal action against Uber for failing to run background checks after it emerged the suspect was arrested for raping a woman three years ago but was later acquitted. Scroll down for video . Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, is expected to be charged today with raping the finance company employee on Friday night. He was hired to ferry her home from a dinner engagement . Uber said there were no defined rules in India on background checks for commercial transport licences and it was working with the government to address the issue. 'What happened over the weekend in New Delhi is horrific,' Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive officer, said in a statement. 'We will do everything, I repeat, everything to help bring this perpetrator to justice.' Police said the driver dropped the woman home after attacking her and warned her not to inform the authorities. She managed to note the driver's number and take a photograph of his car. 'Every violation by Uber will be evaluated and we will go for legal recourse,' said Madhur Verma, deputy commissioner with the Delhi police. Indian police escort Uber taxi driver and accused rapist Shiv Kumar Yadav  following his court appearance . Uber said there were no defined rules in India on background checks for commercial transport licences and it was working with the government to address the issue . Police accuse Uber of failing to check whether the driver had a clean police record or had a satellite location device in his car. The sexual assault happened two years after the fatal gang rape of another young woman taking public transport in New Delhi. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said the company will do 'everything to help bring this perpetrator to justice' That case led to nationwide protests and forced the government to address demands for heavier sentences for rape. Even after the enactment of new laws imposing stricter penalties and establishing fast-track courts, India is struggling to tame attitudes that leave women vulnerable to harassment and rape. In a chilling reminder of the 2012 bus attack, the 26-year-old victim of Friday night's assault told police the driver threatened to insert a rod in her genitals, Indian media reported. India is the fourth most dangerous place for a woman to take public transport, according to a poll published in October by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. It was ranked second-worst on safety at night and for verbal harassment. On an average, 40 cases of crimes against women are registered daily by Delhi Police. This includes at least four cases of rape every day, the Minister of State for Home Affairs Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary told parliament last week. Monica Kumar, a clinical psychologist, who heads the Delhi-based Manas Foundation, said many taxi drivers are often migrants from less-developed areas where patriarchal attitudes remain prevalent and were not accustomed to seeing women out alone late at night or dressed differently. 'No one talks to them, no one engages with them,' said Ms Kumar, which runs gender-sensitization classes for rickshaw drivers. Supporters of Aam Aadmi  Party (AAP) hold placards and shout slogans behind a police barricade during a protest against the rape of a female taxi passenger in New Delhi . 'The conversations about the changing scenario in cities like Delhi where women are becoming more empowered are just not happening.' The criticism of Uber comes at a time when the company has faced critical news coverage over its driver screening in the United States, and has apologized for comments by an executive who suggested 'digging up dirt' on journalists investigating the firm. That has not stopped the San Francisco-based firm from raising investment that values it at $40 billion, reflecting the perceived potential of its expansion into high-growth markets like India.

Manufactured in China, the X7 is, to all intents and purposes, a carbon copy of the Range Rover Evoque — but, at £14,000, is £26,000 cheaper. Unsurprisingly, the chief executive officer of Jaguar Land Rover is livid that one of his flagship vehicles has been ripped-off so flagrantly. ‘The fact that this kind of copying is ongoing in China is very disappointing,’ thundered Dr Ralf Speth to Autocar magazine. ‘The simple principle is that it is not something that should happen — the Intellectual Property is owned by Jaguar Land Rover.’ However, as Dr Speth well knows, his Range Rover, which is promoted by no less than Victoria Beckham, is not the first British vehicle to be copied by the Chinese — and it will certainly not be the last. Over the past few years, Chinese motor manufacturers have been producing scores of ‘fake’ British cars — from phoney Rolls-Royce Phantoms to copies of Mini Coopers. And it’s not just our cars the Chinese are ripping off. For if you name any British luxury brand, you can bet your bottom yuan that somewhere in China will be a factory producing cheap and shoddy copies. A touch of class: The Rolls Royce Phantom in silver, manufactured and sold in Britain for £250,000 . Fake: The Geely Ge in China. The vehicle is £220,000 cheaper than the Phantom at just £30,000 . Not only that, but the products are being exported back to the West and sold here online or on dodgy market stalls. Fancy a Mulberry Alexa handbag? You can get one for £20 from China, compared with the real thing at the Mulberry boutique on Bond Street, where prices start at £1,100. A pair of Vivienne Westwood heels? Yours from China for £15. But you’d be lucky to get much change from £120 for the genuine article. And it’s not just these upmarket brands the Chinese are pirating. High Street names such as menswear chain Hackett are also being ripped off on Chinese sewing machines. And if you’re a smoker, then there’s a good chance your packet of Superkings started life behind the Great Wall and not in Blighty. Why are the Chinese doing it, and how are they getting away with it? The reason why they are making clones is simple — they are cheap, and therefore affordable on the domestic market. Many Chinese consumers want desirable Western and Japanese cars such as those made by Land Rover, Mercedes and Toyota, but their wallets are not big enough. These cars are open imitations and aren’t being passed off as fakes. And they’re only on sale in China. The Chinese motor manufacturers produce these rip-offs quite openly, and, surprisingly, they do so within Chinese law. The problem lies in the thorny issue of patent protection. In the West, inventors and designers have been protected by patents for hundreds of years, and we all understand that we cannot just copy a product and then sell it. But in China, still emerging from some of the shackles of Communism, the notion of intellectual property — which includes copyright and patent — is still a relative novelty. ‘This is a massive, deeply ingrained problem,’ says Chris Neumeyer, the managing partner of Taiwan-based firm Asia Law, which assists companies with intellectual property issues all over the Far East. Bags of cash: A genuine Mulberry Alexa handbag (left), £4,000, and a copy sold for £20 abroad (right) ‘For example, When I first came to Taiwan, 15 years ago, university professors would simply sell to students photocopies they’d made of Western textbooks.’ Mr Neumeyer says that one of the problems is that Chinese patents are surprisingly easy to obtain. ‘When you register a design patent in, say, the U.S. or the UK, you have to show that your design is novel,’ he says. ‘The patent examiner then gives your application a thorough examination. But in China, they don’t do that. All they do is to check that you’ve filled in the forms correctly.’ So, Chinese motor manufacturers can register the designs in China of forthcoming Western cars as if they were their own. And, to make matters worse — and this is where things get silly — the Chinese firms are then able to sue Western manufacturers when their original cars appear on the market in China. The obvious question is this: if registering patents in China is so easy, why then don’t foreign manufacturers do so? This is where things get more absurd still. Many manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover do register their designs with the Chinese patent office, but it makes little difference. Under Chinese law, it is almost impossible for a Western firm to prove to a Chinese court a Chinese manufacturer has infringed a patent. ‘There’s definitely a ‘home court advantage’,’ says Mr Neumeyer. On paper, the rules are supposed to be similar to those in Britain. If, to the eye of an ordinary consumer, the products look the same, then there is an infringement. But in China, according to one anonymous in-house lawyer for a major Chinese car firm: ‘We believe that it is difficult to win a patent infringement case for an overall appearance of a car.’ When it comes to actual counterfeit items such as handbags and dresses, the key difference is that they, unlike the cars, are smuggled back to Britain, and illegally peddled in market squares of many British towns or on online auction sites. Reputable firms such as eBay do their best to enforce a strict ban on fake goods and many purchasers on that site are covered by the firm’s Money Back Guarantee if they find they have bought a knock-off. But some items slip through the net. Real, a £95 Hackett polo shirt (left) and the fake version sold in China for as little as £3 . The other problem is that there is a huge demand in Britain for fakes. Many of us cannot afford to pay top whack for luxury brands, and it is very tempting to spend a few pounds rather than a small fortune on a designer British brand that will turn heads on a Saturday night. And besides, who is really going to notice the difference? If you can’t find what you want in the market or from a bloke in the pub, there is always the internet. Google what you want, and plenty of websites will brazenly offer a counterfeit version for a fraction of the price. On one website it was possible to pick up a ‘Burberry cashmere wool coat’ for £60 plus £30 shipping. Although the coat is last season, the equivalent today would cost £2,500. Fancy an elegant Stella McCartney grey handbag? Why spend around £600, when you can buy the fake for £120? The website even states that 100 such bags are available. The site also offers a staggering 1,000 Stella McCartney coffee-coloured shoulder bags from the 2013 collection for sale for £150 each, whereas the actual price is around £700. Another great British brand that is widely being ripped off by the Chinese is Alexander McQueen. One of the fashion house’s signature items is its skull scarf, which would normally be £245, and has been worn by supermodel Kate Moss and actress Sienna Miller. If you want the same look for less, then you can pick one up from China for £3. Shipping is £15, so you will have to pay just under £20 in total. High Street brands are also faked. Particularly popular are shirts supposedly made by Hackett, which also sell for as little as £3, whereas the genuine article costs £95. Of course, a fake shirt or handbag is not going to cause you any harm. But some counterfeit Chinese products can put your health at risk. Real, left, a pair of £400 yellow and black patent shoes by British designer Vivienne Westwood. Right, in an imitation box, the Chinese version sold for £18 . Smoking, already bad for you, is made even worse if you try a Chinese counterfeit cigarette. The UK is awash with cheap, illegally imported tobacco, of poor quality. In 2011, Customs officers seized 12 million fake Chinese Superkings and Regal cigarettes from a warehouse in Gateshead. That doubtless represents the tip of a very large pile of ash. Similarly injurious are bottles of ‘Scotch whisky’ that are produced in China and often end up over here. Such drinks can contain methanol — a toxic alcoholic liquid — which in some cases can cause blindness. Last year, a wholesaler from western China was jailed and fined £50,000 for selling fake Scotch, a rare display of the Chinese acting against the fakers in their midst. The sad truth is that the Chinese do not do enough to stop copycat cars or the counterfeits. And there’s nothing that the likes of Mulberry and Hackett can do to stop sweatshops in China faking their designs. It is therefore understandable that some companies consider accepting that being copied is a sincere form of flattery. The logic for this is that if you’re being copied, it can only drive up the demand for the real thing. But it still seems wrong that the Chinese should profit from the value of great British brands. If China wants to be a global power, then it needs to play by the world’s rules — and not just rip off the creations of our most talented designers and engineers.","British brands such as Jaguar Range Rover and Mulberry are copied .

"A powerful new drug slashes 'bad' cholesterol levels to those seen in a newborn baby, a study has found. Alirocumab has been hailed as one of the most important drugs to tackle bad cholesterol since statins were introduced. It could drastically reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, researchers claim. Researchers say the drug works 'a bit like Pac Man', as it gobbles up a protein which prevents the liver from using up bad cholesterol. The new drug, called Alirocumab, slashes 'bad' cholesterol levels to those seen in a newborn baby. The 'powerful' drug could drastically reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, researchers claim . It can be used in people who are taking statins but need an extra 'boost' or as an alternative to statins in those who cannot tolerate them. A study found it all but eliminated dangerous blood fats called lipoprotein (LDL) – known as 'bad' cholesterol – in almost a third of people already taking statins. In people unable to tolerate statins, Alirocumab halved bad cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of these killer diseases. Statins don't work for some people, and others experience a host of common side effects including feeling sick, constipation and diarrhoea, muscle and joint pain, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The global study of nearly 2,400 people showed more than a third of people given Alirocumab saw their level of fats fall to those seen in a baby. 'Alirocumab, when used alongside a statin, will dramatically lower cholesterol,' lead researcher Professor Kausik Ray, of St George's Hospital, London, told MailOnline. 'Around 40 per cent of people who took it saw their levels reduce to that of a newborn.' He called the drug 'powerful' and said is likely to reduce the risk of heart disease - but added the risk is not going to be totally abolished. 'If you take the best dose of statin, you get a 50 per cent lowering of bad cholesterol. With Alirocumab, you get a 50 - 60 per cent reduction. 'In combination, you could see a 75 per cent reduction in bad cholesterol levels. Other drugs that we've got only give a 20 per cent reduction. 'That's why it's so powerful. You get more bang for your buck.' He described the drug as working 'a bit like Pac Man' as it gobbles up a protein called PCSK9, which prevents the liver from using up bad cholesterol. Statins are a group of medicines that can help lower the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad cholesterol', and statins stop it being produced inside the liver. This prevents the arteries becoming clogged with fatty deposits, which could lead to heart attacks and stroke in the long run. In July, NICE urged GPs to offer statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease within a decade. The advice means 17.5 million adults, including most men aged over 60 and women over 65, are now eligible to take the tablets, which cost less than 10p a day. But leading GPs, cardiologists and academics are concerned that not enough is known about side effects which include memory problems, dizziness, type 2 diabetes and muscular pain. They point out that very little research has been carried out into these risks and how many patients are affected. It has also emerged that six of the 12 experts drawing up the guidelines have financial ties to drugs firms who make statins or similar pills. Doctors already warn that other side effects also include inflammation of the liver, sore throat, constipation and diarrhoea, nosebleeds and tingling in the hands and feet. A total of 2,338 patients who were at risk of high cholesterol or of suffering a heart attack or stroke took part in the study. Of these 1, 550 were given Alirocumab and a statin, and 788 were given a placebo. More than a third of the people given Alirocumab saw their bad cholesterol levels fall to less than 0.7mmol per litre of blood within a year. This is the same level as a baby, Professor Ray said. 'It is the biggest reduction we've had since statins were introduced,' he said. In the UK, doctors say bad cholesterol levels should be 3mmol per litre of blood or lower for healthy adults. People at risk of heart disease or high blood pressure should aim for a cholesterol of 2mmol per litre of blood or lower. The drug comes as an injection, which patients administer every two weeks. Professor Ray said they had not discovered any side effects so far, but will keep studying the effects of the drug on larger groups of people. Currently, he is carrying out a study which will test how much the drug reduces heart attacks and strokes. The news follows an ongoing debate over controversial guidelines advising statins should be prescribed to millions more people, which has divided the medical and scientific community. In July this year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the NHS watchdog, issued guidance that statins should in future be prescribed more widely - in fact, to almost half of all adults. NICE advised 17.5 million adults, including most men aged over 60 and women over 65, are now eligible to take statins, which cost less than 10p a day. But doctors argue that it is not appropriate to mass-medicalise the public. Some believe the side-effects of statins have been massively underestimated. This, they claim, is due to an over‑reliance on research funded by the pharmaceutical industry, for whom statins have proved to be the single most profitable class of drug ever manufactured. They argue that side effects such as depression, cataracts, an increased risk of diabetes and muscle pains could affect anywhere between 10 and 40 per cent of statin users. Alirocumab all but eliminated bad cholesterol in almost a third of people already taking statins (pictured) to lower their cholesterol. It halved levels in people who weren't already taking statins. Some people can't take statins due to side effects including muscle pain and increased risk of type 2 diabetes .","Alirocumab has been hailed as the most important drug since statins .

"Viking invasions evoke images of burly, bearded men with  flaming torches who are intent on sex and violence. But the conquests to foreign lands may been more like romantic getaways now that DNA has revealed that Viking's brought their women on voyages. A study has shed light on the importance of women in the colonisation of the British Isles in the Middle Ages, suggesting that Viking men were family-orientated and not as blood-thirsty as previously thought. A new study shows the importance of women in the colonisation of the British Isles in the Middle Ages, suggesting that Viking men were family-orientated and not as blood-thirsty as previously thought. This illustration shows viking men and women embarking a ship in Newfoundland with livestock . Researchers from the University of Oslo have revealed that ‘significant’ numbers of women accompanied Viking men when they sailed to places like the Scottish mainland in longboats. Their study contradicts the popular notion that raiding parties only comprised men, who were intent on raping and pillaging new territories, The Independent reported. In fact, experts think whole families may have travelled on the iconic boats to form instant communities on newly-conquered lands. They analysed DNA extracted from 45 Viking skeletons discovered in Norway, to discoverer that women played an integral part in establishing settlements in Britain, for example. Professor Eriks Hagelberg, of the university, said the inclusion of women on the trips meant that Vikings could have children and spread more quickly across the northern seas, establishing communities. Viking expeditions, illustrated by blue line, were carried out across an immense breadth. They set foot through most of Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Northern Africa, Asia Minor, the Arctic and North America . Researchers  revealed that  women and children accompanied Viking men when they sailed to places like the Scottish mainland in longboats, questioning traditional views of bloodthirsty warriors burning local villages. A reconstruction from the Up Helly Aa Festival in Lerwick, the Shetland Islands, is shown . ‘It seems to support the view that a significant number of women were involved in the settlement of the smaller isles, which overrules the idea that it just involved raping and pillaging by males going on the rampage,’ he said. The expert conceded that it is true that Vikings did have sex with local women, but the DNA evidence studied indicates that Norse women were at the heart of new communities set up in the Viking colonies. She told LiveScience that Viking women established settlements and grew crops, and ‘trade was very, very important'. The study contradicts one of the theories as to why the Viking launched raids: that there were not enough women at home, she added. Vikings who settled in Iceland spent most of their time producing and consuming alcohol and beef, according to a study by Baylor University in Waco, Texas. Experts say they did this in part to achieve political ambitions in an environment very different from their Scandinavian homeland. Davide Zori, an assistant professor at the university, said that the seafaring warriors wanted to sustain a lifestyle where chieftains hosted huge feasts of beer and beef served in great halls. Vikings who settled in Iceland spent most of their time producing and consuming alcohol and beef, according to a study by Baylor University in Waco, Texas. They analysed buildings and human bones found at the site of a Viking farmstead . The Viking chieftains used wealth and cultural displays to flex political muscle with their rivals and to cement good relations with local labourers and supporters. His team excavated a farmstead called Hrísbrú in Iceland’s Mosfell Valley, including a chieftain’s longhouse nearly 100 feet long with a ‘feast-worthy’ great hall, a church and a cemetery of 26 graves. Carbon dating and studies of volcanic eruption layers indicated that the longhouse was built in the late ninth or early 10th century and abandoned by the 11th. The team uncovered 38 layers of floor ash, including rubbish from the abandoned house, and discovered samples of bones, barley seeds and imported beads. When the Vikings arrived in uninhabited Iceland, they found forested lowlands, ample pasture land and sheltered sea inlets. The team excavated a farmstead called Hrísbrú in Iceland’s Mosfell Valley (mapped), including a chieftain’s longhouse nearly 100 feet long with a ‘feast-worthy’ great hall, a church and a cemetery of 26 graves . The team uncovered 38 layers of floor ash, including rubbish from the abandoned house, and discovered samples of bones, barley seeds and imported beads (pictured) Excavations show that choice cattle were selected for feasts, with ritual slaughter and the display of skulls common, according to the study, which was published in the journal of Antiquity. And by examining barley seeds, the experts believe Vikings may have used them to produce alcohol, as well as for bread or porridge. Over the centuries, as temperatures in the North Atlantic dropped during the ‘Little Ice Age,’ being a lavish host got tougher, Professor Zori explained. Cattle had to be kept indoors in large barns during the winter so ‘they [the Vikings] had to decide how many to slaughter and store,’ he said. ‘They didn’t have salt, so they had to use big vats of curdled milk as a preservative’ As the landscape changed due to erosion, climate shifts and cleared forests, it became harder to rear larger numbers of cattle. High-status households also struggled to grow enough grain for beer-making and local consumption, based on historical accounts, which have now been confirmed by archaeological data. ‘It got harder and harder to keep up that showiness – and when that collapsed, you didn’t have that power, that beer and big slabs of beef to show off,’ he said, explaining that the power of chieftains diminished. Over time, sheep farming replaced the raising of cattle. Professor Zori argues that Viking chieftains’ drive to produce expensive beef and beer caused them to put their political aspirations above the greater good of the community. ‘Maybe we don’t need the Vikings to prove this, but it shows you that politics can become more important than creating a productive society.’ The research, which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, compared the 1,000-year-old mitochondrial DNA of Viking skeletons to that of modern-day people living in Norway, Iceland, Britain and other places in north west Europe. From this biological data, the experts built up a picture of how the maternal Norse lineage spread throughout areas that were colonised. Experts think whole families may have travelled on the iconic boats (illustrated) to form ‘instant’ communities on newly-conquered lands . The scientists extracted teeth and shaved off small wedges of bones from 45 Norse skeletons dating to between 796AD and 1066AD. They were discovered at various locations across Norway and are on display in the Schreiner Collection at the University of Oslo, LiveScience reported. The experts examined mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria were houses in the cytoplasm of a woman's egg and are passed down from a woman to her children, revealing the maternal lineage. They compared the genetic material with mitochondrial DNA from 5,191 people from across Europe. The Norse material closely matched the maternal DNA of modern North Atlantic people living in the UK and Sweden, but was most closely related to people living from Orkney and the Shetland Isles. Jan Bill, a visiting professor at the University of Oslo, said that Viking women, as well as men, played an important role in setting up communities outside their native lands in Norway, Denmark and Sweden. He said that the male warriors didn’t collect female slaves on the way from Ireland, as previously suggested. A study in 2001 suggested that Viking men travelled alone before picking up Gaelic women on their way to Iceland. He added: ‘We know they transported cattle, sheep and other livestock, so why not take the kids as well? ‘I think we’re looking at family groups rather than just adult men and women.’ He told LiveScience: ‘When raiding activities started to become a more permanent thing, then at some point you may actually see families are traveling along and staying in the camps.' The researchers hope to compare Norse DNA to ancient DNA from Britain, Scotland and beyond to better understand how these people were related.","DNA evidence suggests women accompanied men on raiding trips .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League, Football League and FA Cup fixtures. 1. Arsenal’s performance at Stoke was so bad that they ended up trying to play The Potters at what used to be their own game of lumping long balls. Aaron Ramsey dropped deeper and deeper trying to aim for Danny Welbeck and Olivier Giroud, attempting eight long passes in the second half – more than any other Arsenal outfield player. The Gunners also attempted more crosses than Stoke – 27 against the home side's 23. Arsenal players look dejected after conceding a third goal against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday . 2. If banging in crosses is part of a new Arsenal philosophy they will be grateful to West Ham for the way Carl Jenkinson has been converted into an attacking full back during his loan at Upton Park. The 22-year-old, who earned one England cap as a sub in a friendly against Sweden in 2012, fired in 10 crosses, including the one from which Andy Carroll scored the first of his two goals in the 3-1 win over Swansea. He’s attempted 57 crosses in 12 games as a Hammer this season, an average of 4.75 per match. In his 14 Premier League appearances for the Gunners last year his average was 2.4. West Ham's Carl Jenkinson controls the ball against Swansea at Upton Park . 3. Aston Villa have stumbled on a central defensive pairing to take them forward if they can’t keep Ron Vlaar away from the clutches of Manchester United in January. In four games since Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore were flung together to solve an injury crisis, Villa have now conceded just three times. Against Leicester they made 27 clearances between them, with Denmark centre half Okore winning 100 per cent of his tackles. Aston Villa's Ciaran Clark (left) celebrates with Jores Okore after scoring the equaliser against Leicester . 4. Steven Taylor will be suspended from Newcastle’s trip to Arsenal next weekend but should be the first name on Alan Pardew’s teamsheet when Sunderland arrive at St James’ Park for the North East derby on December 21. The 28-year-old Geordie has started only six games this season after falling out of favour with Pardew – but ending Chelsea’s unbeaten record means the Toon have won every single one of them. Steven Taylor (left) is sent off by referee Martin Atkinson (centre) at St James' Park on Saturday . 5. Aaron Lennon might be keen to point out a similar statistic to Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino after being dumped back on the bench until the final seven minutes against Palace. The winger doesn’t appear to fit his manager’s system – but when he does play Tottenham get results. The 3-0 defeat at Chelsea, when he was hauled off after 58 minutes, was the first time he had been on the losing side of a game he started all season. Tottenham’s record in his other seven starts reads won six, drawn one. Tottenham Hotspur's Aaron Lennon comes on for the final seven minutes against Crystal Palace . 6. Roberto Martinez claimed Eliaquim Mangala should have got a red card for catching Samuel Eto’o with a kung-fu style kick. Whatever the rights and wrongs of referee Andre Marriner’s decision there’s no doubt that Mangala has still got problems finding the correct composure to bring his physical style of play in tune with the Premier League. The £32m France defender has now picked up four yellow cards and one red in his nine domestic games since signing for City from Porto in the summer. Eliaqium Mangala (centre left) challenges Samuel Eto'o (centre) for the ball in the air at the Etihad on Saturday . 7. QPR centre half Richard Dunne might not be the quickest but he makes up for it with speed of thought and determination to defend. In the victory over Burnley he made 20 clearances – more than anyone else – and won 100 per cent of his tackles. Since the 35-year-old got back into the team Rangers have won 10 points from eight games. QPR centre half Richard Dunne makes a clearance during the match against Burnley on Saturday . 8. Derby’s promotion efforts are benefiting from a bit of father-and-son work between boss Steve McClaren and his son Joe. McClaren Jnr is in charge of Under 21 recruitment at Pride Park, and was the man responsible for targeting Real Madrid youngster Omar Mascarell to sign on a season-long loan. The Tenerife-born defensive midfielder has taken time to settle in England, but was excellent in the 3-0 win over Brighton that kept the Rams at the top of the Championship. Joe had been tracking the progress of 21-year-old Mascarell since he spotted him while working in analysis for his dad’s old club Twente. Derby County manager Steve McClaren (right) shakes hands with Brighton manager Sami Hyypia . 9. Wolves chairman Steve Morgan once fell out with his manager of the time Mick McCarthy by going into the dressing room to give his players a rollicking after a 3-0 home defeat by Liverpool. The 62-year-old house building multi-millionaire clearly didn’t learn any lessons about letting his passions boil over. He will be in hot water with the FA after confronting referee Mike Jones on the pitch at the end of his club’s 2-1 defeat by Bournemouth. Jones, demoted from the Premier League list for booking Sergio Aguero instead of giving him a penalty, had sent off Wolves stars Rajiv van La Parra and Matt Doherty. Wolves chairman Steve Morgan (right) confronts referee Mike Jones after the final whistle on Saturday . 10. One of the sores that never healed between MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon was over which club was entitled to wallow in the FA Cup history of the Crazy Gang’s 1988 triumph over Liverpool. Fitting, then, that in the week that the controversial documentary remembering that epic achievement had its premiere the club the fans launched after seeing their own hijacked should manage its own Cup milestone. A 1-0 win at Wycombe thanks to Sean Rigg’s goal put AFC into the third round for the first time since the club was formed 12 years ago. Meanwhile, the MK version went out losing 1-0 at home to Chesterfield.

"Steaua Bucharest were simply referred to as 'hosts' during Sunday's Romanian league clash against CSMS Iasi after losing a legal battle  over their trademark. Deprived of their name, colours and badge on a surreal night of football, the Romanian champions scored in the fifth minute of injury time to beat their opponents 1-0. Romania's most famous club, who were founded in 1947 as an army side, had their registration cancelled by the country's highest court on Wednesday after losing a battle with the ministry of defence. Steaua Bucharest (playing in yellow against Aalborg last month) have been banned from officially using the name after losing legal battle . The club aren't allowed to wear their traditional red and blue colours, ruled Romania's highest court . The club's badge was also covered up . The ministry had first resorted to law in 2011, saying the club had used the Steaua brand illegally since 2004. The court verdict effectively left the most popular and successful club in Romanian football as a team without a name and no identity. The 1986 European champions, playing in yellow instead of their famous red and blue shirts, were presented on Sunday by the stadium's announcer as 'the champions of Romania'. They appeared as 'hosts' on the scoreboard and the club's emblem was replaced by an empty square. Steaua was never mentioned. The name effectively became invisible, removed from all training kits and officials' suits. The teams' two names were missing from the teamsheet, which were presented to reporters before the clash. The club have since reached agreement with the country's defence ministry to be allowed to use the club's name, colours and badge in their Europa League match against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday. Steaua said in a statement that the agreement followed a meeting between Steaua president Valeriu Argaseala and ministry representatives on Monday. The club's flamboyant owner Gigi Becali and general manager Mihai Stoica are currently serving prison terms for abuse of power. On the field, Poland centre back Lukasz Szukala scored the winning goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time with both teams reduced to 10 men after CSMS Iasi's Branko Grahovac and Steaua's Andrei Prepelita were sent off in the closing stages. Steaua, who have won their last five league matches without conceding a goal, top the standings with 43 points from 17 matches, followed by CFR Cluj on 33. Steaua were in Chelsea's Champions League group last season and were beaten by Jose Mourinho's side twice (0-4 and 1-0). The season before that the Romanian side came up against the Blues in the quarter-final of the Europa League and beat Chelsea 1-0 in Romania, but were defeated 3-1 at Stamford Bridge. In 2010-11 Steaua were drawn in a Champions League group with Liverpool and managed a draw in Romania but were defeat 4-1 at Anfield. Going back to 2005-06 Steaua were beaten in the semi-final of the UEFA Cup by Middlesbrough before the north-east club lost in the final to Sevilla.","Steaua Bucharest is Romania's biggest and most successful club .

The pair should have collided a year ago for the world title the American still held at that time. Now they contest what many here are talking of as a final eliminator for the enriching privilege of becoming the next fighter to threaten Mayweather’s unbeaten record. De Le Hoya (right) believes Khan (left) can be as good as anyone in the history of welterweight division . De La Hoya is hopeful that a fight between Khan and Floyd Mayweather can be sorted in the future . Khan, who has twice lost world titles of his own, admits: ‘I can’t afford another mistake.’ De La Hoya does not expect him to slip up again. ‘The bigger the fight, the bigger the prize, the more Amir rises to the occasion. Alexander is a very talented, very durable boxer but Amir is in the perfect place to fulfil now.’ Money Mayweather is their target but Khan’s dream of finally clinching that long-promised bonanzat is threatened by a growing sense that Floyd Jnr and Manny Pacquiao will come to terms at last for the richest fight of all time, the one the world wants to see. De La Hoya says; ‘Well, I’m a boxing fan first and foremost and like everyone else in the game I want to see that fight and I believe it should happen. 'But it annoys me that Amir keeps being promised his turn for a major fight and it doesn’t happen.’ Mayweather is scheduled to take to the ring next in May and Pacquiao has thrown down a challenge which boxes his rival for the mythical title of best pound-for-pound fighter into a corner . De La Hoya says; ‘If Floyd doesn’t meet Manny then I believe his only other option is to fight Amir, who in addition to his own Khan army of fans from Britain is recognised in America as very exciting.’ A Battle of Britain bout - involving Khan and Kell Brook (right) - could be on the cards in the New Year . Brook celebrates winning the IBF Welterweight title after beating Shawn Porter in California in August 2014 . There has also been talk of Khan taking on his former sparring partner Pacquiao and De La Hoya says: ‘While Amir’s speed would set huge problems for Mayweather, I think Pacquiao would be slightly the more difficult fight for him. ‘But I’m not saying he couldn’t win. Style-wise Amir is more trouble for Floyd but he is a major threat to any welterweight in the world, both those guys included. ‘I’m pushing for the Mayweather fight because Amir deserves it. And when does go in against Floyd or Manny, don’t be surprised if he wins.’ If Mayweather takes another route, again, one alternative for Khan is a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, who now brings a world title to the table and expects to return to the ring in Aprill after being stabbed in the leg while on holiday. Khan has made it clear that will only happen if he dictates all the terms and conditions. De La Hoya says: ‘Khan-Brook in front of 100,000 people at Wembley Stadium could be a fall-back position. But what I really want for Amir is the super-fight which brings his chance of glory.’ Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports on Saturday night .","Amir Khan faces Devon Alexander at the MGM in Las Vegas on Saturday .

"In seven of 15 Premier League games this season, Arsenal have conceded a goal from the opposition's first shot on target. It is the shocking statistic contributing to Arsene Wenger's unravelling season. Saturday's calamitous 3-2 loss at Stoke was no exception, with Peter Crouch putting the Potters ahead inside one minute. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (third right) talks to his players during a training session on Monday .

Arsenal players look dejected after conceding a third goal against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium . Lukas Podolski posted this picture on Instagram of he and Mertesacker on the flight to Istanbul on Tuesday . The Britannia loss saw the Gunners' tumultuous campaign plunge to new depths, with Wenger's future never been under more scrutiny. Arsenal share the dubious honour of conceding the most first shots on target with QPR, also on seven. Tottenham Crystal Palace and Stoke have seen the first shot against them go in six times, while Southampton pip Chelsea to the least games, conceding one first shot on target to Jose Mourinho's side's two. It is a damning indictment of the way in which Arsenal set up for games, their defensive capabilities and their goalkeeper situation. Injury to Wojciech Szczesny has seen Damian Martinez between the posts for the last three matches. However, Martinez had conceded just one goal before Saturday's capitulation, indicating the vast majority of the shots conceded were on the Pole’s watch. Starting games has been a perennial problem for the Arsenal, who have failed to score in the first half of any of their last six matches. The earliest of the Gunners' last 10 league goals came in the 60th minute - Danny Welbeck's winner at West Brom last month. Stoke-on-Trent train station was the scene for a group of Arsenal fans berating Wenger as the mananger and his side boarded to head back to London. Amid a cacophany of booing, one fan shouted 'get out of my club.' Differences over Wenger's future have caused fractions in Arsenal's support, with one banner hoisted displaying the message 'Arsene, thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye.' Next up for the under-fire manager is a Champions League trip to Galatasaray, with the Gunners bidding to better Borussia Dortmund's result and finish as the leaders of Group D.

"When you have a sore throat, it’s natural to reach for all the painkillers you can get your hands on. But taking ibuprofen could actually impede recovery, a leading doctor warns. Ibuprofen will dampen the body’s natural response to a virus causing a sore throat, Dr Mike Smith, a former GP and co-chair of the Patients Association, argues. He advises taking paracetamol and a local anaesthetic spray instead. Treat a sore throat with paracetamol and an anaesthetic throat spray, but not ibuprofen,  Dr Mike Smith warns. A previous study found ibuprofen could prolong the symptoms of coughs, colds and sore throats . ‘For a sore throat, what you don’t want to do is dampen the body’s natural defence - the immune system,’ Dr Smith told MailOnline. ‘A few sore throats are caused by secondary infection bacteria, but vast majority are caused by viruses. ‘Ibuprofen and aspirin are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs - they dampen the body’s inflammatory response, the defence system. ‘Inflammation is the body fighting the germs. ‘Your throat goes all red from the increasing blood supply – to fight off the virus.’ ‘If you dampen that, you’re sticking corks on your bayonets.’ Paracetamol, which is a painkiller but is not an anti-inflammatory, is a better choice, he said. This is because it kills the pain of a sore throat without affecting the body’s immune system. Dr Smith said: ‘Medically, I’d rather someone dampened the pain, while making sure they drink enough water, staying at home in bed. Paracetamol and ibuprofen are two of the most common painkillers. The two drugs work in different, but complementary ways. Ibuprofen blocks the production of various chemicals in the body. These include prostaglandins, which are produced in response to injury or disease and cause inflammation. Ibuprofen taken as pills or in liquid form numbs the site of pain and reduces inflammation, and is widely used for arthritic pain. It has a relatively low level of side effects, although it can cause stomach bleeding, kidney damage, allergic reactions. It should not be taken by people who are allergic to aspirin. Paracetamol also blocks prostaglandin, but only in the brain and spinal cord. It reduces temperature by acting on the area of the brain responsible for controlling temperature. Side effects are rare but can include a rash or swelling. ‘Then you are giving the body a better chance of destroying the virus . ‘If you drink enough and rest enough, and take paracetamol, you give your body the best chance of overcoming it.’ A local anaesthetic spray also helps with a sore throat and difficulty swallowing, without affecting the body’s immune response, he added. ‘A local anaesthetic spray, doers the same, it just dampens the nasty feeling of a sore throat,’ Dr Smith said. ‘You dampen the pain locally without flooding the whole body. ‘I had a nasty sore throat recently and I bought some Ultra Chloraseptic anaesthetic throat spray and that helped a lot.’ He added that reading the instructions and taking painkillers or sprays as directed is important, and that if in doubt, a patient should visit their GP or see a pharmacist. Dr Smith’s advice echoes the findings of a British study carried out last year. Researchers from the University of Southampton found paracetamol is the best treatment for coughs, colds and sore throats. Treatment with a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen is inadvisable, and ibuprofen may even slow down recovery, they said. Professor Professor Paul Little, of the University of Southampton, who led the study, said treatment with ibuprofen could contribute to the progression of the illness. He said 'This may have something to do with the fact the ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory. 'It is possible that the drug is interfering with an important part of the immune response and leads to prolonged symptoms or the progression of symptoms in some individuals. 'Although we have to be a bit cautious since these were surprise findings, for the moment I would personally not advise most patients to use ibuprofen for symptom control for coughs, colds and sore throats.' Paracetamol is a painkiller but not an anti-inflammatory drug. Dr Mike advises it will kill the pain of a sore cold without dampening the body's natural immune defence .","Dr Mike Smith is a former GP and co-chair of the Patients Association .

"A woman left almost bald by an impulsive disorder compelling her to tear her hair out, was forced to pay for treatment deemed a 'cosmetic' procedure. Cheryl Mitchell faced a 13-year uphill battle with doctors to receive a diagnosis and then treatment. The 33-year-old from Rhyl, North Wales, recognised her own symptoms after reading a magazine article about trichotillomania when she was 20 years old. But despite her insistence that she knew what was wrong, Miss Mitchell has struggled to receive treatment. Part of the treatment involves stitching hair extensions into a mesh barrier on the scalp and as such is deemed 'cosmetic'. Scroll down for video . Cheryl Mitchell, 33, from Rhyl, North Wales, suffers trichtillomania - a compulsion to tear her hair out . For 13 years she faced an uphill battle to receive treatment. She has been forced to pay for a new hair mesh, to act as a barrier and allow her hair to grow underneath, because it is consider a 'cosmetic' procedure . As a result, Miss Mitchell has been forced to pay for the procedure herself. 'I've walked past loads of people already, said hello and they haven't recognised me, I look so different. My head's a bit sore, but it's all right. 'My hair was maybe half an inch long all over with patches. They've put a very thin mesh on my head, and pulled the thin bits of my own hair through. 'Then they sewed human hair through, so everything is kept in place by my own hair.' The mesh barrier is designed to protect her own hair for the next six months, allowing it to grow back. Trichtillomania is recognised by the NHS, and cases have been documented as far back as 1889. The 33-year-old is also receiving cognitive behaviourial therapy on the NHS to help her overcome the condition which left her nearly bald . But it remains a condition commonly misunderstood by GPs. Miss Mitchell said as a result, she faced an uphill struggle for treatment. She diagnosed her own illness when she read about someone else suffering with it in a magazine, 13 years ago. The then 20-year-old visited a clinic in Manchester to find out more about the treatment, but was told it would cost her £9,000. 'I went to the doctor on and off for 13 years trying to get this treatment on the NHS, but they wouldn't give me the time of day,' she said. 'They just offered me wigs. I got one, but that doesn't really help.' Miss Mitchell,  said: 'I've seen loads of doctors, I've been asking them about my hair loss since I was five, and not once has any doctor known of it and offered me counselling or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), I'm doing CBT now after I told them I was getting my hair done. 'I didn't know about all of the treatments I could try until last year. They'd only offered me wigs. 'I don't know if it'll work or not, but it's worth a go.' The new hair system takes the 33-year-old up to two hours each day to look after, and while costs have come down since she first found a treatment, it still cost her £800, but should last up to two years. According to the NHS website, trichotillomania is more common in girls than boys, and may affect up to four in 100 people. Trichtillomania affects up to four in every 100 of the population, and is common in teenagers . Trichtillomania is a condition where sufferers are compelled to tear their hair out. It is common in teenagers and young adults, affects up to four in every 100 people. They can pull hair from their head, as well as other places including their eyebrowns and eyelashes. Trichtillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action. Sufferers experience an intense urge to pull their hair out, and growing tension until they do. Once they've pulled their hair out, they are overcome by a sense of relief. The condition, which leaves sufferers with bald patches, can invoke negative feelings, including guilt. People feel embarrassed and ashamed, and may try to deny it and cover it up. Experts do not know what causes the compulsion, but some believe it is a form of addiction. Others think it is a reflection of a mental health problem, with psychological and behaviourial theories suggesting it is a means of relieving stress and anxiety. In some cases experts believe the condition amounts to self-harm, deliberate injury to achieve temporary relief from emotional distress. Recognised treatments for the condition include psychotherapy, allowing patients to talk about the emotional problems underlying their compulsion. Cognitive behaviourial therapy may be recommended, helping a person manage their problems by changing how they think and act.

"It is officially 'Hammer Time' in the Barclays Premier League, just in time for Big Sam to pull on his baggy pants and perform 'U Can’t Touch This' at the Christmas karaoke. Now, that really would mark a full cycle in West Ham’s wheel of fortune. Twelve months ago, Sam Allardyce was under the cosh. His team were ensconced in the bottom three, his squad was creaking at the seams under a pile-up of injuries and supporters were groaning at the style of football he was delivering. Things would get worse as Allardyce’s beleaguered team lost 5-0 with a weakened team in the FA Cup at Nottingham Forest and were thrashed by six at Manchester City, three days later. West Ham are flying as Andy Carroll celebrates scoring West Ham's second goal against Swansea on Sunday . But the manager dug in, the board declined to sack him, despite many rumours to the contrary, and today West Ham are getting comfy in the Champions League places. Here, MailOnline Sport discovers exactly what has changed for the Hammers over the past year. THE PLAYERS . The most obvious change is that the club have better players available. For one, they do not have the injuries they were suffering from last season. Andy Carroll’s return to fitness is a major boost, as there is no-one quite like him in the Premier League. More importantly, they have bolstered the squad with a distinct upgrade in quality. Alex Song and Carl Jenkinson, both signed on loan, were outstanding in the 3-1 win against Swansea, the third victory on the bounce. On Sunday, against Swansea, there were only three survivors from the team beaten 4-1 at Liverpool on December 7, 2013. Former Barcelona man Alex Song has brought a touch of class to the West Ham midfield . Diafra Sakho came off the bench to fire West Ham into a 3-1 lead at Upton Park on Sunday . MINS PLD    KM       MILES . West Ham United              105.7        65.7 . Kevin Nolan            90        10,8           6.7 . Stewart Downing    90         10.6           6.6 . Cheikho Kouyate    90        10.2           6.3 . Song has stabilised the midfield and added quality on the ball. He seems a better player since returning from Barcelona, more patient in possession, and not so reckless. He linked up well with Jenkinson, marauding forward from right-back. Aaron Cresswell has stepped easily up to the top level and provides balance on the left. Up front both Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have settled immediately, something which always involves a little chance. You need a bit of luck along the way. How much Allardyce knew about Valencia and Sakho is debatable – co-owner David Sullivan always loves to gamble on a striker - but they have proved inspired. Sakho’s goal against Swansea was his eighth in 10 games in all competitions (he's scored seven in the Premier league) and he seems perfect for the English top flight. He works hard and preys on mistakes. He is quick enough so that defenders do not get back with a recovery tackles. And his finishing, thus far, has been clinical. Summer signing Sakho has now scored seven goals in nine Premier League games for the Hammers . The Premier League table in 1999 when the Hammers were third with the likes of Joe Cole, and now (below) Hammers striker Carroll celebrates scoring his first league goal in 878 minutes of football . Stewart Downing (right) is playing some of the best football of his career this season . THE COACHES . Much has been made of Teddy Sheringham’s influence, since he was appointed as a specialist coach to work with the strikers, and it is difficult to argue with the goals. Sahko, Valencia, Carroll, Carlton Cole and Mauro Zarate have all hit the target. John Hartson on BBC Match of the Day was impressed by the subtleties of Carroll’s movement in the penalty box. Sheringham’s great asset was the way he read the game. If he can get any of that across to the five strikers, he will improve them. It was also good to see Carroll sprint to celebrate with the coaching team, and the medics who helped him through the dark days of recovery from injuries. Harmony and togetherness will generate the spirit required to pull teams through when they are not playing so well, or when fortune turns against them. Sam Allardyce has steered West Ham to third in the Premier League after 15 games . Teddy Sheringham was appointed as a specialist coach to work with the West Ham strikers . This goes for the relationship between Allardyce and the boardroom, too. At the moment, all is calm. The signings have paid off and the manager’s decisions are proving successful. They are entitled to feel smug. But there is still an undercurrent at the club that this is not a natural fit, with Allardyce at pains to point out his tactical brilliance at every opportunity while the owners point to the success of their signings and demand for the team to play with greater adventure. 'We recruited a better calibre of player in the summer, who were chosen because they have the ability to play the West Ham way,' wrote David Gold, in his programme notes for the Swansea game. Before the game, Allardyce was on TV talking about the possibility of a contract extension. Perhaps a successful season will soothe this friction. Allardyce embraces Carroll following the striker's second goal of the game against Swansea . Goals scored after 15 matches last season & this season... Chelsea: 30-34 . Man City: 32-32 . West Ham: 13-26 . Liverpool: 34-19 . Man Utd: 22-24 . PLAYING STYLE . The style has certainly changed for the better. Allardyce will insist this is because there are more and better players available. He is also entitled to credit for the shape of the team, and the switch to a midfield diamond which has allowed Stewart Downing to thrive. West Ham appear committed to a core of English players and they are committed to attack, with two strikers and attacking full-backs to provide the width lost to the diamond. There were 36 cross delivered against Swansea, which helped Carroll wreak havoc. They have 26 goals, double the total they had after 15 Premier League games last season. The Hammers have been playing a more fluid style of football this season as the intricate passing and movement that led to Andy Carroll's first goal shows . Allardyce's summer signings such as Sakho and Valencia have hit the ground running . In midfield, besides the controlling influence of Song and Mark Noble (under-rated and overlooked by England despite his ability in the midfield holding role), the energy of Cheikhou Kouyate has been important, although Kevin Nolan covered more ground than anyone. Without this industry and commitment in midfield, it is difficult to get away with two strikers in the modern game. At the back there are questions, which will eat away at Allardyce, a manager who likes to be solid. There will be times when the centre-halves are exposed by their ambitious full-backs, and will have to make decisions with no margin for error. They have conceded only 18, so there is no cause for immediate alarm. Goalkeeper Adrian is not always totally convincing but has done well. The side has good physical presence and is dangerous from set-pieces, as Allardyce teams usually are. Kevin Nolan has been under scrutiny from West Ham fans this season, but covered more ground that any other player against Swansea on Sunday . THE CARROLL QUESTION . Carroll adds something rare in the modern game, a genuine aerial threat, which can trigger panic among modern central defenders. Allardyce was right to lament the lost art. Not only did he score twice against Swansea, but he nodded headers down and created chances and chaos. By the end of the game, centre-halves Kyle Bartley and Ashley Williams looked as if they might concede from every attack. He will be judged on goals but he also creates space for others. He supplied the flick for Sakho’s goal and the pass for Sakho’s run which tempted Lukasz Fabianski into the challenge which earned him a red card. Regardless of the debate about his transfer value, if Carroll is fully fit, he is an enormous threat. No centre-half will want to mark him, especially if West Ham can successfully keep 30-plus crosses flying into his airspace. Can he stay fit? That is the key. Carroll soars at the back post to head Carl Jenkinson's delivery across Lukasz Fabianski and into the net . Carroll waves to the crowd as he celebrates with team-mates Song, Valencia and Nolan . Carroll adds a a genuine aerial threat, which can trigger panic among modern central defenders . THE FANS . Upton Park was deathly quiet at times during the game against Swansea, perhaps it was the nerves which came with the knowledge that a win would propel them to third place for the first time in 15 years. It made you wonder what the atmosphere might be like at the Olympic Stadium. Maybe this is simply the changing face of football crowds: a bit more corporate and a bit more discerning. By the end, they were in full voice, cheering the goals and celebrating the win. Presumably they enjoyed the style of football, although from behind the press box, there were desperate shouts to 'get it back in the box' for Carroll to head. At least for now they are not in open dissent as they were this time last year when the future seemed far less enticing. Carroll applauds the home fans after West Ham's 3-1 win against Garry Monk's Swansea side . THE FUTURE . It looks very bright. Certainly brighter than it did this time last year. But it will depend on how they build on this encouraging first four months of the season. Song and Jenkinson, two stand-out performers, are only on loan. History tells us that Carroll’s fitness is unreliable, as is Downing’s form. But it is better to build from a position of success. With points on the board, it eases a pressure; the team can play with freedom they don’t have when scrapping against the drop. A stronger squad should help Allardyce ride the problems he is sure to face at some point. The West Ham players celebrate a Downing goal against Stoke in November . Qualify for Europe and it will tempt better players and help keep those who might be lured away. The plan was always to make sure West Ham were in the Premier League at the time when they moved to the new stadium. At this rate, they might be setting sights a little higher. P.S… THE KIT . Of course, there’s transfers and tactics and spirit, etc. but what if it’s all down to the kit? West Ham’s shirts have a horizontal pinstripe with an 80s feel, similar to the design in 1985/86 when they finished third, only four points behind champions Liverpool.

"Harry Kane may be handed his first Premier League start of the season on Sunday as Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino looks to add more goals to his team. Spurs have not scored more than once in a league game since a 2-2 draw against Sunderland on September 13 and their profligacy has played a part in a poor run of form. Defeat at home to Newcastle last weekend means Pochettino has seen his side take just four points in the league since the end of August. Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) slides in to score in his side's Capital One Cup win against Brighton . Kane could make his first Premier League start of the season on Sunday against Aston Villa . Kane leads the scoring charts at White Hart Lane but has yet to find the back of the net in the Premier League, having made just five substitute appearances. Pochettino has warned the England Under 21 international that he must be patient as he utilises both Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado but admits he may be tempted to throw Kane into the side at Villa Park. 'Yes, maybe' he said when asked if Kane could be handed his maiden league start of the campaign. 'We are very happy with him. Everyone is very important. But it's not difficult. It's a good thing he is scoring goals. 'Always we manage, share the minutes (between the strikers). We are happy w8ith all our strikers. Adebayor scored against Newcastle, Soldado was very, very good the last game. Harry the same. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino admits that he could give Kane an opportunity from the first whistle . Roberto Soldado has struggled for goals since joining from Valencia for £28million in the summer of 2013 . 'We need to score more, it's true. But we are improving and I hope our strikers score more goals.' A poor run of form leaves Tottenham in the bottom half of the table but former Southampton boss Pochettino believes their all-round play is deserving of more. 'I don't feel the pressure,' he added. 'I'm not happy about the results. We need to improve. I am disappointed but the results don't reflect the performances. (We are not where we deserve but we still believe in our job and our way. We need to get three points on Sunday.' Newcastle's Ayoze Perez (left) scores his side's second goal against Tottenham to condemn Spurs to defeat . Pochettino also confirmed it remains 'impossible' to predict when England full-back Kyle Walker will be fit following a long-standing pelvic injury which has seen him sidelined since March - whilst any move to bring DeAndre Yedlin in during the January transfer window could be hit by a work permit hold up. The 21-year-old, who appeared for the United States at the World Cup, has already agreed a four-year deal at White Hart Lane but remains on loan at Seattle Sounders and could yet stay in Major League Soccer until the summer.","Harry Kane is Tottenham's top scorer in all competitions this season .

"Mauricio Pochettino insisted he would not grant Harry Kane a Premier League start simply because he is a favourite with supporters. The Spurs manager said striker Kane is a 'special player' in the eyes of supporters because he is English and came through the club's academy. But he will be basing his decision on performances rather than sentiment when making his team selection. 'I understand the fans want him to play because he is English,' said Pochettino, 'But my decision is always about my analysis on the training and afterwards to give the balance to the team and our performance.

Kane, who was born in Walthamstow, just a 15 minute drive from White Hart Lane, has proved popular with fans, many of whom believe he should be rewarded for his rich vein of form. Spurs have scored only 11 goals in 11 Premier League games, the worst of any team in the top half of the table. But Pochettino said Kane could learn from the full international players in the team. 'Roberto and Ade have a lot of experience and I think the energy Harry brings to the squad is important – it is good for him to learn from Soldado and Adebyaor.'

"Not satisfied with conquering the football world, Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola has branched out into rugby and has been assisting Japan coach Eddie Jones ahead of next year's World Cup. Jones said he sought out the 'best soccer coach' following last month's defeats by Romania and Georgia as he aims to lead Japan - in England's pool next summer - to a first win at a rugby World Cup since their sole success over Zimbabwe in 1991. 'The main thing we learnt this year was that we have to be tactically more flexible. We need to react to situations on the field and make adjustments to the way we play,' the Australian told Kyodo News on Monday. Pep Guardiola's training methods have won him respect from coaches outside of the football world . Japan rugby coach Eddie Jones (left) has been talking tactics with Bayern Munich manager Guardiola . Guardiola has built a reputation as a coach that enforces a relentless passing style of play from his team . 'The soccer approach is called tactical periodisation, in which everything is done in preparation for the game and in order to be tactically aware.' Jones said the two sports shared many similarities and that Guardiola, who won three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues with Barcelona before leading Bayern to victory in the Bundesliga in his first season, had been a big help. 'I watched Bayern train and had a really good meeting with the head coach and I really think we can improve greatly with adjustments in the way we train. He is the best soccer coach in the world and you always want to learn from the best. 'Rugby and soccer are very similar in that you always want to move the ball into space and Bayern Munich and his previous team Barcelona played the most fantastic passing game you have ever seen. The principles are exactly the same. 'The very best soccer teams vary their depth and formation in order to make the most of the space. So when you get the chance to learn from the best it's a fantastic opportunity.'

He said up to seven of his side could feature in the Southern Hemisphere Super Rugby competition next year, which would boost their fitness, maturity and mental toughness. He also called for greater commitment from his squad and smarter coaching from his team.

"Billionaire James Packer sported a huge black eye as he flew out of Sydney just hours after he met with rival TV boss and David Gyngell following their street brawl over the weekend. Packer was seen smoking a cigarette in the tunnel on the way to Sydney Airport where he boarded a private Lear jet headed for Melbourne. Earlier, the visibly bruised casino mogul made a dash across town to meet up with executives of Gyngell's rival station, the Seven Network. The meeting came after a statement broadcast on the news of Gyngell's Nine Network, saying he had arrived on Packer's Bondi Beach doorstep 'angry'. James Packer was visibly bruised after his public punch-up with David Gyngell outside his Bondi mansion . Unsightly: James Packer was left with a bruised and puffy left eye after his punch-up with TV boss David Gyngell . 'Clearly had he not turned up at Packer’s premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred,' the statement said. '[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation'. Sydney police have confirmed they are now investigating the fight, although neither Packer nor Gyngell has filed a complaint. Following Gyngell's public admission, Packer left his offices in Sydney city and was driven across town to an office owned by Seven Network boss, Kerry Stokes. Wearing sunglasses to hide the bruising visible earlier in the day, Packer entered the building and remained for some time. Last month, Packer visited China in the company of Stokes and Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, on a trade mission. On a jet plane: Mr Packer was seen boarding his private jet for a flight to Melbourne on Tuesday afternoon . Earlier today, James Packer emerged from his Bondi Beach apartment for the first time following his epic punch-up with childhood friend David Gyngell that made world headlines. The 46-year-old arrived at work at his Sydney city office showing a bruised and slightly swollen left eye. Just before 9am, the casino boss left in a chauffeur-drive car from his $20m Sydney home, where a media pack has been camped out since his street brawl with TV boss Gyngell. Packer was driven off in a car after his mother, Ros Packer, was also seen leaving the apartment. Mrs Packer had arrived at her son's home at 7.25am in a white BMW to see him before he reported for work. Packer then arrived at the Sydney headquarters of Bauer magazines, where he has an office and which was the former stronghold of the Packer company, Australian Consolidated Press. He entered the building via the loading dock entry, his 'black eye' clearly visible. Sydney police have issued a statement saying, 'Eastern Suburbs Local Area Command has commenced an investigation into an incident that occurred about 2pm Sunday on Sir Thomas Mitchell Road near the intersection of Campbell Parade at Bondi Beach'. James Packer's mother Ros leaves son James's Bondi apartment after visitng him this morning. Mrs Packer arrived at 7.25am and spent some time with the 46-year-old before he emerged from the Bondi apartment where he had been holed up in for more than 40 hours following his street brawl with Packer family friend, David Gyngell . The police said they had 'not yet received an official complaint but have appealed to any one who witnessed, or has vision or images of the incident, to contact' them. In a bizarre twist, Packer neighbour Chris Walker has reportedly claimed on radio some teeth were found following the fight and one local resident had them in safekeeping. 'We did find some teeth,' he reportedly told FOX FM, 'we are assuming the teeth belong to the fight but nobody knows.' Packer came to blows with Gyngell in the street on Sunday afternoon because he believed a camera crew from the network run by his childhood friend was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr. Gyngell, 47, had gone to the casino owner's $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure him after an exchange of heated text messages. The pair immediately became embroiled in a profanity-laced argument which descended into blows. Explosive pictures showed 46-year-old Packer and a bearded, bare-foot Gyngell pummeling each other repeatedly and wrestling on the ground before being pulled apart by a bodyguard. Reports of the scuffle say Gyngell, the smaller of the two men, appeared to connect with Packer's eye in a left hook. Following the fight, Packer was seen walking off with his left eye puffy and his grey tracksuit pants marked with grass stains. David Gyngell emerged from his home in a nearby suburb at around 6.30am this morning to set off for work at the Nine Network.","James Packer has left Sydney on a private jet and is flying to Melbourne .

"The only female manager in the Women's Super League top flight has revealed she would love to test herself in the men's professional game. Emma Hayes led her Chelsea team to a second-place finish in the WSL in the season just ended, with Liverpool taking the title on goal difference. Emma Hayes guided Chelsea to second place in the Women's Super League . The 38-year-old former boss of the Chicago Red Stars has been home in England for two years with Chelsea, taking her prominent post just as the women's game began to benefit from a rush of support from the Football Association and parent clubs. Londoner Hayes initially seized the chance to work in the United States, the country that was quickest of all on the uptake with women's professional football, because she saw no prospect of earning a living in the English game. That is changing, and with former Arsenal manager Shelley Kerr coaching the men's team at Stirling University, who play in the tier outside the Scottish Professional Football League, even previously bolted doors are opening to women. 'I'd hope so,' Hayes said. 'All coaches aspire to be at the best level they can get to, and I'm no different. 'If it happened for me that the next opportunity was in the men's game, then I'd welcome that. 'But I also think there needs to be more female coaches at the top end of the women's game before more are entering into the men's game.' The UEFA A licence is a prerequisite for WSL managers, and Camden-born Hayes wants those running the women's game to show faith in female candidates who achieve that standard. Liverpool manager Matt Beard (left) and captain Gemma Bonner show off the Women's Super League Trophy . 'As clubs and boards and chairmen diversify, I think we will see more opportunities, but it's up to those who are in charge to place more trust in female leaders,' Hayes said. Hayes addressed Kick It Out's Women's Raise Your Game conference at Upton Park this week, and spoke of the opportunities opening up in football, including coaching, media and sports science. She added: 'I've come home after 10 years in America and am now able to forge a career at a club like Chelsea, to provide opportunities not just for professional players but for staff involved in the game, and that is similar to what's being done at other clubs around the country. 'I think this is a real golden period in women's football.'","Emma Hayes is the only female manager in the Women's Super League .

"Liverpool will look to sell Mario Balotelli but the chances of him leaving in January are small. The Italy forward has failed to deliver on the pitch and Liverpool can ill afford any passengers at the moment having scored just seven league goals at Anfield this season. However, the injury to Daniel Sturridge and the likelihood that Divock Origi will stay at Lille, at this stage, means Balotelli will likely see out the season.

The 26-year-old Republic of Ireland forward has scored seven goals this season, including the winner against Motherwell on Saturday. He has averaged just under a goal every two games during his time at Celtic and that has alerted English league clubs looking for strikers in January. Cardiff City are showing an interest in Celtic striker Anthony Stokes (right, pictured scoring on Saturday) The 26-year-old Republic of Ireland striker has scored seven goals this season for Celtic .

There is a sense he still wants to prove himself south of the border and Cardiff are willing to give him a chance. Celtic may listen to bids around £2m. Everton are following Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda. The Slovakia star caught the eye of Toffees scouts when he starred for Legia in their Champions League demolition of Celtic early in the season. The Polish club were thrown out because they fielded an ineligible player but Duda has continued to impress.

Everton are following Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda with the January transfer window coming up . Duda, who has scored five goals this season, plays as an attacking midfielder and sometimes as a secondary striker but he can also play deeper and has an eye for a pass. Legia only signed him last summer on a free after he allowed his contract to run down at previous club Kosice. The Poles value Duda in the £7m bracket but Everton would be looking to pay around £3.5m if they press ahead. Everton do not wish to sell their players but are wary of increased interest in James McCarthy - on whom Arsenal and Tottenham are keen - and Ross Barkley.

Deeney is a player several Premier League sides are considering but he won't come cheap with Watford holding out for at least the same £11m fee Leeds gained from Fulham for Ross McCormack.

"Officials have confirmed that it will take around one year to repair the damage done to the launch pad caused by the Antares explosion. The rocket blew up six seconds after taking off on 28 October from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island in Virginia . But Orbital Sciences, who manufacture and operate the rocket, say they could be ready to launch another as soon as 2016. Officials have confirmed the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport launchpad in Virginia (shown after the explosion) could be repaired as soon as 2015. The Antares rocket exploded seconds after lift-off on 28 October, but in a statement it was revealed the pad escaped severe damage . The Antares rocket took off as planned from Pad 0A on 28 October at 6:22pm EDT (local time). But just a few seconds into the flight the rocket failed, falling back to Earth in an enormous fiery explosion. Amazingly, however, despite the huge fireball that erupted, the pad appears to have escaped severe damage - meaning normal operations can resume relatively swiftly. The Antares rocket was due to launch an unmanned Orbital-3 Cygnus spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the International Space Station on 28 October. This included science experiments, experiment hardware, spare parts, and crew provisions - as part of a £1.2 billion ($1.9billion) deal with Nasa. Outfitted with a new, more powerful upper-stage engine, the Antares rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds (2,293 kg) of supplies, science experiments and equipment, a 15 percent increase over previous missions. But just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed, leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure. Zig Leszczynski, deputy executive director of the Virginia Commerical Space Flight Authority, which owns and operates launch pads at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, confirmed the extent of the damage in a statement. ‘Major elements of the Pad 0A launch complex infrastructure, including the Launch Pad, Liquid Fuel Facility (LFF) and Water Tower, escaped severe damage during the catastrophic failure of Orbital Science Corporation’s Antares rocket shortly after liftoff,’ he said. Mr Leszczynski added that officials from Nasa, Orbital and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport had begun removing contaminated soil from the launch site and were pumping out water, reported the Daily Press. Last week the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority then revealed it would take just a year to repair the damage. Repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £8.3 million and £12.8 million ($13 million and $20 million). And in a separate release, Orbital confirmed they would launch a new Antares rocket by the end of 2016. Orbital Sciences have said a new version of Antares could launch as soon as 2016. This will be using new engines, which will be tested in a 'hot fire' next year. Just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed, leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure (shown) The explosion partially contaminated the region around the launchpad. But last week the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority revealed it would take just a year to repair the damage. Repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £8.3 million and £12.8 million ($13 million and $20 million) Antares is contracted under Nasa’s Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) programme to carry cargo to the ISS using the Cygnus spacecraft. Cygnus is launched on top of the Antares rocket and had three successful missions under its belt before this catastrophe. But while Antares is being rebuilt, Orbital say they will launch Cygnus on other rockets to fulfill their contract demands with Nasa. What rockets these will be, however, has not yet been revealed. ‘Under the new approach and in line with Orbital’s existing CRS contract, all remaining cargo will be delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) by the end of 2016,’ said the company. ‘There will be no cost increase to Nasa and only minor adjustments will be needed to the cargo manifest in the near term.’ Orbital also confirmed they will seek a new propulsion system upgrade for Antares, as it was believed the Russian engines used on the October launch were the reason for the failure. The company will perform a ‘hot fire’ test of the new engines next year to ensure they work as planned. Cameras recovered from the launch pad in Virginia shed new light on disaster (still image shown).The remotely operated cameras captured the explosion up-close in incredible detail. Last month footage compiled by websites Zero-G News and America Space revealed the explosion in unprecedented detail. Remotely operated cameras recently recovered from the launch pad captured the explosion - and one even revealed footage from inside the resultant cloud of dust and debris. The sites explained that, as their cameras were so close to the launchpad, they had not been hopeful of retrieving much, if any, of the data. And they were also restricted from retrieving their data  after lift-off owing to the obviously hazardous conditions. But incredibly, four cameras from journalists working for the two websites did survive, 'and the footage is nothing short of spectacular', said AmericaSpace. 'The initial lift-off looked flawless. Then, suddenly, the exhaust turned bright yellow and became far brighter than usual,' said Elliot Severn, a launch photojournalist for Zero-G News and StarTalk Radio. 'That's when we knew things were about to get bad. The vehicle seemed to hang in the air and started to burn, it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. 'It fell in a pillar of fire and exploded on impact, and we could feel the heat on our face from 1.5 miles [2.4km] away. Seconds later the shockwave hit, and we all ran for the buses to evacuate. We had little hope of any cameras surviving.' The Nasa-funded rocket exploded on its way to the ISS (shown) just six seconds after lift-off from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island in Virginia .The rocket exploded at 6:22pm EDT on 28 October, and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine . Organisations said more than £125 million ($200 million) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion (previous image shown). Orbital Sciences said it would stop using the type of Russian engines that were employed when its unmanned Antares commercial supply rocket exploded . They explained how in the first aerial surveys of the launch pad they could see their cameras, but they had to wait several weeks to get everything back from the Accident Investigation Board. One of the cameras was even located very close to the middle of the pad and right in the middle of the explosion. As dust and debris flies around, the camera somehow manages to survive. The rocket was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine and also a number of Earth-observation satellites.

"It was one hell of a strike to announce yourself to the Barclays Premier League - but perhaps we should expect nothing less from someone who goes by the nickname 'Superman'. Enner Valencia's 70mph missile for West Ham in their 2-2 draw with Hull City on Monday night left the KC Stadium and the millions watching on TV open-jawed in amazement. As well as being an early contender for the goal of the season award, it offered hope to the Hammers faithful that this season might be more than another miserable relegation struggle. But who is the man with rockets in his boots? Here's a look at Valencia's career so far, from Ecuador to the East End. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Disappointed but a good result . Enner Valencia fires home his 70mph rocket during West Ham's draw at Hull on Monday evening . West Ham's new £12m forward celebrates with Mauro Zarate (left) and Stewart Downing after finding the net . Enner Valencia is certainly a name to remember if he continues to produce sensational goals like that . VIDEO Disappointed but a good result . EARLY YEARS . Enner Remberto Valencia Lastra was born in San Lorenzo, an Ecuadorian port town located 12 miles south of the Colombian border and about four hours' drive north from the capital Quito, on November 4, 1989. His childhood was spent kicking a ball around and at the age of 16, he left home to join the youth ranks at Caribe Junior, the same club that nurtured the talents of his namesake Antonio Valencia (no relation). He was originally a winger but gradually converted into a striker when it became apparent that he packed a fearsome shot. After three years there, Enner was spotted by Emelec, one of the country's most prominent teams based in the city of Guayaquil. Enner Valencia celebrates after scoring the first of his two goals in the 2-1 World Cup win over Honduras . In an interview back in his homeland, Enner's father said his son was so passionate about football he would get all his chores out the way and even skip dinner to make sure he could spend the rest of his day kicking a ball around. Segun Remberto Valencia said: 'He did all his chores when he came home from school - milk cows, pack and load products and clear water from the canoe - and then would not eat to go and play soccer.' Valencia hails from Afro-Ecuadorian stock and from a very poor area of the country. When he arrived in Guayaquil, he had no money for lodgings and had to sleep at the club's George Capwell Stadium. It took a little time for the forward to break into the first team but under Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli, the man who led Chile at the World Cup this summer, he started getting opportunities. His first goal for Emelec came on March 10, 2010 away to their rivals LDU Quito, helping secure a vital win. The goals had begun to flow. A RELIABLE GOALSCORER . Valencia quickly became a fixture in the Emelec side and contributed nine league goals in 30 outings during the 2011 campaign. Unfortunately, his efforts were in vain as the team lost 1-0 to Deportivo Quito over the two legs of the Championship final, the second year in succession they had missed out at this point. Valencia showing his trademark pace as he nips between France's Mamadou Sakho and Laurent Koscielny . Incredibly the following year it happened again and in heart-breaking circumstances as city rivals Barcelona trumped them. But while the team missed out, it was Enner's most successful season yet, with 13 goals in 40 league appearances. His scoring feats didn't escape the notice of national team manager Reinaldo Rueda and Enner made his debut on February 12, 2012 in a friendly with Honduras. SUCCESS AT LAST . It was fourth time lucky for Enner and Emelec in 2013. The forward scored a number of crucial goals as the club ended its 11-year wait for the title. He was also the top scorer in the Copa Sudamericana, the South American equivalent of the Europa League, with five goals in four matches. Emelec didn't advance beyond the second round, however. But it was enough to attract the attention of Mexican side Pachuca and a deal was agreed in January this year. Valencia celebrates his towering header in the 2-2 draw with England in Miami just before the World Cup . Enner Valencia earned his 'Superman' nickname while in his final season at Emelec. Fans admired his power and pace, not to mention his uncanny ability to pop up and score a vital goal at the perfect moment. Enner immediately found the Mexican Liga to his liking and in just 17 outings during the second half of the regular season he notched 12 goals. In the end-of-season play-offs, he scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 away win at Pumas and a vital goal in the semi-final, second leg at Santos. And when he scored twice more in a 3-2 first leg win over Leon in the final, Pachuca looked odds-on for success. However, they blew it, losing 2-0 at home after extra time to end the season on a low note. INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION . Following the tragic death of Christian Benitez in July 2013, opportunities opened up for Enner and his form in Ecuador's 2014 friendlies made him a natural choice for the World Cup. The first time an English audience caught a glimpse of his abilities was when he powered a bullet header past Ben Foster in the early stages of Ecuador's 2-2 draw with England in Miami just before the finals. Valencia is fouled by Hull's Andrew Robertson during Monday night's match at the KC Stadium . He again demonstrated his aerial prowess to put Ecuador ahead in their opening World Cup match with Switzerland and grabbed two more in the win over Honduras a few days later. His efforts weren't enough to secure a last 16 berth, however, as Switzerland progressed alongside France. Enner was firmly in the shop window and his value rocketed. LONDON CALLING . Amid interest from a number of European clubs, West Ham tabled a £12m bid and secured Enner's signature on a five-year contract at the end of July. Upon arriving in London, he said: 'I really appreciate the welcome I've bene given and I'm excited to be here. 'I've already watched and read a lot about the club to learn about it - I know the fans are really passionate and I'm really glad to have signed.' He came off the bench to replace Carlton Cole with nine minutes remaining of the opening day clash with Tottenham. But it was THAT goal against Hull that really signalled his arrival in England and Hammers fans will hope it's the first of many.

"Neil Lennon called him his 'street kid' and the word on the streets of Bolton is that pocket-sized Zach Clough will soon be a big name in football. Clough looks slight but is built like a light-welterweight boxer and can pack a punch. He delivered a knockout blow to Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup third round and his quick one-two against Wolverhampton Wanderers almost took the points in a 2-2 draw last weekend. So good were his performances, his excited nan Mavis called up local radio to extol his talent. Certainly his Bolton Wanderers team-mates recognise the 19-year-old's ability to spring a surprise on Liverpool on Wednesday night. Zach Clough (right) of Bolton Wanderers is just 19 years of age but will play against Liverpool on Wednesday . The 19-year-old (left) lifts the ball over Ali Al-Habsi to give Bolton the lead against Wigan Athletic . David Wheater (right) insists Clough 'won't freeze' when he plays for Bolton against Liverpool . 'He won’t freeze,' said gnarled 6ft 5ins defender David Wheater. 'He always wants the ball, even in training where I kick him quite a lot. 'Sometimes you can kick the younger lads and they go away but he wants the ball all the time. He’ll be good against Liverpool. He won’t be thinking about what stage he is playing on. He just wants to play football, every game is the same for him. It wouldn’t surprise me if he does score or if he gets man of the match - he’s that good.' Softly spoken, Clough says it like it is. He attended Audenshaw School, which boasts singer Mick Hucknall as a former pupil, he was a promising cricketer as a boy and wears black boots. There's certainly a lot to like about the teenager from Denton. Clough has scored three times in two games for Bolton and is seen as a real prospect . 'He's not a ragamuffin,' said manager Lennon. 'He's polite and he's well mannered but he's a hungry boy and he just loves playing his football.' A Manchester City fan, 5ft 7ins Clough still tries to sneak across to Eastlands with his father Paul to ogle the skills of David Silva and Samir Nasri, who play in his favoured position 'at the top of a diamond or in the hole'. Born on March 8, 1995, the same day that Bolton team-mate Emile Heskey made his debut for Leicester City, Clough has already joined an illustrious band; he scored on his Bolton debut, as have Heskey, Daniel Sturridge, Andy Walker and a certain Nat Lofthouse. Daniel Sturridge and his Liverpool team-mates lie in wait for Clough in the FA Cup fourth-round replay . Bolton boss Neil Lennon (left) insists Clough is not a 'ragamuffin' but puts in plenty of effort . The omens are good and Clough is happy to aim high. 'Three goals in two games has been a great start but hopefully it will be 10 goals in 10 games,' he said. 'I’ve been popping in goals for a long time. I’ve been here since I was eight years old, and worked under some great coaches. 'Being involved against Liverpool in a game live on Match of the Day would be a dream come true. What a game it’s going to be - I’ve worked hard to get that sort of moment. The whole nation will be watching.'

"Mark Wahlberg has launched an appeal to wipe clean his criminal record ... so he can handle a gun and join the police, it has been reported. The actor, whose oeuvre includes such films as 'Shooter', '2 Guns' and 'Contraband', spent 45 days in jail in 1988 after he was convicted for a vicious, racially-charged attack  that left a man blind in one eye. But the 43-year-old now insists he is a changed man and has begged the state of Massachusetts to pardon his criminal past and allow him to join an L.A. area police force as a reservist, TMZ.com reported. Federal law bans convicted felons from possessing firearms or ammunition, and therefore renders becoming an armed police officer impossible. Scroll down for video . Gunman: Mark Wahlberg has launched an appeal to wipe clean his criminal record. He has played many police officers on the silver screen, including 1999 crime thriller The Corrupter (pictured), but his criminal record bans him from handling a gun and is frowned upon in the force . Criminal past: The actor, whose oeuvre includes such films as 'Shooter' and '2 Guns' (pictured, right, with co-star Denzil Washington), spent 45 days in jail in 1988 after he was convicted for a vicious, racially-charged attack that left a man blind in one eye . The celebrity-gossip website claimed he became interested in the life of a lawman while researching roles for movies, including 'The Other Guys,' 'Max Payne' and 'The Departed.' Other celebrities who have turned their hands to law enforcement include former basketball star Shaquille O’Neal, who joined a Miami reservist patrol unit this year, and Jack Osbourne, who is on the force in Muncie, Indiana. Court documents reveal just how horrifying Wahlberg's 1988 attack was - including startling racial slurs he shouted at the victim and others - but the actor insists he is now 'a better person and citizen'. Wahlberg, who served 45 days in jail after the assault, says his record continues to impact him and could prevent businesses, such as restaurants, that work with him from getting licenses. He insists he has come a long way since April 1988, when he attacked Thanh Lam with a five-foot stick while yelling slurs at him in order to steal the two cases of beer he was carrying. Troubled past: Mark Wahlberg served 45 days in prison after he blinded a man in a 1988 assault . Documents included in his pardon request show he called the Vietnamese immigrant a 'Vietnam f***ing s***' before striking him so hard that the stick broke in two and knocked Lam unconscious, according to the documents shared by The Smoking Gun. He then fled the scene and approached a second man, Hoa Trinh, put his arm around his shoulder and asked him to help him hide. But once police passed, Wahlberg hit him, leaving him blind in one eye. When Boston cops tracked Wahlberg down and took him back back to the scene of the assault outside a convenience store in Dorchester, he told officers: 'You don't have to let him identify me, I'll tell you now that's the motherf***** whose head I split open', the documents show. Authorities wrote that he also made 'numerous unsolicited racial statements about 'gooks' and 'slant-eyed gooks'.' In his plea, Wahlberg said that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time. 'From later accounts of the incident, it is my understanding that I may have caused serious injuries'  to the men, he wrote. Other documents show that, in an earlier attack in Dorchester, he and two friends saw a group of black siblings and chased them. Changed man: Now, Wahlberg is hoping to get a pardon for his past actions . Scene of the crime: The liquor store where Wahlberg attacked a man with a stick and then ran away . 'We don't like black n****** in the area so get the f*** away from the area,' the boys shouted at the group, according to the documents. They then chased the boys, shouting: 'Kill the n*****, kill the n*****'. The following day, the group encountered one of the boys again and threw rocks at him. One of the rocks thrown by Wahlberg and one of his friends hit a nearby girl. The trio caused 'a high level of anxiety, fear and intimidation', the documents said. Though he was then only 16 at the time of the 1988 attack, he was charged as an adult and convicted of assault. According to NECN the initial charge was attempted murder. After emerging from prison, Wahlberg went on to find success in music with Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and as a Calvin Klein model. Family guy: Wahlberg (above with wife Rhea Durham and three of his children and Kevin Hart) is now committed to multiple charities and attends church every day . But it was his appearance in the 1996 film Boogie Nights that really changed things, catapulting Wahlberg into the critically-acclaimed box office juggernaut that he is today. 'I am deeply sorry for the actions that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims,' Wahlberg wrote in the pardon application. 'Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others.' He devotes much of his time and a large amount of his money to various charities, including the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation and the Dorchester Boys and Girls Club. He is also a family man now, married to former model Rhea Durham and the father of four children, and attends church daily. The Board of Pardons will investigate the petition to decide if it warrants a hearing before it is recommended to the governor who by that time will be the recently elected Charlie Baker. Pardon? It will ultimately be up to newly elected Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker (above) to decide whether or not Wahlberg should be pardoned . And while erasing the past is important, Wahlberg points out that he still talks about what he did to show how much a person can change. But he said that, as a convicted criminal, there are still some things he cannot do  and for that he needs a pardon, including working with law enforcement to help at-risk youth. In the end, however, it is about showing his growth. 'The more complex answer is that receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that I am not the same person that I was on the night of April 8, 1988,' Wahlberg explains. 'It would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if he devotes himself to personal improvement and a life of good works.'","Wahlberg wants pardon  for assault in 1988 that left victim blind in one eye .

"Dust from a comet has been discovered on the Earth's surface for the first time, locked inside the ancient ice sheet that covers Antarctica. The discovery is expected to reveal new clues about how our solar system formed as scientists study the tiny comet particles more closely. Researchers found the comet dust after drilling almost 58 feet (17 metres) into the Antarctic snow at a place called Tottuki Point, around 10 miles north of the Japanese Syowa Research Station. Scroll down for video . Electron microscope images of meteorite particles found in the Antarctic ice around Tottuki Point, which were found to contain the same minerals, metal compounds and structures that have been found in comet dust . After melting the ice they discovered thousands of particles measuring from the size of a grain of talcum powder to the width of a human hair. They were initially thought to be the remains of meteorites that have broken up in the Earth's atmosphere in the past. However, when scientists examined 40 of the particles more closely, they found they were identical to the kind of material that has been gathered from comets, known as chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles. The discovery is considered to be particularly surprising because the highly porous fragments are extremely fragile and were not thought to be able to survive Earth's weather. To find them on one of the harshest environments in the planet is perhaps even more surprising, but it was probably the extreme cold that helped to preserve them, trapping them in the ice. Professor Takaaki Noguchi, lead author of the study and a meteorite researcher at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, said: 'In this paper we report the discovery of more than 40 chondritic porous micrometeorites in the surface snow and blue ice of Antarctica, which are indistinguishable from chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles. 'It is therefore considered that chondritic porous micrometeorites are chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles that have fallen to Earth and have survived the terrestrial environment.' Comets are some of the oldest objects in the solar system and are thought to be made from the material left over from when our solar system first formed. Composed of a combination of ice and rock, some scientists believe they may have been responsible for first bringing water and organic molecules to Earth that led to the formation of life. Fragile comet particles were not thought to be able to survive the environment here on Earth but the cold temperatures in Antarctica locked them inside ancient ice, helping to protect them from the environment . Comets leave behind a distinctive tail of dust and gas, which is produced as they heat up and become unstable . Comet ISON passed close to the Sun in November 2013 and Russian scientists have been searching in Antarctica for dust particles that may be carried to Earth by the solar wind - the latest findings will raise hopes . By studying them, researchers hope to gain an insight into how our solar system evolved and perhaps even unlock how life first began on our planet. Until now scientists have only been able to obtain comet dust by flying missions high in the Earth's atmosphere, where tiny particles left behind from the tails of passing comets can be collected. However, this can be painstaking work, with several hours of flying yielding just one particle of dust. Already the Japanense scientists, whose work is published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, have found dozens of particles from comets and with thousands of others in their sample still to be identified, the haul could be huge. The dust in Antarctica is also cleaner as it can be filtered from the melted ice, while dust collected in the atmosphere becomes coated in oils used to trap the particles, making them difficult to study. Recently Nasa flew a mission to the comet Wild 2 (seen in the gif to the right) where its Stardust spacecraft collected samples of dust and returned them to Earth. The Japanese scientists found features in their comet dust samples from Antarctica that are almost identical to those seen in the dust collected by Stardust and those collected in the atmosphere. They have yet to determine the age of the ice where the particles were found, which may help to reveal when they fell to earth. The particles they found were spherical and measured between 10 micrometres to just over 60 micrometres. These were composed of a glass like material with metal and sulphides embedded in them. They also featured whisker like crystals of the mineral enstatite. Professor Noguchi said: 'They also contained low-iron–manganese-enriched and low-iron–chromium-enriched ferromagnesian silicates, kosmochlor-rich high-calcium pyroxene, roedderite and carbonaceous nanoglobules. 'These components have previously been discovered in primitive solar system materials such as the cometary particles recovered from the 81P/Wild 2 comet. 'The most outstanding feature  is the presence of kosmochlor-rich high-Ca pyroxene and roedderite, which suggest that they have building blocks in common  cometary dust particles.' The results have excited planetary scientists around the world as it offers a rich source of comet material for study and checking against the results from dust collected in the atmosphere. The comet dust was found among thousands of meteorite particles in ice 58 feet deep at Tottuki Point, where several glaciers meet 10 miles north of the Japanese Syowa Research Station in Antarctica . The scientists found 'whiskers' of the mineral enstatite (shown above) similar to those found in comet dust . Speaking to the journal Science, Dr Larry Nittler, from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, said: 'It’s very exciting for those of us who study these kinds of extraterrestrial materials, because it opens up a whole new way to get access to them. 'They’ve found a new source for something that’s very interesting and very rare.” Earlier this year Russian scientists announced they hoped to collect fresh dust particles in Antarctica from the comet ISON that may fall there after it lit up the sky in November 2013 when it had a close encounter with the Sun. Although they have still to announce any results,  the latest findings will raise hopes that they will be able to survive the fall to Earth. The Japanese work builds on work by French scientists who reported finding unusual comet-like fragments in the snow in Antarctica. Dr Cécile Engrand, a meteorite researcher from Paris-Sud University in Orsay who led that work, said: 'The study of these cometary particles will help shed more light on the material that served for planetary formation. 'They are the best witnesses that we have of that period of time.'

Still, he will no doubt have reflected as . he collected his medal, smiling broadly and posing with his superstar . team-mates beneath a triumphant arch declaring them UEFA Super Cup . winners, it could be worse. Not every wish can come true for a Galactico; just most of them. So it was that Cristiano Ronaldo stole the show in Cardiff. Bale’s show, James Rodriguez’s show, Toni Kroos’s show. The new wave had to bow down to the master. But those who turned out to see the World Footballer of the Year, as much as the local hero, will not have gone home disappointed. Ronaldo cut a forlorn figure in Brazil this summer. Injured, shorn of his more talented club-mates, his Portugal team failed to make it out of their group and the talisman appeared pitiably morose. This occasion could not have been more different. His two goals were well taken, the second a peach, and he looked fit, re-energised, every inch the planet’s finest footballer.

Thumbs up from us: Ronaldo lays alongside Bale next to the Super Cup trophy as Luka Modric (centre) looks on . However impressive his companions, it . is Ronaldo who encapsulates the brilliance of the European champions, . his daring, his audacity, his vision. Cardiff was privileged to have him . for the night; as any city would be. Although . maybe not Seville. His two goals here took his total against Sevilla to . 18 in four years. It is a typical Ronaldo trait that some of his . numbers induce gasps. The majority of forwards would be happy with that . return in one season; he has achieved it against one club. Yet Ronaldo’s magnificence should not . detract from Bale’s  contribution. He certainly did not have a poor game . and his cross for Ronaldo’s opener was arguably the pass of the night. With all eyes on the new boys, it was last season’s partnership that . combined to break the stalemate with a stunning counter-attack fully . showcasing the incredible threat posed by Madrid on the break. Watching on: World Cup-winning midfielder Sami Khedira was in the stands to witness his team-mates' victory . Sevilla . lost the ball 70 yards from their own net but, in the blink of an eye, . that is where it had been relocated, a quite superb left-wing cross by . Bale finding Ronaldo at the far post for a simple, if impressively . clinical, finish. Switching ably between flanks and through the middle, Bale’s supply line was inch-perfect. Less . grand than the Bernabeu, this was nonetheless a fitting stage for his . talents. Born and raised in this city — Southampton spotted him as a . nine-year-old playing for Cardiff Civil Service and, at 16, he was still . helping his school win trophies locally — what a player he has grown up . to be. He looks entirely at home in this company, no matter the continued raising of the stakes. Drawing a line in the turf: English referee Mark Clattenburg uses his vanishing spray to mark a free-kick . Collision course: Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos goes head over heels . Will it work, this team of all the talents? It presents no easy challenge for coach Carlo Ancelotti. Madrid’s . squad is like a big family now, with all the kids constantly fighting . for attention. So James Rodriguez had a fine second-half shot saved by . Beto and Karim Benzema had a couple go close. Angel Di Maria — who may . just have been Madrid’s most consistent player over the course of last . season — couldn’t even get in the starting line-up. As . for Bale, he had a couple of first-half shots deflect wide and forced . an 18th-minute save from Beto: close but no cigar. Perhaps he was just . trying too hard. Quiet night: Jame Rodriguez (centre) did not perform at the level he did for Colombia during the World Cup . Heads up: Sevilla players crowd around Madrid's Pepe trying to challenge for a header . He took a free-kick which did not make . it over the wall and could not get on the end of any crosses, despite a . number of a good penalty area runs. Nor was he greatly helped by his . re-acquaintance with Clattenburg. When . Bale was fouled quite blatantly early in the game, Clattenburg waved . play on, perhaps leaning too heavily on memory and accusations of . diving. They tend to take Bale only on face value in Spain and he fits . right in. Ronaldo is another . who is more sinned against than sinning.  Preparing for one of his . lightning stepovers in the first half, he was taken out quite brutally . by Sevilla’s Vitolo, whose response was almost comical in its crudeness. The second goal, which effectively ended the contest, was a perfect riposte four minutes after half time. Close support: Bale's girlfriend Emma Rhys-Jones watches on from the stands inside the ground . If at first you don't succeed: Bale kept trying but his performance did not match Ronaldo's . Ronaldo . started the move on the halfway line and finished it, seizing a square . pass from Benzema to strike a left-foot shot that eluded Beto. Maybe the . Sevilla goalkeeper should have done better, but  Ronaldo’s effect on . the ball has a way of bamboozling even the safest of hands. There . are a number of useful teams around now, but few possess a forward line . capable of the  wonder of Madrid. When Ancelotti named a front six of . Ronaldo, Bale, James, Kroos, Luka Modric and Benzema, it was a statement . of intent, a bold return to the days of the Galacticos when the club . attempted to dominate Europe with an XI that read like a spectacularly . overambitious fantasy team. On . the computer screen the group does not have to gel, blend or strike . that delicate balance between attacking genius and defensive resilience. Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were always a wonderful pairing, if . matched by keyboard or console. Centre stage: There was no doubt who the man of the match was at the end of the game . Kroos control: The German midfielder was at his controlling best in his competitive Madrid debut . Real . football isn’t like that, except Real’s football is. There is no . equivalent of Claude Makelele in this team, no deep midfield destroyer. Ancelotti’s . forwards have to run hard and Modric and Kroos have to put in their . tackles. It shouldn’t work, it may not work long term — but last night . it did, just about. This . was one of those occasions when Madrid gave their opponents so much to . deal with that the odd defensive lapse could be overlooked. Beating . the very best teams,  certainly in the late stages of the Champions . League, may require a plan B. Yet in Cardiff, Madrid just kept coming at . Sevilla until the defences broke. It was nevertheless a bold first-half . performance by the Europa League champions and Iker Casillas made more . first-half saves than his counterpart Beto. Sparkle: Confetti is released into the air as Casillas lifts the Super Cup . Name on the trophy: Modric, Marcelo and Bale point to show the list of names on the Super Cup . Spurred on: Former Tottenham stars Bale and Modric pose alongside the European Super Cup . But it always seemed a matter of when, not if, Madrid would score and that moment arrived bang on the half-hour. This is a team that cannot, as yet, find room for Sami Khedira, Di Maria or Xabi Alonso. Maybe . one day they will abandon all semblance of logic and just send out the . 11 best players in the world. If they bought Manuel Neuer they could . even take a swing at rush goalie. Don’t put it past them. It is fair to say they do things differently over there, even if Ronaldo’s influence remains as reliable as Iberian sunrise.

"With only 39 days before the election, the president and presidential hopeful alike have been trying to respectively prove and attack the famous Reagan question – are you better off than you were four years ago? And the cast members of Saturday Night Live proved no exception, opening on their Thursday night special with cast member Jay Pharoah as President Obama speaking at Kent State University in Ohio. Pharoah opened by asking those in the audience which members had a job, but appeared crestfallen when person after person said their situations were more dire. Scroll down for video . Better off? In Thursday night's opening sketch, SNL cast member Jay Pharoah played Obama at a campaign event in Ohio asking people if they were better off than they were four years ago . Downgrade: Fred Armisen, left, said he was a manager at Burger King, having been laid off from his banking executive job; Kate McKinnon, right, said she sold apples by the side of the road . Breaking bad: Only Bill Hader's character, who apparently cooks crystal meth, said he was better off than he was four years ago . ‘Who here has a job?’ he asked hopefully, looking around the room. Fred Armisen, who had the honour of playing the president in seasons’ past, raised his hand and said he was a manager at Burger King. ‘A manager at Burger King? There you go – have it your way!’ Pharoah said, then asking, ‘I bet you were behind the counter four years ago?’ Armisen glumly replied: ‘I was the vice president of Bank of America.’ The flailing economy has been a hot topic on the campaign trail this year, dividing those who see the slow economy as Mr Obama’s fault, and those who think the recovery process is simply sluggish. Looking for more encouraging stories, Pharoah again asked who had a job or was better off than they were four years ago. One woman said she worked at the 'apple store,' something Pharoah jumped on. The woman then said: ‘Oh, I don’t work for the computer store, I sell actual apples. I have a shack by the highway and sell mostly to immigrants and the occasional mule.’ Paying visits: On Weekend Update, Fred Armisen, playing embattled Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, spoke to Seth Myers via his translator, played by Nasim Pedrad . Captive audience: Meyers also had on 'the girl you wish you hadn't started a conversation with at a party¿ to talk about current events . Asking the crowd if anyone had a job that didn’t exist before he became president, Kel Thompson answered: ‘I chase racoons out of foreclosed homes, it’s great because the homes don’t have people in them…and then I sometimes eat the racoons.’ On Weekend Update with Seth Meyers, Fred Armisen played embattled Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, with a translator, played by Nasim Pedrad. The president’s visit to New York for the U.N. summit has been racked with controversy, with thousands protesting his vision for a ‘new world order’ of government. He explained to Meyers a favourite pass time while in New York. ‘My favourite game is now “Homosexual or Jew,” Armisen said through Pedrad. ‘I get most excited when someone is both, which is why I’m always so happy to see you, Seth.’ The translator branched off after interpreting the first bit, saying Ahmadinejad wouldn’t notice because he ‘looks like he’s waiting at a bus stop outside of a methadone clinic.’ From there, Meyers brought on ‘the girl you wish you hadn’t started a conversation with at a party’ to discuss global issues. The woman, who wore a pink party dress, was seemingly intoxicated and full of non-sequiturs. The replacements: On the last sketch of the night, the NBC comedy show poked fun at the recent NFL referee labour strike with a fake TV show . Bad call: The refs did the best they could as a jury, but couldn't manage to convict Bill Hader's character, even though he confessed to murder . ‘Society, Seth, it’s unconscionable,’ the girl said, checking her iPhone from her purse in the middle of the conversation. ‘Are we better than them? People are angry, society is angry. Open your eyes, people. War. Hunger. Diseases. ‘It’s getting warm, Seth, and this is on a global scale. Do the math.’ For the final sketch of the evening, SNL poked fun at the recent NFL labour dispute with the referee’s union and the subsequent botched call during the Seattle Seahawks and New York Giants game on Monday, with a fake television show called Replacement Refs. ‘You wanted the best, but you’re getting replacement refs,’ the jingle went. In the skit, bungling referees were part of a jury where the defendant confessed to a murder. After tepidly looking around, the referee said with a shaking voice that he was not guilty. They advertised next week’s episode, where a referee serving as a doctor called the death of a patient who only had an ear infection. Daniel Craig, the star of 007, will be the next host for the show’s October 6 airing.","SNL's Thursday night political skits took aim at Obama on the campaign trail .

"A Georgia mom has expressed her outrage after the school her special-needs six-year-old boy attends restrained him with metal handcuffs ‘for his own protection’ after he became disruptive. Lakaisha Reid said that her son, Patrick, suffered painful bruises on his wrists after a school resource officer at Pine Ridge Elementary cuffed him for misbehavior. The school said it took the controversial course of action because he was being disruptive and destructive. Scroll down for video . Lakaisha Reid (left) said that her son, Patrick (right), suffered painful bruises on his wrists after a school resource officer at Pine Ridge Elementary cuffed him for misbehavior . It said in a statement to WXIA: ‘[Patrick] was acting in a disruptive manner and being self-destructive during school today. He ran out of school onto a busy, public street and was pursued by three school staff members. ‘The student was secured and returned to the school… for approximately one hour, the student was scratching, kicking and hitting school personnel and continued to exhibit violent behavior, running into walls, banging his head on tables and placing his health at risk.’ But Mrs Reid disputes that handcuffing Patrick was necessary. Hurt: Patrick showed the bruises he claimed he suffered while handcuffed to US TV station KTLA News . Concern: Mrs Reid said her son was ‘yelling and screaming’ when she arrived at the school . She told Ktla.com: ‘He just ran away from school. It does not require handcuffs for this. He’s a special-needs kid.’ Patrick was ‘yelling and screaming’ when she arrived at the school with her husband after being told about the situation by an official. Mrs Reid said that the only situation in which it would be necessary to cuff a six-year-old would be if ‘he was robbing a bank’. She added: ‘They need to have police officers that are trained for special need kids or for any kids that are that age. That’s pretty young for handcuffs already, you understand? Anything can happen with those handcuffs on him.’","Georgia mother angered by school handcuffing her son, Patrick, 6 .

"A person’s home is their castle and they populate it with their own subjects - millions and millions of bacteria. Scientists have found that when we move from one house to another – or even spend time in a hotel - we take all of our bacteria with us, and 'colonise' the space around us within a matter of hours. These ‘bacterial signatures’ are unique and could be used to uncover crimes in future, just as today’s investigators rely on fingerprints. Scroll down for video . Scientists have found that when we move from one house to another – or even spend time in a hotel - we take all our bacteria with us and colonise the space around us within a matter of hours (illustrated) Scientists from the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago examined the complex interaction between humans and the microbes that live on and around us. The Home Microbiome Project followed seven families - comprising 18 people, three dogs and one cat - over the course of six weeks. The participants in the study swabbed their hands, feet and noses daily to collect a sample of the microbial populations living in and on them. They also sampled surfaces in the house, including doorknobs, light switches, floors and countertops. Researchers at the lab analysed the DNA of the samples to characterise the different species of microbes in each sample, according to the study published in Science. They found that people substantially affected the microbial communities in a house. When three of the families moved, it took less than a day for the new house to look just like the old one in the way it was covered in microbes. Researchers at the laboratory analysed the DNA of the samples to characterise the different species of microbes in each sample. They found that people substantially affected the microbial communities in a house. A stock image of 'superbug' microbes is pictured . Dr Gilbert said that microbiome studies could serve as a forensic tool. Given an unidentified sample from a floor in this study he said, ‘we could easily predict which family it came from.’ Because a microbial community shifts in a matter of days when a person leaves a location, he said: ‘you could theoretically predict whether a person has lived in this location, and how recently, with very good accuracy.’ Dr Gilbert believes this technique could be more sophisticated than fingerprints. He said that scientists could look at bacterial colonies to identify the last person to come into contact with a person and when it happened. An actual fingerprint is rarely left on a body, but a microbial fingerprint certainly is,’ he added. They found that couples and their young children shared most of their microbial community and that regular physical contact made a difference in how bacteria spread. People’s hands were the most likely to have similar microbes, while their noses showed the most individual variation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more plant and soil bacteria was found in houses containing dogs and cats. The research suggests that when a person, and their microbes, leave a house, the microbial community shifts noticeably in a matter of days. Jack Gilbert, a microbiologist at Argonne, said that the effects are more extreme in hotels. ‘Everyone thinks hotels are icky, but when one young couple we studied moved into a hotel, it was microbiologically identical to their home within 24 hours,’ he told The Washington Post. 'No matter what you do to clean a hotel room. Your microbial signal has wiped out basically every trace of the previous resident within hours.' Dr Gilbert said that microbiome studies could serve as a forensic tool.

Dr Gilbert believes that parents in the future could raise their children in homes full of healthier microbes. The human microbiome is in a state of flux before the age of two and the 'wrong' sort of bacteria can impact physical and mental development. More research on how microbes move around, could mean that parents could expose their children to a greater microbial community. He continued that dogs act as a useful conduit for bringing in microbes from the outdoors. Many scientists believe that more bacteria are good for us and that some can prevent allergies. In the future it may be possible to engineer environments to circulate good bacteria so children could be set up for healthy lives.","Scientists from the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory examined the  interaction between humans and the microbes that live on us .

"Syria has accused Israel of launching several airstrikes near the Lebanese border, including Damascus' international airport. Israel has launched a series of air strikes inside Syria throughout the three-year civil war, but has maintained their purpose have been to prevent weapons from reaching Lebanese islamist group Hezbollah. Both targeted sites, Damascus' International Airport and the town of Dimas were used for military purposes and were used to store weapons, possibly Russian-made missiles, according to reports, . Scroll down for video . Bombing: Syria has accused Israel of launching several airstrikes near the Lebanese border, bombings that may have been an attack to prevent Syria from arming Lebanese militants Hezbollah . 'Both were military sites, and weapons were being stored there,' Rami Abdel Rahma, director of British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict, said. 'This afternoon, the Israeli enemy targeted two safe areas in Damascus province, namely the Dimas area and the Damascus International Airport,' the army said in a statement. It said the strikes caused damage but that nobody was hurt. Following attacks, there has been wide-spread speculation that the weapons targeted in the strikes were Russian-made S300 surface-to-air missiles, the Guardian reports. Both civilian and military aircraft operate at the airport, which lies southeast of Damascus near flashpoint areas including Eastern Ghouta, large parts of which are in rebel hands. Israel's Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz refused to comment directly on Sunday's incident, but made thinly veiled references to Hezbollah when questioned. A video emerged Monday, allegedly showing Israeli jets breaching Syrian airspace before the attacks on Syria's main international airport outside Damascus and the town of Dimas near the Lebanese border . 'We have a firm policy of preventing all possible transfers of sophisticated weapons to terrorist organisations,' Steinitz said in a radio interview when questioned about the airstrikes. The Syrian army reiterated its claim that the Jewish state is helping rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad. 'This direct aggression by Israel was carried out to help the terrorists in Syria, after our armed forces secured important victories in Deir Ezzor, Aleppo and elsewhere,' the army said. Sunday's air raids proved 'Israel's direct support for terrorism in Syria,' it said, using the regime's collective term to refer to peaceful opponents, armed rebels and jihadists fighting in Syria. Fighting back: Rebel fighters take positions inside a damaged building in Aleppo, Syria . Other side: The rebels prepare to fight forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad who are stationed in Aleppo's historic citadel . The rebels range from young teenage boys to greying men, operating within the Syrian city . On the move: Rebel fighters ride a motorbike in the old city of Aleppo on Sunday . Later, the Syrian foreign ministry said it had asked UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Israel, describing the strikes as 'a heinous crime against Syria's sovereignty', according to state news agency SANA. In the past year, Israel has reportedly carried out a number of raids on Syrian targets and on positions of the Lebanese Shiite militant Hezbollah, an ally of both Syria and arch-foe Iran. In March, Israeli warplanes attacked Syrian army positions just hours after a bomb wounded four Israeli soldiers on the Golan, one severely. On Monday, more than 30 humanitarian groups launched an appeal for countries to take in some 180,000 refugees from Syria, with the UN refugee agency predicting that the number of people fleeing the fighting could rise to nearly 3.6 million by the end of 2015. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said 3.2 million refugees were already listed in neighbouring countries after three years of fighting, with Turkey and Lebanon hosting more than a million each. The Syrian conflict, which evolved from a pro-democracy movement into a full-blown civil war, is estimated to have killed more than 200,000 people and forced half the population to flee their homes.","Syria accuse Israel of attacks on airport and town near Lebanese border .

"A hellish inferno at a downtown Los Angeles apartment building has caused hellish gridlock in for commuters this morning after two major highways had to be closed - adding an hour or more to the drive to work for many Angelinos. More than 250 firefighters are on the scene at 909 West Temple Street near the interchange of the 110 Freeway and the 101 Freeway. Authorities closed both highways, which are major thoroughfares through downtown Los Angeles, after the blaze started about 1.20am Pacific Time. The 101 Freeway was reopened before rush hour, but much of the northbound 110 remained shut off into Monday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Los Angeles Fire Department said more than 250 firefighters are battling a blaze, which can be seen for miles around . Firefighters do not yet know what caused the massive blaze, which towered over downtown Los Angeles on Monday morning . The fire engulfed an apartment tower that was under construction and spread to at least two other buildings before crews could bring it under control . The blaze at the seven-story building filled the surrounding area with smoke, causing the the 110 Freeway and the 101 Freeway to close . The northbound lanes of the 110 Freeway remained shut through Monday morning because firefighters feared that the smoldering remains of the building could collapse on to the highway . 'Just imagine that major artery - which is about eight miles long that takes people downtown and into Hollywood, Glendale, Burbank. To shut that off. We’re adding another hour of commute,' California Highway Patrol spokesman Edgar Figueroa told the Los Angeles Times. Traffic slowed to a crawl more than three miles from the highway shut down and alternate routes and other major highways soon became choked with traffic Monday morning. One angry commuter, naming downtown streets, could be heard ranting: 'First is shut down and Temple is shut down. Downtown is basically shut down.' Most of the inferno was brought under control in 90 minutes, though firefighters remained worried that the smoking wreckage could collapse on to the 110 northbound. Three lanes of the highway were finally reopened about 10.15am - well after rush hour. Smoke and flames could be seen billowing up from the blaze for miles around - dwarfing even the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles. Rubble: The wood frame apartment building burned quickly and was reduced to little more than cinders. Much of the debris fell on the 110 Freeway, causing the northbound lanes of the major artery to close . Firefighters say they were shocked by how quickly and uncontrollably the blaze spread. Five stories of wood frame construction were fully engulfed in just minutes . Two other building - both of which house municipal offices - were damaged by the fire. One of the buildings - a 16-story high-rise - had all but two floors damaged by smoke and water . The flames cross the 110 freeway and melted road signs. Only three lanes of the highway were open by Monday afternoon . Witnesses from as far away as West Hollywood reported seeing the fire. 'This is a historic fire, what we as firefighters would call ""a career fire."" It's huge. I really can't remember a building fire this big and I have been with the department for 13 years,' Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman David Ortiz told NBC News. The inferno grew so intense, that it spread to a 16-story office tower nearby and damaged another adjacent building - both of which house municipal offices for Los Angeles County. Three floors of the 16-story tower caught fire and only the building's emergency sprinkler system saved it from being completely engulfed. Firefighters say 14 of the 16 floors have at least water and smoke damage. The building houses several county departments, including Parks and Recreation Department. Another building, Los Angeles County Health Services, . Scorched asphalt: Flames and smokes poured across the 110 and 101 freeways, causing authorities to shut down both until the fire could be contained on Monday morning . The chief of LA's fire department tweeted this picture of his men bringing the blaze under control . Inferno: The fire is burning at a building site planned to be a tall residential structure . Downtown: The fire turned an apartment complex near a key Los Angeles interchanged to cinders . The fire was sparked in the partially built Da Vinci apartment tower. No one was inside at the time and there have been no injuries reported. Fire fighters do no yet know what caused the blaze. The 1.3million-square-foot building had two floors of concrete construction with five floors of wood-frame construction on top. It encompassed nearly an entire city block. Damage is estimated to be in the millions. The Da Vinci was meant to be a luxury high-rise development with shops and offices on the bottom two floors and apartments on the top. The fire all but leveled the apartment building and burned several floors of another high-rise . The fire broke out just down the block from a LAFD fire station. Firefighters emerged from the station house to see the blaze . Parts of the 110 Freeway were charred and remained close into rush hour on Monday morning .

They played to total audiences of just under 1.5million people. ‘They’ve had top-selling albums, sell-out tours, DVDs, a book and they have even endorsed a perfume. There hasn’t been another boyband who have made so much money so quickly. ‘Whether they will carry on at the same rate is anybody’s guess.’ All five of the One Direction members are joint fourth on the list of the wealthiest young musicians, only topped by singer/songwriter Adele, DJ Calvin Harris and former Girls Aloud star Cheryl Cole. Adele, who has seen her fortune swell by around 50 per cent this year, even though she has not released any new material, is estimated to be worth £45million.

Topping the music list - as he did last year - is London-based Ukrainian businessman Len Blavatnik, whose empire includes the Warner Music Group which was acquired in 2011. He is estimated to be worth £10 billion, way ahead of nearest rival Clive Calder - the boss of the Zomba group of music companies - who is worth around £1.4 billion. Sir Cameron McIntosh follows closely behind as his worth has shot up by £175million to make him a billionaire for the first time. Sir Paul McCartney remains in fourth place with his and wife Nancy Shevell's fortune said to be at £710 million, up £30 million on last year. In a largely static top 10, Lord Lloyd-Webber retains fifth place on £640 million - up £20 million - and Irish rock band U2 are sixth with a combined wealth of £428 million.

"The Obama administration has banned federal law enforcement from profiling on the basis of religion, national origin and other characteristics, it was announced on Monday. The Justice Department hopes the protocols could be a model for local departments as the nation tackles questions about the role race plays in policing. The policy, which expands decade-old guidelines established under the Bush administration, also will require new training and data collection. Civil rights advocates said they welcomed the broader protections, but were disappointed that the guidelines will exempt security screening in airports and border checkpoints and won't be binding on local and state police agencies. Scroll down for video . Demonstrators clash with police during the protest in Berkeley, California on Saturday as part of an ongoing wave of protests in the U.S. against the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement . Though the guidelines - five years in the making - were not drafted in response to recent high-profile cases involving the deaths of black individuals at the hands of white police officers, they're nonetheless being released amid an ongoing national conversation about standards for police use of force, racial justice and the treatment of minorities by law enforcement. 'Particularly in light of certain recent incidents we've seen at the local level - and the widespread concerns about trust in the criminal justice process which so many have raised throughout the nation — it's imperative that we take every possible action to institute strong and sound policing practices,' said Attorney General Eric Holder, referring to the August shooting by a white police officer of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the chokehold death weeks earlier of Eric Garner in New York City. Local grand juries declined to indict either officer. The Justice Department is investigating both cases. The guidelines cover federal agencies within the Justice Department, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They also extend to local and state officers serving on joint task forces alongside federal agents. Their practical impact remains to be seen, especially since local police officers are the ones primarily responsible for traffic stops, 911 calls and day-to-day interactions with the communities they patrol. U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured last week, said that he expected the new guidelines, which apply to federal law enforcement but not local police officers, would be announced in coming days . But the Obama administration envisions the rules as a possible road map for local police, with Holder expected to brief local law enforcement officials Monday to encourage them to adopt the federal guidelines. Holder, who has made the release of the guidelines a priority before leaving the Justice Department next year, called the guidelines a 'major and important step forward to ensure effective policing' by federal law enforcement. The guidelines extend a ban on routine racial profiling that the Justice Department announced in 2003 under then-Attorney General John Ashcroft. Civil rights groups have long said those rules left open too many loopholes by allowing an exemption for national security and border investigations and by failing to extend the ban to characteristics beyond race and ethnicity. The new guidelines would end the carve-out on national security and border investigations and widen the profiling ban to prohibit the practice on the basis of religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity - though agents would still be able to consider those factors if they had information linking a person of that characteristic to a specific crime or threat. Still, the new protocols allow for significant exemptions, including some for Homeland Security officials who screen passengers at airports and do inspections at the border. Homeland Security officials argued for the exemptions on the basis of what they said was 'the unique nature of border and transportation security as compared to traditional law enforcement'. 'This does not mean that officers and agents are free to profile,' the department said in a statement. 'To the contrary, DHS' existing policies make it categorically clear that profiling is prohibited,' while allowing for limited circumstances in which race, ethnicity and other characteristics could be considered. The American Civil Liberties Union objected to those exemptions. 'It's so loosely drafted that its exceptions risk swallowing any rule and permit some of the worst law enforcement policies and practices that have victimized and alienated American Muslim and other minority communities,' said Laura W. Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington Legislative Office. 'This guidance is not an adequate response to the crisis of racial profiling in America.' The department said other activities, such as civil immigration enforcement and Coast Guard law enforcement actions, would still be covered .

"As far as surprises go, this has got to be one of the best. After heading into the kitchen of their home in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to start her breakfast, this woman is told to 'pack a bag' as she is being whisked away by her husband Derrick. Her reaction is priceless -  a mix of disbelief, joy and bewilderment as she struggles to hold back tears. Derrick's wife's reaction to being told she is being whisked away is priceless - and even more so when he hands her cash for the taxi to the airport . Filming the whole scene on his mobile phone, the husband tells his wife that she 'doesn't have to go to work today,' and that he isn't going either. He then hands her a 20 euro note as a hint, telling that that she will need it as they are on their way to the airport. 'Happy anniversary! Five years,' exclaims the man, identified as Derrick. At first his wife is confused, particularly when she is told she has an hour-and-a-half to pack a bag. Dismayed, she asks: 'You're not being serious? Do you promise?' As she begins to cry tears of joy, she is comforted by the fact that her husband has already sorted who will look after the cats, before he urges her to get packing. Little did the woman know on entering the kitchen area that she was set for the ultimate anniversary gift . 'We're going to go to Europe,' the man tells his wife. 'Why do you think I've been working like bolt-loads of overtime.' Emotions are running high for both, as the man admits to shaking on delivering the news. The video ends when Derrick's tearful wife says: 'Let me hug you!' 'My wife thought we were leaving for work' Derrick explained after posting the video. 'Little did she know I already booked her the time off, and we were headed for the airport to fly to Europe for our five-year anniversary.'

"Every feature, every wrinkle and every hair in this image has been painstakingly designed to create an ultra-realistic model. The 3D model is based on 77-year-old actress Beryl Nesbitt, and was made using high-resolution scans taken on a 94-camera rig. Shaders were added to the skin, subtle hairs were added to the body and even the tear ducts were built using layers of digital colour. Scroll down for video . This super-realistic model was created by London-based visual effects studio Analog. Designers used high-resolution scans of 77-year-old actress and model Beryl Nesbitt before using a computer to build layers of skin, eyes and even tear ducts . It was created as part of a 3D study into mortality, using a technique known as photogrammetry, and features in the video for Duologue’s single MEMEX. The video was directed by Marshmallow Laser Feast, which was responsible for U2’s Super Bowl promo Invisible, and its laser ‘Forest’ featured in The Barbican’s Digital Revolutions exhibition. Duologue worked with photogrammetry firm FBFX to create a full body scan of model Beryl Nesbitt using a 94-camera system. The 360º scans were then sent to visual effects experts at Analog. Analog shot a spherical panoramic high dynamic range photo of a sunset through a window in the studio’s toilet. The two photographic processes were combined using 3D software so the sunset illuminated Ms Nesbitt’s scanned body parts. Analog then built realistic shaders for the skin to add definition, wrinkles, highlights and shadows to the model’s features. The project was the beginning of a study into filmmaking for the virtual reality environment. Duologue worked with photogrammetry firm FBFX to create a full body scan of Ms Nesbitt using a 94-camera system. These cameras were able to scan every inch of the model in high-resolution. Each scan was captured 360º and at 1/13,000th of a second. The scans were then sent to visual effects experts at Analog, who have worked with Marshmallow Laser Feast on other similar project. Analog shot a spherical panoramic high dynamic range photo of a sunset through a window in the studio’s toilet.

"The man who was mauled by a pack of lions after jumping into their enclosure at Barcelona Zoo, is a former police officer who now spends his time as a neo Nazi activist. Justo Jose, 45, remains in intensive care with   serious injuries after he climbed into the lions' den, where he was attacked by three of the animals for about half-an-hour before he could be rescued. It has now emerged that that as well as being a former head of the municipal police force in Gelida near Barcelona, he had also spent 13 years working as a Civil Guard, but has been on paid leave from the force since earlier this year. A male lion lies down on top of a 45-year-old man, who jumped into the lions' enclosure  at Barcelona Zoo . Mauled: The man has been left with serious injuries after jumping into a lion enclosure at Barcelona zoo . Jose told a local reporter earlier this year how he went on extended leave after he lost custody of his son, divorced his wife, and lost his mother. He also described himself as a survivalist, claiming he slept in the countryside most nights with just a poncho to cover his face although friends let him use their homes to shave and wash. In September he got past a police cordon at an official ceremony and set fire to a Catalan flag in front of TV crews. Last month he was arrested in Barcelona city centre after draping banners emblazoned with Swastikas over the famous Casa Mila building in an anti-abortion protest. Yesterday afternoon, Jose appeared by the lion enclosure at the zoo, dressed in military uniform, climbed over railings and began scaling one of the walls in the enclosure before being picked up by one of the animals and thrown into a pit. One of the female lions carries her loot in her mouth - the 45-year-old's backpack . The man was picked up by one of the animals after he jumped into the enclosure, and thrown into a pit . The 45-year-old was rescued around 30 minutes later, covered in scratches and bite marks. He was taken to the city's Hospital de la Vall D'Hebron where he remains in a serious but not life-threatening condition. According to Spanish reports, Jose climbed over fencing to enter the enclosure as horrified tourists watched on. Footage of the bizarre incident shows him scaling one of the enclosure's walls before being tossed by the leg into a pit by a lioness. He emerged some 30 minutes later after fire fighters used hoses to fight the animals off of him. Fire fighters were forced to use power hoses to scare the lions away from the man's body after he jumped into their enclosure in Barcelona Zoo . Police and ambulance staff care for the man who suffered  scratches and bite marks, but is not in a life-threatening condition . Zoo keepers said the animals were not trying to kill the man but were merely attempting to play with him . Both staff at the zoo and emergency services said that it is clear that Jose's stunt was deliberate. 'The security system makes it impossible for a person to fall into the enclosure. It cannot have been by accident, to enter (the enclosure) you have to want to go in,' said chief fire fighter of the Bomberos de Barcelona, Hector Carmona. While he emerged from the enclosure covered in bite marks and scratches, zoo keepers have insisted the lions were merely trying to play with him, Spanish news outlet 20minutos reports. 'The intention was not to kill him, they were just trying to play with him, Ignasi Armengol, director of Barcelona Municipal Services said.'","Man entered the lion enclosure at Barcelona Zoo in army dress .

"Horror: Tosha Thakkar, 24, was murdered by neighbour 'studying to become a serial killer' An Australian teenager who raped and murdered his neighbour was ‘studying how to become a serial killer,’ and had planned his crime for months in advance as part of his ‘education’, a Sydney court heard today. Daniel Stani-Reginald, now 21, attacked Tosha Thakkar, 24, in her next-door flat, stuffed her dead body into a suitcase and dumped it in a canal before he went home to read an article called Beginnings of a Serial Killer. In the weeks leading up to the 2011 murder, Stani-Reginald had visited 9,500 online articles and websites dedicated to serial killers and rapists. Stani-Reginald has pleaded guilty to raping and strangling the accountancy student, and is due to be sentenced by Sydney Supreme Court. Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC today urged a judge to impose a life sentence on Stani-Reginald, saying he is capable of seeking notoriety as a serial killer, NineNewsNational reports. Instead of attending university or forging a career, Stani-Reginald 'made a deliberate decision to school himself on how to become a serial rapist and murderer,' Mr Tedeschi said. Miss Thakkar, originally from Gujarat, western India, had moved to Australia two years earlier to take a post-graduate in accounting at the city's Southern Cross University. The brutal killing took place in the home of Ms Thakkar, who lived in the same house as Stani-Reginald in the Sydney suburb of Croydon, on March 9, 2011. Stani-Reginald had spent the morning 'studying' the sentences of serial killers and watching pornography focusing on the 'degradation of Indian women,' the court heard. Macabre education: In the months leading up to the 2011 murder of Miss Thakkar, Daniel Stani-Reginald, then 19, visited thousands of websites dedicated to serial killers and rapists . Brutal killing: Stani-Reginald, now 21, attacked accountancy student Miss Thakkar, stuffed her dismembered body into a suitcase and dumped it in a canal before he went home to read 'Beginnings of a Serial Killer' After the murder, Stani-Reginald jumped in a cab and transported Miss Thakkar's dismembered body, which he had put in a suitcase, to a canal at Meadowbank, Sydney where it was found two days later. After dumping the body, he visited a shopping centre before returning home to continue his morbid studies and even spoke to Miss Thakkar's boyfriend as police investigated her disappearance. Stani-Reginald was not found to have been under any influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the murder and has not shown remorse, Mr Tedeschi said, . 'There's not the slightest suggestion he was horrified by what he had done. The community would be justifiably aggrieved if he were to receive a sentence less than life imprisonment,"" Mr Tedeschi said. The sentence hearing continues.","Man, 19, murdered his neighbour as he 'studied to become a serial killer'

The hearse was followed by Belgium's former King Albert II and Queen Paola. The couple succeeded the throne following the death of Queen Fabiola's husband, King Baudouin - King Albert II's brother. He abdicated last year to be succeeded by his son King Philippe. Not her final resting place: The funeral will be held at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels .

Customary: A flag flies at half mast at the Royal Palace of Brussels to signal a state of mourning . Although her exact cause of death has not been confirmed, Queen Fabiola, the childless widow of King Baudouin, had been suffering from osteoporosis for years, and had never fully recovered from pneumonia in 2009. The former queen, who used a wheelchair, had looked increasingly frail over the past month as she increasingly limited her public appearances. Fabiola was born in 1928 as Fabiola de Mora y Aragón into an aristocratic family in Madrid, Spain. Her godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain. She became queen of Belgium when she married King Baudouin in 1960. Tribute: Floral tributes are placed at the gates of the Royal Palace . Sad day: A woman brings flowers to the gate of the palace in memory of Fabiola as a police officer looks on . Fabiola remained Queen Consort for 33 years - until Baudouin's death on July 31 1993. He died of heart failure in the Villa Astrida in the south of Spain. After Baudouin's death, Fabiola moved out of the Royal Palace of Laeken to take up residence at Stuyvenbergh Castle. As the couple had no children, the crown passed on to Baudoin's younger brother, King Albert II, who abdicated the throne in 2013 citing health reasons. He was succeeded by his son, now King Phillippe, on 21 July 2013.

Fabiola, a devout Roman Catholic, was generally regarded to be a popular monarch, known for her tireless charity work. In 2001, she was awarded the Ceres Medal in recognition of her work to help rural women in developing countries. Tragically, Fabiola suffered five miscarriages during the course of her marriage to Baudoin. She openly spoke about this in 2008, stating: 'You know, I myself lost five children. 'You learn something from that experience. I had problems with all my pregnancies, but you know, in the end I think life is beautiful.'

Fabiola's bout of ill health commenced in January 2009 when she was hospitalised with pneumonia and spent 15 days there, with her condition being described as 'serious'. She subsequently recovered. In July 2009, alarming anonymous death threats were published by newspapers which stated Queen Fabiola was to be assassinated with a crossbow. She swiftly responded to the death threats during the Belgian national holiday celebrations later that month when she jokingly waved an apple to the crowd. The provocative gesture, a reference to Swiss folk hero William Tell who shot an apple off the head of his son, won her much praise.

"A New Zealand church pastor has been slammed on social media for a 'shocking' and highly offensive email to a gay Christian man, calling him 'filthy' and telling him to kill himself. Author Jim Marjoram emailed about 400 Auckland churches about his new book 'It's Life Jim' to promote gay-friendly religion which details his many years of struggle as a gay Christian. A response by homophobic pastor Logan Robertson of the Westcity Bible Baptist Church in Auckland, was posted to Facebook and has created widespread anger among both religious and non religious people. Pastor Robertson said in his email, 'we are not interested in your filthy lifestyle or book,' citing that the 'Bible clearly says God has rejected homos'. Scroll down for video . Author and gay Christian Jim Marjoram (pictured left) has been told to 'commit suicide' and that all gays are pedophiles by New Zealand Pastor Logan Robertson (pictured right) Jim Marjoram's (pictured) new book, 'It's Life Jim' is to promote gay friendly religion which details his many years of struggle as a gay Christian . 'They (gay people) are worthy of death,' he went on to say, 'you can not be saved.' After quoting the bible a couple of times, Pastor Robertson then continues to say, 'I pray that you will commit suicide, you filthy child molesting f**.' While the abhorrent email has shocked and appalled many people, Mr Marjoram has taken the response in his stride. 'Got my first hate mail,' he wrote after posting the response to Facebook and his social forum on Reddit. 'Got this lovely reply this morning,' he said. Mr Marjoram told One News TVNZ he doesn't feel any anger or hate towards the Pastor. 'The only thing I could say is what you're preaching isn't love,' he said. 'And if you call yourself a Christian... Jesus wouldn't go anywhere near that.' When Daily Mail Australia rang Pastor Robertson for a response he said 'there was nothing really to say about it,' confirming everything he had written was what he believed. 'The Bible says gay people will die and go to hell,' he said. 'I don't agree with the lifestyle and the Bible condemns it.' Asked if he was worried about all the backlash received from the email he simply said he 'didn't worry about it'. Author Jim Marjoram (pictured) emailed about 400 Auckland churches about his new book 'It's Life Jim' to promote gay friendly religion which details his many years of struggle as a gay Christian but got a 'shocking' response from a New Zealand pastor . Where the Westcity Bible Baptist Church in Auckland is. The church Pastor Logan Robertson has caused controversy after labelling gays 'filthy' and saying they should all go to hell . The pastor who has a bio on the church's website states he was born and raised in New Zealand and is grateful that he was raised in a loving Christian home. It says he was saved as a young child and has been happily married for 8 years to wife, and the Lord has blessed them with three wonderful young children. Clearly unfazed by questions that he was preaching ignorance and hate, Pastor Robertson said he couldn't change what he had written and stood by everything he said. 'All homosexuals are pedophiles, all fags are pedophiles, it's not offensive to me, you're either offended or you're not,' he said. The pastor went on to quote several parts of the bible, as he did in his email. Leviticus 20:13 reads 'If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.' The email from Pastor Robertson has been slammed on social media . After the 'offensive' email was posted to Facebook, religious and non religious people came out in support of author Jim Marjoram . The email by Pastor Logan Robertson caused widespread anger on social media . Some Facebook users labelled the email 'shocking' New Zealand Pastor Logan Robertson has been widely criticised for his 'shocking' email to author Jim Marjoram . The Bible says you are vile, strange (queer), reprobate, filth, sodomite, natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed (2 Peter 2:12). 'The Bible never changes, it's the same every generation, the King James version, it's not offensive and I don't care what people think.' Asked if he thought his congregation would be supportive of his tirade against the New Zealand author, he replied 'yes they would support it'. He also gave his 'view' on what the gay population saying 99 per cent of people weren't gay, so gay people were a tiny minority citing the media is constantly 'trying to cram it down our throats, so it appears there are more gay people than there is'. In New Zealand same sex marriage became legal in August last year, a law the pastor is definitely and not surprisingly against. 'They pretend to get married (gay people), marriage is between a man and wife, god created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,' he said. 'The government should put them to death and I'm not calling them gay, because that means happy, they are f**s.' Author Jim Marjoram (pictured) posted the vile response on Facebook and his Reddit account and it has created a media storm of angry people to the comments . The email response has caused widespread anger on social media, both religious and non religious people backing the New Zealand author. 'People like him make hell right here on earth,' one user said on the Facebook post. Another user, who admitted to being religious called the email 'shocking' and said 'the pastor needs to go back to Bible school'. Others made a comment asking the author 'not to think he's part of mainstream Baptists in New Zealand, he's not'. Anglican priest Rod Bower, who is head of the Gosford Anglican church on the New South Wales Central Coast, north of Sydney, says this is 'unbelievably disgraceful'. The father, who is well know for his stance on supporting the gay community and his irreverent and witty signs that often fly in the face of the traditional views, believes Mr Robertson is clearly in possession of a very limited biblical theology. 'While the biblical narrative does have a negative view of what we recognize as 'homosexual' behaviour, the writers have no concept of what we now understand as sexual orientation,' he said. 'Mostly where there is a negative view it has more to do with pagan worship and marital infidelity than it does with what we understand a homosexuality.' Pro-gay Anglican priest Rod Bower (pictured) has called Pastor Logan Robertson an embarrassment to the Christian faith . Father Rod Bower (pictured) is known for his pro-gay stance and his creative signs out front of his Anglican church at Gosford on the NSW Central Coast. He says the email response is 'unbelievably disgraceful' A sign liked by Father Rod Bower . 'The reference to Sodomy (Genesis 19) is again a misrepresentation of the text, as the sin of Sodom has nothing to do with homosexuality and everything to do with the denial of hospitality.' 'In this context Mr Robertson is more the Sodomite than Mr Marjoram. If Mr Robertson wishes to take the Bible seriously rather than literally (you can’t do both) he may wish to consider James 3:9-12.' 'With it (our tongue) we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way. Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh.' 'Effectively Mr Robertson has sought to curse Mr Marjoram and the problem with that is curses have a nasty habit of bouncing back on you.' 'Mr Robertson is an embarrassment to the Christian faith and I wonder how much harm he has done to other people. Another biblical verse comes to mind, 'Jesus wept'.'","New Zealand pastor slammed on social media for an 'shocking' letter to a gay Christian .

This is the third time Weber has set out to find the seven 'best.' In 2007, he received over 100 million votes when he asked which seven world wonders were the greatest. In 2011, he began the hunt for the best natural wonders. Voting for final seven cities first began in October 2013, when 28 finalists were voted down to 21. From July 2014 until October 2014, the 21 were further reduced to 14 - with the final 7 announced on December 7, 2014 in Dubai. Weber recorded a video to announce the winners, naming the top seven cities in alphabetic order. The beachfront city of Durban, South Africa, also made the final cut. Pictured: Golden Mile beach .

"The National Football League (NFL) has defended two referees who were filmed fist-bumping after Denver Broncos' star C.J. Anderson scored a second touchdown during Sunday's game. The 23-year-old running back scored his one-yard touchdown in the second quarter of the team's 24-17 win against the Buffalo Bills at Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado. As he and his teammates celebrated, line judge John Hussey and umpire Carl Paganelli were caught on video discretely fist-bumping after making what turned out to be a correct call. Celebration: The NFL has defended line judge John Hussey and umpire Carl Paganelli who were filmed fist-bumping (pictured) after Denver Broncos' star C.J. Anderson scored a second touchdown during a game . Their celebration sparked anger among several of the Bills' players, with safety Aaron Williams later taking to social media to express his disgust at the gesture. The 24-year-old posted a link to a video of the officials' fist-bump to Twitter, alongside the caption: 'No excuse for my performance, but can't win playing 16 vs 11, thought I'd seen it all...' In fact, there are nine officials for NFL games, so it would have actually made it 20 vs 11, in accordance with Williams's feelings toward the referees' loyalty. Despite a number of complaints, the NFL had no problem with the gesture.

'It was an acknowledgment of good mechanics between the two officials involved in making the call,' NFL spokesman, Michael Signora, said. Indeed, it was a difficult call because Anderson bulled through the center of the line, making it hard for Mr Hussey - who was standing on the sideline - to see if the ball had crossed the plane of the goal line before the runner's knee hit the turf. Mr Paganelli's job - from the middle of the field - is to stick his nose into the pile and help the line judge figure it out. He did that, then gave Mr Hussey the thumbs up.

"Ellie Harrison was told her long blonde hair was 'too present' when she joined BBC's Countryfile . She may be the popular and attractive presenter of Countryfile, but Ellie Harrison's good looks have not always been synonymous with a smooth path to success. The 37-year-old revealed that after her first appearance on the BBC show she was told her flowing blonde tresses were 'too present.' She was asked by producers on the Sunday evening show to be more countryside, 'less Hollywood' in her appearance - a statement she believes was related to the long blonde locks that have earned her fame. It may have come as a shock as the popular presenter grew up in the Cotswolds where her father grew the family's fruit and vegetable and kept chickens and has also worked on conservation projects across the world. She has recently returned to the Cotswolds with her family. However she said the statement was an example of the problems she has encountered because of her good looks, as well as the different culture in the UK compared to the US - which she said was far more welcoming. 'It is celebratory over there; they really want you to do well,' the mother-of-two told Countryside magazine. 'It's like over here they would almost rather you were on the edge of a breakdown.' Scroll down for video . Mrs Harrison previously worked for the Countryfile Discovery Channel in America and has spoken about the problem of being viewed first for her looks and regarded as a 'blonde, fluffy thing.' Her long blonde hair has attracted much debate among viewers of Countryfile and the presenter herself admits her tresses get much attention. Mrs Harrison travelled across the world last year to film a new BBC series called Britain's Big Wildlife Revival . She added: 'I get asked a lot about my hair. It's a subject that always seems to come up.' The popular presenter joined Countryfile in 2011 and won praise for her calm attitude when she met Prince Charles on the show last year. Ellie Harrison first became interested in wildlife and conservation while studying geography at King's College University in London. She specialised in bio-geography and third world political ecology. Mrs Harrison travelled to Zimbabwe to complete her thesis on conservation development and elephant management. Ellie Harrison appeared in Nature's Miracle Orphans . While doing a temporary job as a secretary on Channel 5 she was chosen to present Milkshake, which she turned down, but eventually accepted a role to cover Michaela Strachan's maternity leave. She travelled across the world to film Michaela’s Wild Challenge, which was awarded a children's BAFTA in 2005. Mrs Harrison then became freelance, presenting a number of shows including working on the Discovery Channel in America. The geographer and ecologist has filmed segments for the One Show in 2006 and currently presents Countryfile, which she joined in 2011, and Wild British Winters. She is a regular on the Alan Titchmarsh show and regularly writes for Countryfile magazine. Earlier this year Mrs Harrison was made president of the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. She also appeared in a two-part series called Nature's Miracle Orphans for BBC One. Mrs Harrison grew up in the Cotswolds where her father grew the family's own fruit and vegetables. She has recently moved back to the area with her husband and their two young children. She has travelled across the world in her career, visiting Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Indonesia last year to film Britain's Big Wildlife Revival. She has also recently been appointed president of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. Mrs Harrison has previously spoken about her looks being a barrier to her career, with people presuming because she is attractive she will not be able to do her job properly. Miriam O'Reilly, a former presenter of Countryfile, won a case for age discrimination against the BBC after she was dropped from the show in 2008 . The journalist said: ‘It can get in the way of people thinking you’re credible, so I try and shrug it off. 'I’ve had people approach me – inside and outside TV – who are surprised I can string a sentence together.’ Mrs Harrison grew up outside in the Cotswolds and has two children with her husband Matt Goodman. She found her love of animals when she met a former boyfriend at university while she was studying geography. She managed to win a scholarship to travel to Zimbabwe to complete her thesis, and has worked in animal conservation across the world. This is not the first time the BBC has been under the spotlight for judging women by their looks and age, and Mrs Harrison was candid about being aware that her career in television could stop without much warning. In 2008 Miriam O'Reilly was dropped from the show and won a tribunal against the corporation three years later for age discrimination. Her case for sex discrimination failed. Miss O'Reilly was axed from the show, along with Juliet Morris and Michaela Strachan, when it moved to a prime time Sunday evening slot. She was given three years to return to the BBC but decided to leave in 2012 to launch a service for women facing discrimination in the workplace. Miss O'Reilly was replaced by Julia Bradbury, 43 and more than 10 years her junior.","Ellie Harrison is the presenter of BBC's Countryfile on Sunday evenings .

"Cooking fresh meals instead of letting children eat junk prolongs their life by up to 13 years, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver says . Parents who cook fresh meals to prevent their children reaching for junk food can prolong their  lives by up to 13 years, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has said. Mr Oliver said children are not programmed to reach for fatty and sugary snacks, and so it is a parent’s job to make healthy food appealing. He called for councils to ban junk food vendors near to schools, and said sugar should be taxed, with the money raised invested in food education. Mr Oliver’s call to arms comes after shocking figures released last week show one in ten children are obese when they start primary school at the age of four or five. The figures rises to one in five by the final year of primary school when they are ten or 11. Obese children are more likely to remain obese as adults, shoring up problems such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. They are also at greater risk of suffering bone and joint problems, sleep apnoea, stigma because of their weight and developing low self-esteem as a result. Experts today wholeheartedly agreed with Mr Oliver's comments, saying parents have a responsibility to help their children avoid obesity. Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Oliver said: ‘Kids are not born and programmed to pick up a nugget, or a burger. ‘So it’s our job to make salads, salsas, veg appealing and gorgeous. ‘If you can learn to cook you can save money and you will possibly put 11- 13 years on your children’s life. ‘Look at wholefoods, swap out regular pastas for whole wheat pastas. Get involved, have fun with food. He added: ‘While councils still allow many, many junk food vendors to be outside schools we will have a problem. ‘While sugar can get into so much things without being taxed, and that money being put back into food education, we will have a problem.’ Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation and National Obesity Forum told MailOnline Mr Oliver was 'absolutely right'. He said: ‘He’s bang on to call for fresh food rather than junk food. ‘We now know from very good research that the current activity of eating junk food as a young person is taking away eight years of life, and robs a person of 20 years of good health. ‘This is because you get so fat you acquire the problems associated with obesity.' He added: ‘Children respond automatically to sweetness. That’s why sugar is used by the food industry to catch children young and keep them for life. 'Its parents’ responsibility to keep high-sugar foods off the menu. That’s why putting out fresh fruit and vegetables is so important.’ Mr Oliver's comments come as world experts meet in London for a summit on obesity, to discuss the best way of tackling the health epidemic. Mr Oliver's call to arms comes after shocking figures released last week show one in five children are obese when they leave primary school at age 11 . Despite the known risks, official figures show nearly one in five children are obese when they leave primary school in the UK. They also revealed children from deprived areas of England are twice as likely to be obese as those living in more affluent parts of the country. The latest statistics for children aged 10 to 11 show that 24.7 per cent from low-income areas are obese, compared to 13.1 per cent in more affluent locations. While 9.5 per cent of four to five year olds are obese, that figure doubles to 19 per cent by the time children leave primary school. The data, published today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, relates to the 2013/14 school year. Eustace de Sousa, national lead for children, young people and families at Public Health England (PHE), described the figures - which are for children in state schools - as 'deeply concerning'. Overall, obesity costs the UK economy £47 billion a year, more than armed violence, war and terrorism, according to a study by consultants McKinsey and Company. Obesity has the second-largest economic impact on the UK, second only to smoking, they found. Children may be eating up to 70 teaspoons of sugar a day, a father warns. Worried about his children's sugar consumption, Richard Price kept a diary and calculated how much sugar his children ate over a seven-day period. He found his children, Jessica and James, ate a total of 1.39kg of sugar - 334 teaspoons - in a week. Richard Price pictured with Jess, eight, James, Six, and his wife Jennie. He kept a diary and calculated how much sugar his children ate over a seven-day period . They managed to eat the equivalent of a bag-and-a-half of sugar each, nearly twice the safe amount of sugar. 'Sugar is everywhere: from school dinners to snacks at after-school clubs and playdates,' he concluded. It is now known to be a major contributing factor to obesity, diabetes and cancer, and Government guidelines suggest children of  should not consume more than 60g daily. Some doctors have even  recommended intake should be halved to 30g a day — 210g a week.","Jamie Oliver said urgent action is needed to stop childhood obesity .

"A new GCSE in cooking and nutrition will be launched in a drive to boost the nation’s skills in the kitchen. Teenagers will be helped to ‘understand and enjoy British and international cuisines’ as well as learning how to develop their own recipes. The course will place a strong emphasis on practical cooking techniques in contrast to current food-related GCSEs which require candidates to complete tasks such as designing food packaging. Pupils will also learn about the scientific principles behind food and nutrition and how to cook healthily . Pupils will also learn about the scientific principles behind food and nutrition and how to cook healthily. The Government has already made cooking and food education compulsory for pupils aged five to 14 in a new national curriculum being implemented this term. The new course will cater mainly for 14 to 16-year-olds and aims to merge key content from the current three GCSEs which cover food or cooking. These are home economics, design and technology with food technology and hospitality and catering, which are expected to be discontinued. It will also include new content on the scientific knowledge underlying cooking and food preparation. The move follows a proposal from exams watchdog Ofqual for GCSEs which overlap to be phased out to maintain confidence in the system. Minister for School Reform Nick Gibb said: ‘At the heart of any food qualification should be a focus on developing practical cookery skills and a strong understanding of nutrition. ‘That’s why we’ve created the cooking and nutrition GCSE so that rather than designing food packaging, students will now learn the essentials of food science, nutrition and how to cook healthily. ‘This qualification will give young people the preparation they need to succeed in the food and hospitality industries as well as giving them vital life skills.’ Henry Dimbleby, said: ‘This qualification is another big step forward for food education in this country' The new GCSE aims to give pupils in-depth knowledge of nutrition, food choice, where food comes from as well as the ability to apply this knowledge when cooking. It could lead on to higher food-related qualifications including apprenticeships in the catering or food industries . The proposed content for the new GCSE was developed with input from experts including the authors of The School Food Plan. Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of Leon and co-author of the plan, said: ‘This qualification is another big step forward for food education in this country following the introduction of cooking as compulsory in the curriculum this term for all children up to the age of 14. ‘I particularly like the new emphasis on understanding and enjoying British and international cuisines and encouraging students to develop their own recipes. ‘It is a serious qualification that will be another step towards creating a healthier and happier society.’ Ministers also announced that design and technology GCSE will be revamped with input from experts such as those from the Dyson Foundation. It will have ‘cutting edge content and product design’ at its heart, the Department for Education said.","Teens will be helped to ‘understand and enjoy British and international cuisines’

"The North Sea may seem a surprising location to discover a woolly mammoth skeleton, but Dutch fossil hunters have hauled ancient bones from its depths. When the creature was alive 40,000 years ago, the now watery expanse was a low-lying stretch of icy tundra. The group of archaeologists, salvagers and palaeontologists trawled the waters off the east coast of Rotterdam at a depth of 100 feet (30 metres). Scroll down for video . Found! Dutch fossil hunters have pulled 40,000-year-old bones (pictured) from the depths of the North Sea to create a complete skeleton . Markus Broch, who works at North Sea Fossils - the firm that found the mammoth - told MailOnline that the sea there is relatively shallow and that bones are revealed by currents created by large ships entering the busy port. Employees of the company, based in Urk in the Netherlands, search for remains of extinct animals in the dark depths and in 2010 discovered bones belonging to an 11ft (3.4 metre) tall woolly mammoth. They collected its skull, tusks and other large bones, and filled in any missing ones with finds from similar beasts discovered nearby of a similar age, to form a complete skeleton after months of work. Salvagers collected the mammoth's skull (pictured left), tusks and other large bones from the bottom of North Sea, which 40,000 years ago would have been an icy tundra, connecting Britain to Europe (pictured right) Ice Age find: Carbon dating tests revealed that some of the bones belonged to a mammoth that roamed Doggerland - a former landmass in the southern North Sea that connected Great Britain to mainland Europe - around 40,000 years ago. Its impressive tusks are pictured . During the Ice Age, when mammoth roamed the Earth, lots of water that now makes up seas and oceans, was locked up in glaciers and huge sheets of ice, so sea levels were lower than they are today. The North Sea didn’t exist at all and the Thames was a tributary of the ancient German Rhine River, which ran down the middle of what is now the English Channel. A vast tundra stretched between Britain and Europe in an ancient landmass known as Doggerland. It looked a bit like northern Siberia, with green shoots poking though snow in winter, when it was cold and barren. To cope with such conditions, mammoths had six inches of fat and fur as long as three feet in places. They shared the land with bison and wolves, as well as other megafauna. In the spring, the ice melted a little, revealing rich pastures that attracted herds of grazing animals. Because of the low sea levels, antelope and ancient deer, for example, could migrate from what is now mainland Europe. 'It took a couple of trips. We started with the skull and then found little ones to replace those that were missing,' he explained. They also uncovered bones belonging to woolly rhinos and Irish elks, plus a prehistoric skull of a European bison, also known as a Wisent on the North Sea bed. Carbon dating tests revealed that some of the bones belonged to a mammoth that roamed Doggerland - a former landmass in the southern North Sea that connected Great Britain to mainland Europe - around 40,000 years ago. 'In the Ice Age, lots of water from the sea became great ice sheets and the land between the Netherlands and the UK was joined up, so megafauna could just walk around. 'When they died, their skeletons remained there so it's quite common to find extinct bones in the North Sea,' he explained. The mammoth would have eaten vegetation on the low-lying tundra. At the time of the last glacial maximum, 18,000 years ago, sea levels were 340ft (120 metres) lower than they are today. Mr Broch said it is 'extremely rare' to find mammoth skulls and large bones on the seabed. The place to be: The bones were pulled from the sea near the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands (mapped). Mr Broch explained that lots are found because large ships leaving and entering the bustling port disturb the sea bed, making bones easier to find . Roaming the tundra: The mammoth would have eaten vegetation on the low-lying tundra. The land mass altered according to climate changes from dry and icy to marsh. An illustration of the Ice Age giant is pictured . A rare discovery: Markus Broch, who works at North Sea Fossils, said it is 'extremely rare' to find a complete mammoth skeleton on the seabed. Here, amateur palaeontologist Klaas Post and mammoth expert Dick Mol examine bones collected on a boat trip in the North Sea . 'But it's quite common to find something. Most fishermen have found extinct bones [near Rotterdam] by dredging and they're more likely to find something than not,' he said. 'They often dump the bones back in the sea'. He explained that his fisherman father-in-law started collecting these bones at a young age and has amassed a large collection. Mr Broch said: ‘Most weeks we go to the fishing ports to meet the fishing vessels and buy the fossils they caught. A vast icy terrain: The area was a low-lying expanse of icy tundra when mammoths roamed the Earth, much like parts of SIberia today (pictured) Catch of the day: The salvagers managed to piece together the entire mammoth skeleton after initially discovering the skull (pictured) and tusks of the animal in 2010 . ‘Sometimes we charter a boat of our own and go for special “fossil hunting” expeditions. ‘Because we see so many fossils we work very closely with the leading experts in the field, such as Dick Mol, who is the world's leading authority on mammoths. ‘We have assembled a number of complete skeletons of mammoths, something very few companies in the world can do’. They have also found parts of sabre-toothed tigers, the skull of a woolly rhino and the cranium of a reindeer. Something to chew over: Mr Broch told MailOnline: 'Most fishermen have found extinct bones [near Rotterdam] by using dredging and they're more likely to find something than not,' before adding that discovering large mammoth bones are 'extremely rare.' Here, a salvager holds part of a mammoth's lower jaw . While Mr Broch told MailOnline that the mammoth is perhaps the team's most impressive discovery, they found a 'wonderful fragment of lower jawbone from a sabre-tooth tiger. 'It doesn't look like much, but then we had it carbon dated.' The bone is 20,000 years old, making it one of the youngest found in the area, causing experts to re-think when the creature became extinct in Europe. 'It proves the animal was there much longer than thought,' he said. 'It's not as impressive [looking] as the mammoth, but it's more scientifically interesting.' Large clean-up operation: The salvagers managed to piece together the entire mammoth skeleton after initially discovering the skull and tusks of the animal in 2010. Here, an expert cleans mammoth molars .

"Indian scientists have developed a new test to detect what your tongue indicates about a person's health. It can spot 14 different conditions . For those feeling under the weather, the old adage of 'stick your tongue out', may betray the signs of the illness by which they are afflicted. The tongue can signal signs of a cough, fever, jaundice, headache or bowel habits, and helps doctors make their diagnosis. A healthy tongue should be pink, clean and covered in papillae, which contain taste buds. But inflamed, red, black or white tongues could be a sign of other conditions such as thrush, while a swollen tongue can be a sign of an allergic reaction. Meanwhile a black, discoloured tongue is indicative of extended antibiotic use, or a fungal overgrowth in HIV patients, say Indian scientists. And long furrows on the surface are a sign of the sexually transmitted infection, syphilis. Ulcers should ring alarm bells, warning of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. And a 'beefy and smooth' tongue might reveal vitamin B12, iron or folate deficiency, and anemia. Moving on to more serious conditions, sores or lumps on the tongue - or unexplained bleeding - can be a sign of mouth cancer, warns Cancer Research UK. But for those living in remote parts of the world, where access to a doctor can be difficult, the simple act of checking a patient's tongue can prove hard. To combat the problem, scientists in India have now developed a new test. The new diagnostic system, reported in the International Journal of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, works to combine symptoms with a digital analysis of an image of the patient's tongue. Karthik Ramamurthy, from Rajalakshmi Engineering College in Chennai, and Siddharth Kulkarni and Rahul Deshpande of School of Electronics Engineering at VIT University, have developed the new software. The neural network can take 'soft inputs' - standard questions about symptoms - and a digital image of a patient's tongue to help  offer a likely diagnosis. It aims to help decide if a professional healthcare worker should be sought out for further advice. The digital images of the patient's tongue reveal discolouration, engorgement, texture, and other factors linked to various illnesses. The team's automated diagnosis, however, ultilises the condition of the tongue in combination with other symptoms, to identify whether a patient has a common cold, flu, bronchitis, stretptococcal throat infection, sinusitis, allergies, asthma, pulmonary edema, and food poisoning. In its current form the system allows diagnosis of 14 distinct conditions. But the team hope they can soon add images of patient's eyes to use as additional information, thus extending the system's repertoire significantly. A recent study has discovered that the tongues of some people who snore are extra large. It's already well-known that being overweight or obese increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which leads to snoring because the airway becomes blocked. Until now, it was thought that a large neck was to blame. Now, however scientists say piling on the pounds can also cause a fat tongue - which may well be the culprit. U.S. researchers found that obese people with OSA had a higher percentage of tongue fat - especially at the base of their tongues - which made their tongues larger overall. A recent study, published in the journal Sleep, found the tongues of people who snore are extra large . This was compared with obese people who didn't suffer from the sleep condition. Increased tongue fat might prevent the tongue's muscles from positioning the tongue away from the airway, causing snoring because the airway becomes blocked, researchers said. They added the study might provide an explanation for the link between obesity and sleep apnoea - and said screening to identify fat tongues may could help diagnose the condition. It's known that obesity is a major cause of obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition where the throat closes repeatedly during the night. Snoring occurs because the airways become narrowed, or even completely blocked, preventing the body from getting enough oxygen. In severe cases, the brain jolts the body awake, causing the airway to reopen. The person may wake up repeatedly without knowing it, increasing their heart rate and blood pressure and preventing deep sleep. Dr. Richard J. Schwab, of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in the U.S. said: 'This is the first study to show that fat deposits are increased in the tongue of obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea.' Dr Timothy Morgenthaler, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine said doctors should look at tongue size when screening for OSA. He said: 'Tongue size is one of the physical features that should be evaluated by a physician when screening obese patients to determine their risk for obstructive sleep apnoea. 'Effective identification and treatment of sleep apnoea is essential to optimally manage other conditions associated with this chronic disease, including high blood pressure, heart disease, tType 2 diabetes, stroke and depression.' The study was published in the journal Sleep.","Scientists in India have developed a new test to spot 14 conditions .

"New Manchester City signing Fernando hopes to establish himself as one of the club's greats - and would love the chance to play alongside Yaya Toure. The Brazilian joined the Barclays Premier League champions from Porto for £12million last month, increasing a pool of midfield players that includes the influential Toure, compatriot Fernandinho and Javi Garcia. Toure's future at the Etihad Stadium has been the subject of much speculation over the summer but 26-year-old Fernando is keen to play alongside the dynamic Ivorian. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Fernando's skills and tricks for Porto . Ambition: New Manchester City signing Fernando want to become one of the club's greats . Fernando told the club's website, www.mcfc.co.uk: 'City are known all over the world, football players are aware of Manchester City. 'It is a dream to be here and to be part of this great club. I also hope to become one of the club's great players. 'We know they are players with a lot of qualities - it won't be easy to get into that midfield, but with a lot of work, and I know how to give myself to work, every day I will give my best in order to have a chance to make a contribution to the team. 'The player I admire the most and I watch many of his games is Yaya Toure, he is a great player and it will be an honour to play alongside him.' Fernando was previously linked with City in January but a deal failed to materialise before the transfer deadline. Even this summer, Fernando concedes the deal was far from straightforward. Patient: Fernando had been linked with a move to City in January but had to wait . He said: 'It was a very difficult transfer, we had to face a lot of challenges in order to be here today but, thanks to God, everything went well and I am here to help Manchester City in the best way possible.' Asked what convinced him City was the right move, he added: 'The club itself. 'Also it is a very strong league, it is one of the best in the world; the players in this club are the best players in the world. 'So, all good reasons to be part of it and so I am here now.' General: The 26-year-old will wear the No 6 shirt for his new club . Fernando, who will wear the number six shirt at City, feels he made his mark at Porto and hopes to continue in much the same vein at City. He said: 'I left a good legacy at Porto. I hope I can repeat that at City, winning titles, playing regularly. 'That's what everyone can expect from me, willpower and dedication, always with the eyes on trophies, that's what City and I want.' Fernando earned the nickname of 'Octopus' at Porto, because he seemed to be everywhere and have a lot of legs, but another one, likening him to American president Barack Obama has also emerged lately. He said: 'The nickname is a bit complicated. I saw the photo and we have some resemblances, but it's better to call me Fernando!'

"Online shopping has grown to such an extent that for the first time it now accounts for almost one third of household purchases, apart from groceries. One in three home appliances, items of clothing and furniture are bought using the internet, according to research by the British Retail Consortium. Overall, more than £1 in every £5 of all non-food spending is now being done online. Scroll down for video . Pizzas could soon carry the government 5 a day logo under plans considered by Public Health England . The latest growth, a 12 per cent rise on last year, was revealed in statistics for last month, including Black Friday – November 28 – when £810million was spent online in a single day. The astonishing demand left many websites unable to cope, with the result that shoppers suffered ‘screen freeze’ and some retailers are still struggling to make deliveries. Customers at Marks & Spencer face a wait of ten days to get their purchases, while Tesco has suffered delays in its click-and-collect service, and the online fashion chain ASOS has suspended a large part of its next day delivery system. Further pressure was put on delivery services yesterday with websites expecting a further shopping binge on what is known in the industry as ‘Manic Monday’. The deals offered online by specialist web stores such as Amazon as well as high street giants including Tesco, Asda, M&S, John Lewis, Currys PC World and the big department stores have triggered an unprecedented spending splurge. All types of fruit and vegetables, fresh, frozen, canned, dried, or pure juices (fruit, vegetable or smoothie), including those within composite foods, count towards the five or more daily portions. A portion is generally taken to be 80g (or equivalent if dried or a concentrated puree) or 150ml of 100 per cent pure fruit juice. Certain criteria that apply to the logo scheme do not necessarily apply to the five-a-day health promotion message. Although a particular food would not necessarily be able to carry a 5 a day logo, if it contains a sufficient amount of fruit or vegetables it would count towards an individual's intake as consumed. For example, currently a vegetarian chilli ready meal would not be able to apply for a 5 a day logo as it is a composite food. However, an individual consuming this would be able to count the vegetable content as contributing to their own five-a-day. The £810million figure for internet sales on Black Friday was almost 50 per cent higher than expected by the industry. The BRC director general, Helen Dickinson, said: ‘This month brings fantastic news for retailers who have worked hard on their online presence, as the online penetration rate of non-food sales is at an all-time record. ‘Every £1 in £5 of non-food purchases is spent online. Online sales are also contributing a larger proportion of growth to non-food sales compared to in-store. ‘Black Friday was the retail event of the month and retailers offered consumers impressive discounts both online and in-store. The high volume traffic to websites meant that consumers also bought a large amount of full priced items and not just those on sale. ‘Online sales growth was good for the month but there may have been a distortion caused by Black Friday with consumers delaying purchases until the end of the month in the hope of grabbing some bargains.’ The BRC ranks retail sectors in terms of their annual growth. Health and beauty products saw the biggest increase in sales, ahead of household appliances, particularly flat screen TVs. The BRC said: ‘There were widespread discounts for Black Friday, with particularly aggressive deals among fashion retailers, who used the opportunity to lower their stocks after the unseasonably warm autumn quarter we’ve just seen. A panel of experts from Public Health England (PHE) has discussed the idea of expanding the logo to include 'composite' foods, which contain at least one portion of fruit and vegetables . ‘Household appliances – for its first appearance in the monitor – moved straight to second position and finished the month on a very strong note, thanks to Black Friday.’ Based on 300g cheese and tomato pizza . Thick crust - 836 calories . 8.5g of sugar . Total fat - 31.5g . Saturated fat - 15.5g . Salt - 3.3g . David McCorquodale, the head of retail at KPMG, said: ‘Online orders reached record breaking penetration levels this November, as shoppers snapped up a bargain in the Black Friday sales. ‘However, retailers’ online systems have been tested and some have been found wanting. ‘The sheer weight of consumer demand caused some websites to buckle under the pressure and these retailers need to sort this capacity issue out and quickly or face losing sales to competitors with more robust systems. ‘Online sales will help to drive growth for retailers this Christmas and are a crucial element of their overall strategy.’ He added: ‘After years of slow growth this Christmas could be a cracker for the retail sector, with sales surpassing last year’s levels. Online sales will be launched as early as Christmas Day and shoppers will be able to pick up a bargain while tucking into their turkey.’","Public Health England considering extending government's 5 a day logo .

"Across the Arctic region 700 years ago, the last of the Paleo-Eskimos disappeared, ultimately being replaced by ancestors of the modern-day Inuit and Eskimo cultures. Exactly what happened to this group of people, known as the Dorset culture, has remained a mystery. But now extensive research suggests this remaining group may have been wiped out due to a combination of inbreeding and climate change, ultimately perishing in isolation while the other groups lived on. Research led by the University of Copenhagen provides new theories as to how the first inhabitants of the Arctic disappeared 700 years ago, which coincided with descendants of modern-day Inuits and Eskimos arriving (stock image shown). Their extinction is shrouded in mystery, as they vanished in mere decades . The research, headed by the Centre for Geogenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, was published in the journal Science. The North American Arctic was one of the last major regions to be settled by modern humans. This happened when people crossed the Bering Strait from Siberia and wandered into a new world. While the area has long been well researched by archaeologists, little is known of its genetic prehistory. In this study, researchers showed that the Paleo-Eskimo, who lived in the Arctic from about 5,000 years ago until about 700 years ago, represented a distinct wave of migration, separate from both Native Americans - who crossed the Bering Strait much earlier - and the Inuit, who came from Siberia to the Arctic several thousand years after the Paleo-Eskimos. The genetic studies show that the Paleo-Eskimos - representing one single group - were the first people in the Arctic, and they survived without outside contact for over 4,000 years. But, after surviving in near-isolation in the harsh Arctic environment for more than 4,000 years, they disappeared around 700 years ago - about the same time when the ancestors of modern-day Inuit spread eastward from Alaska. The genetic study, which involved more than 150 human remains, claims that Paleo-Eskimos were the first people in the Arctic - and they survived without outside contact for more than 4,000 years. However the arrival of the ancestors of modern-day Inuits, around 1500 AD, is said to have forced the Paleo-Eskimos into a mass-migration that ultimately led to their demise in just a matter of decades . In the research they obtained 26 genome-wide sequences and 169 mitochondrial DNA sequences from ancient human bone, teeth, and hair samples from Arctic Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland. They also examined genomes of two present-day Greenlandic Inuit, two Siberian Nivkhs, one Aleutian Islander, and two Athabascan Native Americans. Twenty-seven ancient samples were then radiocarbon dated for accurate cultural assignment. The research rejects previous theories that Paleo-Eskimos were descendants of native Americans. The conclusion is that their disappearance was not due to them being assimilated into other cultures like the Thule people, who arrived at the Arctic later. In the research they obtained 26 genome-wide sequences and 169 mitochondrial DNA sequences from ancient human bone, teeth, and hair samples from Arctic Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland. Pictured are Greenlandic Inuits from the 1930s in their traditional boats (umiaq), used for hunting and transportation . But while some conclusions can be ruled out, the exact cause of their extinction remains somewhat shrouded in mystery. According to Joshua Krisch of the New York Times, one of the reasons for their disappearance could have been inbreeding. 'Certainly they survived for almost 5,000 years, so they weren't completely destroyed by inbreeding,' Dr Eske Willerslev, who led the study, told the New York Times. 'But it causes a number of medical problems, and I wouldn't be surprised if that had an effect on them.' And Dr Todd Disotell, a professor of anthropology at New York University, added that the harsh tundra life coupled with the effects of climate change, namely dwindling food sources as the temperature shifted, would have contributed to their extinction. 'When you're dealing with sea ice, just a few degrees can be transformative,' Dr. Disotell said. 'Three bad winters in a row where you can't hunt seals, and you're in trouble.' The extinction of Paleo-Eskimos in mere decades is a mystery. It's thought they may have been driven out by technologically superior people. Their food sources may also have dwindled as temperatures changed due to climate change. Pictured is a researcher looking for ancient human remains in northern Greenland . However there is still more research to be done into their disappearance. The study was unable to establish why the extinction of the Paleo-Eskimos coincided with the ancestors of the Inuit beginning to colonise the Arctic. It’s widely believed that the Inuit ancestors - who crossed the Bering Strait about 1,000 years ago and reached Greenland around 700 years ago - were technologically superior to the Paleo-Eskimos, which may have led to them being driven out. The Inuit's own myths tell stories of a people before them, which likely refer to the Paleo-Eskimos. In the myths, they are referred to as the 'Tunit' or 'Sivullirmiut', which means ‘the first inhabitants’. According to these myths they were giants, who were taller and stronger than the Inuit, but easily frightened from their settlements by the newcomers. Genetic studies show that the Paleo-Eskimos were the first people in the Arctic, and they survived without outside contact for over 4,000 years. But, after surviving in near-isolation for so long, they disappeared around 700 years ago. Pictured is a site of the Dorset culture, the last of the Paleo-Eskimos . ‘Ever since the discovery of a Paleo-Eskimo culture in the North American Arctic in 1925, archaeologists have been mystified by their relationship with the Thule culture ancestors of the modern Inuit,’ said co-author Dr William Fitzhugh from the Arctic Studies Centre at the Smithsonian Institution. ‘Paleo-Eskimo culture was replaced rapidly around 1300 and 1400 AD, their only traces being references to 'Tunit' in Inuit mythology and adoption of some elements of Dorset technology. ‘This new genomic research settles outstanding issues in Arctic archaeology that have been debated for nearly a century, finding that Paleo-Eskimo and Neo-Eskimo people were genetically distinct, with separate origins in Eastern Siberia, and the Paleo-Eskimo remained isolated in the Eastern Arctic for thousands of years with no significant mixing with each other or with American Indians, Norse, or other Europeans,’ continued Dr Fitzhugh. The lack of inbreeding with other species is surprising, as many species of human have been known to mingle in this way in the past. In fact, it is thought that Neanderthals were gradually phased out through breeding with modern humans. 'Elsewhere, as soon as people meet each other, they have sex,' Willerslev told National Geographic. 'Even potentially different species like Neanderthals [and modern humans] had sex, so this finding is extremely surprising.'","Research led by the University of Copenhagen provides new theories as to the disappearance of Paleo-Eskimos .

"Tennis ace Roger Federer is set to move into a £6.5million glass mansion in a Swiss tax-haven on the shores of Lake Zurich. Federer and his family are set to move in to the state-of-the-art three-storey building at the end of the year, and are believed to be joined by his parents Robert and Lynette, who could be the new residents in the two luxury apartments being build in addition to the main home. The building, called The Residence, is located in Wollerau in Schwyz county, and comes with  floor-to-ceiling windows, a swimming pool and large balconies with magnificent views stretching across Lake Zurich. Scroll down for video . Almost ready: Tennis player Roger Federer is building a £6.5million 'glass home' on the hills overlooking Lake Zurich . Here's looking at you: The house, called 'The Residence' is in Wollerau, Schwyz county, and has floor-to-ceiling glass windows throughout . Federer, 33, moved from his birthplace of Basel to the 'tax paradise' of Wollerau in March 2008, one year before marrying Slovakian-born Mirka, 36. Located about 20 minutes drive from Zurich, and an hour from Basel, Wollerau is one of the lowest tax municipalities in Europe and the liberal tax structure has attracted other multi-millionaires. Formula One drivers Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa and the former UBS chairman Marcel Ospel have all chosen to live in the canton. Federer's new glass-walled home, being built on a plot of about 1.5 acres with underground parking, is believed to be worth £6.5million. The  500sq.m property will have plenty of room  for Federer, Mirka  and their two sets of twins – five-year-old girls Myla and Charlene and boys Leo and Lenny, born last May. 30–love: Roger Federer and former tennis player wife Mirka, pictured left and right in 2009, when Mirka was pregnant with their oldest set of twins, met when they were both representing Switzerland in the 2000 Olympics and married in April 2009 . Decent view: A computer-generated image shows what appears to be the Federers' en-suite master bedroom . Space to chill: Wollerau, located about 20 minutes from Zurich, is considered a 'tax haven' and is one of the lowest tax municipalities in Europe . Due to the location on the hillside and the property overlooking the water, there will be no insight into the home, despite the glass walls . Federer famously likes to take his whole brood on the road, and brought both sets of twins to Wimbledon this year, despiter Leo and Lenny being just a few weeks old. He said at a press conference after his sons were born that taking them all on the road is hard work but worth it. 'My wife does a lot of work, as much as she can. And I try to help as much as I can,' he explained. 'We have the grandparents as well and all my team members, they sometimes just tag along. Clearly we also need some help on the road, so Mirka can have an opportunity sometimes to sleep in a little bit, or come to watch one of my matches. 'You need to be well organised, but by now we know how it works. I am looking forward to life on the tour with the family, and it will be a long time without any travelling after the tennis is over. So I'm looking forward to the next couple of years now.' Scores of builders have been working to get the impressive structure completed this year, described as 'prestigious, contemporary architecture with extensive glazing,' by the developer, Kamata Development. The additional flats are believed to be for Federer's parents Robert and Lynette, pictured here with Mirka and the couple's oldest daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, during the 2012 Wimbledon tournament .

"One Manchester club has spent a shed load of money trying to keep up with their local rivals - and it is strange to think that it is United splashing the cash. Last season they finished 22 points adrift of Premier League champions Manchester City and Louis van Gaal was brought in (and given a healthy amount to spend) to ensure this did not happen again. Very noisy neighbours City are just as able to have another delve into the market place, of course, and turn the new order into a familiar one. Manchester United  can get to within five points of Manchester City with a win at Southampton on Monday .

Van Gaal's team are on a good run of form with four straight wins and just one defeat in nine matches. Perhaps 'just' is not the right word. Losing 1-0 to their inter-city rivals will rankle more than any other loss to most fans. Yet the fact of the matter is that United are continuing to play catch-up with City, who in turn are hanging on to the coat tails of Chelsea. The unthinkable could happen. United may well finish below City for a second successive season and that has not happened since Boney M topped the charts with Rivers of Babylon. In other words, May 1978. United have been the undisputed kings of Manchester pretty much ever since. Even when City won the Premier League in 2012, it went to the wire with only goal difference separating the clubs. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure runs off to celebrate scoring his side's winner against Everton . United goalkeeper Alex Stepney (left) tussles with City's Brian Kidd at Old Trafford in March, 1977 . Premier League table . That all changed with the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Since the wily Scot called it a day in May 2013, United have spent £215m on new players. David Moyes has come and gone and, in his place, Dutchman van Gaal is beginning to make his mark at Old Trafford. Last summer saw the arrival of the likes of Angel di Maria (£60m), Luke Shaw (£27m), Marcos Rojo (£16m), Ander Herrera (£29m) and Daley Blind (£13.8m). Radamel Falcao was signed on a £6m loan. Quality players all, even though not all of them have hit the heights on a regular basis yet. Di Maria is now injured, as well, which makes it even harder for United to make in-roads on their close rivals. Van Gaal is still dissatisfied and could step up the hunt for a world-class central defender, whether in January or in summer. Striker Falcao is not regarded as fit enough to spearhead United's attack for 90 minutes, which means an over-reliance on Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney so that may also be a position which needs further strengthening. Look at the Premier League goals tally, and that says everything. Rooney has five, Juan Mata and RVP have scored four while Di Maria has chipped in with three – and we are in December. United's best hope may be that Manuel Pellegrini is set to be without Sergio Aguero for the busy Christmas period. The Argentine's dodgy knee could be a blessing down the road. Wayne Rooney (right) breaks away from Toure during City's 1-0 win against United at the Etihad in November . Radamel Falcao, Ander Herrera and Juan Mata (left to right) have all arrived at Old Trafford in the last year . Each time United added to their squad, the danger is that City can also recruit big. They were almost modest in their spending last summer, although Frenchman Eliaquim Mangala did cost £32m from Porto. The young defender was one of the hottest properties in Europe last season and once upon a time might have been the sort of player United could have tempted without a problem. Sadly for Van Gaal, he cannot even offer Champions League football as an incentive. When Ferguson retired, the general consensus was that the squad required an overhaul simply to stay in the same place. Treading water is no good, however, when all around are swimming furiously. Chelsea have set the benchmark this season, followed closely by City. City forward Sergio Aguero could miss a month of action after injuring his knee against Everton on Saturday .

The position has improved this year. United are making a fight of it, at least, despite a huge injury list which has decimated them of defenders and meant the likes of Ashley Young playing in defence.

"Video has emerged showing the moment a woman was rescued from an 18ins gap after she fell between two buildings. She had to be pulled 25ft up the building by 30 firefighters after getting stuck while leaping across the roofs of buildings in Santa Ana, Orange County, last night. It is not known why the 28-year-old woman was jumping across the rooftops of the commercial buildings, but she was taken to hospital to be treated for scrapes to her arms and legs.

"A Kansas airman accused of aggravated assault for exposing multiple sex partners to HIV at swinger parties in Wichita will have his appeal heard this week before the nation's highest military court. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will take up on Tuesday in the case against David Gutierrez, an appeal the defense contends could upend similar prosecutions in the U.S. military. 'This case will have the potential of decriminalizing sexual contact with someone with HIV,' defense attorney Kevin McDermott said. Landmark appeal: Wichita airman David Gutierrez, who was jailed for eight years for failing to tell sexual partners he has HIV, will testify that medical advances in HIV treatment mean the laws are outdated . Air Force prosecutors have declined comment. Gutierrez was a sergeant at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank and sentenced to eight years behind bars. In addition aggravated assault, Gutierrez also was found guilty of violating an order to notify partners about his HIV status and to use condoms. He was also convicted of indecent acts and adultery. He has not been accused of actually infecting anyone with HIV. In his appeal, Gutierrez has challenged whether the risk to his sexual partners was high enough to constitute aggravated assault, arguing that laws covering exposure to the disease are outdated since the statistical probability of heterosexual transmission is low and medical advances have made the disease treatable. 'About 100 years ago we used to have a lot of laws on the books that threw people in prison for having syphilis because you couldn't cure it. Once they came up with a cure a lot of those laws went along the wayside,' McDermott said. The risk of infection by an HIV-positive man during sexual intercourse with a woman varies widely, and each side in the case is citing the statistic within that range that is most favorable to their argument. Defense lawyers say the risk of infection ranged from a 1-in-10,000 to 1-in-100,000 chance per sexual encounter, which they contend is so low that it doesn't meet the legal standard for assault. Gutierrez was a sergeant at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita in 2011 when he was stripped of his rank and sentenced to eight years behind bars . Prosecutors, however, counter that the exposure risk was closer to 1 in 500. 'A 1-in-500 chance of receiving a deadly, incurable disease is not merely fanciful, speculative, or remote possibility. It is a real possibility,"" they wrote. 'That real possibility of harm, when balanced with the magnitude of harm, certain death, provides more than enough justification to hold (Gutierrez) criminally liable here.' Government lawyers argued at trial that Gutierrez played Russian roulette with his sexual partners' lives and several people who had sex with Gutierrez and his wife testified that they would not have done so if they had known he was HIV-positive. The government is playing up that testimony on appeal. The case could have a broad sweep, since defense attorneys in a similar case winding through the Army appeals process have gotten involved with a rare friend-of-court filing. In that brief, defense lawyers said an 'epidemic of fear' pervaded the nation in the in the mid-1980s, when many of the applicable laws were written. They said that panic led to an expansion of criminal liability, and they urged the military appellate court to see HIV as a treatable condition. As of early this year, there had been more than 900 arrests or prosecutions in at least 38 states and the military of HIV-positive people accused of exposing others to the disease, according to the Global Network of People Living with HIV. Defense lawyers also say Gutierrez shouldn't have been convicted of adultery since he and his wife participated in group sex. They also contend that their client's due process rights have been violated by a long appeals process. Gutierrez's wife Gina told investigators her husband became infected with HIV in 2007 while stationed at Aviano Air Base, Italy. It is understood that many of Gutierrez’s alleged victims were met through adult websites and at ‘swingers’ parties, with a police search warrant suggesting he attended 21 such events in 18 months. Two women listed within court documents claimed to have chatted with him on swinging websites. Both allege he did not inform them of his HIV before engaging in both oral sex and sexual intercourse. In his appeal, Gutierrez has challenged whether the risk to his sexual partners was high enough to constitute aggravated assault . One alleged victim said she first met Gutierrez at a swingers party before performing a sex act on him. She also claimed that he took photos and videos of every sexual encounter. The other complainant claimed she engaged in sexual activity at Gutierrez's home during over a Thanksgiving holiday. Court records also claim that a large collection of pornographic videos were seized from his home as well as sex toys and other items. He was also reported to have posted a survey on a swingers website in 2007 asking whether respondents were willing to 'play' with partners infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) or HIV. And in a follow-up post, he allegedly asked: 'Why are people scared of the HIV virus, don’t you wear condoms to protect yourself from HSV?' One  woman to testify in his trial said that she and her husband had sex with both Gutierrez and his wife Gina after meeting them at a swingers party. The woman said: 'My husband and I asked point blank, because we were clean. And David and his wife said no. They made a point to tell us they were both clean.' Another woman, when asked whether she would have still have had sex with Gutierrez knowing his HIV status, said: 'No, because I watched a brother die from Aids.' The women, whose names have not been released, have not tested positive for HIV. Investigators previously recovered a cell phone, camera equipment and three laptop computers from his home. One of the women testified that she had asked Gutierrez about whether he was HIV positive and he denied that he was positive. The victim said she believed him, saying: 'He's Air Force. They have integrity. I trusted him.' Gutierrez graduated from a high school in New Mexico before joining the Air Force. On his Facebook wall, he described his philosophy as 'Do unto others as they would do unto you'.","The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces will take up on Tuesday in the case against David Gutierrez .

"British viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of Saturday's game due to broadcasting regulations. Real Madrid welcome bitter rivals Barcelona to the Bernabeu on Saturday evening in the first El Clasico of the La Liga season. The clash brings together the two best players in the world, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who between them have won the last six Ballon d'Or awards. Here, Sportsmail's columnists and reporters reveal which of the two they consider to be the best. JAMIE REDKNAPP . Messi. This has to be one of the hardest questions anyone has ever asked me! I was lucky enough to work on both the Barcelona and Real Madrid games this week and both players were so good. I took my son, who is a big Liverpool fan, to Anfield just to watch Cristiano Ronaldo. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch players of their quality so whenever you get the chance you have to go and watch what they do. They are both so different but so good in their own right. It’s like trying to compare Bentleys and Ferraris! Cristiano Ronaldo delivered another masterclass this week as Real Madrid crushed Liverpool at Anfield . Ronaldo scored twice against Brendan Rodgers' side to take his goal tally for the season to  a staggering 21 . Ronaldo (centre) trains with Sergio Ramos (left) and Luka Modric the day before El Clasico . When Messi was at his best two or three years ago, Ronaldo wasn’t at the level he is at now. Since then he has got better and better and there’s no doubt he’s now eclipsed Messi. At the World Cup Messi walked more than he ran and I wondered if this truly would be Ronaldo’s time, but against Ajax on Tuesday I sensed a change. Some of that Messi movement and intensity was back and I hope he stays fit. It would be fantastic to have a true shoot out between the two where we can all have front row seats. I honestly think Lionel Messi is the greatest footballer I have ever seen in my lifetime – it’s impossible to compare players across eras – and if you asked me whose ability I’d rather have, I’d probably say Messi. Some of the things he did at his peak were pieces of absolute genius. But what is definitely true is that at the moment, Messi and Ronaldo are playing a different game to everyone else. Lionel Messi had his best season to date in 2011-12 when he scored 73 goals in 60 games for Barcelona . MARTIN KEOWN . Messi. In every other era there’s only ever been one great player at a time – Pele, Cruyff, Maradona, Zidane. There have always been good players but they were the solo stand-out players. Now we’ve got two of them. That almost makes them better because they are competing directly against each other for goals. They are both match-winners and exceptional players, but I do have a favourite. When you look at Ronaldo, his numbers and goals are phenomenal. But you look at his skill set and it is something that can be developed. You have seen his pace, energy, strength in the air and his power all increase. His technique has improved and there has been a noticeable development. Of course he is incredible, but he has made himself the player he is. Messi showed he is returning to something like his best form as he helped Barcelona to victory over Ajax . With Messi, it’s like he has a God-given talent. You look at videos of him as a kid and he’s doing all the same things as he is now – beating five or six players and curling it in the corner. There’s also something eye-pleasing about left-footed players. You saw it with Maradona and you see it with Messi. I love the way he runs around the ball to pass it into the corner. They are both exceptional players but I just prefer watching Messi. GRAEME SOUNESS . Messi. For me, and I've said it for a few years, Lionel Messi is the best player I have ever seen play. I know he's had a quiet 12 months by his own standards, but he edges it for me. We're blessed with Ronaldo and Messi being of the same generation, that they're both around at the same time. This is a golden period. These players don't come along every generation. There's not a lot between them. They both get you on the edge of your seat every time they get the ball, both create goals and both score goals. I don't buy it that they have to win a World Cup or a European Championship to be considered great players. That's just a title. They make the best defenders in the world look ordinary time and time again. Messi has won three Champions League trophies with Barcelona, the last of which came in 2011 (left) Ronaldo celebrates after helping Madrid win the Champions League against rivals Atletico in May . Ronaldo shows off his boots ahead of the weekend . LEE CLAYTON . Ronaldo. Power, pace, edge-of-the-seat adrenaline, football box office. He’s George Best, without the benders. Messi is a beautiful footballer, with balance and mesmerising dribbling skills… but he’s the second best footballer in the world. I like the edge between them, too. It makes for ‘anything you can do, I can do better’ football at its finest. Roll on the Clasico. MATT LAWTON . Messi. It's difficult to ignore Ronaldo, especially when even Roy Keane can't fault him. He considers him the ultimate professional as well as the ultimate player. But I think Messi does things with just that little bit more finesse. The way he strikes the ball for instance. It's just that tad more pleasing on the eye. I also like Messi's modesty on and off the field. He's more understated than Ronaldo, which again I prefer. DOMINIC KING . Messi. This is not saying one is better than the other, as I don’t believe it is right to compare. They are two of the greatest footballers to have ever played the game and should be duly appreciated and enjoyed. At Anfield on Wednesday, Ronaldo was so good he earned a standing ovation from the Kop. But let’s not forget what Messi has done in recent years. He is, in a word, a genius. SAMI MOKBEL . Messi. Best player of a generation bar none. Ronaldo is the epitome of sports entertainment. Good-looking, honed physique (Adel Taarabt take note); a sports marketer's dream. Messi, though, is about one thing: football - only football. There's that viral of Ronaldo and Messi sitting at the Balon d'Or bash, with the Portuguese flanked by both his and Messi's girlfriends and the Argentine sitting on his lonesome. Ronaldo gets the girls. Messi gets the crown of the world's best footballer. This Photoshop image of Ronaldo with both his and Messi's girlfriends mocked the difference between the two . Ronaldo is a sports marketer's dream with his honed physique and modelling contracts . VIDEO Barcelona next on Ronaldo's hit-list . ROB DRAPER . Messi. One-on-one there is no-one in the world as good as Messi, not even Ronaldo. The sheer range of his ability to beat a man from a standing start is what puts him apart. Yes, Ronaldo can head better and is stronger. But in terms of doing something special with a football, no-one is more mesmerising than Messi. JOE BERNSTEIN . Messi. Ronaldo has an extra ingredient to all the other football all-time greats, he is as lethal in the air as he is on the ground, making him impossible to stop. But if you are talking preferences, I think Messi is an inspirational figure because of his size - or lack of it. One of the reasons football is the world game is because anyone can play from five foot nothing upwards. To be idolised through pure skill rather than power or celebrity lifestyle in this day and age is amazing. So it's Messi for me - just. Ronaldo is great, too! MATT BARLOW . Messi. Maybe not quite at the heights he was a couple of years ago but still the most outrageously gifted footballer of the generation. What a delight it is to see him perform. Messi is for wit, artistry and imagination against pace, muscle and power. Who doesn’t warm to the idea of the scruffy short kids embarrassing the big lumbering oafs with their magical skills? He offers hope and a reminder that football’s soul resides in the streets not the gym or the lab, and that it is about the playing for pleasure not posing for fame. Messi shares a joke with his Barcelona team-mates in training as they prepare for El Clasico . Messi with former Manchester United defender Gerard Pique ahead of Barcelona's trip to the Bernabeu . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI . Messi. He lacks the incredible athleticism of Ronaldo and likewise can't do nearly as much in the air. By all accounts, Ronaldo is the more complete player. But, for the same reasons I favour Roger Federer over Rafael Nadal, despite Federer's vastly inferior head-to-head record, it is because of the elegance of how Messi plays. Ronaldo is magnificent and fast and a brutally effective goalscorer; Messi, at his best, is just as effective and looks better doing it. For me, there is nothing more stunning in football than a player slaloming through a crowd and dinking the keeper. That is what Messi does (did?) better than anyone. They are, in my opinion, the best two players of my lifetime and the little man stands a hair taller than Ronaldo. CRAIG HOPE . Ronaldo To call him 'ruthlessly efficient' is a disservice - he is beautifully and brilliantly efficient, redefining how we evaluate football numbers. Wayne Rooney take note: here is a guy with equal talent who has dedicated his life to maximising that ability, stretching the limit of his body and mind. Messi, of course, is incredible, but Ronaldo shades it for his unrelenting genius and hunger to be the very best, season on season. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Confusion surrounds the death of a six-year-old Chicago boy who was fatally shot in the head on Friday while watching cartoons at home. Michael Cattron III, who lost his mother and uncle to gun violence in the city earlier this year, died after his father left him and his cousins watching television while he stepped outside to smoke. According to the call made to the 911 dispatcher, Cattron's father heard a 'pop' and rushed back inside to find his son lying in a pool of blood on the floor. Scroll Down for Video . Death: Police believe that Michael Cattron III accidentally shot himself dead on Friday at his father's home . Police have said that they are trying to establish whether Cattron shot himself in the head or if one of his relatives fired the shot. Police are currently investigating how the gun came to be in the possession of children but have said that they believe the shooting was accidental. Indeed, this is just the latest tragedy for the  family. Michael's mother, Jasmine Curry, was shot dead while pregnant driving in her car over the summer. The 25-year-old mother of five died after a male driver opened fire on her van in July. Friends believe she was not the intended target. 'It's disgusting, it's sad, and all I keep thinking about is her babies,' said Liz McElroy, a friend of the victim to ABC 7. The boy's grandfather, Pierre Curry, was distraught at the news. 'It feels like I'm floating,' said Pierre Curry to the Chicago Tribune. 'I have to take deep, deep breaths. I just can't believe it.' Shot: Michael Cattron was found dead by his father after he either shot himself dead or was shot by one of his relatives . Death: Jasmine Curry was shot dead in Chicago in July while she was driving through the city with a friend . Devastated: Pierre Curry said that he was distraught at the news his six-year-old grandson had passed away from a gunshot wound . Admitting that everyone was 'fuzzy' about the circumstances surrounding the boy's death, Curry said that all he knew for certain was that his son stepped outside for a cigarette. 'He heard a popping sound, a boom. One boom,' said Curry to the Chicago Tribune. 'He came inside and saw him lying in front of the TV.' According to his grandmother, Latonia Mardis, the boy accidentally shot himself dead. 'Michael went into a room, went through some boxes, found a gun, and shot [himself] in the head,' said Mardis, according to the Inquisitr. Lost: Michael was a popular student and was watching cartoons with his relatives before his fatal shooting on Friday . 'Now, he's dead. It's too much death in the family, killing. It's just terrible out here.' Another of Pierre Curry's sons was shot dead in August 2013 aged 17 while his third child died after an illness, aged 20. 'He loved everybody, he was happy. He liked to joke like his momma. It's a tragedy,' said Michael's grandmother, 43-year-old Latonia Mardis to the Chicago Tribune.","Michael Cattron died on Saturday afternoon after Friday evening shooting .

"A young brother and sister have discovered both their parents dead in their Massachusetts home from what police suspect was a heroin overdose. The Essex district attorney’s office says foul play is not suspected in the deaths of the Haverhill husband and wife. Spokeswoman Carrie Kimball-Monahan said Sunday that state police are investigating the 'unattended' deaths of the 39-year-old man and 36-year-old woman whose lifeless bodies were discovered Saturday at their home on Lamoille Avenue in Haverhill. Heartbreaking find: A 10-year-old boy and his 8-year-old sister have discovered their parents dead from a suspected heroin overdose inside this Haverhill, Massachusetts home . She said the couple’s 10-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter discovered their parents dead at around 10.45am and called their grandmother. The grandmother called a friend living nearby, who went to the home and then called 911. Kimball-Monahan said the state Department of Children and Families responded to the scene as is routine, and the children are now in the custody of their grandmother. Neighbors said that family had moved into the brown two-story home at 7 Lamoille Avenue only a few weeks ago. When police officers responded to the 911 call Saturday morning, the rental property was decorated for the holidays with red, white and gold ribbons tied around the porch and a festive Christmas wreath hanging on the front door. A medical examiner will conduct autopsies to determine the causes of death, but sources within the police department tell the Eagle Tribune they suspect heroin may have played a role. Haverhill - a community of 60,000 located 35 miles north of Boston - has found itself in recent years at the center of Essex County's devastating heroin epidemic. The city has the second highest number of  heroin deaths so far this year, with 22 confirmed fatalities. On Sunday, the Salvation Army held a 'No More' candlelight vigil at the City Hall to remember those who have lost their lives to drugs and send a message of hope to people battling addiction.","A 10-year-old boy and his 8-year-old sister found their 39-year-old father and 36-year-old mother dead inside their Haverhill, Massachusetts home .

"The federal government drew up plans to detonate 23 nuclear bombs in a California mountain range to blast over a passage for a new railroad and highway, it has been revealed. The scheme, which was deemed 'safe' by scientists at the time, is one of more than two-dozen ideas dreamed up at the height of the atomic age for Operation Plowshares - a bid to harness the devastating power of nuclear weapons for civilian use. Other  ideas included using five bombs to dig out a harbor on Alaska's North Slope, digging an alternative to the Panama Canal across Nicaragua and using underground blasting to unleash the oil from the tar sands in Canada. During this time, engineers were testing the limits of nuclear propulsion -  drawing up plans for nuclear yachts and ferries, nuclear-powered rocket ships, nuclear powered planes and Ford even designed a prototype for a car - the Nucleon - with an atomic reactor. Scroll down for video . The plan called for 50 kilotons of nuclear bombs to blow out 68million cubic yards of rock and debris from a mountain pass in the Mojave Desert in California . 'The friendly atom': A 1962 test in Nevada blasted a 320-foot-deep crater in the Earth. Plumes from the blast exposed thousands of people to radiation . The map shows that few people lived with a 50-mile radius of the proposed blast site. Experts predicted it would have little effect on people on the environment . Project Carryall intended to blow open the mountains to make room for a new highway and rail line through the southern Mojave desert. Route 66 and the parallel train line had to run several miles of the way to get around the steep mountains. The operation would have saved the federal government $8million over the cost of conventional blasting through the Bristol Mountains in the Mojave Desert, the Atomic Energy Commission estimated in 1963, according to Gizmodo. The plan called for 22 nuclear bombs to be detonated deep in the mountain to blast a 500-foot deep chasm. The final fission explosive would have been used to create a crater for drainage. 'The study group has concluded that this project is technically feasible. It can be done, and it can be done safely,' California highway engineers wrote in a report. The blasts would have excavated 68million cubic yards of rock and gravel. The atomic age caused America to dream of world without internal combustion engines or fuel. Engineers designed small ships, airplanes and even rocket ships with nuclear reactors - though few came to reality. Ford even fleshed out a prototype Ford Nucleon fission-powered car equipped with its own nuclear reactor. One project that did come to fruition - the NS Savannah, a 600-foot cargo ship and cruiseliner - was built in 1959 to show off the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Barely bigger than some modern day super yachts, the ship was dramatically smaller than nuclear-powered warships of the day. The Convair NB-36H flew several dozen flights with a nuclear reactor, but the program was scrapped . The NS Savannah was the world's first civilian nuclear-powered ship. At less than 600 feet long, it was barely bigger than some modern super yachts . End the end, however, the Savannah proved too costly to operate for commercial purposes. Both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. built nuclear-power long-range bombers in the 1950s and early 60s, as well. Both the Soviet Tupolev Tu-95LAL and the Convair NB-36H flew dozens of test flights with a reactor in place - though they never ran on nuclear propulsion. Cost, safety and environmental concerns led to both the Soviets and the Americans the cancel the programs. Ford built a scale model of a Neutrino - a fanciful concept car that would have run on a nuclear reactor and a steam turbine . Project Carryall was actually deemed safe by engineers in the day - though thankfully it was never tested . The mountains in California were too high to build roads or rails across - so either a tunnel or a passage way had to be blasted out . Cutting through the mountain: Project Carryall was meant to allow a highway to pass through the mountains - rather than around them, like Route 66 was forced to do. Modern day I-40 passes near the planned route . The study - and all other Plowshares projects - come around when Americans were still enamored by the potential of nuclear explosions. Disasters and near disasters that have shaped the modern fear of nuclear power had not yet happened. The partial nuclear reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island took place in 1979. The Chernobyl disaster was not until 1989. The 1962 Sedan nuclear test in Nevada exposed the dangers of using nuclear weapons for engineering when a radiation plume contaminated people as far away as Iowa - exposing the risks of detonating nuclear weapons. The Carryall project was shelved and eventually engineers used conventional explosives to blast through the Bristol Mountains to build Interstate 40. Project Pan-Atomic Canal would have blasted a new trans-ocean canal across Nicaragua . Operation Plowshares spent nearly a quarter billion dollars researching civilian uses for nuclear weapons between 1959 and 1971. The project carried out 27 nuclear tests during that time. Here are some of the more outlandish plans from Operation Plowshares: .","The 1963 plan would have blown at hole through the Bristol Mountains in California, to make way for a road .

"Olympic cycling champion Dani King, centre, pictured with Georgia May Jagger and Ronnie Wood, suffered a punctured lung in an accident involving a pothole . Olympic cyclist Dani King is in hospital after puncturing a lung in a crash caused by a pothole. The 23-year-old gold medallist was riding near her home in Cardiff. One of her team went down after hitting the water-filled pothole, bringing down a number of others including Miss King, who won team pursuit gold at the London Olympics in 2012. She suffered a collapsed lung and five broken ribs. Her agent Steve Fry said she was in a ‘fair bit of pain’ and called on authorities to improve roads. ‘It was a totally routine ride that Dani has done hundreds of times before,’ he said. ‘There was a puddle across the full width of the road, it was one of those freak things that in the middle of that puddle was a hole. ‘A rider to her side went down and fell into her. It was obvious she was injured, and quite badly so, and almost immediately she was taken to hospital by ambulance. Several other riders were also hospitalised. We are in the hands of the medical professionals so we don’t know how long she will be in hospital. ‘It happened on a B-road between Merthyr Tydfil and Quaker’s Yard,’ he added. ‘The injuries are clearly painful and serious and we can only hope she gets better soon. It’s too early to say yet when she’ll be back in training and competing. It’s time local authorities started spending more money on repairing roads to ensure things like this don’t keep happening. We’d like to see £10 per head of population spent on . . . maintenance of paths and roads.’ Scroll down for video . British Cycling said: ‘We wish Dani a speedy recovery . . . There is much more to be done to improve conditions.’ After the crash on Thursday Miss King tweeted: ‘Crashed whilst out training yesterday resulting in five broken ribs and a collapsed lung.

'I just need that one courageous person to come forward with information about Shane.' Volunteers have been aiding local authorities in the search. Police say Montgomery was home for Thanksgiving when he met up  with some friends  at the crowded Kildare's bar. Authorities say he became separated from them and was escorted out by a bouncer around 2am Thursday after stumbling on a bar stool. In the wake of his disappearance, Jim Townsend, the director of operations at Kildare's, came forward to shed light on what happened when Montgomery was last seen. A search of the records at the bar turned up a tab for Montgomery totaling $17, which Townsend said was for three craft beers. He said that Montgomery did not appear intoxicated and though he bumped into the DJ table accidentally, he was polite about it.

An employee at Kildare's, who is a relative of Montgomery's, walked him to the exit around closing time and security saw him leave the door and turn south on Main Street. Montgomery's cellphone pinged near the CVS Pharmacy, located less than a mile from Kildare's, about an hour after he was last seen at the bar, but that signal could be picked up at a radius of 4,500 feet.

On the case: Police marine units use long poles while combing the bottom of the Manayunk Canal in search of missing Shane  early Sunday, November 30 in Philadelphia . Upset: A woman is comforted by another during a candlelight vigil for Shane at a park across from Kildare's Irish pub in Manayunk . Distinctive: This is a photo of the Celtic cross tattoo on Montgomery's shoulder . Authorities have used K-9s, helicopters and marine units as part of the search. The search was so widespread that the city cancelled a Christmas tree lighting ceremony and caroling activities. Instead the organization held a candlelight vigil at the Canal View Park. Montgomery is a liberal arts major and a former high school runner. He is 5-foot-11 and 130 pounds, with short brown hair and green eyes. He was wearing a buttoned- down gray shirt, gray hoodie and jeans when he left the bar. He also has a unique Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder.","Shane Montgomery, 21, left a Philadelphia bar about 2am November 28 .

"A Chinese schoolgirl was left with shocking head injuries when she was beaten by her teacher as punishment for talking in class. Seven-year-old Li Li fell into a coma after she was grabbed by the hair and slapped by her teacher Yang Yali, 40, at her school in northeast China's Liaoning Province. According to the other children, when the little girl did not cry at the first blow,the teacher grabbed by her braids and slammed her head against the classroom wall. Seven-year-old Li Li fell into a coma when she was grabbed by the hair and slapped by her teacher Yang Yali, 40, at her school in northeast China's Liaoning Province . Li Li who was a student at the No.1 Primary School at Tiaobingshan County in Tieling city was only taken to hospital when she collapsed at the end of the day. She kept silent as she began to feel increasingly ill as she had been told not to complain, but the little girl collapsed when she got home at home. Her mum Chen said: 'She told me she had banged her head but she said she had been knocked by a friend's satchel - so I did not think much of it.' Early the next morning, Li Li was in so much pain that her mum rushed her to hospital where doctors operated immediately to relieve the pressure on her brain, and she slipped into a coma.

"It's a gadget that sounds like it is straight out of a James Bond movie - an iPhone that fires lasers. But Apple is developing a new laser-based system for future generations of its iPhone devices. Rather than cutting through handcuffs and walls like devices designed for 007, however, Apple is planning to use the feature to enable its phones to map their surroundings. Apple's patent suggests the lasers could be mounted behind existing openings like the camera (label 20) or have its own dedicated opening (12) in the side of the phone that would then be pointed at walls or objects . The laser would be mounted inside the iPhone and used together with the inbuilt motion sensors to generate a map of any surface it is pointed at. An iPhone-mounted sensor  would detect any light bounced back to the device and provide information about the surfaces of objects around it. This  would allow the iPhone to be used to measure distance and create 3D maps of rooms and even buildings - something that currently requires bulky equipment. Apple's patent proposes using motion detection hardware in the iPhone to allow users to freely move the laser along a wall to measure distances from one point to another or to build up a detailed map of the surroundings . According to Apple's patent, the laser mapping may work in the following way: . 1. User will start laser mapping application . 2. They then choose a measurement mode - either surface mapping, volume mapping, planar surface mapping or curved surface mapping . 3. GPS, Wifi, cellular data and motion detector establish coordinates of iPhone position. 4. Laser is turned on and gathers data as it is moved across the surface. 5. User can input additional data using the laser as required until a map can be generated . 6. App generates image of map created on display. This can be stored or transmitted to other devices. A flowchart from the patent showing how Apple envisages its iPhone laser device may work . Designs for the iPhone laser were revealed in a US patent application submitted by Apple. It raises the prospect of being able to connect future generations of the iPhone to 3D printers so users can replicate their favourite objects or important components. Apple claims the laser technology could be incorporated into other handheld devices such as iPads, laptops and even wearable technology like its new Apple Watch. Writing in the patent, Apple said: 'Conventional laser measuring devices measure only the distance from the device to a given surface. 'These devices are unable to measure distances between multiple points that are separate from the device and therefore require the user to place the device is specific locations for which measurements are desired. 'This can be difficult in, for example, a furnished room with items that restrict access to all parts of the room. 'Additionally, these devices can be bulky pieces of equipment that require batteries or battery packs and must be purchased and transported separately from other equipment and electronic devices. 'It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with mapping circuitry.' Apple proposes housing the laser and sensor inside an iPhone, giving it a dedicated opening in the case to allow the laser beam to be emitted and received. However, it says the laser system could also be mounted behind the camera, the display or even inside the port for headphone jacks. The laser system works by measuring the time it takes for the light to be reflected back to the sensor mounted in the iPhone, allowing it to measure the distance from an object. 'It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with mapping circuitry.' Apple proposes housing the laser and sensor inside an iPhone, giving it a dedicated opening in the case to allow the laser beam to be emitted and received. However, it says the laser system could also be mounted behind the camera, the display or even inside the port for headphone jacks. iPhone users may be able to build up maps of their surroundings simply by pointing their phone at them . The iPhone laser will be able to map surroundings by precisely measuring the distance to nearby walls . The laser mapping could be used in a handheld device thanks to the iPhone's existing positioning hardware . The laser system works by measuring the time it takes for the light to be reflected back to the sensor mounted in the iPhone, allowing it to measure the distance from an object. It can also build up a picture of the texture of the surface it is pointed at by looking at the amount of light that is scattered. Similar systems have been used to produce 3D maps of buildings such as the Houses of Parliament in London while paleontologists have adapted the technology to produce maps of dinosaur tracks. However, these devices need to be mounted in a single spot for hours on end to build up a detailed image. Apple proposes allowing its users to do the same with handheld phones by using the laser in combination with its GPS and data from the iPhone's motion sensors. It said: 'For example, a user may stand in a room and aim a laser beam generated by the laser sensor at a wall. 'The user may gather laser sample data while pointing the laser at first, second, and third points on the wall. The user can freely move the device between sample points. Apple's proposed laser technology could see some popular public areas like musuems looking more like night clubs as iPhone owners attempt to scan everything in sight with the sophisticated mapping system . 'As the user moves the device, the positioning circuitry monitors the position and orientation of the device. 'When the user gathers laser sample data at the second and third sample points, the positioning circuitry can determine the relative position and orientation of the device with respect to the position and orientation of the device during the first sample point measurement or with respect to a global coordinate system established at the outset of mapping operations.' While such technology will be useful for professionals like architects, builders and even estate agents, it could find wider uses among the general public. It would be possible to provide instant dimensions of an object to online buyers, for example. Householders could use it to map their room and work out where new items of furniture may fit. The technology could also help Apple to build up more detailed street level views for its map application by uploading scans performed by users. Apple's patent says the laser mapping could appear in iPhones and wearable technology like the Apple watch . The system could also be used in combination with 3D printing to allow users to produce replicas of a favourite toy or an important piece of equipment. However, such technology may result in museums and other public venues having to ban eager Apple fans from scanning everything in sight. According to website Patently Apple, the full potential of the laser technology will become clear as the company submits more patents for its devices. It said: 'More than likely Apple will expand upon this invention in the future so as to provide us with more insight as to how consumers will be able to take advantage of this new laser beam system for iDevices that cover everything from an iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. 'While Apple is careful to not mention the word 3D, the nature of the measurements would suggest that the data collected in three axis mode would create a 3D model. 'It's definitely one of Apple's most interesting inventions of the year.'","Built in lasers would create 3D maps of rooms, furniture and objects .

"Three dozen college presidents at private colleges and universities made more than $1 million in 2012, with the highest earner bringing home $7.1 million in compensation, according to a survey of the 500 private schools with the largest endowments. The highest earner was Shirley Ann Jackson at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute based in Troy, New York. Her compensation included a payout of nearly $5.9 million that had been set aside over a decade as a retention incentive, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education's report released Sunday. The highest earning private college president is Shirley Ann Jackson at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute based in Troy, New York, who took home total compensation of $7,143,412 . The Chronicle finds the median compensation for private college presidents was a little less than $400,000. 1. Shirley Ann Jackson, The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY - $7,143,312 . 2. John L. Lahey, Quinnipiac University, Hamden, Conn. - $3,759,076 . 3. Lee C. Bollinger, Columbia University, New York, NY - $3,389,917 . 4. Amy Gutmann, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Penn. -$2,473,952 . 5. Charles R. Middleton, Roosevelt University, Chicago, Ill., $1,762,956 . That's an increase of 2.5 per cent from a year earlier. A high salary for presidents can be prestigious, but it also opens them up to criticism as tuition prices continue to rise. Presidents of some of the nation's most prestigious universities didn't hit the million mark but were close. The presidents of Princeton, Stanford and Harvard had compensation in the $900,000s. Many presidents who are members of religious orders earned no compensation at Roman Catholic institutions. The Chronicle's analysis was conducted using tax forms and Education Department filings. It calculated the annual compensation using base salary, bonuses, other reportable compensation and nontaxable benefits. It didn't include compensation such as retirement pay set aside for future years but not paid out in 2012, the Chronicle said. John L. Lahey, of Quinnipiac University, Hamden, Conn., came in second place with $3,759,076 . Other college presidents in the top earners were Quinnipiac University's John L. Lahey with total compensation of $3.7 million, Columbia University's Lee C. Bollinger with $3.3 million, and Amy Gutmann at the University of Pennsylvania with $2.4 million. Jackson was named president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1999, the first African American woman appointed to the position. She is married to Morris A. Washington, a physics professor at the school, and her son Alan is a Dartmouth alumn. According to her profile page on the school's site, she also serves on the U.S. Secretary of State’s International Security Advisory Board, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, and the U.S. Comptroller-General’s Advisory Committee for the Government Accountability Office. He research specialty is in condensed matter physics. She has been awarded 52 honorary doctoral degrees and has been praised by Time magazine as 'perhaps the ultimate role model for women in science.' John L. Lahey, who follows in second place at Connecticut's Quinnipiac University with $3,759,076, took his position in 1987 and is credited with drastically expanding both the school's campus and enrollment numbers, having directed development for two additional campuses. Third runner up Lee Bollinger at Columbia with $3.38 million began his tenure in 2002 and is identified by the school's site at the longest serving Ivy League president.","The highest earner was Shirley Ann Jackson at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute based in Troy, New York .

"Roy Hodgson has hit back at critics of Raheem Sterling and blamed the media for trying to create divisions between him and club managers. Sterling was rested for England’s 1-0 win over Estonia last month after telling Hodgson that he was tired in a training session. But Hodgson says that the Liverpool forward has been unfairly treated, and that there have never been any club vs country disputes while he has been England manager. England manager Roy Hodgson addressed the Cambridge University Union on Wednesday . England sit top of their 2016 Euro qualifying group, with Hodgson having overseen a 100 per cent record . Roy Hodgson spoke to young journalists from the Cambridge University newspaper before his speech . The England boss was incensed with people attempting to create a division between him and Raheem Sterling . Hodgson speaks to Raheem Sterling before England's meeting with Estonia . Hodgson spoke from behind a lectern and addressed the crowd of students who were in attendance . Hodgson (left) was in attendance on Sunday as Sterling impressed at Queens Park Rangers . ‘With young Raheem Sterling this week, it guts me to see that sort of treatment,' Hodgson told students at Cambridge University on Wednesday night. 'It’s totally unfair and totally wrong. ‘It’s suiting people’s agendas. But, you know, he’ll be stronger for it. ‘Is that right? Of course it’s not right! But I can’t turn the clock back, I’m living in 2014, I can’t go back to Downton Abbey!’ Hodgson was also adamant that he had not been involved in any arguments with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, and blamed the press for ‘trying to drive wedges’ between the managers. ‘There is no tension with Brendan,’ Hodgson told members of the Cambridge Union at the end of a talk about his philosophy of leadership. 'We get on very well. ‘I’ve been very fortunate that, in two-and-a-half years I’ve not had a single situation where a manager has tried to drag a player out of the team, or told me that they don’t want their players to take part. 'I think a lot of the players, if their manager said, “I don’t want you to play for England”, the player would say, “I’m sorry, I love playing for England and I want to go.” ‘Brendan and I have always got on very very well since he took the job at Liverpool, so there’s no problem at all. The England manager has defended Sterling, claiming the media treated the winger unfairly . Sterling faced perhaps his hardest test against Spanish giants Real Madrid on Wednesday . ‘And Jose Mourinho has come out and said that on my behalf as well. “I’ve been lucky. I think there have been club vs country conflicts in the past, but I’ve been pretty shielded from it luckily. ‘Journalists would like more conflict, because they work in a slightly Machiavellian situation. 'So when there is just the simple situation – the simple situation of a player asking to be excused from a training session the day before a game because he was feeling tired. ‘I said, “No problem with that, in which case I won’t start you, but thanks for telling me” ‘They don’t want that, that’s too simple. It must be Brendan Rodgers. ‘Unfortunately, that’s how simple it is. He didn’t say he didn’t want to play the game – he played the game, 25 minutes. ‘Journalists are always going to try and drive wedges between managers.’ Sterling tries to break his way past Alvaro Arbeloa but it was a frustrating first half for him at Anfield . VIDEO Sterling criticism unfair - Rodgers . Hodgson also said he is ‘daring to dream’ of Euro 2016 success, but that realistically the tournament could be too soon for the current generation of England stars. ‘I’m hoping that what we’re doing today, and have been doing for the last couple of years really, will provide the cornerstones for this future generation. ‘I’m obviously hoping that in two years time, we’ll have got the experience, we’ll be in superb form and we’ll race through to become European champions. ‘But realistically it might take longer than that. ‘We’ve got plenty of players who can win games off their own back. I was at Liverpool against QPR, Raheem Sterling won the game off his own back in the last 10 minutes, because players couldn’t deal with him. England overcame Estonia, and Hodgson is daring to dream of success at Euro 2016 . ‘In the past we’ve been well organised, solid, hard to beat. But if you can be solid and hard to beat, and add the Sterlings, the Sturridges, the Welbecks, the Wilsheres, the Barkleys, you’ve got a chance. So we’re daring to dream.' Hodgson later apologised for not including his captain Wayne Rooney in that list of game-changers, but said the Manchester United striker, who will be 30 by the time the tournament begins, was a crucial player for England, who Hodgson knows he can trust. ‘The one thing I’ll tell you about Rooney, he’s a very passionate person about playing for England,’ said Hodgson. ‘He’s a super professional, and the one thing I know I’ll get from Wayne, is that I can trust him. ‘If I say to him, “Wayne, this is your job today, I’d like you to fulfill this role”, he’ll do it. And that’s a great a quality for a player to give a coach.’","Roy Hodgson was addressing Cambridge University students during a talk on Wednesday night .

"The parents of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham have spoken publicly for the first time since their 18-year-old daughter's disappearance last week. The Grahams's heartfelt plea for more information on their daughter's disappearance comes as Charlottesville Police have issued an arrest warrant for 'person of interest' Jesse 'LJ' Matthew. Matthew is wanted on two counts of reckless driving for speeding away from the police station yesterday afternoon. According to Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo, Matthew turned himself into police on Saturday, but quickly left the station after asking to speak with a lawyer. Chief Longo says they are 'aggressively pursuing' Matthew on an arrest warrant for two two unrelated charges. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: John and Sue Graham spoke to reporters on Sunday, to thank locals for their support in searching for their missing daughter . Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo says that an arrest warrant has been issued for Jesse Matthew on unrelated charges . Shaking and with a faltering voice her parents John and Sue Graham held hands as they walked in front of the news cameras for the first time since their daughter disappearance over a week ago. Tears could be seen running down the Mrs Graham's face. Speaking in a British accent Mr Graham said: ‘As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah’s big brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like to make this statement. ‘Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James’s little sister. She is also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously precious to us.' Mr Graham then went on to ask anyone with information on Hannah's disappearance to call police, no matter how small the detail. Hannah Graham (left) has been missing since last weekend. She was last seen with Jesse Matthew (right), who is considered a person of interest in the case by Charlottesville Police . Mystery man: Police released this footage in their search for a man in dreadlocks. He has now been revealed to be Jesse 'LJ' Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital . 'All we want to do now is to bring Hannah home safely,' Mr Graham said, before he left the room with his sobbing wife. ‘Now somebody knows what happened to Hannah. We don’t know who that is. Others who may be watching, they may know something about what happened to Hannah.’ Mr Graham appealed to anyone who saw ‘distinctively-dressed’ Hannah last Friday night. He said: ‘Did anybody see Hannah? Did you see Hannah? Who saw Hannah? Somebody did. Please if you have anything no matter how insignificant you think it may be please call the tip line. ‘Anything that just might help us to bring Hannah home.’ During the address, Mr Graham held Hannah’s favourite soft toy, a white rabbit called Bibi, aloft. He said the toy had been Hannah’s ‘constant companion and guardian angel’ until he returned from dropping her off at UVA last month without. Mr Graham said Bibi was lost for three months when Hannah was six. But he added: ‘We found Bibi and we brought him home to Hannah. All we want to do is to bring Hannah home safely and please, please, please, help us bring Hannah home.’ Mr Graham said his family had received countless messages of support including one from Hannah’s former High School teacher who said ‘if anyone can get through this it is Hannah.’ Meanwhile Virginia State Police have issued an arrest warrant for Jesse ‘LJ’ Matthew the man named by MailOnline as the ‘person of interest’ in the Hannah Graham inquiry. Police have since conducted searches of Matthew's car (pictured) and house. They are awaiting the results of forensic tests which are due back tomorrow or Tuesday . Heartbroken and hopeful: Hannah with her brother, James, mother, Sue and father, John . Longo said he believed Matthew, 32, was the last person to see Hannah ‘before she vanished off the face of the earth’. Hannah was last seen by friends at Camden Plaza Apartments, in Charlottesville at 11.50pm on Friday night at a party with another male friend and police have said she was heavily intoxicated. At 1.20am, friends waiting at a party for the student got a text from her saying that she was lost in the area around 14th and Wertland Streets, which is near the student;s own off-campus home. Surveillance footage released on Wednesday places her half-a-mile away at the Charlottesville downtown mall just 20 minutes before the text. The 5'11' softball player was wearing black pants and a gold top that had black mesh cut outs on the evening she went missing a week and a day ago. Chief Longo revealed Matthew had walked into the police station on Saturday afternoon just hours after he was named and his picture appeared on MailOnline. However, he revealed his frustration as Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital has so far refused to discuss his ‘interaction with Hannah Graham’. Crucial: The last footage of Hannah is from approximately 30 minutes before she called her friends to say she was lost . Chief Longo said he continued to be ‘very interested’ in talking to Matthew. And he told how Virginia State Police had issued a warrant to arrest Matthew after he drove ‘recklessly’ to lose police and Federal agents who followed him from the Charlottesville City Police headquarters. He said: ‘I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she [Hannah Graham] was seen with before she vanished off the face of the earth.’ The police chief said he believed Matthew was the black man with dreadlocks seen in the video with his arm around Hannah’s waist on the Downtown Mall in the early hours of Saturday morning. ‘I believe that man was Jesse Matthew. I really do,’ he said. ‘I believe Jesse Matthew and Hannah found themselves at the Tempo restaurant. Eye witnesses have told us so. I believe Hannah Graham left Tempo restaurant with Jesse Matthew. In fact I believe that JM was the last person to see Hannah before she vanished off the face of the earth. ‘But somebody knows where she is. Somebody’s got to know where she is. And we want to know who that person or persons are.’ Jesse 'LJ' Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar, MailOnline revealed. But Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital, told his mother that Hannah did not get into his car and that the pair 'went their separate ways.' Matthew’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told MailOnline on Saturday: ‘I have been talking with his mother. Big break: The local police chief described the find of Matthew as a 'person of interest' as a major break in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham (pictured) ‘He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car. The girl went her way and he went his.’ Matthew has lived in Charlottesville his whole life, where he works in the operating room of the UVA Hospital, sources told MailOnline. He is a nursing assistant who transports patients to the operating room. His grandmother, Mrs Carr, says she instantly recognized her grandson ‘LJ’ when she watched the video tape released by police investigating Hannah’s disappearance. She told MailOnline: ‘I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment. ‘They took away his car and three bags out of his apartment.’ Mrs Carr added she was confident her 32-year-old grandson, who has dreadlocks, has nothing to do with the disappearance of Hannah, who has not been seen since the early hours of last Saturday morning. ‘LJ would never hurt anybody,' Mrs Carr, 82, from Charlottesville, told MailOnline. 'I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life. ‘I’m sure he had nothing to do with it. He is a good boy. He has worked ever since he was able to work. He has never been in trouble. He would do anything to help anybody. Chief Lingo added that although police have named Jesse Matthew investigators maintain an open mind to other suspects. He said: ‘I don’t want to get tunnel vision just because we have a name, just because we saw her with a particular person.’ With friends: Hannah with a group of friends who have all described her disappearance as extremely uncharacteristic . Acquaintances immediately recognized this man as Matthew . However he added people should keep their eyes’ open ‘on all four corners of the nation’ for Matthew. He said: ‘We were so interested in Jesse Matthew that we found our way to his apartment with a search warrant.’ Chief Longo also issued a photo of his burnt orange Chrysler car. He said: ‘If you saw that car we want to talk to you. We want to know where you saw it and who was inside the vehicle. If you saw somebody get into that car about 1.20 1.30 we really need to talk to you. Because this is a critical piece of a puzzle with lots of pieces missing. ‘Jesse Matthew showed up at the police station yesterday. He walked straight in through the front door. He got inside and he asked for a lawyer. ‘They walked out of that door and I don’t know any more about that interaction than the minute he walked in. ‘I hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to Jesse Matthew again. Because I think he can help us find Hanna Graham.’ Detective Sergeant Jim Mooney said investigators had received over 900 tips and had spoken to over 75 witnesses.. Mark Eggerman of Virginia Search and Rescue who coordinated the search for Hannah Graham thanked volunteers for giving up their weekend to help find clues. He said: ‘We need to find that one thing that will turn this mission on a dime.’ Confusion: This map shows Hannah Graham's movements on the night of Friday 12 and Saturday 13. At 11.50pm she was seen at a party by friends with another male friend. She then seemed to head westward toward the Charlottesville downtown mall .","University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been missing for a week .

"Last week, Jose Mourinho claimed losing Nemanja Matic for Saturday's trip to Newcastle would be 'no problem'. Unfortunately for the Chelsea faithful, their side fell to a 2-1 defeat at St James' Park without the suspended Serb, who had been one of seven ever-presents in the Premier League for the Blues so far this season. Despite suffering their first loss of the season, Mourinho's side still sit three points clear at the top of the table, proving that consistent selection can be key with six players having started in each of Chelsea's 15 games so far. Six of the Chelsea first team have started every Premier League game so far this season . Nemanja Matic was suspended for Chelsea's 2-1 win against Newcastle on Saturday . Table continues below . Ronald Koeman's Southampton are the only other team to rival Chelsea's ever-present selection, with the Dutch boss also picking the same six players to start in each of his team's 14 outings. And it's no coincidence that these two teams sit first and fourth in the Premier League as we head into the busy Christmas period. In his second spell as Blues boss, Mourinho looks intent on creating a solid spine, similar to the one that brought him so much success during his time in charge 10 years ago. This time, rather than Petr Cech, John Terry, Claude Makelele, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba, it's Thibaut Courtois, Gary Cahill, Terry, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, whenever the Spain striker is available. Chelsea would have also played the same backline in each game if it wasn't for Cesar Azpilicueta's red card against Crystal Palace which saw Filipe Luis deputise at Newcastle. Gary Cahill (left), Eden Hazard (centre) and John Terry have started all of Chelsea's 15 Premier League games . At Manchester United, Louis van Gaal would no doubt have loved to select the same set of players each week, but the Dutch boss has had to deal with a number of injuries to key players meaning only David de Gea has started each game. Chelsea's Premier League title rivals Manchester City do not feature in the ever-present list as none of the squad have started in each of their 15 games.

"Carol Vorderman has insisted there should be more female pilots. The TV presenter is backing a campaign by British Airways called the Future Pilot Programme which is a training scheme aimed at recruiting new pilots. However, the 53-year-old former Countdown host, who qualified to become a pilot in 2013, said that there are currently too few women training to enter the industry. Carol Vorderman has insisted there should be more female pilots and is backing a campaign by British Airways called the Future Pilot Programme  aimed at recruiting new pilots . She is also hoping that her own experience can inspire more women to begin training. Ms Vorderman, who is planning to fly solo around-the-world next year following in the flight path of British pioneer aviator Mildred Bruce, said: ‘I always wanted to be a pilot. 'It was the reason I read Engineering at Cambridge, and ideally would have joined British Airways after graduating, but sadly their training school wasn’t open at that time.’ She added: ‘I’ve always wanted to be a pilot, ever since I was very young. ‘I grew up in the 60s and 70s and in those days girls weren’t allowed to join the RAF as pilots. It was something I’d always wanted to do, but the opportunities back then, as they were in many other industries, they just weren’t there for girls. The 53-year-old former Countdown host, who qualified to become a pilot in 2013, said that there are currently too few women training to enter the industry . ‘I think it’s wonderful that the future pilots programme is trying to attract women as well as men. My girl is 22 and she may well be applying. The opportunities open to her are very different to those open to me and I just think we should celebrate that. ‘Last December, I got my PPL, which is baby pilot’s licence. ‘I’m involved in a very glamorous industry and have been for decades, but it’s never quite satisfied every part of my head to be honest, whereas flying does. ‘Certainly to be fast with numbers and to understand numbers is an important part of flying.’ British Airways runs its own cadet training scheme called the British Airways Future Pilot Programme – open to anyone from 18 to 55. The next application process will begin in February. The airline’s cadet programme has around 4,500 application each year, with the airline saying there has been a gradual increase in the number of female applicants over the past three years. Carol Vorderman was announced as the new Ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets in November this year . A far cry from Countdown!  Carol Vorderman . posed in her new uniform to celebrate becoming the first women ever to become the ambassador to the RAF Air Cadets . The company currently have around 200 female pilots – more than any other airline. British Airways’ First Officer Emily Lester, said: ‘The British Airways Future Pilot Programme has allowed me to realise my dream of becoming an airline pilot. ‘After an intensive training programme I am now flying to destinations throughout Europe and would encourage anyone thinking of a career as a pilot to apply. ‘It’s an ideal route into an incredibly rewarding career for both men and women.’ It was in November this year that Ms Vorderman, became the first woman to be named an honorary ambassador for the Air Cadets. She has long been associated with RAF-linked charities including the Royal Air Forces Association, the RAF Benevolent Fund and the Bomber Command Memorial committee. She even led the Salute Area in Green Park in London when the Queen unveiled the RAF Bomber Command memorial in June 2012.

"A young woman who reached the final of a beauty contest without organisers realising she was born a boy is now determined to win the next series of Big Brother. Pammy Rose, so called because she modelled her look on Pamela Anderson, first hit the headlines last year when she made the final of 'The Face of Sunderland'. The 22-year-old from Seaham, County Durham, later revealed to the judges that she was born as a boy called Paul Witten. Scroll down for video . Reality TV hopeful: Pammy Rose, 22, is ready to 'show the world who she really is' She had entered the beauty contest because she 'wanted to promote different people'. Now she wants to spread her message even further by starring in the next series of reality TV show Big Brother. Pammy Rose, who is on a waiting list for her full sex change operation, has sent a video to producers explaining her struggles in life so far and why should would make a great housemate. She said: 'I want to win Big Brother, I am dying to get in there. I am a big fan of the show and I absolutely love reality TV. I want to be the second transgender to win Big Brother after Nadia. Happier now: The 22-year-old was born as a boy called Paul, right, but never felt comfortable in her own body so started dressing as a girl and then taking hormones to change her sex . 'I am ready to show the world this is who I am and I am not afraid to show it.' She is now one step closer to achieving her dream after Tweeting that she has now been invited to audition for the show. She wrote: 'I've just received the email I've been waiting for! Looks like it's the beginning of the audition process for big brother tomorrow!' The TV hopeful said she can't wait to have an operation to fully change her gender. 'It feels like I have been waiting forever,' she said. 'I am a straight woman. I have always considered myself a woman but inside a man's body.' Name change: Pammy Rose has been likened to Pamela Anderson - which is why she chose her moniker . Beauty accolade: She reached the final of the Face Of Sunderland competition in 2013 . Born Paul, Pammy Rose said she always felt different and wasn't happy being a boy. She recalled: 'I was very feminine when I was younger. I would run around the house with a T-shirt on my head pretending it was hair. I would tell my mum I'm a girl and I don't belong in this body.' During school Pammy Rose said she was often bullied and called names and she felt like a 'freak' because she wasn't comfortable living as a boy. When she turned 14, she decided to embrace who she really was and started growing and bleaching her hair. She began wearing make-up and wore the girls' school uniform instead of the boys'. She said: 'Once I came out and told everyone I was a woman, everything became a lot easier.' Journey: Pammy was bullied at school but is enjoying life now she's living as a woman . At the age of 16 her mother, Julie, 49, took her to the doctors to begin her full transition into a female. A joke about her looking like Pamela Anderson led to her officially changing her name at the age of 18. The following year, she started taking hormones to begin the process to turn her into a woman. In spring 2013, a friend entered her in a local beauty contest and she made it to the final. Pammy Rose said: 'Until I told them in my interview, the organisers said they didn't even know I was transgender. 'I felt like I had to tell them because I really wanted to promote different people entering the competition.' Following publicity surrounding the competition, Pammy Rose was complimented by Katie Price who spoke of her admiration of her journey in the national press and Tweeted her to wish her well.","Pammy Rose, 22, was born a boy called Paul Witten .

"Romance of the FA Cup? Not for Liverpool. While there have been countless tales in this season’s competition to put sheen on the old pot, Liverpool have been reacquainted with old ghosts. First up was Wimbledon, meaning a month of having to listen to countless references to that final of 1988, when ‘The Culture Club’ of John Barnes, Peter Beardsley and John Aldridge came undone against ‘The Crazy Gang’, destroying their chances of a Double . The fifth round draw put on the agenda a potential reunion with Alan Pardew of Crystal Palace; Pardew, remember, was the man who settled the 1990 semi-final at Villa Park, his goal securing a 4-3 win that derailed Liverpool’s hopes of landing the two big domestic gongs. Philippe Coutinho was Liverpool's matchwinner as they came from behind to beat Bolton 2-1 on Wednesday . The 22-year-old prepares to curl a delightful effort off the underside of the bar and into the Bolton net . The Brazilian midfielder (centre left) points to the sky after his goal put Liverpool into the FA Cup fifth round . Alberto Moreno (left) jumps for joy with Coutinho as Liverpool secure a fifth round tie against Cyrstal Palace . Sandwiched in between, of course, was Bolton. Back in 1993, they inflicted one of the biggest surprises in the competition’s history, winning 2-0 at Anfield as a club from the old third division to ensure Liverpool’s FA Cup defence got no further than the first hurdle. To many of the players Brendan Rodgers selected here, history should have had no bearing but Liverpool have laboured through this year’s FA Cup as if the psychological scars have not healed. Perhaps we should have known all along that one of the old spectres would haunt them. The thing is, they should have got through this test. Bolton – and they deserve tremendous credit – were organised, spirited and tenacious but should they really have been able to keep a side that cost more than £110million to assemble so quiet for two games? Rodgers was not in the least bit perturbed about this tie being taken to a replay, as he was adamant the slick, open playing surface at The Macron Stadium would suit Liverpool, allow them to pass, pass and pass until Bolton were hypnotised. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers was confident going into the match that Bolton's pitch will help his side's style . Raheem Sterling (left) pulled Liverpool level with his five minutes to go after a brilliant Reds move . Sterling wheels away in celebration of his 86th minute equaliser against Neil Lennon's side . Anfield’s pitch has been a source of contention for Rodgers, who believes the surface is hindering Liverpool’s potential, so he knew there were no excuses. This had to be a night for some of those ball players to come to the fore. For long period, however, it seemed as if his players wanted to score the perfect goal. Bolton were spirited in the first 45 minutes but Liverpool over-elaborated, as if they were trying to walk the ball into the net. Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho, Raheem Sterling – all were guilty of lacking the gumption to finish off the moves that took them into positions to pull the trigger. Coutinho and Sterling – the two great hopes for the future – were particularly guilty. Coutinho was big news in the build up to this game, the new contract he signed ensures he will stay at the club until 2020 and Rodgers felt compelled to liken him to Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, the men responsible for keeping Real Madrid carousel ticking. Steven Gerrard wore a pair of boots with '700' stitched into them to mark his 700th appearances for the Reds . The midfielder though had an average performance against their Championship opponents on Wednesday . Labelled ‘the magician’ by Rodgers, there is no doubt he has wonderful ability but sometimes Coutinho leaves you exasperated that he doesn’t light up the big games away from home and this was a contest that was heading that way. Until injury time. The goal he scored to ensure more ‘memories’ will be dredged up in the coming weeks was magnificent, full of lift, spin and vision that only a few would attempt and fewer still would be able to pull off. He came good just when Rodgers needed him. He needs to keep doing it.","Liverpool  beat Bolton 2-1 in FA Cup fourth round replay on Wednesday .

"The American teacher brutally stabbed to death inside the bathroom of an Abu Dhabi mall last week was attacked while her 11-year-old twin sons waited for her outside, it has emerged. Ibolya Ryan, who previously lived in Colorado, was stabbed a week ago, in what police have called a 'lone terrorist act' by an Emirati woman who had laid in wait for a Westerner to enter the restroom. On Monday morning, Ryan's ex-husband, Paul, and their three children, 13-year-old Timea and 11-year-old boys Adam and Aiden, spoke about their heartbreak in an interview with theToday show. Their father, who lives in Vienna with Timea, revealed that his sons had been at the mall with their mother on the day of the brutal attack. He has still not told them exactly what happened to her. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Ibolya Ryan's children - 11-year-olds Adam and Aiden and 13-year-old Timea - and her ex-husband, Paul, told the Today show on Monday that they would pull together to overcome her murder . 'The boys did not realize what happened and did not hear their mother cry for help,' he said. 'This lady - I shouldn't even call her a lady - this monster of a person was lying in wait for someone like her for an hour in the bathroom,' he said, becoming emotional. 'Unfortunately it was my kids' mother.' The boys hugged each other as they paid tribute to their mother and said she was a brave woman. 'She wasn't scared a little bit,' one of the boys said. 'She always just wanted to help you,' Timea said. 'She sacrificed herself for other people.' She added: 'As long as we're not alone, we still have each other. We're going to do it.' Victim: 47-year-old Ibolya Ryan, right, is pictured with her children. She lived in Abu Dhabi with the 11-year-old twin boys while her teenage daughter lived in Austria with their father, Paul . In the dark: Their father has still not told the twins exactly what happened to their mother before she died . Together: Mrs Ryan is pictured with her teenager daughter, who lives with her father in Austria . After Mrs Ryan was killed, police released video of her alleged killer, Dala al Hashmeni, who was dressed in a burqa, walking calmly from the mall and into the parking lot. The killer then drove to the apartment of an Egyptian-American doctor and left a home-made bomb outside his front door, but it was found by one of his sons and safely dismantled. Police tracked down the woman within 48 hours of the killing and arrested her in a dramatic night-time raid that was captured on video. Authorities believe she was working alone. 'Nothing so far suggests that the accused has links with terrorist organizations,' an unnamed official, who was quoted by the official UAE news agency, said over the weekend. The official said initial investigations show that the woman, who is in her 30s, learned how to manufacture explosives from websites affiliated with terrorist organizations. The suspect's foreign targets appear to have been selected randomly, the official said. Attack: In footage that was released last week, the suspect can be seen entering the mall before the attack . Horror: The murder weapon was found near the woman's body where it had been abandoned by her killer . Dragged away: Dala al Hashmeni is seen being led away in cuffs following the night-time raid on her home . The killer faces the death penalty after she admitted to the murder, but national laws allow the family of the victim to issue a pardon. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and the flashy investment hub of Dubai, prides itself on being a safe haven in the turbulent Middle East. It is part of the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Candlelight vigils for Ryan were held over the weekend in Abu Dhabi and on Sunday in Dubai. 'We've lived here for seven and a half years and I've never felt anything but safe anywhere I've been day or night, and I really still do feel the same way,' Nancy Ray, an American who was at the vigil in Dubai, said. 'Anything can happen anywhere, in any city in the world, and I've always felt very comfortable in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi.' See below for video .

"In just six months, a camera technician lost nine and a half stone and has since gone on to become a fully qualified personal trainer. Matt Deeming, 24, from Stoke on Trent, had struggled with his weight for years, but was in denial about how large he had become. He said; 'I had a really poor diet and did barely any exercise. Scroll down for video . Matt's New Year's resolution to lose weight has not only transformed his body, but put him on a new career path . 'I was out drinking with my friends a lot, eating kebabs and living a completely unhealthy lifestyle. 'However, after a Christmas shopping trip where I realised I had suddenly become a XXXL in shirts I decided that enough was enough and I needed to make a change.' What started out as a simple New Year's resolution to join a gym and lose weight quickly turned into a single minded obsession. Within six months Matt had gone from 23st to a much healthier 13st 7lb, dropping an astonishing 9st 7lb and totally transforming his body through a strict diet and exercise regime. Matt commented; 'I completely changed my diet, found a regular training regime and with the help of my best friend and training partner, Jessica Bennett, I battled through each session.' Although he was happy with the results of his weight loss, the rapid transformation had left Matt looking gaunt and unhealthy. Matt's journey has seen him drop from 23st (left) to 13st 7lb before adding 2st of muscle to his frame (right) As a result, Matt decided he would attempt to gradually build up his weight in the form of muscle by undertaking weight training. He said; 'I assessed my diet and training regime again and gradually built up my weight to just over 15st 7lb over the following 18 months. 'I changed to PhD Pharma Whey protein rather than the Diet version, cut down on carbohydrates and started to eat six meals a day which mainly involved protein, vegetables and nuts.' With diet and exercise becoming such a central part of Matt's life, he decided to take the next step and pursue a career in fitness and health. Matt said; 'I wanted to continue improving my own fitness but I also wanted to inspire others to do the same. 'I could never picture myself the way I used to be and wanted to help others believe that it was possible too. I decided to take on the level 2 gym instructor and then the level 3 personal training courses. 'Becoming active and losing weight has completely changed my life. I never thought I would be in the position to help others to achieve what I have'. Matt currently balances his day job of being a camera technician with taking clients as a personal trainer after work and at the weekends. He is hoping to become a full time personal trainer once he has built up a large enough client base and one day in the near future hopes to open his own gym.","Matt's lifestyle of drinking, takeaways and no exercise meant he was 23st .

"A bride left 'heartbroken' after her handmade £6,000 engagement ring was stolen on her big day is over the moon after a generous jeweller replaced it for free. Caroline Marshall, 32, was tying the knot with James Granshaw, 29, in June at a a secluded village church, when a bridesmaid's handbag was stolen - with the bespoke sapphire and diamond-encrusted platinum band inside. The couple, both from West Sussex, launched an online campaign to help find the ring which gathered 100,000 supporters within just 24 hours. Caroline Marshall and James Granshaw were left heartbroken when the engagement ring was stolen . But despite offering a £1,000 reward, it was never recovered following the theft as the couple said their vows at St Peter ad Vincula, in Wisborough Green, West Sussex. As well as the monetary value, the ring held sentimental significance. James, a qualified barrister and legal adviser at Waverley Borough Council, had spent months researching ethical jewellers for a ring that did not contain so-called 'blood diamonds' - mined in conflict zones. He even helped to design the 'irreplaceable' ring himself. The new ring (pictured) is said to be almost identical to the band that was stolen in June . After reading about the couple's story during an airport stop-over in Hong Kong, Dubai jeweller Ashraf Ahmed offered to replace the ring for free. Ashraf Ahmed, a Dubai-based jeweller, read about the couple in a newspaper and offered to replace the ring for free . British-born Ashraf got in touch with the family via email, they sent him the bespoke ring's specifications, and he sent the delighted newlyweds an exact copy. Caroline, who had come to terms that she may never get her ring back, said she was astonished by Ashraf's act of kindness. 'I am truly overwhelmed by Mr Ahmed's generosity,' she added. 'It's been a difficult time as it cast a shadow over our wedding day but I'm thrilled with my new ring and I can't thank him enough.' James' father Mervyn, a retired airline pilot from Guildford, Surrey, added that they had never expected this result when they set about finding the stolen jewellery. 'Our online campaign was to hopefully get the ring back, or to at least make it too hot that any jeweller presented with it would know it was stolen. 'We never expected the sort of generosity Mr Ahmed offered, and are eternally grateful. 'This week the ring was delivered to James and I now have a very happy daughter-in-law again with a beautiful ring back on her finger.' Mervyn added that the family had received an overwhelming amount of support from other members of the community and they couldn't be more thankful. 'We had so much support from all quarters, for which I am eternally grateful, and without this we would not have had this fairy tale ending. 'In this season of goodwill, I would very much like to let everyone know that there are some kind people in this world.'","Caroline Marshall, 32, and James Granshaw, 29, were married in June .

"An executive for Korean Air is facing investigation after she reportedly delayed a flight because a member of the cabin crew didn't serve her nuts properly. The flight was was about to take off from New York's JFK Airport when Korean Air's vice-chairman Cho Yang-ho had a flight attendant removed from plane for failing to offer her a packet of macadamia nuts. South Korean news service Yonhap reports that, when prompted, the attendant gave the daughter of the airline's chief executive Cho Yang-ho macadamia nuts in a bag, and not on a plate as formal business class procedure dictates. That's nuts! Korean Air executive Cho Yang-ho kicked flight attendant off her plane for not serving her macadamia nuts before take-off according to formal procedure ... meaning on a plate . The plane about the leave New York was delayed 11 minutes by Cho's on-the-spot disciplinary action . For that oversight, Cho, who also goes by her English name Heather, reportedly yelled at the cabin crew member and ordered her off the plane as it was readying to depart JFK Airport for Incheon, near Seoul. The South Korean Government is looking into the executive's on-the-spot disciplinary action against the attendant, who hasn't been named. The plane was already in the process of being taxied to the runway but had to return to the passenger terminal, with the whole saga delaying the New York-bound plane's take-off by 11 minutes, it was confirmed by the airline. However, Korean Air also confirmed that the decision to expel the crew chief had been made in consultation with the pilot.

"Look closely enough and you can still make out the prints on the bottom of his toes ... 2,500 years after he died. This is the near-perfectly preserved body of a 14-year-old Egyptian boy named Minirdis, revealed for the first time since he was unearthed in the 1920s, entombed within a lavishly-decorated sarcophagus. The son of a powerful stolist priest, he is still wrapped in the embalming cloth - now yellowish, dusty rags - in which his corpse was swaddled some 500 years before the birth of Christ. The trouble, however, is that his body has lain still for so long that it is impossible to unwrap the gold-painted shroud covering his face,  for fear it may crumble instantly into dust. Scroll down for video . No head, shoulders, knees... just toes: This is the near-perfectly preserved body of a 14-year-old Egyptian boy named Minirdis, revealed for the first time since he was unearthed in the 1920s, entombed within a lavishly-decorated sarcophagus . Revealed: The trouble, however, is that his body has lain still for so long that it is impossible to unwrap the gold-painted shroud covering his face, for fear it may crumble instantly into dust . So his toes remain the only part of him that we can now see after scientists opened his coffin for the first time since his untimely death. Once the lid was off the wooden coffin containing his remains, scientist J.P. Brown could relax. The conservator at Chicago's Field Museum and three other scientists had just used clamps and pieces of metal to create a kind of cradle to lift the fragile lid. Wearing blue surgical gloves, they slowly lifted the contraption containing the coffin lid and carefully walked it to a table in a humidity-controlled lab at the museum. 'Sweet!' Brown said, after helping set the lid down. He later added: 'Oh yeah, god, I was nervous.' The well-planned routine came on Friday as scientists started conservation work on the mummy of Minirdis, the 14-year-old son of a stolist priest. The mummy needs to be stabilized so it can travel in the upcoming exhibit, 'Mummies: Images of the Afterlife,' which is expected to premier next September at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. It is expected to travel to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in fall 2016. Relief: Scientist J. P. Brown and three colleagues  used clamps and pieces of metal to create a kind of cradle to lift the fragile lid at Chicago's Field Museum. Markings on the coffin showed that, if Minirdis had lived, he would have been a priest like his father. Scientists don't know why he died so young . Delicate: Wearing blue surgical gloves, they slowly lifted the contraption containing the coffin lid and carefully walked it to a table in a humidity-controlled lab at the museum . The Field Museum has had the mummy since the 1920s, when the institution received it from the Chicago Historical Society. It's part of the museum's collection of 30 complete human mummies from Egypt. 'There's always a risk of damage,' said Brown, who did the work in a lab filled with plastic-covered examination tables set behind a large window to let schoolchildren watch his daily work. 'So we like to handle these things as little as possible.' Inside the coffin, known as a sarcophagus, there was expected damage. CT scans, which make X-ray images that allow scientists to see inside the coffin before opening it, showed the boy's feet were detached and partially unwrapped with his toes sticking out. His shroud and mask were torn and twisted sideways. Those also will be repaired. Artifact: The Field Museum has had the mummy since the 1920s, when the institution received it from the Chicago Historical Society. It's part of the museum's collection of 30 complete human mummies from Egypt . Confident: Brown didn't worry that the mummy would scatter to dust when opened - something common in the movies. Pieces of the coffin had previously gone missing, exposing the mummy to the elements . Technology: CT scans, which make X-ray images that allow scientists to see inside the coffin before opening, prepared scientists for the damage already done to the remains . Brown didn't worry that the mummy would scatter to dust when opened - something common in the movies - so long as he is kept wrapped in linen. Pieces of the coffin had previously gone missing, exposing the mummy to the elements. 'The last bit of ""Indiana Jones"" and all that,' Brown explained before opening the coffin. 'That's not going to happen.' And it didn't. Walking around the opened coffin, Brown pointed and explained the significance of a certain marking, the colored resin on the linen wrappings or the gilded gold on the mask. If Minirdis had lived, he would have been a priest like his father, Brown said. Scientists don't know why he died so young. 'The fascinating thing about any mummy is that it's survived as long as it has,' Brown said. 'They're actually amazingly fragile.' 'This kind of work is always painstaking, filled with pre-planning and tests so scientists are prepared for the unexpected,' said Molly Gleeson, who works with mummies as project conservator at Penn Museum's 'In the Artifact Lab: Conserving Egyptian Mummies' exhibition in Philadelphia. 'These are unique individuals, unique objects,' she said. 'There's nothing else like them. If damage were to happen, we can't put things back together exactly the way they were before.'","Coffin opened at Chicago's Field Museum where it has been since 1920s .

He loved me when I was a blonde. He didn't tell me he hated it until I went back to brunette. He has loved me through my up times and my down times.

Happy: Delta Burke with husband Gerald McRaney - she said after 25 years of marriage he loves her 'no matter what' A quiet life: Delta Burke told MailOnline that she was happy, laughing: 'I'm just not very exciting right now!' Delta rose to fame as Suzanne Sugarbaker in 1980s TV hit Designing Women, which centered around the lives of four Southern women and one man in an interior design firm. She was nominated for two Emmy awards for the role, but left the show in 1991 after a row with her bosses. Appearances on shows including Boston Legal followed. In 2012, she was set to make her comeback on on an ABC sitcom Counter Culture, which was to follow three aging sisters running a family diner together in West Texas and starring Kerri Kenney, Margo Martindale as well as Doris Roberts. However, after Burke fell on the set, production of the pilot was suspended and it was not picked up to series. Asked if there were any projects on the horizon, Delta told MailOnline there was nothing on the horizon - but said she was happy.

"Luis Enrique is still struggling with the biggest decision of his career so far as Barcelona coach – to start, or not to start, with Luis Suarez. British viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of Saturday's game due to broadcasting regulations. In the build up to the midweek match with Ajax, Enrique told reporters before the game that Pedro would definitely be playing - effectively revealing his starting line-up. 'No, I can't play that game today,' he said on Friday when asked if wanted to repeat the early shout on who was in and who was out.

Suarez (left) has featured for Barcelona's reserve side since his £75million move from Liverpool over summer . The Uruguayan will play his first competitive match after serving a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini . 'Suarez will get minutes but I can't say how many,' he said. 'This is a great chance for him to incorporate himself in the team. How many minutes he will get I can't say.' When asked if it was better for a player to start a game or come on in the second half after such a long lay-off, he against batted away the inquiry saying: 'Every player is different for some players it's better to play from the start for others to come on in the second half.' Suarez's anxiety to kick-off his Barcelona career lends itself to throwing him in from the first kick but Enrique has also practiced with a four man midfield this week, with Xavi Hernandez back in the side alongside Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic behind a front two of Neymar and Lionel Messi. If Enrique opts for that tactic his formation will mirror Carlo Ancelotti's who looks set to play Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Isco and Luka Modric in midfield having confirmed Gareth Bale will miss the game with a buttock injury.

'The absence of Bale does not change the way we will play the game. We have our ideas and follow them. We don't change,' said Enrique, who despite the bravado will know Madrid are a different proposition without Bale, leaning more on possession and less on explosive counter attacks. There was one thing both coaches agreed to be unhappy with – the kick-off time. The game has been scheduled for 6pm local time to reach a wider global television audience at prime time. Ancelotti has complained most vehemently after his side had to travel back from Liverpool after their later midweek Champions League game. 'Ancelotti is right when he says the kick-off time is not ideal,' said Enrique. 'It is a problem for all of us but everything works around the interests of television. It is a lot better for all of us playing later.' The Barça coach also said that he was not worried about provocation from Pepe on Saturday as Suarez plays his first competitive game since biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. He said: 'There is physical contact in football and we accept that and there is also a referee to make sure there is fair play. I'm sure it will be a great game and a good spectacle.' On Suarez, Ancelotti said: 'I am not here to judge the behaviour of Luis Suarez. I rate him a lot as a player, he is a fantastic player, he scored a lot of goals in England but whether he plays or not does not change our tactics for the game if they are with Suarez or without Suarez – it is good news for football that Suarez can play in the Spanish league.'

"It is pointless asking Steven Gerrard where it all goes wrong. Gerrard is where it all goes wrong. Not just in this tournament, not just with the odd mistake of a player raging against the dying of the  light, but from the very start, from his earliest days as an international footballer. All those times when we looked and wondered what happened to the Gerrard we knew, the one in the red shirt, a hero of the modern game. That was it going wrong. That was it right there. VIDEO Scroll down for Steven Gerrard: The World Cup has left me a broken man . Ruined: Steven Gerrard has retired from international football following failure at the 2014 World Cup . Stepping away: The 34-year-old has called time on his England career after 114 caps . Name Gerrard’s greatest performance for Liverpool. It is impossible to stop at one. The second half of the 2005 Champions League final; the FA Cup final in 2006; that Champions League tie against Olympiacos in 2004; the 3-0 win over Everton in 2012; Napoli in the Europa League in 2010; as a 21-year-old against Manchester United in 2001. Anfield regulars would not stop there. They could add another 50, maybe 100. Southampton, New Year’s Day, 2001; Marseille in 2008. Games that Liverpool would not have won without Gerrard, the pumping heartbeat. Now do the same with Gerrard and England. Several of those who have seen each one of his 113 appearances tried it yesterday. There was a consensus on Andorra away in 2007 under Steve McClaren. And not a whole lot else. He was very good when England beat Germany 5-1 in Munich, but so were a lot of players. There was a friendly against Hungary immediately after the 2010 World Cup, when he stopped the Fabio Capello backlash reaching its shrill crescendo. And he was most consistent in the qualifying campaign for the 2010 World Cup, albeit in a starting position on the left, which he hated. Glorious: Many Gerrard displays for Liverpool, particularly in Istanbul in 2005, have been outstanding . Irregular: There have been fewer great displays for England, with the best arguably against Andorra in 2007 . Yet Gerrard’s malaise is England malaise. Just as the national team is less than the sum of its parts, so his century of England appearances do not amount to his best 10, maybe his best five, for Liverpool. Gerrard, an admirable individual of great honesty and often given to brutal self-analysis, admits as much. On the occasion of his 100th cap, he said he had played six or seven good games for England. That was harsh. It is generally agreed Gerrard has frequently hit a standard that justifies his inclusion. Only very recently has his place in the team been questioned, and never by Roy Hodgson. He has asked Gerrard to stay as captain, and he will consider his future in the coming weeks. Yet it is impossible to divorce Gerrard’s legacy as a player from the decade or so of underachievement from what was a highly promising England group. ‘If we can’t make this one a player, we might as well give up,’ Sir Alex Ferguson once said, viewing the young Ryan Giggs. Looking back on Gerrard’s international career, it would appear the England machine has failed even that simple challenge. It has taken one of the greatest England footballers of this, or any, generation, one of the most talented players in the world, the midfielder Luis Suarez says is the greatest he has played with, and somehow reduced him to mediocrity. Tortured: England captain Gerrard looked injured mentally when he faced the press on Sunday . Flattered to deceive: Wayne Rooney is another player who fails to replicate club form for his country . It is as if someone has pulled the plug on The Beatles, chucked a blanket over Gainsborough, brought the curtain down on Larry Olivier. This is one of the finest footballers we will ever see. And we’re harking back to a golden hour against Andorra. Gerrard looked pained on Sunday. Injured, mentally more than physically. He picked at the back of his leg until he drew blood, and his face was wrinkled so intensely a bicycle could have been parked in one of the furrows on his brow. He recalled the afternoon after the night before, flicking around on his hotel television, back and forth, checking on Italy’s game with Costa Rica in the hope there might be one last lifeline. It wasn’t to be. Gerrard gave the impression he half expected as much. ‘There was a small, tiny glimmer, but that made the pain even worse when the game was gone,’ he said. ‘It was a desperate position to be in. 'To me, that’s not good enough, to be relying on others, when you’ve got the talented players we have in this squad. 'The margins are smaller now from where we were two years ago but, sitting here, we’re bitterly disappointed. It’s killing me not to have any positives to speak about.’ VIDEO Gerrard to take time over retirement decision . Fighting back: England manager Roy Hodgson (right) wants Gerrard (left) to remain as his captain . Dead rubber: England and Gerrard trained ahead of the Costa Rica match on Tuesday . England are all about accentuating the positives in Brazil, but it seems so empty in the wake of the poorest performance at a World Cup since 1958. The margins are small, was yesterday’s mantra. Yet in three hours of football, England have not been ahead in a match, once. The group of death myth has also been exploded. No group of death is won by Costa Rica, as seems likely here. Italy were not world-beaters. Uruguay truly are Luis Suarez plus 10 others. In Belo Horizonte on Tuesday,  England will face a Costa Rica team that would not merit a second glance from many Premier League clubs - even, in Joel Campbell’s case, the one that holds his registration, Arsenal. It was hoped this game would be the comfortable victory that confirmed English progress, after tussles with Italy and Uruguay. Instead, it is a desperate attempt at saving face. England have never lost every match at a World Cup, and a draw would merely confirm Costa Rica’s place as winners of Group D. Either outcome would be a savage denouement for Hodgson. And a win? It would be scant consolation. This, then, is the proverbial kick into nothing. ‘The last couple of days have been grim,’ Gerrard conceded. ‘It’s a tough moment. In my head, I’ve got a mixture of emotions: frustration, pain. Dejected: Too often have we seen the sight of Gerrard crouched in despair after an England match . Consoled: Gerrard (left) is hugged by Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez (right) after the Uruguay defeat . 'The season for Liverpool ended badly for me and the team. I was coming out of that, trying to put it to bed, trying to get some positivity back through the World Cup. This is exactly what I didn’t want to happen. ‘I have to try to grieve, get away with the family and away from international football, and then make a decision on my future. 'It would be wrong for me to make that decision now. I will consider it long and hard, speak to people who will guide me. I’ve put everyone before myself. I’ve done that all the way through. This time I’ve got to make the decision that is best for me. I’ve told Roy I’ll need three weeks to clear my head. ‘It’s difficult to put into words. When you’re an England player, the captain, a fan and you’ve worked so hard to get into this position, for it to backfire over a few days, it’s a tough place to be. I’m not going to share blame or responsibility. I’ve got to take it on the chin.’ When England’s underachievement was put before Hodgson, the England manager had little in the ways of tangible answers. All alone: Hodgson's position has come under question following England's elimination in Brazil . Endemic: England's problems run far deeper than anyone imagined they did before Brazil 2014 . ‘Costa Rica were the team who were going to finish bottom of the group,’ he said. ‘Yet they’ll win it and might end up winning all three games. But if you can become a good team, maybe you can survive without necessarily having world-class players. ‘Look at their team. Their players weren’t regarded as world-class before the tournament, and maybe not after it, but they’ve had success together. Maybe there is something for us to learn from that.’ It sounded like clutching at straws, the idea a new England can be formed, minus its marquee names and elite performers. Is this really where we go from here, the acceptance that while we might fail to make an international footballer out of a truly exceptional player in Gerrard, we might succeed with an inferior model? There is no logic in that, no reason. If the path from here involves alchemy, the problems are greater than we have imagined. Deep down they all know it, too.","Gerrard has never been able to replicate his Liverpool displays for England .

"Nothing to hide: Angela Rippon steps out in leather trousers and knee high boots . She flashed her long and shapely pins for the first time when she ventured out from behind the newsdesk and danced on the Morecombe & Wise show. And almost 40 years on Angela Rippon is only too happy to continue to show them off in one of her favourite outfits: leather trousers and knee high boots. Some would say her attire was an unconventional choice for a woman who celebrated her 70th birthday only a few days ago but then Miss Rippon has never been afraid to break the mould. The veteran TV presenter, who will always be known as much for her ability to high kick as for her ground breaking role as the BBC’s first female news anchor, appeared in her racy outfit at a furnishing launch for GPlan Upholstery earlier this month. She admitted last year she had made a pact to ‘grow old disgracefully’ following her 50th birthday. At the time she said: ‘I decided when I was 50 that I was going to grow old disgracefully and I’m keeping to it,’ she said. ‘I was at a lunch and we talked about the fashion police dictating that women of a certain age shouldn’t wear black leather trousers or knee-high suede boots. Well, knickers to that. I’ve got black leather trousers and I wear suede boots up to my knees and beyond. ‘I shall wear what I feel good in and frankly that’s my choice and nobody else’s business.

"Sir John Betjeman may have rhapsodised . about playing tennis with Joan Hunter Dunn, who had ‘the speed of a . swallow, the grace of a boy’. But the modern tennis heroine has rather . more weapons in her arsenal — and we are not just talking about ability . on the court. Eugenie Bouchard, 20 years old and . Canadian, is gloriously blonde with perfectly regular, brilliantly white . film-star teeth, a pair of oiled thighs that could crack walnuts, half a . million fans on Facebook — and a Twitter profile which ranges from the . flirtatious to the, frankly, provocative. Indeed, . the new face of women’s tennis - who will be fighting to be crowned . Wimbledon champion on Saturday — likes to post pictures of herself . lounging seductively in bikinis and pouting in fancy dress. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stunning Eugenie Bouchard dazzle in Sportsmail photo shoot . Rising star: Eugenie Bouchard prepares at the All England Club for her Wimbledon final clash on Saturday . Fierce: While much focus is on Bouchard's appearance, she is a determined competitor and hugely talented . She is as much the queen of the selfie . as the queen of the court. Canny, money-making and with an ambition and . drive which make the rest of the tennis crowd - no offence Maria . Sharapova - look like a bunch of shuffling amateurs. Her . smitten fans, known as the Genie Army, follow her around the globe and, . in a mawkish display of puppy love, throw teddy bears on to the court, . some with proposals of marriage attached. Adorable . though she may be, Eugenie can also be utterly ruthless - in a charming . way - when it comes to fulfilling her role as champ-in-waiting. For example, she was once best friends . with British tennis hope Laura Robson, who is also 20. They met aged . nine and were inseparable for a decade. They . were once so close that Canadian Bouchard stayed with Robson at her . family home near the All England Club when they played there. As . teenagers they dined together every night during overseas tournaments . and two years ago made a video featuring tennis stars - including . Sharapova - performing Gangnam Style dance moves. But there has been an acrimonious . falling out. Asked on Friday if they were still close, Bouchard . responded bluntly: ‘No. I don’t think so,’ adding ‘I’m sure you guys can . figure out that one... I’ll leave it at that.’ The . rift is believed to be over Nick Saviano, the leading coach who runs . the Florida tennis academy where they first met. While the pair . previously shared his services, he now coaches Bouchard exclusively. Falling out: Bouchard (right) and Britain's Laura Robson (left) used to be inseparable but are no long close . Their . friendship has deteriorated further during the past year as Bouchard . accelerated ahead of her former friend. She has climbed into the tennis . top ranks, while Robson peaked when she reached the fourth round of last . year’s Wimbledon, then missed this year’s championships with a wrist . injury. She now languishes at 91 in the world rankings. Tennis insiders say the girls no . longer speak, let alone post pictures of themselves together on social . networking sites as they once did so regularly. Before the French Open, . Bouchard said she didn’t have a best friend: ‘I don’t think the tennis . tour is the place to have friends. For me it’s all competition.’ Where . her twin sister Beatrice is concerned, Eugenie says they are . ‘opposites’ and ‘very different’. Beatrice, she adds, ‘retired from . tennis aged six’, and they see little of each other as Eugenie . criss-crosses the globe in search of sporting glory. Beatrice, a student, is the older by . six minutes. Speaking to reporters, she claimed to have a telepathic . link with Eugenie and broke into a broad smile over her sister’s . achievements. ‘Every day I am just in awe,’ she said. ‘I have seen . everything she has missed out on in childhood and teenage years. She has . sacrificed a lot to get where she is today.’ Eugenie . has self-belief and focus by the bucketload. When she met tennis legend . Chris Evert at an event in Singapore in January, she was far from . over-awed. BFFs no more: When asked if she was close with Robson anymore, Bouchard said: 'No. I don't think so. I'm sure you guys can figure out that one... I'll leave it at that' Tight bond: As teenagers Bouchard would stay at Robson's house when she played at Wimbledon . Evert tweeted: ‘@GenieBouchard has informed me that there are more cameras focused on her...’ By . the end of the day they were apparently friends, and Evert wrote: ‘Ok, . spent the whole day with @GenieBouchard. Impressions: genuine, mature, . determined, and really funny!!!’ Or, as she told a reporter that day, more bluntly: ‘She is as tough as nails.’ So . who is Eugenie? Born on February 25, 1994, in Montreal, she is the . product of a wealthy suburban upbringing. Her father Michel Bouchard, . known as Mike, is an investment banker, and mum Julie LeClair is a great . fan of the Royal Family — which is why she called her twin girls . Eugenie and Beatrice. ‘When . I was young my mum gave me a magazine with the two Princesses in it and . I still keep it on my bedside table,’ Bouchard says. Her younger brother is named . William after Prince William and the eldest of the siblings is . Charlotte, after Princess Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco. Home was in the posh suburb of Westmount - in the same street as former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The children were introduced to tennis . at a young age, but Eugenie, then aged five, detested the ‘childish’ games involving hula hoops and balloons that were supposed to interest . them in the sport. Acrimonious: The rift between Bouchard and Robson is reportedly over coach Nick Saviano choosing to work with the Canadian exclusively . Confronting: Bouchard remonstrates with the chair umpire during her semi-final victory at Wimbledon . ‘All of the kids, including my sister, . loved the games, except me,’ she told the Canadian Globe and Mail . newspaper. ‘I hated them, I just wanted to hit more balls and actually . play tennis. ‘Eventually, I . started playing three times a week, then took private lessons and played . my first tournament aged eight. I loved it right away.’ Extraordinarily, . this was when she decided that tennis was to be her life. ‘Nine is very . young to decide what you want to do in life, but that is pretty much . when I decided,’ she said. When she was 12, Eugenie had the chance to move to Florida to train with coach Nick Saviano at his academy. The . whole family relocated to Florida from Montreal — and moved back a few . years later, after Tennis Canada agreed to pay for an exclusive trainer . for her in Montreal. She continues to train with Saviano in Florida for . part of the year, and spends the rest of it on the tour, going home to . Montreal for visits when she can. Mike Bouchard — like the parents of . champs Andre Agassi and Steffi Graff — has taken a hands-on approach to . building his daughter’s sporting career, sometimes with excessive zeal. Bouchard . tried to claim thousands that he personally spent on his daughter’s . dream in 2004, 2005 and 2006 as business losses against tax — but . Canada’s tax service disallowed it. An . embarrassing episode perhaps, but Eugenie continued her march to tennis . glory. She won Junior Wimbledon in 2012 and last year was named WTA . tennis newcomer of the year. She reached the semis of the 2014 . Australian Open in January and the 2014 French Open. Moving on: Bouchard defeated Simona Halep in straight set to win her place in Saturday's Championship decider . Clash: The 13th seed (left) faces sixth seed and 2011 winner Petra Kvitova (right) on Centre Court . Her . prize money to date stands at £1 million — her greater earnings come . from endorsements, which so far include Nike and Coke, and she has been . in Vogue and other fashion magazines. She is now being courted by watch . manufacturers, jewellery designers, clothes labels and banks. Sharapova, . the best financially rewarded female athlete on the planet, netted . £15 million last year with her deals with Tiffany, Omega, et al. Fancy dress: Eugenie (right) with twin sister Beatrice . Eugenie’s agent, Sam Duvall, is tipping her to become the most famous player in the world. ‘She’s got the personality, she’s got the game, she’s got the looks,’ he said. ‘She speaks two languages [French and English] and the crossover appeal is great. Aussie fans love her, French fans love her.’ ‘She understands that the better she plays tennis, the more money, the more marketable and the more famous she will be. But it’s all centred on the tennis.’ Nigel Currie, of sports agency Brand Rapport, agrees that Bouchard could unseat the glorious Sharapova as the game’s top earner. Her use of social media already sets her apart and makes her all the more valuable as a commodity.  She is, online at least, an unabashed flirt — posting a selfie with the actor Owen Wilson earlier this year; a picture of herself on her birthday, lying on her bed surrounded by flowers and birthday wishes; and one on Valentine’s day with a hand-drawn card: ‘From me, to me.’ All of which makes her fans love her even more. She is, though, apparently quietly going out with American ice hockey player Alex Galchenyuk, who plays for a Canadian team. Before that she was dating Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic. She faces No 6 seed Petra Kvitova as Canada’s first Grand Slam singles finalist at Wimbledon, and is brimming with confidence. ‘It’s not a surprise to me. I expect to be in these finals. I totally feel like I belong. I want to make my own history.’ As well as her own millions.","Canadian Bouchard, 20, will contest the Wimbledon final on Saturday .

"UEFA is prepared to move the Champions League semi-finals and final to June in 2022 to accommodate a winter World Cup in Qatar, the European body's president Michel Platini has revealed. Platini said a solution to deciding the dates of the tournament was now 'not so far' and that it would not be a problem to move the Champions League - something that could prove to be an important compromise. A FIFA task force to decide on the dates met on Monday and afterwards FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said it had identified November/December 2022 and January/February 2022 as the most likely options in order to avoid the fierce heat of June and July. A final decision is expected in March. UEFA president Michel Platini (left) says  the 2022 Champions League semi-finals and final could be moved . Platini (centre) said the tournament's latter stages could be in June because of the Qatar winter World Cup . Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup in 2010, despite fears of the country's hot climate affecting players . The Al-Khor stadium, pictured here in its artistic form, is one of 12 proposed stadia for the 2022 World Cup . The 45,330 capacity stadium could have games staged in Novemeber/December 2022 if FIFA get their way . Germany won this summer's World Cup thanks to Mario Gotze's (second left) strike after extra time . Platini, speaking on his first visit to St George's Park, England's national football centre in Burton-on-Trent, said: 'As the president of the confederation I have no problem ... because it is not a problem for the competition of the Champions League, we can move the dates in 2022 and have two semi-finals and the final in June, so that is not a problem.' Platini had previously been insistent that the 2022 World Cup should be played in January rather than November - and said that was because November could affect up to six international calendar dates in that month, October and September beforehand. He added: 'Everybody speaks about the clubs and the leagues but if it is in November and December then you lose six dates of the national teams. But we are not so far away with FIFA. We are not so far from a good solution.' Platini (left) was speaking at St George's Park where he was given a tour by FA Chairman Greg Dyke (right) Playing in January 2022 would cause severe friction with the International Olympic Committee over the timing of its winter Olympics - and FIFA president Sepp Blatter has guaranteed it would not do so. Asked about that issue, Platini said: 'That is FIFA, they don't want to clash with the Olympic Committee but the rest of the world wants to find the best solution for the football.' In a wide-ranging interview, Platini said he understood why Barcelona's ex-Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, banned for four months for biting an opponent during the World Cup, had not been nominated for the Ballon d'Or because player behaviour is one of the components of the award. He said: 'If the Ballon d'Or is on the quality of the player then naturally he deserves to be on the list. But if you consider the player's behaviour then that creates a little problem. This is a guy who was suspended for four months by FIFA. If the Ballon d'Or is a question of behaviour then I agree that he should not be on the list.' Luis Suarez (left) was banned for four months after biting Giorgio Chiellini during this summer's World Cup . Chiellini shows the bite marks on his shoulder caused by Suarez during their World Cup Group D clash . The UEFA president also admitted he had been surprised to read reports that the USA's former FIFA member Chuck Blazer had agreed to be bugged by the FBI for meetings with football officials during the London Olympics. The New York Daily News reported that Blazer agreed to take a bug hidden inside a key ring into meetings, some of which took place in London. He was under investigation by the FBI and tax authorities for millions in unpaid taxes, the newspaper said. Platini said: 'That was a big surprise. I know Chuck, he's a good friend of mine and the last time I went to New York I went to see him in the hospital because he has a small cancer. Some American reports suggest former USA FIFA member Chuck Blazer had agreed to be bugged by the FBI for meetings with football officials during the London 2012 Olympic Games after being under investigation . 'I was very surprised when I read that in the newspaper. 'I read it was in London but I was not there and we never speak about that.' Platini also described St George's Park as a 'beautiful' facility that would help England develop better players. He added: 'But it's not just about having this place - you have to have the coaches and the people who can create good players. If you have good players in England then the clubs will not go abroad to bring in players.' Platini hailed St George's Park's facilities as beautiful during his visit on Wednesday .","2022 World Cup in Qatar is set to be staged in the winter due to the heat .

"Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has criticised four times world champion Sebastian Vettel for the way he reacted to failure this year. The German, who has now left Red Bull for Ferrari, ended the season without a win after dominating the previous four championships. Red Bull started the season on the back foot with an uncompetitive and unreliable Renault V6 turbo hybrid engine but Vettel's new Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo still won three races. Sebastian Vettel failed to win a race for Red Bull last season and has now left to join Ferrari . 'I'm a super supporter of Sebastian, but I'm a little bit disappointed with his attitude, which I think has changed,' Ecclestone wrote in the foreword to the official Formula One season review. 'He's acting like a defeated guy, and he isn't - that's not his mentality,' added the 84-year-old. Ecclestone and Vettel, who won the last nine races of 2013, are close and the Briton will be happy at least to see the 27-year-old move to Maranello after achieving all his success with Red Bull. Ferrari are going through considerable change and, now on their third team principal of the year, are under pressure to perform after a dismal season in which they too failed to win a race for the first time since 1993. 'Ferrari was very disappointing, getting lost somewhere,' said Ecclestone. Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone has admitted his disappointment at Vettel's attitude last season . 'Fernando (Alonso) got a little bit like Sebastian halfway through, so I'm a little disappointed in him, too.' Spaniard Alonso has made way for Vettel and is now expected to join McLaren, who have not won a race since 2012. Mercedes won both titles this year, with Lewis Hamilton taking his second driver's championship, but Ecclestone said the sport had been lucky the Briton and his German team mate Nico Rosberg were allowed to race each other. 'It's good that Mercedes allowed them to do that,' he said. 'If not, we would have had a really lousy championship.'","Sebastian Vettel has left Red Bull for Ferrari after failing to win last season .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers needs to explain his team selection against Real Madrid to the fans, UEFA president Michel Platini said on Wednesday. Rodgers incurred the wrath of some Reds supporters on social media sites when he left Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson, Mario Balotelli and Philippe Coutinho out of the starting line-up, with an eye on the weekend's Premier League encounter with Chelsea. Champions League rules state clubs must field their strongest sides but UEFA is not considering any action. Platini pointed out Liverpool only lost 1-0 in Spain last night compared to an apparently stronger line-up losing 3-0 at Anfield.

Alberto Moreno (right) attempts to chase down Gareth Bale (left) during Liverpool's Champions League defeat . Platini, speaking on his first visit to St George's Park, England's national football centre in Burton-on-Trent, said: 'First of all he has to explain to his fans why he put this team - not to me, not to you. 'Are you sure it was not the best team? How can I say that? The coach of Liverpool, if I say something, he'll say, ""Oh, Michel Platini, I put my best team of the moment."" And I would be stupid. 'If I am the coach of Liverpool I say, ""It's my best team. How you can prove it's not your best team?"" I can't interfere with that. 'I think we give a lot of money to the national associations, to the clubs to have their best teams. But they want to win, everybody, because there is the prize money, there is many things. The best team is what the coach put.' Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson (from left to right) started on the bench against Real . UEFA president Michel Platini (right) believes Rodgers should have to explain his team selection to the fans . Platini also joked Liverpool may have played a weakened team in the match at Anfield a fortnight ago. He added when asked about the selection for the starting XI at the Bernabeu: 'That is a good thing, because they put a better team now! Why they don't change 15 days before when they lost 3-0? 'You accuse the coach not to have put his best team 15 days ago? I cannot say to that. It's the problem of the coach, it's not my problem.'","Brenda Rodgers rested seven first-team players at the Bernabeu .

"Victor Valdes has been deemed the best goalkeeper in the history of the Spanish league. The 32-year-old former Barcelona keeper, who is training with Manchester United, topped a list ahead of Thibaut Courtois and Iker Casillas. The study, carried out by the Centre for Research of Football History and Spanish Statistics (CIHEFE), analysed keepers since 1928. Victor Valdes spent 12 successful years with Barcelona before leaving this summer . Valdes helped the club win six La Liga titles, three Champions Leagues and six Copa del Reys . Valdes (centre) watches on during  Manchester United's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford in October .

Meanwhile, Santiago Cañizares was eighth, Luis Maria Arconada 13th and Andoni Zubizarreta 17th.

"When Rachel Kelly was born in 1977, her future husband Mike was already 33 years old. The couple both went through a marriage and had children with their previous spouses before finally falling in love seven years ago. The age gap and timing of their union rocked the religious community they were part of so strongly that they were forced to leave their local church, where Mike was volunteering as a pastor, and join a different congregation. But almost decade later and the Lancastrian couple are stronger than ever, with two children of their own, Aiden, four and Natasha, six. They also live with Rachel's two children from her first marriage, Kayleigh, ten, and Jessica, 12. Make and Rachel Kelly started dating when she was 30 and he was was 63. Seven years later they are married with two children. The first few years of their romance were not such plain sailing though. After meeting through the local church, Rachel and Mike remained just friends for several years while she was married to her first husband. But as her first relationship crumbled, Rachel turned to Mike for advice and assistance in leaving her partner. She said: 'My husband had gone out with the children, something had happened and I just thought to myself that I'd had enough. 'I rang Mike and asked if he could find me somewhere to stay. 'He picked me up, rang round his friends and found me somewhere. 'He took a week off work and helped out and just generally was was fantastic.' And before long, Mike's chivalrous behaviour meant Rachel started to see him as more than just a friend. She said: 'I wasn't looking for love and so was very surprised when I found I had feelings for Mike. 'But I had never been treated so well, so respected, for someone treat me so well without expecting anything back.' Mike, who had been single for fifteen years after splitting from his first wife, admits that he was already holding a torch for Rachel by this time and couldn't believe it when his feelings started to be reciprocated. He told This Morning:  'She was a friend in crisis, but there was also an attraction - I'd always fancied her a bit - for several years before we got together . 'I was of course I was surprised (when she liked me), because well, look at me. 'I always say I look like an oil painting, something like Picasso.' Rachel and Mike Kelly have a 33 year age gap, but they are happily married in a romance that has lasted seven years . The couple didn't have long to adjust to their new relationship - just six weeks after they started dating, Rachel fell pregnant. She said: 'My first husband and I had struggled to conceive with my eldest two children and with (Mike) being so old, we just decided to take a chance.' Seven years later, the couple are married with two children of their own, along with two children from Rachel's previous marriage and five children from Mike's earlier relationship. Mike has taken on the role of house husband, while Rachel is studying for a degree in nursing. He said: 'It's great, I'm a house husband and I do school runs, get up in the night with the kids, sort out meals and do most of all that side of things because I have more time. 'It's a bit like being a full-time dad, but also with the role you'd expect the wife to have.' Mike and Rachel first met int heir local church, where he was a volunteer pastor and she was the organist . And his elder children are equally comfortable with the age gap in his second marriage. When asked what his family first made of the match, he said: 'One of my lads asked if she has a friend!' The only negative of their budding romance was that Rachel and Mike were both forced to leave their local church after a backlash from fellow members of the congregation. Rachel said: 'Initially it was very difficult, but looking back I can understand why they did what they did. 'Because I was still legally married, they saw it as adultery, even though I had left my first husband before anything happened with Mike. 'But I can see why they did what they did. I don't hold any hard feelings.' Mike added: 'The problem was also that her ex-husband obviously needed some support and if had we stayed in that congregation, then he wouldn't have got the support that he needed, so we found another one.' Rachel fell for Mike because of his chivalrous behaviour . But now the dust has long settled and the couple are looking forward to sharing the rest of their lives together. And both Rachel and Mike believe that the age difference gives them just as good chance of survival as a couple who are the same age. Mike said: 'With marriages today, you see the ones who break up - they're often the same age. 'So it must be compatibility, not age and about whether you can keep the love going.' Mike and Rachel Kelly star in a documentary called Age Gap Love on Channel 5 at 9pm tonight.","Mike and Rachel Kelly met at their local church where Mike was a pastor .

"The groom wore white, the best woman took centre stage and Prince Harry’s girlfriend serenaded the bride (while flashing her midriff). It’s fair to say that the wedding of Sam Branson and society blonde Isabella Calthorpe was an unconventional affair. Alison Boshoff has all the details of the nuptials dubbed ‘the nearly royal wedding'... All in white: Sam Branson and Isabella Calthorpe tied the not in South Africa both wearing all-white outfits . ‘BELLE’ OF THE BALL . Isabella, 33, who is known as ‘Bellie’, wore a beautiful full-length ivory gown, covered with lace, by Los Angeles-based designer Monique Lhuillier. It would cost a normal client around £10,000, although Isabella may have negotiated a favourable rate, given the publicity surrounding her nuptials. Miss Lhuillier previously designed a wedding dress for Britney Spears’ ill-fated 2004 marriage to Kevin Federline. At the Oscars this year, Kate Beckinsale and Isla Fisher both wore Lhuillier gowns. Isabella added Jimmy Choo pumps in silver glitter, £395, and a matching Choo clutch, £575. SUITED AND BOOTED . Not to be outdone, Richard Branson’s son and heir Sam, 27, wore an ivory three-piece suit by British designer Ozwald Boateng. It would have cost at least £3,000. Boateng is famous for cutting a very slim silhouette, and fans of his tailoring include actor Jude Law and chat show host Graham Norton. Sam’s shoes were by trendy Californian brand Toms, which donate a pair of simple canvas shoes to someone in need for every pair sold — appropriate for a right-on documentary maker like Sam . The extravagant wedding is covered in a 24 page special in Hello! magazine . A PRIVATE AFFAIR . It seems Sam is cut from the same publicity-hungry cloth as his father. The wedding, conducted at Sir Richard’s game reserve Ulusaba in South Africa, fills 24 breathless pages in this week’s Hello! magazine. And we’re promised a second instalment next week, which will include details of … drum roll … the bride’s second gown and the ‘hilarious’ speeches. Like Sir Richard, who arrived for his own 1989 wedding in Necker dangling from a helicopter, Sam appears to be very comfortable in the spotlight. When his bride was a few minutes late he called out to the guests: ‘She’s probably run off with a ranger!’ STAR-STUDDED RINGS . The wedding rings were designed by fashionable young jeweller Charles Goode, who also made Zara Phillips’ diamond and platinum engagement ring and the wedding bands used when Kate Winslet married Sir Richard Branson’s nephew, Ned RocknRoll. Isabella’s was a plain band; Sam’s featured a piece of quartz, hewn from the rock where they married. Goode also designed Isabella’s diamond engagement ring. TALE OF LOVE . The happy couple produced a booklet, mostly written in rhyme, which served as an invitation to guests. Titled A Tale Of Love by Sam and Bellie, it opens: ‘Oh dearest friends and family/ We ask you to come/On a journey of adventure/Laughter and fun.’ CRESSIE CENTRE STAGE . Opera singer Patrick Hunter, a friend of the groom, sang Nessun Dorma at the party on the wedding eve. The bride’s younger half-sister Cressida Bonas — who is dating Prince Harry — sang Gershwin’s Our Love Is Here To Stay. Dance student Cressie, 23, known to her family as ‘Smallie’ because she’s the youngest, wore a vest top, long skirt and flowers in her hair. The bride was so moved she burst into tears and buried her head under the table. Prince Harry did not attend the ceremony with his girlfriend Cressida . FIT FOR A PRINCESS . Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie both attended the wedding. Beatrice wore a blue Roland Mouret dress and Eugenie a green dress by one of the Duchess of Cambridge’s favourite labels, Issa. For the past six years, Beatrice has been dating Dave Clark, who works  for Branson’s Virgin Galactic arm. Eugenie, incidentally, introduced Cressida  Bonas (left) to Prince Harry. Harry didn’t attend the wedding last week — perhaps hoping to avoid speculation he might be thinking of  following suit  with Cressida. Sam Branson explained to Hello!: ‘Harry’s a good friend and a great guy. We did invite him and he wanted to come but he was in South Africa the week before with official duties so the timings didn’t work out.’ Harry has been friendly with Sam Branson for some time, and his notorious Vegas holiday started with a break on Necker Island with Sam and Cressie Bonas, among others. Film-maker Arthur Landon, who also partied in Vegas with the Prince, was at the wedding, too. SUNSET CEREMONY . The vows were adapted from a classic wedding reading called Blessings Of The Hands, whose opening lines read: ‘These are the hands of your best friend, young and strong and full of love for you, that are holding yours on your wedding day, as you promise to love each other today, tomorrow, and for ever.’ The bride arrived on the arm of her father, John, who guided her along a candle-lit path through the African bush just as the sun set. Sam Branson had chosen a best woman, a friend called Anthea Townsend, who gave readings including Oh The Places You’ll Go by Dr Seuss. The congregation sang Jerusalem and the local Ulusaba choir also sang. The ceremony was conducted by a local pastor, Carl Louwrens. As a memento guests were given a bag of quartz crystal mined from the rocks where the couple said their vows . STARGAZING . Singer Natalie Imbruglia, a friend of both Sam and Sir Richard, was among the guests. Sam has even appeared in one of her videos. Physicist Professor Brian Cox gave a speech about the universe. Sam and Bellie had bumped into him and his wife Gina on holiday previously,  and invited him along. BEAUTIFUL BLONDES . Isabella’s mother, Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, daughter of the 6th Earl Howe, wore a striking coral dress by Australian designer Collette Dinnigan. The vivacious Sixties deb, who has been married four times, is the mother of four stunning blonde daughters — Georgiana, Isabella, Pandora and Cressida. As Sam remarked: ‘I am about to inherit a very beautiful bunch  of sisters.’ Isabella’s father is the younger son of a baronet who made his fortune in property. On the groom’s side is Sir Richard, 62, who has been married to Sam’s mother Joan for 24 years. He said: ‘I am totally sure that Sam and Bellie will be together a lifetime and it will be lovely to have some grandchildren before too long.’ Sir Richard’s indomitable mother Eve, who is 91, was also there. FIVE DAYS OF FUN . The wedding celebrations lasted a full five days, with guests arriving on Monday and leaving on Friday. There was a ‘bush Olympics’ featuring football and egg-and-spoon races, and a spot of competitive fishing for the boys, plus game drives to see the wildlife. Not too much late-night carousing, though, as Ulusaba has a midnight curfew. CRYSTAL GIFT . Guests were given a bag of quartz crystal as a memento. The crystal was mined from the rocks at the spot where Sam and Bellie said their vows. TREETOP HONEYMOON . The ceremony took place on a hillside at a precise spot picked by the bride and groom on one of their numerous holidays at the game reserve. The 140 guests stayed in lodges on the reserve and went on dawn game drives to see the wildlife. All of the lodges have bedrooms that are open to the elements and vast baths made of locally quarried stone which allow guests to bathe under the stars. Sam and Isabella honeymooned in the Treehouse Suite, a 15-minute walk along a raised walkway from the main lodge. Sam’s sister Holly was married in January last year at Sir Richard’s Caribbean paradise, Necker.","Bride wore Monique Lhuillier gown and groom wore Ozwald Boateng suit .

"Real Madrid and Barcelona spend hundreds of millions on world-class footballers as freely as kids buy candyfloss as the seaside. At some stage of their careers the majority of the game’s greatest players cross the portals of the Bernabeu or the Camp Nou, in some cases both. Cometh the latest edition of El Clasico in Madrid this Saturday, cometh the hour for plucking from the pantheons of Spain’s gigantes their most wondrous teams of all-time. Barcelona stars (from left to right) Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano, Gerard Pique, Rafael Alcantara, Dani Alves and Luis Suarez give Neymar (centre) a lift during training ahead of El Clasico . The problem with this embarrassment of riches is as much who to leave out as who to put in. Ronaldo, the original Brazilian phenomenon, does not make it into my Barca XI. Ronaldo, Real’s modern Portuguese marvel, is one of less than a handful of current players in both teams put together. For every genius chosen, a maestro has to be left out. Inevitably the Real selection is predicated on the greatest club side in history, that which won the first five European Cups with the immortal Alfredo Di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas as its axis. Our fantasy Real Madrid and Barcelona XIs - scroll down for who we think would win this encounter . History weighs a little less heavily on Barcelona, leaving scope for balance down the ages, yet still no room for Xavi, Iniesta or any of the other 2010 World Cup winners . Let the arguments begin. REAL MADRID (4-4-2) IKER CASILLAS – coming to a reluctant end now but the No 1 keeper for Real and Spain virtually since his Madrid debut at the age of 18 and the one-man saviour of transitional Real teams in several of those seasons. Iker Casillas dives and makes a save during Real Madrid's 3-0 Champions League win over Liverpool . CHENDO – Miguel Porlan Nogeura, as he was born, won five successive La Liga championship medals in just one of the segments of his 16 years as Madrid’s peerless right back . JOSE SANTAMARIA – the giant Uruguayan rock at the defensive heart of the European legends of the late 50s and early 60s. Jose Santamaria (in white) challenges Celtic's John Hughes (left) and (right) full back Chendo . FERNANDO HIERRO – the midfield enforcer turned iron-man defender who scored almost as many goals as he prevented, 127 of them in 601 appearances . JOSE ANTONIO CAMACHO – another 600-plus games man. Winner of seven La Ligas and a European Cup in 16 seasons at the Bernabeu. Far more beloved and effective than Brazil’s hit-and-miss free-kick cult left back Roberto Carlos. Fernando Hierro (left) challenges Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero in 1998 . Real skipper Jose Antonio Camacho (left) shakes hands with Tottenham captain Steve Perryman prior to their UEFA Cup quarter-final second leg at the Bernabeu in 1985 - the Spanish side won 1-0 . CRISTIANO RONALDO – having finally de-throned Lionel Messi as world footballer of the year, Ronaldo tales his place in the legend. He does so having just scored more goals in one season than any other Madrilleno - 48 – and as he is threatening to improve on that record. ZINEDINE ZIDANE – perhaps the finest player of his generation, probably the best French footballer ever, remembered for ever for the most sublime of all his works of art – that stupendous volley in Real’s winning of the 2002 Champions League final . Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) scores his sublime first goal for Real against Liverpool on Wednesday . Zinedine Zidane scores one of the most famous European Cup final goals of all time in 2002 . ALFREDO DI STEFANO – the king above all Madrid’s princes as playmaker and goal-taker in the founding legend of the European Cup; still among the five best players of all time; anointed by most of the others in that celestial company as the most complete footballer ever . FRANCISCO (PACO) GENTO – The Third Man alongside Di Stefano and Puskas in the magnficent European Cup triumvirate. The only man to win six European Cups and 12 La Liga titles. Dynamic on the wing. Deadly in front of goal. Alfredo Di Stefano (right) nets in the famous 7-3 European Cup final thrashing of Eintract Frankfurt in 1960 . Francisco Gento training in the unlikely venue of Kilmarnock's Rugby Park before the 1960 European Cup final . RAUL – Real’s all-time high scorer with 323 goals in a club record 741 games played over the 16 seasons in which he won six La Liga titles and three Champions League winners’ medals (the competition in which he is still top scorer), to become a favourite son of the Bernabeu. FERENC PUSKAS – Hungary’s revolutionary galloping major took Spanish football by storm, scoring an astounding 242 goals, many of them created by Di Stefano, in 262 appearances for Real. The only man to score hat-tricks in two European Cup finals, the first in the historic 7-3 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in Glasgow. Ferenc Puskas (centre) bags Real's fifth goal in their demolition of Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park . BARCELONA (4-1-3-2) ANDONI ZUBIZARRETA - Spain’s No 1 pre Casillas, and kept immaculate goal through more than 400 appearances for Barcelona, including the club’s first winning of the European Cup in 1992. CARLES PUYOL – Barca captain supreme; played 581 games before retiring this May; led them to six La Liga titles and three Champions League glories; fearsome centre back but also a redoubtable right back and is there to help balance this defence . Andoni Zubizarreta (left), a stalwart in the Barcelona goal, punches clear against Valencia in 1998 . Carles Puyol (right) leaps to challenge Chelsea's Didier Drogba in a Champions League semi-final in 2012 . 'The Beast', Miguel Angel Nadal (right) a fixture at the heart of the Barcelona defence for years . MIGUEL ANGEL NADAL – Not called ‘The Beast’ for nothing. Snuffed out most of the best forwards in the world through almost 500 games for Barcelona – yet as creative from the back as he was uncompromising tin the challenge. MIGUELI – Who else to play alongside ‘The Beast’ but ‘Tarzan’, as Miguel Bernardo Blanquetti was dubbed. Another iron man with deft touch, Migueli played 620 games over 20 seasons with Barca – much of one of them with a broken collar bone in the extra-time winning of the 1979 European Cup-Winners’ Cup final. SERGI – the perfectly balanced left-back who defended as solidly as he answered Cruyff’s crie-de-couer for Total attacking football . Migueli (left), dubbed Tarzan, holds off Hugo Sanchez during a Clasico - he was a hard-man defender . PEP GUARDIOLA – in his first incarnation at the Camp Nou, before filing his credentials as one of the great managers, Guardiola was the ideal midfield anchorman, reading the game as brilliantly as you would now expect, shutting down danger at its source and starting attacks . LIONEL MESSI – the brilliant Little Master, after Maradona the great Little Master. Messi has failed to place a God-like Argentinian hand on the World Cup but his electrifying runs and barrel-loads of goals have propelled Barcelona to glory in recent seasons – and himself to multiple World and European Footballer of the Year awards. Like Cristiano Ronaldo, a legend in his own time. Pep Guardiola, in his first Barcelona incarnation as a midfielder, against Sampdoria in 1992 . A legend in his own time, Lionel Messi has consistently produced barnstorming performances for Barca . DIEGO MARADONA – the second greatest footballer ever made not much more than a pit-stop in Catalonia but his virtuoso brilliance and wonder goals cannot be left out of any all-time team for which he qualifies . JOHAN CRUYFF – the genius who orchestrated Total Football for Ajax and Holland and went on to conduct Barcelona to honours as both player and manager. Another of the all-time top five who simply has to be in this line-up . Two geniuses of the Nou Camp, Johan Cruyff (left) and the Argentinian master Diego Maradona . LASLO KUBALA – sometimes known as Ladislav, this Hungarian giant of the late 40s, 50s and early 60s was to Barca what Puskas was to Real – a goal machine harnessed to magical touch with his passing. Scorer of 194 in 256 matches spanning a decade at Barcelona, he was the first striker in the world to perfect the art of bending free kicks round and over defensive walls – with that heavy old ball to boot. A forgotten hero in some quarters – but not here. RONALDINHO – not unlike George Best, this Brazilian enigma was the best player on the planet – for a while. The ball-conjuring skills were as captivating as that beaming smile and all his four most enchanted club seasons were his gift to Barcelona, whom he insired to Champions League glory as well as La Liga titles while being twice elected World Footballer of the Year. Ronaldinho celebrates scoring against away at Real Zaragoza during his time at Barcelona in February 2008 . This leaves us with just one question to answer: Who would have won. For my pesetas Real’s extra width plus the telepathy between di Stefano and Puskas would give them the edge in this 10-goal spectacular: . REAL MADRID 6     BARCELONA 4 . Puskas (2)                           Kubala . Di Stefano                           Maradona . Raul                                    Messi . Ronaldo                              Ronaldinho .

"So it turns out that the smartest folk in town this week were those at Madrid sports newspaper Marca. They were the ones who suggested as early as Monday morning that Liverpool were about to come to the Bernabeu and stick their reserves out. Nobody believed the story but in the end they were right, which prompts a question for Liverpool supporters. What is more worrying — the fact that your manager’s team plans are being leaked to the press in your opponent’s home town or that he should make a decision laced with such staggering lack of ambition in the first place? Brendan Rodgers applauds the travelling fans at full time after Liverpool's defeat by Real Madrid . Steven Gerrard (left) started the game on the bench and came on as a sub for Lucas Leiva . Raheem Sterling (left, tussling with Cristiano Ronaldo) was another star who started on the bench . Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend. Liverpool starting XI v Newcastle: . Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Balotelli . Liverpool starting XI v Real Madrid: . Mignolet, Manquillo, Toure, Skrtel , Moreno; Can, Lucas 7; Lallana, Allen, Markovic; Borini . Most of those standing flummoxed in the away section high up in the gods here last night were perhaps past caring about the small details by kick off. The decision had been made and Liverpool, as a result, were finished before they even began. This was sport, but only in name. It is hard to win at Madrid. Since 1957, only one English team apart from Liverpool has managed it. Arsenal in 2006. The key fact here, though, is that the others have come to this magnificent stadium and tried. To return to an earlier point, that is called sport. You turn up, take a deep breath, put your gloves on or your shin pads and you go out and try to do something special. Bobby Robson tried with Ipswich here in 1973 and got a draw. Brian Clough lost 5-1 with Derby after winning a European Cup first leg 4-1. He went home with a broken heart and a sense of injustice but at least he tried, just as David O’Leary did in losing 3-2 with Leeds in 2001. Thierry Henry celebrates scoring for Arsenal during a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu in 2006 . Karim Benzema (right) celebrates scoring what proved to be the winning goal for Real Madrid . Kolo Toure (left) holds off Benzema in what was an impressive display by the Liverpool defender . CLICK HERE for DOMINIC KING'S ratings from the Bernabeu to find out how the surprise Liverpool starters fared . His team led that night. Only for a minute, but just imagine what that minute must have felt like. We could go on. We could talk about narrow failures here for both Manchester teams. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers can dress this team selection up all he likes. He can call it pragmatic or realistic but it is neither of those things, really. It just felt fundamentally wrong and the fact that the defeat was narrow and the performance spirited does not change that. The result should not serve as vindication of Rodgers’ methods. The scoreline was a fluke, reflective not of Real’s clear dominance but of the fact that Liverpool’s lack of competitiveness almost sent their opponents to sleep. Emre Can (right) was a surprise starter for Liverpool but failed to impress in Madrid . Fabio Borini started up front for Liverpool in place of Mario Balotelli . 137 - The seven players on the Liverpool bench had made 137 Champions League appearances between them prior to kick-off last night. That’s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting XI. 130 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Liverpool’s starting XI. 642 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Real Madrid’s starting XI. £59 -The cost of an away ticket at Bernabeu last night. Not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels. 27 - Shots at goal by Madrid last night. That’s 13 more than they managed in their 3-0 win at Anfield. 2 - Minutes played by Steven Gerrard at the Bernabeu prior to last night. He was a sub in a 1-0 win in 2009. He has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium. 3,669 - Tickets at the Bernabeu allocated to Liverpool fans. Rodgers’ team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796-mile round-trip. The game was played in an almost dreamlike atmosphere, as though Madrid knew they would win. When they scored, in the 27th minute, the roof hardly came off the place. By half-time, Real had taken 13 shots on goal to Liverpool’s none. That is not what we hoped for when the draw threw these two great clubs together. Afterwards, Rodgers’ stated belief in his own methods was impressive enough. It is a relevant quality. He has not done much wrong since arriving at Anfield two summers ago but this selection flew quite spectacularly in the face of all he has preached. Back then he talked romantically about sitting on the floor of his grandfather’s house watching great Liverpool European nights on TV. What he will not have watched is Bob Paisley sending his stiffs out. Back then they didn’t even get on the plane, never mind the pitch. Real are a very good football team. They were not the best team in Spain last season, though. Or, indeed, the second best. They lost five times, including twice at home. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle . Adam Lallana (centre) grew into the game as it went on and justified his starting place . They have improved since then and were far too good for Liverpool two weeks ago. In Rodgers’ mind, though, they have been clearly been built up in to a monster. He obviously believes them to be unbeatable and perhaps that is the greatest sin of all. No manager — in any sport — should ever think that. If we all thought that way, we may as well scrap the FA Cup. This was, in effect, a team selection designed principally to avoid collateral damage that may affect an entirely different game — against Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League — that is still three days away. And if that is the way a manager thinks, what chance do his players have? Results can change seasons. Just one result. Who knows? For Liverpool, this could have been the one. Liverpool fans who traveled to the Bernabeu may question Rodgers' decision to play a weakened team . Simon Mingolet (centre) rises to collect a cross and deny Cristiano Ronaldo an effort at goal . Instead, Liverpool now look like a team who feel they don’t belong in Europe, a team who arrive at the really big venues seeking purely to avoid a hiding. Rodgers, meanwhile, must wait and see what this does for his own reputation — even if he claimed last night not to care. Just two weeks ago, the Liverpool manager told another Spanish newspaper — AS — that he would like to work over here one day. He may be waiting a while after this.

"Over 800 long lost love letters  documenting a remarkable long-distance post-war love story  have been discovered by a  husband and wife hidden in a dusty corner of their attic. Lewis Caven, 25, and his wife Kerrie, 27, moved into the semi-detached house - which had previously stood empty for 18 years - back in 2010. Spanning five decades the tender letters tell a story of a couple's long distance love as they navigate the difficulties of being apart in a time where letters took weeks to cross the globe. Kerrie discovered the chest with her husband years after they had moved into the semi-detached house . The old trunk was found hidden in the roofspace last month when the couple started to clear out the attic in preparation for building an extension . The trunk contains over 800 hand written letters, telegrams, cards and notes between Henry and Moira . The majority of the hand written notes are addressed to Henry Oliver Forbes who lived at the house before Lewis and Kerrie . It is believed the couple eventually married and then lived at the house until Henry died around 20 years ago . Builder Lewis and Kerrie were stunned when they found an old trunk hidden in the roof space last month when they started to clear out the attic in preparation for building an extension. 'Darling, Here we go again! 'Thinking of you more often as usual. Let me know how things are going with you? 'In case you get to the old good USA be sure to look me up. I had changed my address.' The pair discovered around 800 love letters  inside the chest, as well as postcards, Christmas cards and even drawings. The majority of the hand written notes are addressed to Henry Oliver Forbes who lived at the house before Lewis and Kerrie. They are penned by Moira Read, who lived in Newport, South Wales, with some of them sent from as far away as Boston and Los Angeles in America - as well as Germany. The letters are dated from 1948 up until 1979 but there was also a set of Jewish prayer robes in the truck and an old canvas military sack with the name Henry Forbes printed on it. Lewis and Kerrie believe the lovestruck couple eventually married and then lived at the house until Henry died around 20 years ago. Some of the letters are sent from as far away as Boston and Los Angeles in America - as well as Germany . In the moving love letters, Moira tells Henry she has missed him and often asks why he hasn't written for a few days . The couple are desperate to find any relatives of the couple to pass on the priceless romantic letters . Neighbours have told them his wife Moira went downhill after his death and put herself into care - leaving the house empty for 18 years before it was sold to pay care home fees. Full-time mother Kerrie said she was desperate to find any relatives of the couple to pass on the priceless romantic letters. 'I've missed you an awful lot this week, darling and I wish I had you more to myself.' She added: 'The house had been empty for 18 years when we bought it and it was just as it was left when she walked out the door. 'Her dressing gown was still on the bed and the dry cleaning was still in the bedroom. All their drawers were still full and there was food in the pantry. 'I think their grandchildren were involved in selling the house but they couldn't have been interested because the estate agent asked us if we wanted to clear the house out. 'We declined because it was too big a job and I think they just got some house clearing firm in. 'Lewis and his dad were up in the attic clearing it out for the extension when they found the trunk. 'My dearest Henry, . 'This is a line so that you won't have to wait till Tues for a reply to your last letters. 'Yes darling, I didn't have your Thursday letter till yesterday morning and I had your little Friday note by the same post.' 'They brought it down to have a look and there was about 700 or 800 letters. 'We have had a flick through them and handpicked a few to read. 'Once they got married they obviously put them together because you have got both sides of the story. 'From as far as we can tell he was living here and she appeared to be living in Newport. 'All the envelopes are dated but we haven't got time to sit down and read all 800 letters in order. 'Long before the days of mobile phone text messages and emails this is how people expressed their love and you have to say it is much more romantic.' 'My darling Henry, 'm afraid I had only a minute or two to scribble a few lines last night' one letter begins . The semi-detached house lay empty for 18 years after Henry died and Moira went into a care home . Lewis, who lives with Kerrie and the couple's three children, added: 'We were starting to extend the house, so my dad and I went to clear out the attic. 'I'd been up there plenty of times before and never seen the trunk. 'My darling Henry, . 'I thought I'd drop a line now to ask you when I can expect you darling. 'I believe you'll be coming Saturday morning as I have the day off, I'd like to meet you - if you let me know the time your train is leaving Birmingham. 'I packed a few presents last night - but had several interruptions - so that I still have some cards to do. 'I'll be hoping to hear tomorrow, darling. Look after yourself. 'All my love and lots of kisses, Moira' 'The trunk was hidden right down in the eaves, wrapped in blankets.. It was as if no one wanted it to be found. 'I couldn't believe it when I looked inside and saw it was filled with letters, post cards and drawings. 'The dates on the letters go from 1948 up to 1979. I'm not too sure how far they go back, I didn't want to disturb them. 'Along with the trunk was a set of Jewish prayer robes. 'There was also an old canvas military sack with the name Henry Forbes printed on it.' In the moving love letters, Moira tells Henry she has missed him and often asks why he hasn't written for a few days. She also talks about meeting her lover for what appears to be the first time in a letter dated December 18, 1951. 'My dearest Henry, . 'After I wrote to you last night, darling, I went home to find a parcel from you waiting for me. 'After I took off the first layer, I found the Xmas packing so I didn't want to open it any further. 'At first, you see, I thought you'd insisted on sending on some rations or something but when I saw the pretty paper, I decided you'd sent it on to save packing it. 'Today I was hoping for a letter but lunch-time I received another parcel! I was sure this was rations, but again I found fancy paper and I was afraid to open it. 'Darling, did you remember that I told you I always keep parcels till Xmas day? I wondered if that was the reason. 'However I began to wonder if I was doing right - so Mom peeped inside them both to see if there was a letter, but she couldn't find one. So you see I'm none the wiser! 'Thanks for your card, darling, it was a lovely one and a nice thought. How are you Henry? 'Cherio, my darling and all my love, Moira xxx' Moira writes: 'This won't be a very long letter either but in case I won't have much time later, I thought I'd drop a line now to ask you when I can expect you darling. 'I believe you'll be coming Saturday morning as I have the day off, I'd like to meet you - if you let me know the time your train is leaving Birmingham.' The Cavens believe Moira was last known to be living at a nursing home in Coventry and are hoping her family come forward to claim the long-lost letters. Lewis said: 'I just want to return the letters to Henry's family. 'I know that if they belonged to my grandfather I would want them. Kerrie added: 'We don't know where to start looking for their family. 'We hope somebody sees it because we wouldn't just throw them out. 'If the family didn't want them then we could give them to an art gallery or museum so they can go on display - they really are a fascinating insight into quite a remarkable love story.'","Chest was discovered in attic of house by couple 3 years are moving in .

"Radamel Falcao is fit enough to withstand the rigours of the Barclays Premier League and is ready to give his all for Manchester United, according to his wife, Lorelei Taron. United manager Louis van Gaal's is becoming increasingly frustrated at not having his striker fully fit and that was evident at the weekend. Van Gaal said Falcao was in the squad for the match at Southampton on Monday 'in spite of the fact he can only play 20 minutes at this level because the rhythm of the game in the Premier League is the highest.' Radamel Falcao's wife, Lorelei Taron, uploaded the above image of her husband training at Manchester United . Louis van Gaal had previously said that Falcao was only ready to play 20 minutes a game for United . Falcao (centre) made a substitute appearance in the 78th minute in United's last match against Stoke . But the Colombia centre forward's wife Taron went on her Instagram account to pour scorn on Van Gaal's assertion. Alongside a picture of Falcao in United training attire the caption read simply: '100% ready to give everything !!!' Falcao has yet to discover the prodigious goalscoring touch he is renowned for, finding the net only once in seven appearances at United. He came on as a 78th-minute substitute during their last match, the home victory over Stoke. But if Monday's game at St Mary's sees United's resurgence continue with their fifth consecutive win, they will move above Southampton and into third in the Premier League. However, if Falcao does play a part he will be up against the top-flight's best defence. Southampton have conceded a measly 10 League goals, thanks to a back four who have barely changed all season. So Jose Fonte and Maya Yoshida are likely to be the centre halves against whom Falcao is likely to line up. And then Van Gaal will have a better idea of how ready the Colmbia star is.","Manchester United play Southampton in the Premier League on Monday .

"FIFA have concluded there is insufficient evidence to open disciplinary proceedings against Croatian side HNK Rijeka over an alleged incident of racial abuse towards young Manchester City midfielder Seko Fofana during pre-season. The club's Elite Development Side, managed by French World Cup winner Patrick Vieira, were playing their final pre-season game of a tour in Novigrad in July. Fofana, 19, was sent off by the referee after being seen to kick out at his opponent but the club subsequently revealed their belief that Fofana, usually a level-headed young man, was racially abused by opposition players moments before he lashed out. Seko Fofana, pictured on loan at Championship side Fulham, was allegedly racially abused by HNK Rijeka . Fofana, seen here tussling with Chelsea's John Swift, is part of Manchester City's Elite Development Squad . Elite Development Squad manager Patrick Vieira, once alerted to Fofana's complaint, immediately entered the pitch and after holding discussions with the referee and the City officials present, the decision was taken for his players to leave the field. The news reverberated around Europe but five months on, Sportsmail can reveal that FIFA will take no action against the Croatian team. A FIFA spokesman confirmed: 'The chairman of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee considered that, based on the information at his disposal, there were not enough elements to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings. Also in relation to this matter, the chairman was pleased to observe that Mr Davor Suker and Mr Patrick Viera engage positively to work through the issue. 'The relevant parties were notified on Friday, 5 December in the form of a letter, which also emphasised FIFA's zero-tolerance stance against any form of discrimination.' Patrick Vieira (second from right) was praised for taking his players off the pitch after the alleged incident . City have become increasingly disillusioned by what they perceive to be the weak approach of UEFA towards racism in the game and this latest decision by FIFA will rankle wtihin the walls of power at the Etihad Stadium. For the fifth time in just over two years, one of their players has allegedly become the victim of racial abuse. Previous incidents include the subjection of Mario Balotelli and Yaya Toure to monkey noises in European competition, a banana being launched at Gael Clichy in a friendly at Limerick and Devante Cole, a young talent, receiving relentless abuse in a youth tournament in Madrid. Fofana, pictured in action against Brighton, saw HNK Rijeka deny City's accusations of racial abuse . Vieira was praised in the summer by anti-racism groups but the Croatian side accused Vieira and his staff of an 'illogical decision.' Ranko Buketa, the sport co-ordinator of HNK Rijeka, said: 'It seems that this is the way in which they are trying to hide a very hard tackle from a Manchester City player that resulted in an exclusion, followed by a hasty and illogical decision of the Manchester City coaching staff on the withdrawal of the team from the field. The game was most of all within the limits of fair play.' He added that the fact they had six Nigerian players was evidence of their commitment to challenging racial prejudice.","The alleged incident occurred during a friendly in Novigrad in July .

"Barack Obama welcomed a future king at the Oval Office today. Prince William made a whirlwind solo visit to Washington, D.C., today to meet the president and deliver a speech at the World Bank on stopping illegal wildlife trafficking. The Duke of Cambridge then flew back to New York City this afternoon on a 2pm shuttle - in time to meet former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea in the Big Apple. During a brief public chat between Obama and Prince William at the White House, the royal revealed that he was so excited after the birth of Prince George that he forgot to ask whether he was a boy or a girl. 'I remember when George was born, I forgot to work out whether it was a boy or a girl. The excitement of the event and everything else was just chaos. You are suddenly... well actually it's a boy,' he joked. Landmark: Prince William, who is second in like to the British throne, was invited to the White House by President Barack Obama . Whirlwind trip: The Duke of Cambridge,  32, will also deliver a speech to the World Bank about stopping illegal wildlife traffic, one of his pet causes . The Duke of Cambridge is also in Washington to deliver a speech at the World Bank on stopping wildlife trafficking, an issue that the young royal is championing . The prince, who also met with Vice President Joe Biden, discussed the 'special relationship' between Great Britain and and the United States. Biden discussed the ongoing efforts to combat ISIS. A Kensington Palace spokesman revealed that Prince William gave the Commander in Chief of the United States a signed portrait of himself and Kate - which is said to be the customary gift for such occasions. His audience with Obama at the White House is groundbreaking. Price William is second in line to the British throne - after his father Prince Charles - and it's entirely possible he won't become head of state for several decades. Prince William left his pregnant wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, in New York City - where the couple arrived Sunday night to a rock star welcome. Kate visited a center for disadvantaged children in Harlem in Manhattan with New York City's First Lady, Chirlane McCray. The Duchess of Cambridge didn't accompany her husband to the White House because the visit was not confirmed until after she had agreed to go to Harlem with Ms McCray, Kensington Palace said. Obama and the prince have  met before - but never on the president's home turf. The last time the two met was at the 70th anniversary commemoration of D-Day in Normandy. The Duke of Cambridge flew first class on a shuttle flight this morning into Washington's Reagan National Airport. He will return to New York this evening to watch the Brooklyn Nets take on LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Taking a stand: At the World Bank, Prince Williams said, 'In my view, one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today is the illegal wildlife trade' The Duke of Cambridge praised China's efforts to crack down on traffic in shark fins - while also mentioning that a large demand for illegal ivory comes from the nation . Prince William was greeted by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim before his speech, in which he called on nations to do more to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade . The prince later met with conservation officials from around the world at a luncheon following his speech . Better safe than sorry: Police broke into a suspicious SUV outside the World Bank shortly before Prince William arrived - but determined it was safe . Prince William and Obama’s conversation could barely be heard above the clicking of cameras and reporters shouting questions, but the two could be seen laughing and smiling as the chatted. He commented that next year will be very busy. 'It's going to be interesting next year. A busy year next year,' he remarked. Prince William and Kate's second child is due in April. The couple also have officials visits planned to Japan and China. Noting the large group of reporters crammed into the room, a surprised William remarked that 'you can’t get any more people in the room.’ The president thanked reporters for coming and for their interest in William's ‘very important work.’ The only question he took from press was about his health, following recent reports of a sore throat that tests proved to be the result of acid reflux. ‘I’m fine. I was completely fine,’ he assured. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill also greeted the prince in Washington, though that meeting was closed to the press. The White House said: 'The President and Duke of Cambridge discussed the long and special relationship between the UK and the United States. In addition, the Duke of Cambridge briefed the president on his initiative to combat the illegal wildlife trade, an issue to which the president and this administration are strongly committed. 'Vice President and Dr. Biden discussed our bilateral relationship and global challenges, such as the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, as well as efforts to support our two countries' wounded warrior through the Invictus Games, which Dr. Biden attended earlier this year in London.' Prince William is also gave speech at the World Bank today for the International Corruption Hunters Alliance on how to stop poaching and wildlife trafficking. Prince William flew first class to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., on Monday morning after arriving at New York's JFK International Airport on Sunday night . Dominican golfer Willy Pumarol posted this picture of the prince flying first class aboard the 2pm US Airways shuttle from Reagan National Airport to New York . Prince William, spotted leaving Washington at Reagan National Airport, took the 2pm US Airways shuttle flight to New York . Landing with a bump: Prince William and Kate got the royal welcome when they arrived in New York City on Sunday night for a whirlwind official visit . 'In my view, one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today is the illegal wildlife trade,' he said. 'Some endangered species are now literally worth more than their weight in gold, which makes it even harder for governments and international bodies to counter this trade. For example, according to some reports, in China and South East Asia the wholesale street price of ivory has increased from $5 to $2,100 per kilogram in 25 years. And this is reflected in increases in poaching.' However, he singled out China as taking steps to combat poaching - despite it being the world's largest market for illegally trafficked goods. 'Another highly commendable example is in China, where the government working in partnership with local NGOs is successfully curbing the trade in shark fins,' he said. Stayed behind: While her husband was meeting President Barack Obama, Hate, the Duchess of Cambridge, met New York City's First Lady, Chirlane McCray in Harlem . Kate met children at the Northside Center for Childhood Development in Harlem in Manhattan - part of her charity outreach . She was greeted with a bouquet of roses and hundreds of adoring fans - despite some students saying they thought Princess Elsa from Disney's Frozen would be coming instead of Kate . Obama has called the issue 'a devastating environmental problem' and applauded the Duke of Cambridge's activism. Prince William rejoined his wife back in New York by mid-afternoon. He boarded a 2pm US Airways shuttle flight - flying first class again. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper happened to be on the same flight. 'I'm hoping this means on-time departure,' Cooper quipped. Prince William's surprise invitation to the White House shows that he is working to become the new public face of the Royal Family as his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, approaches her 90s. The prince, who is training as an air ambulance pilot in England, has only once before visited the United States on official business - in 2011 when he and Kate made a brief stop in California following a tour of Canada. This is also the first trip for the Duke and Duchess that does not have them visiting a Commonwealth nation. Here are excerpts from Prince William's speech to the World Bank today on combating illegal wildlife trafficking: .","Prince William flew first class to Washington, D.C., on Monday to meet President Obama at the White House .

"A Turkish mayor highlighted the plight of the visually impaired on an international disabled day by slapping a blind man around the back of the head. Spectators at a public rally gasped when Altinok Oz cuffed Ozgur Ugur on the back of the head as the latter addressed the crowd on the United Nations' World Disability Day. Then as Mr Ugur span on his heels to work out what had happened, the grinning politician made a 'shhh' gesture before surprising his fellow speaker with a friendly kiss. Scroll down for video . Funny? Spectators gasped when Turkish mayor Altinok Oz cuffed Ozgur Ugur, who is blind, on the back of his head during a rally in Istanbul for the United Nations' World Disability Day . Mr Ugur had been speaking at an event in the western city of Istanbul, organised by Turkey's Republican People's Party, as the political group's main spokesman for disability, when Mayor Oz played his trick. What followed appeared like a pantomime farce as Mr Ugur, representative of the municipality's disabled people unit, slowly turned the wrong way in an effort to locate his assailant. Mr Oz gestured for people to remain quiet and allowed Mr Ugur to spin a full 270 degrees before halting his search and kissing him on both cheeks, to laughs from the watching crowd. The UN warns that people with disabilities are at higher risk of violence, stigma and discrimination. So perhaps Mr Oz, mayor of Istanbul's Kartal district, was trying to make a clever point. If it did it fell flat and his bizarre antics led to an avalanche of outraged calls for his resignation. One online commenter, Selcuk Potuk, said: 'Is he out of his mind? Is he drunk? How can anyone think abusing a blind man is funny? He has to go.' He's behind you! What followed appeared like a pantomime farce as Mr Ugur, representative of the municipality's disabled people unit, slowly turned the wrong way in an effort to locate his assailant . Wait for it: As Mr Ugur span on his heels to work out what happened, grinning Mayor Oz made a 'ssh' gesture . More than a billion people - about 15 per cent of the world's population - live with some form of disability, according to the UN. The supranational body says people with disabilities generally have poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities. Observing the Day, marked annually on December 3, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said disabled people face limitations and hardships largely due to the lack of services available to them. 'Through adaptive, assistive and inclusive technology, persons with disabilities can make the most of their potential in their communities and in the workplace,' said Mr. Ban. Evidence shows that when barriers to their inclusion are removed and persons with disabilities are empowered to participate fully in societal life, their entire community benefits, the UN said. The punchline: Mayor Oz stopped his fellow speaker three-quarters of his way around a full spin and surprised him with a kiss on both cheeks. Despite criticism, his spokesman said the gesture was 'just a joke' Despite the brickbats he faced for his apparently insensitive display, Mr Oz refused to back down, claiming he and Mr Ugur were friends and it had just been a joke. A spokesman for the Town Hall public relations department claimed the pair were 'as close as father and son', adding 'this was just a joke. It was a bit like a ritual greeting.' The statement, seen by Turkey's Hurriyet Daily News, also quoted Mr Ugur defending the mayor by calling the gesture a 'beautiful greeting'. He was quoted as saying: 'Can’t people see the full picture? Are they blind?'","Then politician made 'ssh' gesture, before surprising speaker with a kiss .

"Yannick Bolasie showed off his trickery with a stunning '360 flick' during Crystal Palace's 0-0 draw against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. And the Eagles winger also showed he has a sense of humour as he responded to accusations from BBC Match of the Day pundits that he did not know what he was doing. To show it was no fluke, Bolasie  posted a video on his Instagram on Monday which featured footage of him doing it on two previous occasions. Yannick Bolasie is facing away from the pitch with Spurs' Christian Eriksen putting him under pressure . The Palace star has the ball under control, using both feet, as Eriksen closes in . The slightest touch from Bolasie's right boot plays it over Eriksen and leaves him stranded . And he's off, heading for the byline after the perfect execution of his trick . Bolasie wrote on Instagram: 'I actually don't know what am doing.' The trick was the highlight of a dull goalless draw at White Hart Lane - and Bolasie later revealed it was inspired by Brazilian legend Ronaldinho. Bolasie told the Mirror: 'I don’t do too many tricks like that on the pitch. It was a 360 and a flick.

"Manchester United are moving closer to making £30million England star Luke Shaw their first signing of the summer. United have been fighting with Barclays Premier League rivals Chelsea for the 18-year-old left back’s signature as the soon-to-be-deposed champions look to bounce back quickly from their wretched first season under David Moyes. The United manager had feared Chelsea would win the race as Shaw is a boyhood fan of the  London club and had attended their development centre when he was just eight years old.

Honoured: Shaw (left) received his first senior England cap in a friendly against Denmark in March . However, Sportsmail understands that Shaw is attracted by the promise of regular first-team football at United and has told the Old Trafford club he will make the switch if they can agree terms with Southampton. United have more than £100m available for transfers this summer and are ready to spend big to land Shaw ahead of the departure of current left back Patrice Evra, the 32-year-old fading France defender. After being caught out last summer when United left it too late to land their major transfer targets, Old Trafford chief executive Ed Woodward wants to close the deal for Shaw before the World Cup in Brazil. Woodward is also working hard to finalise a big-money move for Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho. Target: Manchester United are interested in a move for Sporting Lisbon defensive midfielder William Carvalho . Busy: Manchester United executive vice chairman Ed Woodward is already working on transfer deals . Talent: Carvalho has attracted interest after a standout season in Portugal with Sporting . Sportsmail revealed last month that United had opened negotiations with the Portuguese club for the 21-year-old and they have since been talking to Sporting about finding a way round a £37m buy-out clause that they believe to be excessive. Nevertheless, Shaw is the current priority as United believe if they can sign him it would send out a message to their rivals and to other targets around Europe that they can still attract the top talent to Old Trafford. Shaw has one England cap and has been one of the stars of the Premier League season. United will offer him a starting salary of £80,000 a week.","Manchester United close to making Luke Shaw first signing of summer .

"The biblical film 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' has come under fire for white actors being cast in the main roles as Egyptians. But director Ridley Scott has a message for those trying to boycott the movie: 'I say, 'Get a life.'' Scott said he had to assemble the 'best possible cast ... on a budget of this scale.' The film cost an estimated $140 million. Scroll down for video . Christian Bale,  left, Ridley Scott, center, and Joel Edgerton, right attend an after party for the premiere of 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' at The Brooklyn Museum. Scott has said critics boycotting the movie over the racial makeup of the cast should 'get a life' Twitter users are urging a boycott of Exodus: Gods and Kings, which tells the story of Moses, calling it ‘offensive’ and ‘unacceptable’ that white actors are playing the roles of Egyptians. While a number of ethnic minority actors have also been cast, including Sir Ben Kingsley, the majority of the non-white performers are in background roles, often even playing slaves or criminals. But this has done little to placate the critics. One Twitter user said: ‘I’ll be boycotting Exodus and so should everyone else to tell Hollywood that whitewashing is sick and unacceptable’, while another called the casting of Oscar-winner Bale as ‘offensive’. Twitter users have expressed their issues with the casting with the hashtag #boycottexodusmovie . At Medium, writer David Dennis Jr. called the film 'racist.' 'Not only are these characters who are supposed to be Africans White, they’re not even remotely tan. They’re pearly White,' he writes. Actor Christian Bale supported his director, saying working with him was 'a true partnership.' Bale said he was surprised when Scott wanted to cast him as Moses. 'Then I did some research and just found it to be too fascinating to pass it up,' he said. The Oscar-winning actor understands the controversy over the film's casting choices, though he sees the business side of it. 'No doubt it would have been a melting pot between Europe and the Middle East and North Africa,' Bale said. But he praised Scott for doing what was needed to finance the movie. 'He's been incredibly honest in getting a large, big-budget film like this made,' he said. Ridley Scott, left, and Giannina Facio, right, attend the premiere of 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' Bale was alluding to the fact that investors feel safer with big-name actors. 'I don't think fingers should be pointed, but we should all look at ourselves and say, 'Are we supporting wonderful actors in films by North African and Middle Eastern filmmakers and actors, because there are some fantastic actors out there,' Bale said. He said he feels audiences can help international actors who are lesser known in the Western world get cast in major films. 'If people start supporting those films more and more, then financiers in the market will follow,' Bale said. Christian Bale, left, with Sibi Blazic, has said he feels audiences can help international actors who are lesser known in the Western world get cast in major films . 'The audience has to show financiers that they will be there, and (then) they could make a large budget film.' Bale said the time will come when another film about Moses will be cast with a North African or Middle Eastern actor. 'To me that would be a day of celebration. For the actors it would be wonderful.

By the end of a disappointing loss against Newcastle, Spurs supporters were yearning for bygone glory days.

To rub salt in their wounds their unravelling took place in front of club greats Ray Clemence, Martin Chivers, Alan Mullery and Pat Jennings, who were among the special guests at White Hart Lane as Spurs commemorated the 10th anniversary of legendary manager Bill Nicholson’s death. Their supporters taunted Newcastle manager Alan Pardew with chants of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ after Emmanuel Adebayor handed the home side a first-half lead. But Pardew had the last laugh as both his half-time changes — Sammy Ameobi and Remy Cabella — played crucial roles in a stunning Newcastle comeback. Ameobi equalised, just six seconds after the restart, while Cabella laid on Ayoze Perez’s winner, all before the hour mark. ‘To start the second half by conceding in the first action — a stupid goal,’ lamented Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino. ‘It was a shock because after that, it all changed in this moment. 'Seven or six seconds before, all was happiness and there was good energy in the stadium. ‘In this moment, I think it was difficult to manage in our head. Our heads had gone and we started to take rash decisions on the pitch.’ It was Pardew’s astute decision making that turned this game on its head. Substitutions change football matches but in this case, they may have saved Pardew’s job. Emmanuel Adebayor scores the game's first goal at White Hart Lane to give Tottenham a 1-0 lead against Newcastle . Tottenham's Adebayor's header finds its way towards the goal with Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul looking on . Adebayor's header gave Tottenham the lead but they couldn't hold on to the advantage at home on Sunday . Where did Ayoze Perez come from? Newcastle beat a host of Spanish clubs to sign the 21-year-old from Tenerife for £1.5m. Why was there so much interest? Sixteen goals in Spain’s second tier alerted the Magpies and others. How has he done at Newcastle? His headed winner broke a goalscoring duck after seven substitute appearances. And that won him a start? Well, he was at the front of the queue when Papiss Cisse failed a fitness test before the game. Alan Pardew must have been delighted with him... He was, and here’s what he said: ‘He’s a really great individual talent. The players love him so they were really made up he scored the winner.’ After issuing a half-time rollicking to his side for their inept opening 45 minutes at White Hart Lane, the under-pressure manager threw on Ameobi and Cabella in an attempt to stir a revival. ‘We were giving too much possession to Tottenham, too much space,’ said Pardew. ‘We never made a challenge. And we were fortunate to come in at 1-0, so I reminded them about the fundamentals of a Premier League game and we came out with a much stronger attitude. ‘There were a few strong words. It’s not nice as a manager to go in and bark out orders but sometimes it’s necessary just to shake people up because we needed shaking up.’ And it all started so well for the home side, as they dominated the opening exchanges, in terms of possession at least. Christian Eriksen’s half-volley from distance proved the highlight of a drab opening 15 minutes, as Spurs failed to turn their possession into goalscoring opportunities. It took 18 minutes for them to fashion a clear-cut chance — and with it came the opening goal. Steven Taylor did well to block Nacer Chadli’s fierce shot, but he was helpless to prevent Ryan Mason pouncing on the rebound to stand-up an inviting back-post cross that Adebayor nodded past goalkeeper Tim Krul.

Danny Rose fired wildly over the bar after Eriksen and Erik Lamela combined to set-up the left back, as Spurs put their foot down. Rose then thought he should have been awarded a penalty as he crossed paths with Gabriel Obertan, but referee Anthony Taylor dismissed Spurs protests, and rightly so after replays showed contact — if any — was made outside the box. Chadli wasted a good chance in the final moments of the first half — volleying Eriksen’s free kick over the bar when he had ample time to take a touch. Pochettino would have been satisfied with his side’s first-half display, if not overjoyed. With more cutting edge and creativity, Spurs should have been out of sight. Pardew knew it too, as Cabella and Ameobi replaced the ineffective Obertan and Vurnon Anita. Straight from the kick-off, Jack Colback found Ameobi, who steamed past Eric Dier down the left, and then neatly finished across Hugo Lloris. Pochettino showed little emotion on the home bench, but he must have been furious. His side, who had looked so comfortable in the first-half, were now firmly on the ropes. So goodness knows what he was thinking when Newcastle took a 58th-minute lead when Cabella’s cross from the left was glanced home by Perez, who was making his first league start for Newcastle after seven appearances from the bench.

"When Southampton waved goodbye to arguably their three best defenders in the summer, no-one would have predicted them becoming the clean sheet kings of the Barclays Premier League by December. Yet the Saints go into Monday night’s match against Manchester United boasting the best defensive record in the English top flight. Lose Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers? No problem, at least not so far, for Ronald Koeman’s team. Nathaniel Clyne has been in fine form for Southampton this season under new boss Ronald Koeman . Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster has proven himself to be one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League . Jose Fonte (centre) and Victor Wanyama (right) have helped the Saints to seven Premier League clean sheets . Fewest goals conceded in the top-flight this season (top five): . Southampton - 10 goals . Chelsea - 13 goals . Manchester City - 14 goals . Manchester United - 16 goals . Swansea City - 17 goals . Southampton have conceded a measly 10 League goals, thanks to a back four who have barely changed all season. Add the giant goalkeeping presence of Fraser Forster, plus pass-breaker Victor Wanyama in front of the defence, and that is one formidable hurdle. Nathaniel Clyne, Jose Fonte and Ryan Bertrand have been ever-presents while Toby Alderweireld has played 10 matches. Alderweireld is struggling to make the United game, which means a possible call for Maya Yoshida, who has not let anyone down either. Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and/or Radamel Falcao may think that Southampton’s three-match run without a win means there might be easy pickings at St Mary’ s. Not if Saints can help it. First Fonte. He has been part of the fixtures and fittings for a few years now and at the age of 30 provides a steady head for the younger players. The Portuguese reads the game and marshals his team-mates. Chelsea loanee Ryan Bertrand shows his pace down the flank against Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla . Toby Alderweireld is a doubt for Southampton's clash with United after picking up an injury against Arsenal . Clyne might have been forgiven for wondering what he had done wrong in the summer as Chambers and Shaw headed off to Arsenal and Manchester United. Nothing at all, from Roy Hodgson’s point of view. Clyne, 23, is in the England coach’s plans thanks to his club performances. He has also chipped in with three goals, which is an unexpected and pleasant bonus. Bertrand must love living out of a suitcase. The left back, on loan from Chelsea, is on his seventh temporary move and appears to find the south coast to his liking. The 25-year-old had the misfortune of being at Stamford Bridge while a certain Ashley Cole was monopolising his position. No-one doubted Bertrand’s potential but he is finally getting the opportunity to prove himself a headline act. So to Alderweireld, who is living up to his classy CV. The 25-year-old Belgian, brought up the Ajax way, has played in the Champions League final (for Atletico Madrid) and the World Cup in 2014, which makes the Premier League a less-daunting proposition. He is on loan from Atleticoand doubtful for the United game with a thigh injury, which opens the door to Yoshida. The Japanese defender made 13 appearances last season and this year has started four games in the Premier League. Yoshida, 26, may be an understudy but he knows what makes Southampton tick after joining from Venlo two years ago. Southampton boss Koeman has hinted that he may promote a couple of his youngsters to the bench, too. Defender Jason McCarthy will be hoping that he gets a close-up view of the seniors.

"Two teenagers have died after they were thrown from the flatbed of a pickup truck after it lost control and flipped over several times. Seven Lakes High School football star, 17-year-old Trent Weber, and Cinco Ranch High School sophomore, 16-year-old Terra Kubala, were killed in the crash in Katy, Texas on Saturday night. The teens were in the back of the Toyota pickup truck with as many as eight other schoolmates as it drove to a bonfire, authorities said. The 18-year-old male driver lost control, causing the vehicle to roll three times along Luna Vista Lane at around 11.30pm, KPRC reported. Scroll down for video . Loss: Trent Weber, 17 (left), and Terra Kubala, 16 (right), both died after the truck they were riding in on Saturday night crashed on the way to a bonfire night. The driver and four others were also injured . Deputies say the driver, who has not been identified, and four other teenagers suffered significant but non-life-threatening injuries. They say at least five teenagers were in the cab of the truck and as many as 10 were in the bed. No charges have been filed against the driver but an investigation is being carried out by the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office. After news emerged of the death, two separate vigils were held for the beloved teens on Sunday. Students gathered at the football field at Seven Lakes to remember Weber, the wide receiver for the Spartans. He was known as 'Spider-Man' because he could catch whatever was thrown at him. Loved: Weber, pictured with his mother, was known as 'Spider Man' because he could catch any throw . Missed: School friends said that Kubala always had a smile on her face and improved everyone's day . 'Everybody loved that kid, everybody loved him, everybody was his friend because he was so kind to everyone,' said Trent's teammate, Andy Garcia. Weber was a big brother to three younger siblings. At Cinco Ranch High School, more than 300 friends and classmates gathered to remember Kubala. Friends said she always had a smile on her face. Classmate Teagan Schmidt told Fox26: 'She's just a ball of sunshine.' 'She always had a smile on her face and she was so much fun to be around,' added another friend, Natalie Nesbit.

"Mark Zuckerberg has been photographed with a copy of Chinese President Xi Jinping's book on governance at his desk while hosting a top Internet regulator from China, known for tight censorship. The Facebook founder, who has long sought market access to China, where the social network is blocked, was quoted by China.com.cn as saying he purchased several copies of Xi's book so he and colleagues could learn about 'socialism with Chinese characteristics.' The California-based company did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding the visit to Facebook's offices by Internet regulator Lu Wei. Mark Zuckerberg pictured at his desk with the president of China's book on the table as he hosts a top Internet regulator from China, Lu Wei . The gesture, interpreted as an effort by Zuckerberg to court the government, disappointed and angered activists in China, who have long held the social networking company in high regard for its ability to share information beyond the controls of the ruling Communist Party. 'Mr. Zuckerberg is either ignorant of China's politics or shameless,' said prominent dissident Hu Jia, who called Lu a top enemy of Internet freedom and expressed worry that technology giants such as Facebook were kowtowing to Beijing for their own business interests. 'He is an Internet genius who should understand the power of technology for social change.' China.com.cn, controlled by China's Internet Information Office and another government agency, said the photo was taken at Facebook's Menlo Park office and that Xi's book 'The Governance of China' was at Zuckerberg's workstation when he hosted Lu. 'I bought this book for my colleagues as well,' Zuckerberg was quoted as telling Lu. 'I want them to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics.' The photo shows a beaming Lu sitting in Zuckerberg's work chair, with the Facebook founder smiling and standing next to him. 'In that photo, Lu Wei looks the part of a boss,' Hu said in a phone interview. 'I feel ashamed for Facebook and sorry for Mr. Zuckerberg. When you yield to the executioners of the Internet, they will only become more arrogant.' A cartoon posted online showed Zuckerberg in a Chinese military outfit holding a bayonet and clutching Xi's book to his chest. Some commenters joked that he was close to joining the Communist Party of China, although others suggested that Zuckerberg might have placed Xi's book on his desk merely for show. It was not clear when the visit took place, but Lu was in the United States last week to attend a Chinese-American Internet conference at which Beijing pushed for a louder voice in the management of the Internet. China also argued in favor of the concept of 'information sovereignty,' which could help justify its tight controls over Internet information. Zuckerberg surprised Chinese college students in Beijing in October when he chatted with them for 30 minutes in Mandarin, in a move widely seen as an attempt to court Chinese good will.

"Andros Townsend has spoken of his frustration at not playing regularly for Tottenham with Mauricio Pochettino reluctant to use the winger in the Barclays Premier League. Townsend was selected in Roy Hodgson’s 26-man England squad for games against Slovenia and Scotland next week, but has fallen out of favour at White Hart Lane. The winger has played just 109 minutes in four substitute Premier League appearances this season, and has mainly been used in the Europa League and Capital One Cup. Andros Townsend (left) is keen on getting some more Premier League minutes under his belt . Townsend was in impressive form during his side's 2-1 win against Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League . Townsend has revealed he wants to make himself 'hard to drop' like club team-mate Harry Kane . The 23-year-old opened the scoring against Asteras Tripolis on Thursday in the Europa League with a penalty, before going on to set Harry Kane up to double Tottenham’s lead in Greece. It was Townsend’s first goal and assist in the competition as the north London club won 2-1. And the attacker has been looking to Kane for inspiration who, while awaiting a senior England call up, is being handed more Premier League opportunities by Pochettino. ‘It’s difficult. You are a footballer and you want to play every week and every single game but you have got to be patient,’ Townsend said. ‘When you get your Europa League or Capital One Cup games you have got to make an impression like Harry Kane has done. ‘You have got to score goals and make yourself hard to drop and I think Harry Kane has done that. ‘He has got 10 goals in cup games, he has made himself hard to drop and I am looking to do the same for now.’ Townsend showed composure from the penalty spot to score past goalkeeper Tomas Kosicky . Mauricio Pochettino has favoured the likes of Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen in the Premier League . Townsend’s selection comes a year after he scored against Montenegro at Wembley as England all but guaranteed their place at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The goal was later voted the fans’ favourite of qualifying, although the winger missed the tournament in Brazil due to ankle ligament damage. But the man who has been on loan to nine different clubs since 2009 believes his most recent call up can help his Premier League ambitions. ‘The last time I got called up I trained really well,’ he added. ‘I was rewarded with 25 minutes against San Marino and scored another goal so it was good the manager (Hodgson) showed faith in me. ‘I'm going to go away, work my socks off for a week, 10 days, and hopefully I can get some more game time. ‘I think the manager (Pochettino) realises every time I have been called upon for my country I have done myself justice. ‘So hopefully I can keep playing well when called upon for my national team and come back to my club after that and hopefully establish myself in the Premier League.’","Tottenham winger Andros Townsend is frustrated at his lack of minutes in the Premier League .

"Creating a space elevator on Earth has been considered as a possible way to cheaply and easily get things into space - either for building structures or providing supplies to a space station. But a team of experts are instead suggesting we should build one on the moon, to get useful material from the lunar surface. And in a newly released video the infrastructure that might make this possible has been revealed. Scroll down for video . A Washington-based company is planning to build an elevator on the moon. The LiftPort Group says it could be up and running by the end of 2019. Their design will involve an 'anchor' that is drilled into the lunar surface. Rovers will then scoop up material, to be transport to a space station in orbit . The Washington-based venture known as the LiftPort Group received about £70,000 ($110,000) worth of funding on Kickstarter back in September 2012. In October this year they also ran a Kickstarter to make a short film called 'Shoot the moon' about the project, which was also fully funded to just over £24,000 ($37,000). And the group says they can have their ambitious proposal up and running by the end of 2019. In September of this year dreams of taking an elevator into space were given a boost after researchers created ultra-thin, super-strong nanothreads made from diamonds. The threads are made up of a long, thin strand of carbon atoms arranged in the same way as the inside of a diamond. The discovery could finally be the breakthrough needed to hoist and support cosmic elevators that would transport people into the atmosphere. The research was carried out by John Badding, a professor of chemistry at Penn State University, and the findings were published in the journal Nature Materials. Their plan is to use a ‘ribbon’ cable to transport material, robots and even humans to and from the surface of the moon. It will be attached to a space station in a Lagrange Point around the moon, which is a position where the moon and Earth’s gravity cancel out, so a spacecraft or station can remain stationary. The cable from the station, dubbed the PicoGravity Laboratory (PGL), will drop down to a location on the moon known as Sinus Medii - which is roughly in the middle of the face that looks towards Earth. On the surface will be the Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure (nicknamed Elsie) Anchor Station. One of the main purposes of this structure will be mining the surface of the moon. The company plans to release rovers, which will extract valuable elements from the lunar soil. This will include rare Earth elements and helium-3, which can then either be shipped to Earth or stored in space to be used as fuel. The cable from the station, dubbed the PicoGravity Laboratory (PGL), will drop down to a location on the moon known as Sinus Medii (shown) - which is roughly in the middle of the face that looks towards Earth . To construct the space station, LiftGroup plans to use a counterweight. This involves ‘balancing’ the station in orbit with an object so that it stays in position. For this lunar elevator, the counterweight would be placed at the top of the 155,000 mile-long (250,000km) ribbon, where it would be held in place by Earth’s gravitational field. What material this ribbon will be made of, however, has not yet been revealed. The other end of the station will be anchored to the moon, using drills to keep it attached to the surface. And, like the ISS, the orbiting station around the moon will be modular - so more and more parts can be added over time. 'LiftPort Group is throwing all of its weight behind the Lunar Elevator,' the company writes on their website. 'The Lunar Space Elevator Infrastructure  will serve as both testing ground and demonstration of the feats mankind can accomplish when people work together. 'It’ll be a great opportunity to build on current research findings, and in the design and construction we know we’ll develop materials and engineering techniques and gain technical knowledge that will apply to the design of Earth’s space elevator.' To construct the space station, LiftGroup plans to use a counterweight. For this lunar elevator, the counterweight would be placed at the top of the 155,000 mile-long (250,000km) ribbon, where it would be held in place by Earth’s gravitational field (shown in illustration) LiftGroup says their design could be a precursor to an Earth-based space elevator system (Nasa illustration shown), which could make the transportation of material from Earth's surface into space much easier .","Washington-based company is planning to build an elevator on the moon .

"A fortnight ago, Ayoze Perez was best known for a YouTube clip which showed him weaving between four Carlisle defenders and scoring in front of a handful of onlookers at Newcastle United’s training ground. His brother, Samuel, was arguably getting more attention turning out for Blyth Spartans in the Northern League. Not anymore. For the past week has seen the 21-year-old graduate from internet viral to the big screen.

First, there was the winning goal at Spurs on his full Premier League debut. Then, alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, he picked up a pair of awards at a glitzy ceremony in Spain. And to cap it off, it was he who came from the bench to nick Newcastle’s winner against Liverpool on Saturday. ‘It feels incredible,’ said the £1.5million former Tenerife forward, who scored 16 times in Spain’s second tier last season. ‘I couldn’t ask for any more. It is a dream come true for me. To make the jump from a team like Tenerife to playing in the Premier League is incredible really. It is something that I always wanted to do. ‘It’s been a really good week with the two goals, but more importantly because it’s the fourth consecutive win for the team. It has been a really good time for the club.’ And what of those awards? Best breakthrough player and best attacking midfielder in Segunda Division. ‘It was a very important night for me and it was very emotional to go back to Spain and win the awards,’ he said. ‘It was amazing to be surrounded by so many world class players and it means a lot to me. I think it is the reward for all the hard work I have put in to the start of my career when I was in Spain.’ Perez was crowned the best breakthrough player and best attacking midfielder in Segunda Division last week .

Facundo Ferreyra (right) takes a shot during Newcastle training as Perez (centre) tries to make a challenge . Ayoze Perez’s strike for Newcastle United in the 1-0 win over Liverpool ensured this game’s ability to keep producing goals continues. These clubs have not shared a 0-0 draw since February 1974. It is all a far cry from behind-closed-doors practice matches against League Two opposition. Perez scored four in an 8-0 win that afternoon and his new team-mates are said to be quite taken with the Under-21 international, who had offers from Barcelona and Real Madrid before joining the Magpies in June. The intention, however, was to stagger his introduction to the senior set-up. Rather, his impact has been staggering. ‘There was a lot of interest in me from some very important teams, but I always knew that Newcastle would be the right move and the last few results have just proved that,’ he said. The former Tenerife striker holds his shirt and gestures with joy after scoring the winner on Saturday . Perez (left) and Newcastle team-mate Mehdi Abeid acknowledge the crowd following their fourth straight win . ‘I know I made the right decision and I am very happy here.’ He added: ‘I definitely feel ahead of schedule. I always hoped I could do well but things have been very good and I am feeling great here. I feel like I’m settling in well and I just can’t wait to play more games now because I feel like when I play I can score more goals.’ His headed winner at Spurs was followed by a predatory stab against Liverpool, seizing upon a mistake by compatriot Alberto Moreno to pierce Simon Mignolet’s target. And manager Alan Pardew feels Perez is a natural in the penalty box. ‘He has a knack,’ said the United boss, whose own position is now safe on the back of four straight wins. ‘He has a lot to learn about the English Premier League but you know that if something falls for him he will score. You sometimes get a player who can do it in training but not on matchday, but he has shown he can do that and has had a fabulous week.’ From YouTube to Match of the Day, the rookie striker is certainly passing his Premier League screen test.

"Geologists in Ohio have for the first time linked earthquakes in a geologic formation deep under the Appalachians to hydraulic fracturing, leading the state to issue new permit conditions in certain areas that are among the nation's strictest. A state investigation of five small tremors last month in the Youngstown area, in the Appalachian foothills, found the injection of sand and water that accompanies hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the Utica Shale may have increased pressure on a small, unknown fault, said State Oil & Gas Chief Rick Simmers. He called the link 'probable'. While earlier studies had linked earthquakes in the same region to deep-injection wells used for disposal of fracking wastewater, this marks the first time tremors in the region have been tied directly to fracking, Simmers said. The five seismic events in March couldn't be easily felt by people. Probable link: Officials say a series of tremors in Youngstown, Ohio last month were linked to fracking (pictured, a brine injection well owned by Northstar Disposal  Services LLC in 2011) Balancing goals: Officials say drilling in Ohio's Utica shale region nearly doubled the output of oil and natural gas there since 2011, but there are concerns fracking has been responsible for a series of small quakes in March (pictured, a large drilling rig sits outside the Covelli Center in 2011) The oil and gas drilling boom targets widely different rock formations around the nation, so the Ohio findings may not have much relevance to other areas other than perhaps influencing public perception of fracking's safety. The types of quakes connected to the industry are generally small and not easily felt, but the idea of human activity causing the earth to shake often doesn't sit well. The state says the company that set off the Ohio quakes was following rules and appeared to be using common practices. It just got unlucky, Simmers said. Gerry Baker, associate executive director of the Interstate Oil and Gas Commission, said state regulators across the nation will study the Ohio case for any implications for the drilling industry. A consortium of states has already begun discussions. Fracking involves pumping huge volumes of water, sand and chemicals underground to split open rocks to allow oil and gas to flow. Improved technology has allowed energy companies to gain access to huge stores of natural gas but has raised widespread concerns that it might lead to groundwater contamination and earthquakes. On hold: This brine injection well owned by Northstar Disposal Services LLC in Youngstown (pictured 2011) has halted operations after a series of small earthquakes hit the area . A U.S. government-funded report released in 2012 found that two worldwide instances of shaking can be attributed to actual extraction of oil and gas, as opposed to wastewater disposal in the ground - a magnitude-2.8 quake in Oklahoma and a magnitude-2.3 quake in England. Both were in 2011. Later, the Canadian government tied quakes in British Columbia's Horn River Basin between 2009 and 2011 to fracking. Those led to stricter regulations, which news reports indicated had little effect on the pace or volume of drilling. But for the region encompassing Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, where energy companies have drilled thousands of unconventional gas wells in recent years, it's a first. The Utica Shale lies beneath the better-known Marcellus Shale, which is more easily accessible and is considered one of the world's richest gas reserves. Glenda Besana-Ostman, a former seismologist with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, confirmed the finding is the first in the area to suggest a connection between the quakes and fracking. A deep-injection wastewater well in the same region of Ohio was found to be the likely cause of a series of quakes in 2012. 'No fracking': Ohio State Rep. Bob Hagan participates in an anti-fracking rally outside of Wells Academy/Steubenville High School on February 7, 2012, in Steubenville, Ohio . Under Ohio's new permit conditions, all new drilling sites within three miles of a known fault or seismic activity of 2.0 magnitude or higher will be conditioned on the installation of sensitive seismic-monitoring equipment. Results will be directly available to regulators, Simmers said, so the state isn't reliant on drilling operators providing the data voluntarily. If seismic activity of 1.0 magnitude or greater is felt, drilling will be paused for evaluation. If a link is found, the operation will be halted. 'While we can never be 100 percent sure that drilling activities are connected to a seismic event, caution dictates that we take these new steps to protect human health, safety and the environment,' said James Zehringer, director of Ohio's natural resources department. Link: A state investigation into last month's tremors found the injection of sand and water that accompanies fracking in the Utica Shale (pictured) may have increased pressure on a small, unknown fault . Ohio has also imposed an indefinite drilling moratorium at the site of the March quakes. The state is allowing oil and gas extraction to continue at five existing wells at the site. Such events linked to fracking are 'extremely rare', said Shawn Bennett, a spokesman for the industry group Energy In Depth, who described the new rules as safeguards that will prevent similar future quakes in Ohio.","Geologists said hydraulic fracturing may have caused five tremors in Youngstown last month .

"An obesity pill that transforms 'bad' fat to 'good' could replace exercise, helping people shed pounds and with them their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. That is the claim by scientists who believe they have made a breakthrough in the battle against the bulge. They said the discovery could be 'the first step towards a pill that can replace the treadmill'. Harvard Stem Cell Institute at Havard and Massachusetts General Hospital have identified two compounds that can turn white or 'bad' fat cells into brown 'good' fat cells in the body. When a person eats too many calories without burning them off, they are stored as white fat cells by adult stem cells. A team of scientists  believe they have made a breakthrough which could see an obesity pill replace exercise as people try to fight their weight (picture posed by model) That is what causes people to pile on the pounds. The new study found two small molecules that convert fat stem cells, which would normally produce white fat, into brown-like fat cells. These brown fat cells burn excess energy and subsequently reduce the size and numbers of white fat cells. Associate professor Chad Cowan, at Harvard, said: 'What we were really impressed by is that there are some compounds that have this same kind of effect when they are administered to animals, but when you remove them, the effect goes away. 'But what we saw here was a stable conversion of the white fat cells to brown cells. 'You're constantly replenishing your fat tissue so if you were on a medication to convert the cells, each new fat cell would be more metabolically active and would convert to brown fat over time.' The researchers said this reduces the chances of a person developing type 2 diabetes, or any of the other conditions related to a build-up of fat. One of the two molecules is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but scientists warned a pill is some way off. They warned the compounds could damage the immune system. Associate professor Cowan warned these compounds 'target the same molecule, and that molecule plays a role in the inflammatory response'. He added: 'So if you administered them for a long time, the person taking them could become immune compromised.' The compounds were found by screening a library of about 1,000 compounds. They said the discovery could be 'the first step towards a pill that can replace the treadmill'. Harvard Stem Cell Institute at Havard and Massachusetts General Hospital have identified two compounds that can turn white or 'bad' fat cells into brown 'good' fat cells in the body (picture posed by models) The team said a typical pharmaceutical company library has between 1.5 and 2 million compounds, meaning there could be more similar compounds out there. A German team is currently carrying out tests on the two compounds on laboratory mice and associate professor Cowan added: 'We expect to have results fairly soon. 'The compounds appear to work the same way in mice, but we don't know what the long term metabolic or immune system effects are. 'The good news and bad news is that science is slow; just establishing proof of concept takes an enormous amount of time. 'We thought that working with stem cells would lead to the discovery of new drugs and therapies, and now it's really starting to happen - a decade of hard basic scientific work is paying off.' White fat cells store energy as lipids and play a role in the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related conditions - including heart disease . Brown fat has been shown in mice to lower triglyceride levels, reduce the insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes, and burn white fat. However the team pointed out that although any pill might help us stay slim, it would not replace the other benefits of exercise. A team of scientists have identified a hormone causes a person to pile on weight, triggering obesity and type 2 diabetes. The study found obese people have higher levels of the hormone serotonin in the blood. The hormone inhibits the beneficial effects of brown fat - the 'good' fat that can be burned off - activity. Brown adipose tissue, known as brown fat, is located around the collarbone and acts as the body's furnace, burning calories to keep the body warm. Obese people have lower levels of brown fat, and its activity decreases with age. But until now, scientists have not known why. The study by McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, found there are two different types of serotonin. Scientists at Canada's McMaster University found obese people have higher levels of the hormone serotonin in the blood (picture posed by model) One type is found in the brain or central nervous system affects mood and appetite, but makes up only five per cent of the body's serotonin. The lesser-known peripheral serontonin circulates in the blood, and makes up 95 per cent of the hormone in the body. McMaster scientists discovered that this kind of serotonin reduces brown fat activity, or 'dials down' the body's metabolic furnace. The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first to show blocking the production of peripheral serotonin makes brown fat more active. Professor of medicine Gregory Steinberg, said: 'Our results are quite striking and indicate that inhibiting the production of this hormone may be very effective for reversing obesity and related metabolic diseases including diabetes . 'Too much of this serotonin acts like the parking brake on your brown fat. You can step on the gas of the brown fat, but it doesn't go anywhere.' And the scientists believe they may also have identified the culprit responsible for elevated levels of peripheral serotonin - high-fat Western diets. Associate professor of pathology and molecular medicine Waliul Khan, added: 'There is an environmental cue that could be causing higher serotonin levels in our body and that is the high-fat western diet. 'Too much serotonin is not good. We need a balance. If there is too much, it leads to diabetes, fatty liver and obesity.' The hormone, a model of which is pictured, inhibits the beneficial effects of brown fat - the 'good' fat that can be burned off - activity . The majority of serotonin in the body is produced by tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph1). The study found that when they genetically removed or inhibited this enzyme that makes serotonin, mice fed a high-fat diet were protected from obesity, fatty liver disease and pre-diabetes due to an enhanced ability of the brown fat to burn more calories. Inhibiting the peripheral serotonin doesn't affect the serotonin in the brain or central nervous system functioning. This is in contrast to earlier weight loss drugs which worked to suppress appetite by affecting levels of brain serotonin, but were associated with problems including cardiac complications and increased risk of depression and suicide. Professor Steinberg said: 'Moving forward, we think it's a much safer method to work with increasing energy expenditure instead of decreasing the appetite, which involves more risks.' The researchers conclude that reducing the production of serotonin by inhibition of Tph1 'may be an effective treatment for obesity and its comorbidities,' and so the team is now working on a pharmacological 'enzyme blocker'.","Harvard scientists claim to have made a breakthrough in the obesity crisis .

"Saido Berahino sat next to club manager Alan Irvine and produced a performance as assured as he has been on the pitch this season. Mother Liliane featured heavily, and there were surely a few winces coming from West Brom officials when Berahino suggested he might have to leave the club in search of Champions League football. The player was quick to put what could have been an incendiary revelation into context. Saido Berahino has excelled for West Brom this season, scoring eight goals in 13 appearances so far . 2012-13: No goals in one appearance . 2013-14: Nine goals in 35 appearances . 2014-15: Eight goals in 13 appearances . ‘It doesn’t mean I am going to leave this year or next year, it’s just an ambition I have,’ declared a confident Berahino. ‘I shall take each game but my ambition is to play Champions League, to play senior football for England, to play in big tournaments, World Cups and Euros. I have a big vision and hope to reach my goals. ‘Leaving West Brom? If that’s what it comes to, it will have to be that.’ Berahino realises he is the hottest property in the Premier League at the moment but a contract through to 2017 suggests he is not going anywhere just yet. Manager Irvine chipped in: ‘I hope he is not going anywhere because we want to take the club forward. If there is an opportunity to go then it must be the right time. Berahino scores against Manchester United at The Hawthorns in their Premier League clash . The 21-year-old scored his side's second goal against Louis van Gaal's men as they drew 2-2 . ‘Who knows what the future brings. Right now he is in a good place, being given a chance to play week in and week out with a club which plays to his strengths. It is important that young players don’t go to the wrong place.’ Berahino was fast asleep when the squad was announced at midday on Thursday. His mother saw the news on tv downstairs and called her son from his slumbers. The eight-goal striker fled war-torn Burundi as a kid and admits he still thinks he is in dreamland. Last season Berahino was involved in several high-profile incidents, including taking hippy crack, and while he has turned over a new leaf, he has no intention of changing his personality. He added: ‘People that know me know what type of person I am. I work hard in my game. I like to have a laugh like any other youngster. ‘People might look at me that way because of my loudness but I don’t mean any harm, I just want to have fun. I don’t have to change. There will be more eyes on me but I know I can handle the pressure and I let the football do the talking. Berahino believes the things he has been through in his life have made him stronger than many others . ‘There is a lot of pressure. Some of us thrive some of us fade away. Mentally I couldn’t be any more prepared. What I have been through has made me a stronger person and stronger character. ‘I was in the newspapers for a lot of things but always thought I would come through. I was learning about life and I was new in the Premier League. ‘I have realised I can’t live in a certain way as a footballer. I didn’t want my mum seeing me in the paper for the wrong things. She didn’t stop talking to me, gave me a headache sometimes and she has always been there.’ ‘Mum said don’t waste God’s time, she always mentions that.’ If Berahino does win his first cap, the shirt will go straight to his mother. First he has to play for West Brom against Newcastle on Sunday. He is no longer the cocky upstart who clashed with senior players last season and revealed that every player shook his hand when he reported for training on Friday morning. Although Berahino was born in Burundi he has represented England at every youth level from the Under 16s up . Berahino has a remarkable record for the England Under 21 side, scoring 10 goals in 13 appearances . The forward credits Irvine for his change of attitude and the manager is obviously fond of him. He added: ‘It is important he remains focused, important he doesn’t forget. It is very easy to be distracted by what happens outside a training ground or football pitch. ‘My feeling is that this is a great opportunity for Saido to go and learn. That’ s what top players do to reach this level. I will ask him what have you learnt? This is the best learning experience he can have. ‘I have said here on a number of occasions as long as he keeps doing what he’s been doing, living his life, keeps applying himself then good things will happen.’","Saido Berahino has scored eight goals in 13 appearances this season .

"Saying you love your friend's new (ugly) shoes can strengthen your bond . Lying to your loved ones may seem like a sure fire way to push them away. But new research says telling white lies - specifically for the right reasons - can actually strengthen social bonds. Fibbing about how good your friend looks in a (bad) dress or how much you love your partner's (awful) new haircut tends to be good for relationships. But lying to cover up a misdeed or just to get your way is not the way to improve your relationships, says Robin Dunbar, evolutionary psychologist at Oxford University. This type of deception, known as antisocial lying, is destructive and weakens bonds between two people. On the other hand, lies told to help another person or to protect someone's feelings tend to be good for relationships, Dunbar said. Psychologists call this pro-social lying, but it's more commonly known as telling a white lie or a fib. To study how these two types of lies affect relationships within social groups, Dunbar and a team of researchers associated with the Aalto University School of Science, in Finland, created a complex mathematical model, report LiveScience. The model showed that those who tell anti-social lies become slowly isolated from others within their social networks. However, people who tell pro-social lies don't become isolated from their groups. In fact, they tend to form stronger links with others in their social networks. While the researchers created a purely hypothetical model, Dunbar said it could be used to understand how lying affects groups of friends and peers in the real world. Fibbing about how much you love your partner's (awful) new haircut tends to be good for relationships . Researchers speculated that the model . could also help psychologists better understand the effects of lying in . online communities, where much of today's social networking takes place. Social networks that people create . online - on sites such as Facebook and Twitter - mimic the social . networks they're part of in the real world. So, fibbing on Facebook, . much like telling a white lie to a friend over lunch, might actually . improve your relationships, according to the new model. Larry Rosen, a psychology professor at California State University, Dominguez Hills, told LiveScience he finds the Facebook Like button most fascinating. He said that in general, people like things on Facebook because of something he calls 'virtual empathy.' Whether you're liking a picture of your . aunt's cat or a status update from a childhood friend, pressing the Like . button tells a person that you have good intentions or that you support . them in some way, Rosen said. The Like button can function as a type of lie . However, not all likes are delivered with such good intentions. Sometimes people might click the Like button just because they feel it's something they're supposed to do. For these people, pressing the Like button functions as a type of lie. 'I think that in many cases you can consider the like a white lie if [it's done] for reasons that have nothing to do with support,' he said. Liking something on Facebook that you don't actually like resembles giving a dishonest answer to a question such as 'Do you like my new shoes?'. In these situations, you might say something insincere, but only because you're worried that honesty might hurt someone's feelings. And while it can calm your nerves to lie, it could also save your friendship.","Lying to cover up a misdeed or just get your way can harm relationships .

"Long after the Toon Army had marched into town for a victory ale and the last few staff remained inside St James’ Park, one player partied by himself in the home dressing-room. Not so long ago, the same young man would have been clearing that very room of muddied tape and empty bottles. Not on Saturday afternoon. For Mehdi Abeid was king of the castle. There, having been delayed by demand for his post-match thoughts and four press interviews, the French-born Algerian turned the sound of his North African music to the max. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Premier League Big Match Stats: Newcastle vs Liverpool . Algerian midfielder Mehdi Abeid is beginning to settle in at Newcastle after loan spells in Greece and Scotland . And why not? In the space of four days he had bossed two of the game’s greatest midfielders. First, at Manchester City in the League Cup, he out-ran, out-passed and out-thought Yaya Toure in a shock 2-0 triumph. Then, against Liverpool and Steven Gerrard in front of a global television audience, he was named man-of-the-match on his Premier League debut in a 1-0 win for Newcastle. The 22-year-old later posted two pictures on his Twitter account – one of him hunting down Gerrard and the other of a graphic detailing his seven tackles, more than any other player. But there was no need for such reminders, millions had watched as the rookie ruled against the master and England’s Jordan Henderson. The 23-year-old muscles Dejan Lovren out of the way during Newcastle's win against Liverpool . Clubs: . 2003-11: Lens (youth team) 2011- : Newcastle . 2012-13: St Johnstone (loan) 2013-14: Panathinaikos (loan) International: . Played for France U16, U17 and U18 . Played for Algeria U23 . Trophies won: . Greek Cup 2014 . There were 52,166 inside St James’. Two years ago, in front of just 2,500, Abeid was turning out for St Johnstone during a loan spell in the Scottish Premier League. Last season, though, he spent the entirety of the campaign in the Greek Super League with Panathinaikos. Club sources, however, say that he travelled more than the 2,000 miles to Athens. Rather, he made the journey from boy to man. Abeid, who now has a young son, has himself been fathered by the senior French players on Tyneside, Moussa Sissoko and Yoan Gouffran - and previously Yohan Cabaye - taking particular care with a comrade who left the eastern suburbs of Paris for the North-East of England aged just 18. But the fledgling, it appears, is ready to take flight. ‘It has been unreal,’ he says. ‘To play against big sides like Manchester City and Liverpool in one week is fantastic. I am getting more and more experience and learning what it is like to play against big players. Abeid chases Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during their Premier League clash at St James' Park . The Algeria U23 midfielder attempts to squeeze past Manchester City forward Edin Dzeko . ‘But I have to keep my head down and work every day to prove that I can be a solution for the team and for the coach. ‘You don’t know how pleased I am – but I am not finished. I need to work every day and I want to judge myself against the big players. ‘I know that some days will be good and some bad, but I have been passionate and worked hard for four years – which have been difficult – but that is the way I work and play my football.’ His Greek odyssey was more than a mere learning curve, just ask Panathinaikos fans. They were desperate to see his loan stay made permanent after a return of 10 goals in 38 games, helping them to a third-placed finish and victory in the Greek Cup, their first in four years. Abeid takes the ball past Samir Nasri during Newcastle's 2-0 win against the Premier League champions . But reports of Abeid’s impact had way their way across the continent and into the possession of a somewhat surprised Alan Pardew, for the Newcastle manager had suspected it was time to move on the former Lens trainee. ‘I felt I grew a lot in Greece,’ says Abeid, offering explanation for his career revival. ‘I played 40 games and got a lot of experience. I grew up as a player and as a man – I want to keep going in that way. ‘I feel I’m a better player. I wanted to play football and that’s what I got. Now it’s about the next level and taking my chance. ‘The Premier League is the biggest in the world and to be part of it is great. It’s nice to be back and involved. I had a great season (at Panathinaikos) but now I need to build on that and show it here.’ Abeid poses with the Greek Cup, which he won while on loan with Panathinaikos last season . On the evidence of the past week, it seems that Abeid boasts craft, graft, brains and bite – he was sent off at Crystal Palace in the League Cup Third Round and in his final league game for Panathinaikos – and has an eye for goal to boot. Pardew feels the Algeria Under-23 international is a genuine all-rounder. ‘Mehdi has good strength, good discipline, is a good passer and has a good mentality,’ says the United boss, whose side have now won four on the bounce. ‘He has earned the right to play. Hopefully he could be one of the young players who can be a regular for us this season.’ Abeid certainly intends to stick around in the Newcastle first-team, for not even Toure or Gerrard can spoil his party right now.","Mehdi Abeid impressed against both Liverpool and Manchester City .

"If you have seen Monty Python’s Life of Brian and you’ve been following Spanish and European football over the last year or so then you can imagine the conversation supporters at the Santiago Bernabeu might have had on Saturday. I mean seriously – what did Gareth Bale ever do for Real Madrid? It was in the 71st minute when Bale flew down the right and decided to shoot instead of pass to Cristiano Ronaldo who had made a run through the middle. The error of judgement provoked a crescendo of jeers from home supporters and a couple of expletives from Ronaldo. Cue the debate between supporters: . Cristiano Ronaldo vents his anger after team-mate Gareth Bale failed to pass the ball . Bale was jeered by Real Madrid fans despite scoring an outstanding free-kick against Espanyol . Supporter A: There he goes again shooting instead of passing. When is he going to start doing something for the team? Supporter B: Well he did score the second goal with an unstoppable free-kick from about 30-yards out. Supporter A: Yeah but that’s for his own glorification. When’s he going to start thinking about the team? Supporter B: Well he did play a 40-yard cross-field pass straight on to Ronaldo’s boot in the first half that led to the opening goal. Supporter A: Yeah but that’s today! What about the rest of the time he’s been here. What has Gareth Bale ever done for Real Madrid? Supporter B: Well he did run half the length of the pitch in the 85th minute of the Copa del Rey final, running off the pitch and then back on to it to outsprint Marc Bartra before shooting past Jose Pinto for the first trophy of last season. Bale lifts the Champions League trophy in the air while surrounded by his team-mates after victory last May . The Welshman scored in Real Madrid's Champions League final win against rivals Atletico Madrid . Supporter A: Yeah but that’s the Copa del Rey . Supporter B: Well he did score in the Champions League final. You remember the goal that finally put us in front against Atletico Madrid and meant we went on to win the Champions League. Supporter A: Yeah but we always win the European Cup, we’ve won it 10 times. Supporter B: Well we hadn’t won it for 11 years. Supporter A: Yeah but I’m not talking about specific matches I’m talking about in general. Supporter B: Well he has got 34 goals and 22 assists in 69 games since joining the club. Supporter A: OK, so apart from making the first goal and scoring the second goal against Espanyol, with the pass of the season and the best free-kick of the season; scoring the winning goal in last season’s Copa del Rey final; scoring the decisive goal in last season's Champions League final; and scoring 34 goals and given 22 assists since joining… what has Gareth Bale ever done for us. September 1: Bale signs for Real Madrid for a world record fee of £86 million . September 14: The Welshman scores on his Real Madrid debut in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal . October 30: Scores two and assists two on his first home start at the Bernabeu . November 30: First hat-trick - a 'perfect' one too - for Real Madrid, against Valladolid . April 16: Bale scores the winning goal in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona. His first goal against Madrid's bitter rivals, and his 20th of the season . May 24: The former Spurs man scores a goal in extra time in the Champions League final, which Madrid go on to win 4-1... it's a record 10th European title for the Spanish side . August 12: Bale's third trophy at Madrid - the European Super Cup. He sets up the first of Ronaldo's two goals in his home city of Cardiff . December 20: Another trophy for the Welshman, and a goal in this final too. Real Madrid beat San Lorenzo 2-0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup, with Bale netting the second . December 23: Reports surface of a potential exit, and 54 per cent of Real Madrid fans would be happy to see him leave for the right price . Ben Nagle . Monty Python included a scene where they ask 'what have the Romans ever done for us' The 25-year-old is congratulated by Xabi Alonso after scoring a solo goal in the Copa del Rey final . Bale skipped past Barcelona's Marc Bartra before scoring his side's winning goal in the Copa del Rey final . Bale, pictured with Real Madrid team-mate Luka Modric after the Champions League final, has failed to win over a selection of the La Liga giants' fans . And so they jeered and whistled and Marca gave him 6.5 out of 10 in their match ratings. Perhaps there were mitigating circumstances. The Bernabeu was desperate for Ronaldo to score before he goes off to Zurich for Monday’s Ballon d’Or gala. Almost as desperate as he was to find the net. And with the benefit of the replay, Ronaldo’s run was a good one and Bale probably should have passed. Just as he should have passed the weekend before when Karim Benzema was in the clear against Valencia – another bad decision for which he has also received a disproportionate amount of criticism. His first year-and-a-half at a new club has been little short of miraculous. It’s difficult to think of any other player who has made such an impact in his first 18 months playing for a new side in a different league. Yet Bale is cut little or no slack. Manchester United’s interest in the player for now seems to amount to no more than the level of interest they have in all top players – laced with a little desire to give Real Madrid back a little of its own medicine: you want De Gea well we want Bale. But if it ever becomes more than that, then the curious lack of warmth between the club and arguably its most productive signing since Zinedine Zidane will play massively in United’s favour. Real Madrid forked out £85million to sign then Tottenham winger Bale in September 2013 . Bale kissed the Real Madrid badge during his official presentation at the Santiago Bernabeu on September 2 .

And Steve Job's biological father was today seen holding a bit of his son's legacy as he left his Casino holding his iPhone. Abdulfattah Jandali, who gave his son up for . adoption and never got to meet him, said he was not shocked by the news of Jobs's death, but desperately wanted to meet him before he passed away. The sighting of Mr Jandali happened the same day as Mr Jobs' death certificate was released, stating that the Apple founder died due to respiratory arrest caused by pancreatic cancer. The certificate, released by the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, said that Mr Jobs had a 'metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumor' and there would not be an autopsy. The death certificate also states that Mr Jobs had the cancer for eight years before his death, stating that he was first diagnosed in 2004. Mr Jandali only learned that Mr Jobs was his son one year later in 2005. Mr Jandali said in the past year he . wrote a few simple emails to Mr Jobs such as 'Happy birthday' and  'I . hope your health is improving.' He received he received two short supplies. The last one came six weeks before Mr Jobs died. It just said 'Thank you.' In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mr Jandali said he found out about Mr Jobs's death last Wednesday. A stranger called his office to offer their condolences. Mr Jandali said: 'It was not a shock. Basically all you feel is sadness.'

Inc. and went on to become one of the world's most famous businessmen. But for Mr Jandali the only connection with his son is his story of the emails and the iPhone 4 that he owns. He . told the Wall Street Journal: 'I don't know why I emailed. I guess . because I felt bad when I heard about the health situation. 'He had his life and I had my life, and we were not in contact. 'If I talked to him, I don't know what I would have said to him.' He . said that after hearing of Mr Jobs's death, he watched online videos of . the Apple chief's famous keynote speeches launching new products. He also watched Mr Jobs's famous Stanford University in 2005 in which he spoke about his personal life. While Mr Jobs spoke of his biological mother and sister, he never mentioned Mr Jandali. MailOnline . revealed in August that in the months leading up to Steve Jobs's death, . Mr Jandali became overcome with guilt for abandoning his son. But he admitted that after all this time he was too proud to make the first move to arrange a meeting. Mr Jandali, a Syrian immigrant, said he did not call Mr Jobs for fear he would wrongly think he was after his money. He . said at the time: 'This might sound strange, though, but I am not . prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to pick up the . phone to call him. 'Steve will have to do that, as the Syrian pride in me does not want him ever to think I am after his fortune.

"Barcelona legend Hristo Stoichkov is hoping Real Madrid fans do the right thing and applaud Lionel Messi if the Argentine star breaks the La Liga goalscoring record during Saturday's El Clasico. Messi can go level with the Spanish league's top goalscorer of all-time, Telmo Zarra, if he scores against Real Madrid and would set a new record if manages a double at the Bernabeu. 'Why would Madrid fans not tribute Leo?' Stoichkovtold told SA during the week. 'They do applaud Barca players, remember Ronaldinho scored in the Clasico and some clapped him.

"Brazilian great Pele, who is being treated for a urinary tract infection, is in good condition and is expected to leave the hospital in the next few days, his spokesman said Thursday. The Albert Einstein hospital released a statement saying the 74-year-old Pele was transferred to a 'special care' unit after his condition became unstable, but his spokesman and personal aide denied his health condition deteriorated. 'He is fine,' Jose Fornos Rodrigues, known as Pepito, said on Thursday. Brazil legend Pele has been admitted to hospital twice this month and is now a special care unit . 'The problem was that he was receiving too many visitors and that wasn't helping, so they transferred him to a calmer area to continue receiving the proper treatment. He should be out of the hospital in a few days.' The hospital's statement created a scare in Brazil, with local media widely reporting that Pele's condition had worsened. The story was highlighted by most of the country's top web portals. Widely known as the greatest footballer of all time, Pele is a national hero in the South American country. The hospital's press office had already said the three-time World Cup champion was not in an intensive care unit and was just being monitored. Pele won three World Cups with Brazil, the last of which came in 1970 in Mexico (above) Pele hands Ballon d'Or award to Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo in January . Pele was admitted to the hospital on Monday for a medical evaluation and was diagnosed with the infection. He was being treated with antibiotics. Pele was in the same hospital less than 15 days ago to undergo surgery to remove kidney stones. He has enjoyed good health in recent years despite needing to undergo surgeries for a hip replacement and a detached retina. Pele remains a worldwide ambassador to football and is active with his many businesses across the globe. He still participates in many advertising campaigns and is present at most major football tournaments. He won the World Cup with Brazil in 1958, '62 and 1970 and is known as the game's most prolific scorer, credited with 1,281 goals in 1,363 career matches.

"Lionel Messi achieved yet another milestone in his glittering career on Saturday night when he surpassed 400 career goals for club and country. The Argentinian wizard scored twice in Barcelona's 6-0 thumping of Granada to take his overall goal tally to 401 - comprised of 359 for his club and 42 for his country. 'I never imagined I could achieve anything like this in my career,' the humble Messi wrote on his Facebook page afterwards. 'I'll continue working hard to reach more targets.' Lionel Messi scored his 400th career goal in Barcelona's 6-0 win over Granada at the weekend and now has his sights set on breaking more records in both La Liga and the Champions League . Messi slams home his 400th career goal to put Barcelona 4-0 up against Granada at the Nou Camp . Like so many in his glittering career, Messi's shot was simply unstoppable . 1. Telmo Zarra (1940-1955) 251 goals in 278 games . 2. Lionel Messi (2004-) 248 in 282 . 3. Hugo Sanchez (1981-1994) 234 in 347 . 4. Raul (1994-2010) 228 in 550 . 5. Alfredo di Stefano (1953-1966) 227 in 329 . 10. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009-) 187 in 170 . Well, that's very convenient because the maestro is within striking distance of a whole host of other records. In fact, we could see them fall in the next couple of weeks. Messi needs just four more to surpass Telmo Zarra, prolific Bilbao goal-getter of the Forties and Fifties, and become La Liga's all-time leading scorer. Zarra scored 251 goals in 278 appearances between 1940 and 1955, while Messi has 248 in 282 - and counting. Barcelona's next league match is at Rayo Vallecano on Saturday afternoon and the omens are pretty good - Messi has nine goals in six matches against them. If he goes on a scoring spree, he will also move one closer to the league record for hat-tricks. Messi flicks the ball over Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart to open the scoring in their Champions League meeting last March . Messi rattles the ball past PSG goalkeeper Sirigu during Barcelona's Champions League match there in 2013 . Messi with a characteristically composed finish past Bilbao keep Gorka Iraizoz in a 2012 La Liga game . 1. Raul (1995-2011) 71 goals . 2. Cristiano Ronaldo (2002-) 69 . 3. Lionel Messi (2004-) 67 . 4. Ruud van Nistelrooy (1998-2009) 60 . 5. Andriy Shevchenko (1994-2011) 59 . 1. Alfredo di Stefano 22 hat-tricks . = Telmo Zarra 22 . = Cristiano Ronaldo 22 . 4. Edmundo Suarez 19 . 5. Lionel Messi 18 . Messi has scored three or more goals on 18 occasions in La Liga but he still trails Zarra, Alfredo di Stefano and Cristiano Ronaldo, all of whom have scored 22 trebles. With rival Ronaldo showing no let up in his awesome scoring record, Messi will really have to up the pace to claim this particular accolade. He is close to Zarra's record for scoring two or more in a La Liga game as well. Zarra did this on 76 occasions, Messi has done it on 72 so far. With Barcelona travelling to take on Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, Messi also has an opportunity to further close the gap on Real Madrid legend Raul as the European Cup's all-time top scorer. Messi's Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo is competing for some of his records . Pele - 23 . Gerd Muller - 26 . Lionel Messi - 27 . Ferenc Puskas, Cristiano Ronaldo - 28 . Alfredo di Stefano - 29 . Messi has 67 in the competition, four shy of Raul. However, in between on 69 goals is Ronaldo and the next few years look like being a battle between the two to claim top spot. Messi is also one goal shy of notching 200 goals at the Nou Camp but will have to wait until after the international break to try for this milestone. Barcelona take on Eibar on October 21 and Messi will fancy his chances of getting on the scoresheet in that one. It seems inevitable that we'll be celebrating yet more Messi milestones before the year is out. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page. VIDEO Messi for Argentina compilation .

"Girls star Lena Dunham has splashed out more than $4.8 million on a sprawling new home after moving out of her modest $500,000 apartment. The 28-year-old writer, actress and director has moved into the four-bedroom apartment with her longtime boyfriend, musician Jack Antonoff. Lena - who scored a reported $3.7 million book advance for her memoir Not That Kind Of Girl from publishers Random House - bought the property in her beloved Brooklyn. Scroll down for video . Luxury: Lena Dunham has splashed out $4.8m on a condo in this new boutique building in Brooklyn . Happy couple: Lena Dunham shares her new home with longtime love, Jack Antonoff . Home sweet home: Musician Jack Antonoff seen arriving home at the apartment he shares with Lena Dunham on Friday . The brand new boutique condo building has just five apartments, each with their own elevator and top of the range appliances. It is a five-minute walk from New York harbor and Lena's apartment boasts stunning views of the lower Manhattan skyline from its giant terrace. Aside from the terrace, there’s a spacious ground-floor courtyard complete with a fountain for all of the tenants. Lena's new home is a far cry from the shabby apartment her Girls character, struggling writer, Hannah Horvath, is seen sharing with her boyfriend Adam, played by Adam Driver, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The star bought her first home in Brooklyn Heights in 2012 and told how she had hankered to live in the building since she was a teenager, saying: 'I used to walk my dog by this apartment building in high school. I was always getting in trouble for my dog peeing in the courtyard, which is technically illegal. I’m like, ‘Someday, I’m going to live in that building!’' After Girls took off, Vogue reported that 'she moved in with a sense of private triumph.' However, in an interview with the fashion bible in January, she said she would soon be moving out with Fun frontman Jack. And Lena is most certainly moving up in the world after splashing out more than the original $4.750,000 asking price. Records show that the purchase price in May was $4,887,600 and the property was brought through a trust. Although Lena has been away, Jack, 30 - who is working on his new solo project Bleachers - was seen arriving home on Friday with pals. Broody: Jack Antonoff says he's ready for kids - and the sprawling home he shares with Lena Dunham is more than big enough for a baby . The pair have said they are real homebodies, and Jack recently compared their relationship to that of a staid old couple. 'One time we were at a dinner party where everyone was over 60 and before we knew it we realized everyone at the table had gone outside to smoke pot and they didn’t invite us. That basically says it all,' he told New York magazine. The couple hit it off after going on a blind date two years ago, but Lena insists they won’t tie the knot until same-sex marriage is legal across America. But turning one of their spare bedrooms into a nursery could be on the cards soon. Jack, who co-wrote several tracks on Lena's close friend Taylor Swift’s new album 1989, admits he’s broody and can’t wait to have children, adding: It just seems like the most fun thing in the world. 'I think it is biological. I’m 30. I’m not that young right.' Advance: Lena Dunham got a reported $3.7 million advance for her memoir, Not That Kind Of Girl, from publishers Random House - allowing her to splash out on a new home . Lena has not put her old Brooklyn Heights apartment - described by Vogue as 'concertedly unostentatious' - up for sale. The property has a small galley kitchen, featuring an old photo of Lena's grandmother as well as a hot-pink Hello Kitty microwave. And nearby, Lena had arranged what she refered to as her 'salon wall', a small selection of artefacts, fan letters from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks; a birthday drawing from the New Yorker cartoonist and Girls producer Bruce Eric Kaplan; a portrait of Girls star Zosia Mamet by co-star Jemima Kirke; and other 'cherished works'. To really prove that art does mirror life, much of the furniture in the apartment, Vogue noted, was taken directly from the Girls set. Brand new: Lena Dunham snapped up this apartment in Brookyn in May - but still owns her beloved Brooklyn Heights apartment . Out with the old: Lena Dunham lived in this Brooklyn Heights building and still owns the apartment she bought in 2012 after Girls became a hit . The Girls star has however found herself at the center of controversy as a result of her memoir. The first incident was over the memoir's description of her relationship with her sister. Right-wing website Truth Revolt excerpted a portion from the book about her childhood curiosity with the female reproductive system and labelled it 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'. The passage that Truth Revolt excerpted details a conversation that then-year-old Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs. In the course of the conversation, young Lena asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers. 'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds. Dunham wrote that she subsequently she 'spread open her vagina' as the two played on the driveway. 'She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked,' she wrote. 'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!” 'It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.' Right-wing website Truth Revolt described the incident as 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' in an article titled 'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister'. In response Dunham threatened to sue the website. That was followed by further controversy over her claim that she was raped while at university by a man she identifies as 'Barry One', a 'mustachioed campus Republican'. The man who fits that description has now retained an attorney and taken steps towards suing her, saying that he has asked since the book's publication for his name to be cleared.","Girls creator splashes out on four-bed in trendy Brooklyn and moves in with her long-term boyfriend Jack Antonoff .

Her boyfriend, fellow vlogger Alfie Deyes, announced he would also be taking a break as the couple have been so busy. Publishers Penguin has said Zoe 'Zoella' Sugg, 24, 'did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' but did not confirm that the sales success was ghostwritten . The vlogger, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, posted a message on Twitter today to her fans saying she was taking a few days off the internet 'because it's clouding up my brain' 'Just to let you know :) Zoë and I are going to take a few days out of daily vlogging to have some time to our selves,' he tweeted. 'We've both been so busy recently working on different things so a little break will do us good as we haven't spent proper time together.'

Girl Online sold nearly 80,000 copies in its first seven days . Pauline @TheLifeParadise tweeted: 'Why do you only take the negativity zoe? You shouldnt even think about them.People are jealous. Look at the positive, all the love.' Girl Online broke the all-time record for highest first-week sales for a debut author, selling 78,109 copies in its first seven days. The figure is more than five times higher than the number of copies which were sold of EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey in its first week. As rumours started to spread about a possible ghostwriter, Penguin confirmed that Sugg did not write Girl Online on her own. 'To be factually accurate, you would need to say Zoe Sugg did not write the book Girl Online on her own,' a penguin spokesperson told the Sunday Times, adding that despite this, the story is very much Miss Sugg's work. The firm said in a statement: 'As publishers our role is, and always has been, to find the very best talent and help them tell their story and connect them with readers. 'Talented YouTube entrepreneurs such as Zoe are brilliant at understanding and entertaining their audience. 'For her first novel, Girl Online, Zoe has worked with an expert editorial team to help her bring to life her characters and experiences in a heartwarming and compelling story.' Zoella responded by writing on Twitter: 'Thanks for all the positive feedback about Girl Online and for the doubters out there, of course I was going to have help from Penguin's editorial team in telling my story, which I talked about from the beginning. 'Everyone needs help when they try something new. The story and the characters of Girl Online are mine. I want to thank all of you who have taken time to support the book.'

Girl Online's acknowledgements thanks 'everyone at Penguin for helping me put together my first novel, especially Amy Alward and Siobhan Curham, who were with me every step of the way.' The former, Ms Alward, is Zoella's editor, the latter, Siobham Curham, is a freelance writer and the author of several young adult novels. A since deleted post on Ms Curham's blog allegedly read that she had been approached with writing a novel in six weeks, and finished the task, 80,000 words, in August. MailOnline has reached out to Ms Curham for comment. Zoella's 'vlogs', short for video blogs, attract 12 million hits each month. She began posting the videos in 2009 as a 'creative outlet'. She now has six million followers on YouTube and is read by more than 2.5 million on Twitter.

"A teenage girl who was held at a hospital for 16 months against her will has been admitted to a specialist facility after her chronic condition deteriorated. Justina Pelletier, 16, who suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, was taken to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia last week for more extensive tests after being admitted to Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital in September because she was unable to eat. Miss Pelletier, from West Hartford, Connecticut, is being fed intravenously as she undergoes testing at the hospital, one of the country's top pediatric units. Justina Pelletier, 16, (pictured last month) who suffers from Mitochondrial Disease, was taken to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia last week after suffering acute gastrointestinal distress in September . Justina with her older sister Jennifer on Halloween at Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital where she was admitted with acute gastrointestinal distress . The girl's father, Lou Pelletier,  told the Boston Globe that he and his wife Linda were confident in both hospitals' care of their daughter and she was only transferred to Philadelphia because they have expertise in her condition. Her treatment is ongoing and it has not yet been decided when she will be discharged. Miss Pelletier was at the center of a custody battle for 16 months with Boston Children's Hospital last year. She first checked into the Boston hospital in February 2013 with flu-like symptoms. But her family became embroiled in a custody battle with the state when hospital staff insisted her genetic muscular condition was in fact a stress-related mental disease caused by domestic abuse. Mitochondrial Disease is notoriously difficult to diagnose and support groups claim many sufferers are accused of fraud or their parents accused of abuse. The teenager was held in a psychiatric ward where she claimed hospital staff were 'mean and nasty' and accused her of faking her condition, the family said. They told her she had Somatoform Disorder, which is considered to be anxiety-related with sufferers feeling real pain that cannot be medically explained. Justina's family insisted she did not have Somatoform Disorder symptoms when she was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital. She was banned from seeing her family without a welfare supervisor or hospital staff member in the room. She was rarely allowed outside for fresh air and spent most of her time in a small room. She was finally allowed to go home in June of this year. The 16-year-old had been at home for four months with her family and had been celebrating her birthday in September with 100 friends and relatives when her condition worsened and she was rehospitalized. Miss Pelletier, pictured with mom Linda, was at the center of a custody battle for 16 months with Boston Children's Hospital . Justina Pelletier was diagnosed with Mitochondrial Disease several years ago, a genetic condition that affects muscle coordination and mobility. The illness includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy. There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can cause death. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Every year 1,000 to 4,000 children in the U.S. are born with a mitochondrial disease. After being admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February 2013, doctors concluded Miss Pelletier was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although there is no physical cause. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain. Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants. Patients can become increasingly frustrated with the diagnosis as there is seemingly no explanation for their symptoms. Experts estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the U.S. suffer from the condition.","Justina Pelletier, 16, was taken to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia last week for specialist testing for acute gastrointestinal distress .

"Arsenal forward Theo Walcott will not set himself any ambitious goals as he plots a steady return to full match sharpness. The England international made his first start in a year in the FA Cup third-round tie against Hull, and produced a few positive runs behind the defence despite lacking a finish in the penalty area. With his rehabilitation now almost complete - from, first the serious knee injury which shattered his World Cup dreams last summer and then a groin problem sustained on international duty with England in November - the 25-year-old feels achieving small targets can help make the biggest difference. Theo Walcott is setting himself short rather than long term targets as he works towards full fitness . 'I like to work week by week, so I forget about the big picture and the nine months (out). Week by week, hitting the goals and when you have achieved that, you can feel good about hitting something else,' Walcott said to Arsenal Player. 'You need to just come into training with a smile on your face, enjoy it and that's all you can do. I remember when I had one of my injuries before, I came in down in the dumps and rehab seemed to take so much longer. 'You don't want that, you want to come in and feel like you're doing something each day. Even though it might be the same things at the start, you benefit when it comes to the end of it.' Theo Walcott outpaces Hull City's Maynor Figueroa during the FA Cup third round last weekend . With both Danny Welbeck, who has been out with a thigh injury, and Olivier Giroud, serving a three-match suspension, set to be available for Sunday's encounter against Stoke, Walcott could again find himself back on the bench, which could also include German playmaker Mesut Ozil for the first time since October after his knee problem. Another player uncertain of his place in the starting XI is goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who has found himself at the centre of some unwanted headlines following reports he was caught smoking in the showers after Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, when he had been culpable for both goals. Fit-again David Ospina stood in for the Poland international against Hull, but Gunners boss Arsene Wenger had already indicated he was likely to rotate the goalkeeper for the FA Cup tie and so now has a direct choice to make, with Argentine Emiliano Martinez having offered back-up earlier in the season when Colombia international Ospina was injured. Wojciech Szczesny was at fault for both goals that Arsenal conceded during their 2-0 defeat to Southampton . Arsenal are expected to look to add to the squad during the January transfer window. Legia Warsaw teenage midfielder Krystian Bielik, rated at around £2million by the Polish club, and Uruguayan trialist Federico Valverde appear potential recruits for the future. However, more pressing is some defensive cover, with St Etienne captain Loic Perrin a player said to be on Wenger's radar, along with Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin and New Zealand defender Winston Reid, who is out of contract at West Ham in the summer. There have also been reports Arsenal are preparing a shock £60million-plus bid for Real Madrid's Spanish midfielder Isco. More likely, however, is the impending departure of forward Yaya Sanogo out on loan, although Wenger would prefer an English side rather than a return to France at Bordeaux.

"A dying Vietnam veteran has been told he must repay $6,300 he received in pension benefits - despite the fact the payments were made in error by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Rob Arthur, 68, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in January and soon after married his girlfriend Debbie Shafer. They live together in a trailer at the foot of the Cascade Mountains in Washington. Weeks after the wedding, he informed Veterans Affairs of the change in his marital status and her income as a nurse's aide - which is just $22,000 a year. Rob Arthur, 68, has terminal brain cancer which led him to marry his long-time girlfriend in January. File photo . But due to a paperwork backlog, it took six months for Mr Arthur to receive a reply. They informed him that he was no longer eligible for a pension, as his income had increased due to his wife's wages. He was told he would have to repay the benefits he received from January to June while his paperwork was being processed, which amounted to $6,324. But Mr Arthur says he accepts the loss of his $1,000-a-month pension, but he disagrees with having to pay back the amount the VA is demanding. Despite this, his wife recently sent a $5 check to start paying off the debt. Mr Arthur told The Seattle Times: 'They are mental abusers right now, is the way I look at it. And that's not a kind way to look at your government. 'We got knocked down, and now they are stomping on us. We don't have the money to pay them.' Mr Arthur, who is now requesting a hardship exemption, added: 'We simply cannot afford to survive should we be held responsible for this.'

"Some people buy environmentally-friendly products because they are concerned about their impact on the world but others only do so because it fits with the eco-friendly image of themselves they want to promote, scientists have said. Korean researchers found that many older people choose to spend large sums of money on a hybrid car because it boosts their self-esteem and image. They said that some people want to be seen as the type of person who cares about the planet by driving an expensive eco-friendly model - and would even choose one to evoke their neighbours' green-eyed monster. Korean researchers found that older people might choose to spend a more money on a hybrid car (such as the Prius pictured) as it boosts their self esteem and image. Prestige, price and quality are major influences on older people's decisions to buy 'pro-environment' vehicles, they said . They said prestige, price and quality are major influences on older people's decisions to buy 'pro-environment' vehicles. The findings, published in the journal Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing and Service Industries suggest that less visible green products are not as desirable as they cannot be shown off. 'If I want to pay $5 for a 'green' detergent or sponge, I'll know that I'm helping the environment. But . those things aren't highly visible. Other people aren't going to notice,' said Dr Jay Yoo, an assistant professor of family and consumer sciences at Baylor's College of Arts & Sciences. The researchers from the universities of Baylor and Yonsei as well as Pykyoung National University in South Korea, believe their study could prove significant as some segments of the older-consumer population control a . considerable share of the discretionary income in the United States and . the population size of the 'mature market' is growing rapidly. The scientists analysed 314 consumers aged 60 and older who had bought hybrid cars and found that their satisfaction was influenced by social values, including pride and prestige, as well as quality and price, not only in vehicle purchase but in future savings on gasoline expenses. Dr Yoo believes three variables - social value, price and quality - are significant in enhancing senior citizens' customer loyalty as shown by repurchase intention and positive word-of-mouth. The scientists analysed 314 consumers aged 60 and older who had bought hybrid cars and found that their satisfaction was influenced by social values, including pride and prestige, as well as quality and price, not only in vehicle purchase but in future savings on gasoline expenses . Interestingly, emotional values such as excitement, did not significantly influence their purchase intentional or satisfaction, according to the study. The team said: 'The findings suggest that elderly consumers are concerned about how they appear to others when driving a hybrid car. 'They believe that driving a hybrid car builds a positive self-image of the people who drive them.' Dr Yoo said that the knowledge gained from he study could be used to market the vehicles as well as other green products. 'Hybrid cars have increased in visibility because of their environmental consciousness. So people may be willing to pay an extra $5,000 or so in order to think, ""I'm great, and this is good for the environment,""' he said.

"Winston Churchill was a ‘racist and white supremacist’, a Labour candidate in next year’s general election has claimed. The war leader’s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames today slammed the ‘deeply insulting’ views expressed by Benjamin Whittingham, who is standing for Parliament in the Wyre and Preston North seat. The Labour candidate made the outburst on Twitter, after it was announced that Churchill would feature on the new £5 note. Scroll down for video . Labour candidate Benjamin Whittingham said he was 'disappointed' that Winston Churchill had been honoured - because he was a 'racist' Sir Winston Churchill was wartime leader from 1940 to 1945. He became Prime Minister again in 1951, before retiring in 1955 . The damning revelation comes after Labour was forced to suspend a candidate for claiming Adolf Hitler was Israel’s ‘Zionist God’. Vicky Kirby, Labour's candidate for Woking, Surrey, she would ‘never forget’ and make sure her kids knew ‘how evil Israel is’. Ms Kirby was told of her suspension while on her way to the Labour party conference in Manchester. Churchill’s grandson Sir Nicholas today called for Labour leader Ed Miliband to similarly take action against Mr Whittingham. He told MailOnline: 'The fact that these views are expressed within the Labour Party is deeply insulting to the memory of our greatest Prime Minister.' He added: ‘Ed Miliband must take action against those in his party who hold abhorrent views. If he can't do that he can never be up to the job of being Prime Minister.' Mr Whittingham’s remarks are also in stark contrast to the esteem in which the two-time Prime Minister is held among the general public. In a 2002 BBC poll Sir Winston was voted the Greatest Briton in history for his role defeating Nazi Germany. Sir Winston led Britain between 1940 and 1945 - and again from 1951 to 1955. He also served in the British Army in India, Sudan and South Africa – while commanding a battalion in the First World War after resigning from the Cabinet. Churchill is also the only British Prime Minister to have won the Nobel Prize in Literature and was granted the rare honour of a state funeral after his death in 1965. Sir Winston's grandson Nicholas Soames attacked the remarks as 'insulting to the memory of our greatest Prime Minister' Winston Churchill served in the Army before going into politics. Here he is pictured as a Hussars Officer in 1895 . But Labour’s Mr Whittingham, who describes his politics as ‘far left’, dismissed the statesman as a ‘racist’ who did not deserve to be honoured on the £5 note. Mr Whittingham has also expressed his desire to renationalise the major utilities – including electricity, water and rail. Churchill's critics point to several of his caustic remarks and his handling of the 1943-44 Bengal famine when between one and three million Indians died of starvation. He derided India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi as a 'half-naked holy man' and once said: 'I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.' On April 26 he wrote: ‘Bit disappointed Churchill is on the new £5 given he was a racist and white supremacist. Can't go into the future with a foot in the past.’ But Mr Whittingham's remarks are not his only controversial interventions online. He has also called for wage caps - claiming that it is ‘disgusting’ for people to be paid £100,000 when others are ‘on the breadline’. His Facebook account also lists him as a member of the ‘Socialist Workers Party Edinburgh’ group, raising concerns about his links to the fringe militant group. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing growing trouble from far-left party activists . Labour’s own rule book states that ‘A member of the party who joins and or supports a political organisation other than an official Labour group or other unit of the party…shall automatically be ineligible to be or remain a party member’. Mr Whittingham is not the first prominent Labour figure to criticise Churchill. Former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell was accused of insulting the war leader after suggesting he told worse lies about D-Day than Tony Blair had about the Iraq War. Mr Blair’s former director of communications, said Churchill used what the Second World War leader called a ‘bodyguard of lies’ to trick Hitler before the Normandy landings in June 1944 – and ‘lied’ to MPs afterwards to ‘keep various deceptions going’. Campbell argued: ‘If the pollsters were to do a survey, who had a greater commitment to wartime truth, Churchill in the Second World War or Tony Blair in Iraq, I think we know what the answer would be . . . it just wouldn’t be true.’ But his assertion was challenged by Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, who led British forces in Bosnia. ‘For Campbell to suggest that Churchill was a bigger liar than Blair is deeply insulting to the memory of our greatest Prime Minister,’ said the Beckenham MP. ‘It is absurd to compare the disinformation used by Churchill to enhance our chance of victory in the Second World War to Tony Blair’s dodgy dossiers before the Iraq War. ‘Churchill exposed the truth about German rearmament. Blair, aided by the likes of Campbell, exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam’s weapons. ‘Britain went to war with Germany legally to defend Poland and Churchill used misinformation as part of British strategy and tactics. 'The Blair Government used misinformation to drum up public support for a war that was probably illegal.’ Campbell was deeply involved in Blair’s notorious ‘45 minutes from doom’ dossier on the Iraq War in September 2002. A few months later, the spin doctor was also associated with a separate so-called ‘dodgy dossier’ about Saddam Hussein’s weapons, which turned out to be a crude copy of out-of-date research. A Labour Party spokesman said: 'This comment does not represent the view of the Labour Party.'","Benjamin Whittingham  'disappointed' Churchill was featured on £5 note .

"A rocky lookout with niches for lanterns and a subterranean cave complete with a secret waterway entrance have shed more light on the life of 17th century pirates. The two locations in the Republic of Ireland are believed to have been used by a group of 17th century pirates and smugglers, but remain unexcavated, with possible treasure thought to rest nearby. Historians believe the secret spots could have been used by a powerful alliance that was destroyed in a huge battle in 1614 when it was at the height of its power. Archaeologists have discovered two sites that they are sure were used by pirates, one of which is located at a place known today as 'Dutchman's Cove', east of Baltimore in county Cork. The location has niches for candles or lanterns (pictured) that would have been used to signal to pirates in the darkness . The area was dominated by English . pirates in the 17th century because there was a crackdown on pirates in southern England by James I. Private sailors who made a living . fighting the Spanish moved to Munster to make a living once peace was . declared. Munster at the time was a British colonisation experiment. The . local economy was buoyed by loot stolen by pirates who largely escaped . the law because of Munster’s location and cooperation by local . officials, Ms Kelleher explained. Pirates typically paid three times . the price for local goods in return for smuggling their loot ashore . without any problems, so that local business people grew rich. The practice even helped to fund exploration and colonisation projects in the Americas, such as Jamestown in Bermuda. Ms . Kelleher said: ‘Legitimate businessmen and merchant venturers were . deeply involved, as it was assured access to venture capital, that was, . in turn, invested in colonial ventures elsewhere in the New World, which . was opening up to the maritime empires globally at this point in time.’ The alliance that operated off the southwest coast of Munster at the time was wealthy and elected its own admiral, but was ultimately destroyed by a Dutch fleet, according to historians. Archaeologists have discovered two sites that they are sure were used by pirates, one of which is located at a place known today as ‘Dutchman’s Cove,’ east of Baltimore in county Cork. The site has niches for candles or lanterns that would have been used to signal to pirates in the darkness. While it might not have been used in the 17th century, underwater archaeologist Connie Kelleher, who discovered the site, told Live Science that it would have been ‘used over a very long period by pirates, smugglers and others who wanted to do secret things’. Another site nearby called Gokane Point led to a subterranean cavern that could be accessed by a boat via a small waterway – ideal for unloading stolen booty. Both the sites are unexcavated and . were found by Ms Kelleher, who works for the Ireland National Monuments . Service's underwater archaeology unit. Pirates typically paid three times the price for local goods in return for smuggling their loot ashore without any problems, so that local business people grew rich. Here, an 1887 engraving pictures a pirate selling his jewels . Underwater archaeologist Connie Kelleher, who discovered the site said that it would have been 'used over a very long period by pirates, smugglers and others who wanted to do secret things'. It is possible to see concealed steps in this photograph . An . expert in 17th century pirates, she said: ‘One pirate haul is said to . have been worth, in today's money, some $7 million. This was an . amazingly lucrative commercial venture, and this is why it was so . successful.’ The pirate . alliance in Munster was largely made up of Englishmen as well as Irish, . Flemish and ‘renegade’ Dutchmen, according to records. Ms Kelleher said they show that Arthur Drake, who was lieutenant to pirate Captain Robert Stephenson, was the only black man to have held a position of command in the motley crew. She plans to search Crookhaven Harbour, close to Gokane Point, for the remains of the destroyed alliance fleet and there is the prospect of finding treasure there, according to a list describing the loot on-board one of the ships. ‘Certainly part of the lower hulls and its cargoes could be there - things that were in the hold of the ships,’ she said. ‘Similarly, if a ship exploded, then material could be scattered, and we could be dealing with a wider archaeological site.’ While it would be difficult to tell if any ships did indeed belong to pirates, if they were found and identified, the ships would be the first pirate-associated wreck found in Irish waters. Archaeologists have discovered two sites that they are sure were used by pirates, one of which is located at a place known today as 'Dutchman's Cove' near Baltimore (pictured).

"The chances of heatwaves in Europe have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures, experts have said. Extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now likely to happen twice a decade, a new study from the Met Office found. The chances of extreme heatwaves, such as the one in 2003 which led to tens of thousands of deaths across Europe, have also increased tenfold, from a one in 1,000 year event to around one in a century. The UK Met Office says the chance of warmer weather is predicted to increase due to climate change. Warm summers and heatwaves (UK shown in 2003) will increase ten-fold, they say. Warm summers will increase from twice a century to twice a decade, while extreme heatwaves will occur once a century . By the 2040s, such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the research published in the journal Nature Climate Change found. The study is an update of research carried out in 2004 into the heatwave the previous year. It found the likelihood of it happening again has at least doubled as a result of human activity, such as burning fossil fuels. Despite a slowdown in rising global temperatures since the late 1990s, the new study found summer temperatures in central and Mediterranean Europe affected by the 2003 heatwave had increased by 0.81°C (1.4°F) between the 1990s and the period 2004 to 2013. 2014 is on course to be the hottest year on record not just in the UK but across the entire globe, experts claim. UK temperatures from the beginning of January to late November were 1.6°C (2.8°F) above the long-term average, making it the warmest since records began in 1910, the Met Office said. The scorching temperatures mean only an Arctic-like December - which would have to be one of the ten coldest ever - could stop this year from topping the table. The prediction comes as figures reveal that global temperatures for this year are also above the long-term average from January to October, heralding a warning from experts that the threat from climate change is real. The rises have increased the chances of summer heatwaves, defined as having temperatures of 1.6°C (2.8°F) above the long-term average, and extreme hot weather events such as the summer of 2003, which was 2.3C (4.1°F) above the 1961-1990 average. Dr Nikos Christidis, lead author of the new paper, said: 'Extremely warm summers that would occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now expected to happen twice a decade. 'Moreover, the chances of heatwaves as extreme as seen in 2003 have increased from about one in a 1,000 to about one in a 100 years and are projected to occur every other year by the 2030s to 2040s under continuing greenhouse gas emissions.' Dr Peter Stott, co-author of the study, said: 'This paper shows how our vulnerability to heat extremes is rapidly changing and we expect that to continue going forward.' He said that projections of future changes to the climate suggest that by the end of the century, summers as hot as 2003 could be considered 'unusually cool'. Both the 2004 study and the latest research looked at the same region, covering parts of central and Mediterranean Europe. It did not cover the UK. Although the UK was less severely affected by the 2003 heatwave, extremely hot summers are also expected to become more common here as a result of a warming climate. In 2003, an extreme heatwave killed tens of thousands of people in Europe. Shown here is the temperature difference in 2003 compared to 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004. If emissions continue to rise, the occurrence of such heatwaves could increase further to every other year by the 2040s .","The UK Met Office says the chance of warmer weather in Europe is predicted to increase due to climate change .

"Women who like to work out know that finding perfectly-fitting underwear that’s supportive, can be just as challenging as running a marathon. Now, scientists have created a ‘bionic bra’ that automatically tightens in response to breast movement, in a bid to make running more comfortable for women. The smart underwear prototype contains hidden sensors to monitor and control movement. Scientists have created a ‘bionic bra’ that automatically tightens in response to breast movement, to make running more comfortable for women. From right to left, Professor Julia Steele, Professor Gordon Wallace and Dr Sheridan Gho are pictured . It has so far taken researchers at the University of Wollongong (UoW), in New South Wales, Australia, 15 years to develop and it could still be a while before it hits the shops. Professor Gordon Wallace, Executive Research Director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, based at the university, explained that progress has been accelerated of late because the team discovered new actuators and sensing technologies. ‘Our ability to make things from advanced materials has been greatly enhanced recently with the advent of new approaches to fabrication,’ he said. ‘The advent of approaches such as 3D printing has enabled us to assemble structures containing new sensing technologies to more accurately monitor movement and new artificial muscle technologies to control it. Keep on running: The underwear is designed to make running more comfortable for women (pictured) and to prevent long-term damage caused by underwear that provides no support . Almost one third of 1,300 female runners who registered for the London Marathon in 2013 said they experienced breast pain when exercising. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the proportion that complained of discomfort rose with increasing cup size, The British Medical Journal reported. Half of those with a cup size of F or larger complained of pain, compared with one in four of those with an A size cup. While half blamed the pain on their menstrual cycle, three in 10 said it was associated with unsupportive underwear, with nine out of 10 wearing a sports bra . Half of the women surveyed said they experienced breast pain during moderate exercise while almost two thirds said their breasts were painful during vigorous exercise. As many as one in 10 described the pain as 'distressing' or 'excruciating' and one in six said it put them off exercising. ‘These advances have inspired us to (re)confront the challenges involved in creating the Bionic Bra.’ Since the beginning of the project, Professor Julia Steele, Director of Breast Research Australia at UoW, has been investigating the movement of women’s breast during physical activity. She said that without the right breast support, long-term damage can be done, including numbness in the fingers caused by compression of nerves on the shoulders, as well as neck and back pain. ‘Unfortunately, the most supportive sports bras tend to be the most uncomfortable to wear. ‘Making matters worse, bra research has found that 85 per cent of women are wearing bras that do not fit or support their breasts correctly,’ she said. While the bionic bra is a step closer to hitting shops, there are still some problems that need to be ironed out. Professor Steele said: ‘Although we have made substantial progress, we still have a way to go before the bionic bra can be taken from the bench top to the washing machine. However, when finished, the bionic bra will transform bra design.’ Team member Dr Sheridan Gho added: ‘Results indicate that our technologies can sense breast motion and provide additional breast support. ‘The challenge now is to integrate these technologies into a functional, comfortable bra.’ Professor Wallace spoke about the smart bra at the 9th Australasian Biomechanics Conference (ABC9) where research to measure the effectiveness of rugby headwear was also a hot topic.","Researchers at the University of Wollongong, Australia, have been working on the bra for 15 years and have finally completed a prototype .

"The Duchess of Cambridge shares an ancestor with the late Queen Mother, it has been revealed. The discovery was made by Michael Reed, from Australia when he was researching the famous Blakiston-Bowes Cabinet. Built in Newcastle in around 1700, the cabinet is now housed at the New York MET Museum and is coincidentally due to be seen by Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate during their first official visit there. It has been revealed that the Queen Mother (left) and the Duchess of Cambridge (right) share a mutual ancestor . The extravagant piece, which has both the Blakiston and Bowes family crests on it's doors, was made to celebrate the wedding between the two biggest families in County Durham - the Blakistons and the Bowes-Lyons. And it was this wedding that makes the connection between Queen Elizabeth's mother and the Duchess of Cambridge with Sir William Blakiston, of Gibside Hall, near Gateshead, being the common ancestor that they share. Elizabeth, Sir William's great granddaughter, married into the Bowes-Lyon family. Elizabeth's descendent is the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who last visited the family estate in 1968. Michael Reed, who made the connection between the two women while studying the Blakiston-Bowes Cabinet, says the relation could be the reason Kate wore the Queen Mother's tiara on her wedding day . Michael Reed said his research revealed that the Blakiston Baronets and the Baronets of Conyers of Horden, Kate's ancestors, were the wealthiest landowners in Northern England. They married into the Bowes-Lyon family so that they could share each others' vast coal estates at Gibside. Michael added that this connection could even be the reason for the crown that was worn by the Duchess on her wedding day. 'It makes sense that Kate wore the Queen Mother's tiara when she married Prince William - both women share a great deal, Durham ancestry, the vast Gibside Estate and the same famous cabinet.' Prince William and Duchess Kate are currently on an official visit to New York and are coincidentally due to visit the MET Museum where the famous cabinet is housed . Kate's direct ancestor, Sir Thomas Blakiston Conyers, also attended the funeral of his Gibside cousin Mary Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was the Queen Mother's great-great-great-grandmother, considered at the time of her death in 1800 to be the wealthiest woman in England. Weardale Royalist Anita Atkinson agreed that the discovery was not actually surprising, especially since there was a strong connection with The Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle. 'It does not surprise me at all.' said the Royalist adding: 'When Kate married William, I hoped that she would take County Durham from where the Queen Mother left it because each member of the Royal family used to have their own area and when the Queen Mother was alive she was always here.' Anita added that it is not uncommon to find this kind of ancestral connection within the royal family. 'Of course we have to remember that the Queen Mother was not royal, she was only a member of the Royal family because she married a prince, but if we look at the ancestry of the Royal family we would see that they were intermarried all the time.'","Australian Michael Reed made the discovery while studying the Blakiston-Bowes Cabinet .

"Scientists at Bristol University believe mini doses of Prozac could help ease the irritability and mood-swings associated with PMS (file picture) Mini doses of Prozac could end the monthly misery of PMS, scientists believe. They say that the irritability and mood-swings of pre-menstrual syndrome are caused by plummeting levels of a hormone that keep a lid on emotions. Prozac raises levels of this natural sedative and so should stop a woman’s mood fluctuating in the run up to her period. The doses given would be much smaller than those used to treat depression – cutting the risk of the side-effects that have dogged Prozac’s use in psychiatry. Bristol University researcher Thelma Lovick said: ‘Pre-menstrual syndrome is an enormous problem. ‘Something like 80 per cent of women suffer in some way. ‘And it’s not just women – it’s their partners, their families and their workmates. ‘It is a terribly British thing to just brush it under the carpet and say “It’s women’s trouble”.’ ‘It is caused by hormones and there is something we can do about it. And everybody would benefit.’ Dr Lovick, who did her research with colleagues in Brazil, said that the symptoms of PMS seem to be caused by a sharp fall in levels of the hormone progesterone around a week before a woman menstruates. Normally, a waste product of progesterone called allopregnanolone, or allo, acts as a natural tranquilliser and keeps the brain circuits that control emotions calm. When progesterone falls, the amount of this sedative falls and emotions run riot. Dr Lovick, who has likened the brain changes caused by lack of allo to those experienced by a heroin addict denied their fix, has shown that Prozac raises levels of allo. Given to rats, the drug banished the increased sensitivity to pain and stress they normally occurs at the same point in their cycle as women experience PMS. Dr Lovick says that given to women, Prozac could ease the anxiety and irritability that often occurs ahead of a period. The scientist, who has published her work in the British Journal of Pharmacology, said: ‘If you have got PMS, you get irritated by things that wouldn’t annoy you at other times.’ Dr Lovick hopes the treatment will also ease other symptoms of PMS, including bloating and lethargy, but won’t know until the drug has been trialled on women. She hopes to start tests on women soon. Regular strength Prozac lifts depression by raising levels of ‘feel good brain’ chemical serotonin but can cause problems from loss of libido to suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Mood swings are caused by plummeting levels of the hormone progesterone. Prozac raises levels of a natural sedative which controls emotions and so should stop fluctuating moods, the researchers said . Using much lower doses, around a fifth of those used to treat depression, would not have any effect on serotonin and so the odds of side-effects should be reduced. In addition, women would not take the drug every day. Instead, they take one a day for a week from when they first show signs of PMS. Michael Dooley, a consultant gynaecologist and spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said that some doctors already prescribe low-dose Prozac for PMS. Women are anxious about taking the pills but the results have been ‘fantastic’. But Linda Gask, a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, warned of the possible side-effects. She said: ‘The problem is that when you take medication, you are going to have side-effects. ‘With a low dose, side-effects will be less likely but I think most psychiatrists are concerned about medicalising something that you could probably find other ways of managing.’ Although PMS is often viewed as a minor inconvenience, it affects around 80 per cent of women - and up to 40 per cent of those say it damages their quality of life. In extreme cases, women can become violent and suffer from severe depression. There is also an economic impact, with research suggesting that time off and loss of productivity due to the syndrome annually costs employers around £3,000 per female employee.","Mini doses of the antidepressant could help ease pre-menstrual syndrome .

"Susan Parkin, 73, was given just a four per cent chance of survival and spent six days in intensive care, fighting for her life after the ordeal . A pensioner suffering a brain anerusym was given just a four per cent chance of survival after being refused an ambulance by the dedicated NHS computer system. Susanne Parkin's husband Michael called 999 after she woke at 2am with an excruciating pain in her head and started drifting in and out of consciousness. But she was not deemed an emergency and later spent six days in hospital fighting for her life. Despite attempting to outline the seriousness of the situation, Mr Parkin was told by the call operator that it wasn't necessary to rush his 73-year-old wife to hospital and advised him to call out their doctor. A nurse from the local GP practice came out at breakfast time and almost immediately told Mr Parkin to drive his wife to hospital as it would be quicker than waiting for an ambulance. By the time the pensioner arrived at hospital she was unconscious. She underwent emergency surgery and spent six days in intensive care after being diagnosed with a ruptured brain aneurysm. Doctors later told her she had been given just a four per cent chance of survival. Mrs Parkin, from Corfe Mullen, Dorset, is the second person to slam the NHS's so-called 'computer says no' triage system it uses to assess emergency cases. Last week the widow of taxi driver Bill McLaughlin spoke out after he was refused an ambulance by the same ambulance - only to be rushed to hospital eight hours later and died of heart failure. The ambulance service's triage system involves a call handler asking the person questions about their condition and inputting the answers into a computer which 'listens out' for key words and decides whether to send an ambulance. Despite the NHS website describing a ruptured brain aneurysm as a 'medical emergency' and Mrs Parkin describing two of the four main symptoms to the operator, the South Western Ambulance Trust maintains it was right to refer her to the out-of-hours GP service. Mrs Parkin said: 'I woke up with the most terrible pain and asked my husband to call an ambulance. I was very aware that it was not a normal headache, we told them about the pain and the stiff neck. 'The operator insisted on speaking to me even though I was going in and out of consciousness and then they said they wouldn't send an ambulance. 'I didn't answer in what they considered the right way so I didn't tick the right boxes that would make them come out. But neither of us remember them offering the out-of-hours GP service. In a written reply, ambulance trust bosses admitted the handling Mr Parkin's 999 call had fallen well short of standards and apologised for the lapse in service. 'I was told so many times in hospital I should have died and how lucky I was. I had a four per cent chance of living and my doctor said it was as serious as it gets. If that isn't an emergency I don't know what is. 'I can't fault the doctors and nurses, they were superb, but I'm upset with the ambulance service. All the delay because they didn't come out caused a lot of problems. 'I learned of Bill McLaughlin's case and realised it was almost identical to what I had experienced. I didn't know until then that the decision was made by a computer and I was totally outraged. 'I don't think the general public are aware that these decisions are made by a computer. It's entirely ridiculous to judge humans like this and not help someone if they don't tick the right boxes. 'I was lucky but the other poor woman lost her husband. It's just wrong that this system is in place.' Following Mrs Parkin's ordeal her husband Michael wrote to South Western Ambulance Service to complain about their treatment of his wife. NHS Pathways is a software used by the NHS to to classify public calls for medical care and emergency medical services - such as 999 or 112 calls. It is used by six ambulance trusts in the UK. The main idea behind the system is to reduce unnecessary call-outs for emergency services. It is diagnosed to deal with any health problem and refer the patient to the appropriate service . The idea is that any healthcare problem can be triaged by any arm of the NHS - emergency or non-emergency - and can be directed to any possible health care provider without the need for a second triage on referral, or any delay. In a written reply, trust bosses admitted the handling Mr Parkin's 999 call had fallen well short of their standards and apologised for the lapse in service. The letter read: 'The triage of the 999 call for your wife has been carefully reviewed and audited by the Trust's QI team who have determined that the actions of the EMA taking the call did not meet the expected standard. 'To pass a quality audit, the triage of a 999 call must achieve a percentage 'score' of 86 per cent. 'The 999 call for your wife achieved 59 per cent, significantly lower than the standards expected by the Trust and I would like to specifically apologise again for the standard of this service.' In a press statement, the Trust said: 'South Western Ambulance Service is sorry that Mr Parkin felt the need to complain about the service he received following a 999 call for his wife back in May this year. 'The Trust acknowledges that some aspects of the call could have been handled better and actions have been taken to address this. However, the outcome of assessing Mrs Parkin’s symptoms was that an out-of-hours GP should call within two hours. 'This was the correct and appropriate response to the call, which Mr and Mrs Parkin chose not to accept. 'The triage system (NHS Pathways) used by our 999 call-handlers is a robust, national system, designed by clinicians to determine the most appropriate care pathway for patients. 'Emergency ambulances are for immediately life-threatening emergencies only. If a patient is not thought to be suffering a life-threatening emergency, they can be re-triaged by a clinician (paramedic, emergency care practitioner, nurse or sometimes a doctor) in the control room to ensure that patient receives the right level of care for their current symptoms and condition. 'If it is deemed that a patient needs to speak with an out-of-hours GP, this will be organised by the Trust – there is no expectation for the patient to make that arrangement themselves. 'Callers are always advised to call back on 999 if the patient’s condition deteriorates.' The family of a man who died after he was refused an ambulance claimed last week he lost his life because an NHS ‘computer said no’. Taxi driver Bill McLaughlin dialled 999 at 5am he was finding it hard to breathe. But after putting his details into a computer an operator told him he did not need an ambulance. Bill McLaughlin, 55, died after being refused an ambulance - despite telling the operator he was struggling to breathe . The 55-year-old, a former merchant seaman, had been ill for three weeks and had seen five doctors about swelling after a change in his blood pressure medication. It has now emerged he did not give the answers that ‘trigger’ the need for an ambulance and was told to contact his GP instead. Mr McLaughlin died four days later, on September 1. A post-mortem examination found fluid around his body had caused heart failure. His family demanded to know why an ambulance had not been sent in the first place, from a station just three minutes from his home in Bridport, Dorset. They were told a computer system had decided neither an ambulance nor immediate hospital admission was necessary. The ‘computer says no’ catchphrase was coined by comedian David Walliams in the BBC’s Little Britain, in which a worker inputs data and then informs a customer they cannot be helped.","Susanne Parkin's husband Michael called 999 when she woke suffering an excruciating pain in her head and drifted in and out of consciousness .

We are still working on a lot of hot spots,' Piringer said to WTOP.Com . Piringer said that those hurt in the plane crash were in such bad shape that they couldn't be transported for medical attention. Deceased: Michael K. Rosenberg, who is a CEO of North Carolina company, Health Decisions was onboard the flight. 'No one was transported to a hospital. They were not able to survive the crash,' said Piringer to the Washington Post. The most badly affected home was the two-story, wooden frame one which was gutted by the impact of the crash and ensuing blaze. The first floor was nearly completely blown out and smoke drifted from a gaping hole in what was left of the collapsing roof. Two adjacent homes also had significant damage, with one of them clearly having caught fire, as well.

Witness Tracey Everett told NBC Washington that she saw the plane in difficulty before it came down. 'You could tell he was struggling with the sticks. He was trying to pull up; he would gain a little elevation and then drop again,' said Everett. 'His wings were wobbling back and forth, very unsteadily.' Suddenly the aircraft began to roll and came down onto the row of houses. '...I doubled around, got into the block just before some of the firetrucks got here, and just realized there was nothing I could do,' said Everett.

Fred Pedreira, 67, who lives near the crash site, said he had just returned home from the grocery store and was parking his car when he saw the jet and immediately knew something was wrong. 'This guy, when I saw him, for a fast jet with the wheels down, I said, 'I think he's coming in too low,'' Pedreira told The Associated Press. 'Then he was 90 degrees — sideways — and then he went belly-up into the house and it was a ball of fire. It was terrible. 'I tell you, I got goosebumps when I saw it. I said, 'My God, those are people in that plane,' Pedreira said. 'I just hope nobody was in that home.' The jet is registered to Sage Aviation in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

"Spurs still so far from the top four . It was the same old story for Tottenham at Man City. They have now conceded 26 goals in their last seven games against the champions. They want to get back in the top four but at the moment they could not be further from it. They have struggled ever since they sold Gareth Bale and most of the men they brought in have not been good enough. Arsenal got a lot of stick for not signing players but they have spent the best part of £100million on Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck and Mathieu Debuchy. Roberto Soldado was again under par during Tottenham's 4-1 defeat by Manchester City on Saturday . Erik Lamela (right) gave yet another disappointing performance in a Tottenham shirt . Arsenal's £16m signing Danny Welbeck rescued a point with a late equaliser against Hull . Alexis Sanchez, who joined Arsenal from Barcelona for £30m, opened the scoring against the Tigers . Those are ambitious signings of proven quality. Spurs have spent plenty of money but how many of those transfers were for top-class players? Erik Lamela has not lived up to his billing and clearly Roberto Soldado is not the answer up front. They still look short at centre half, too. Younes Kaboul gave away a penalty at City — exactly what you don’t want your captain to do — and the rest just could not cope with Sergio Aguero. Tottenham have paid a lot of money for an awful lot of players. I just hope they kept the receipt. It's a shootout for the title . That was some performance by Sergio Aguero. He was absolutely magnificent against Tottenham and with Manchester City and Chelsea the two favourites for the title, it could come down to a shootout between Aguero and Diego Costa. Watching both of them play at Atletico Madrid, I always felt they could score goals in the Premier League. They have started this season in electric form with nine goals each. The only problem is they are prone to muscle injuries. With both sides looking good, it could come down to which striker stays fit enough to fire his team to the title. Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (left) and Chelsea's Diego Costa (right) both have nine goals this season . Aguero scored all four goals in Manchester City's 4-1 win over Tottenham at the Etihad . VIDEO Aguero had his best day - Pochettino . Redknapp's first column of the season, tipping Ronald Koeman's Southampton to do well . Saints march on . At the start of the season there was a lot of worry around Southampton. People were questioning if they could survive relegation, let alone perform to the same levels as last season. I always thought they would be fine but they have been so good I have had to write about them almost every week! They were brilliant against Sunderland, even though Gus Poyet’s side were absolutely woeful. They have a good squad and with Dusan Tadic supplying Graziano Pelle, they always look like scoring. I loved that even after scoring so many goals Ronald Koeman still wanted more. He was urging his team to get forward and it was the perfect all-round performance. Southampton recorded a thumping 8-0 victory over Sunderland to continue their strong start to the season . Super Sakho . You can’t help but be impressed by West Ham’s firepower at the moment. Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have come in and immediately been banging in the goals. At £12million you would expect Valencia to produce the goods but Sakho has been a revelation. Last season he was scoring goals for Metz in the French second division but his pace and power make him the perfect fit for the Premier League. He cost just £3.5million and is the kind of player every manager dreams of discovering. Credit to Sam Allardyce and co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold because with six goals in his last six games, Sakho looks worth his weight in gold. Diafra Sakho (left) is congratulated by Mark Noble after giving West Ham the lead at Burnley . A Sterling show from Raheem . Nobody came out of the row over Raheem Sterling with any credit. Thankfully on Sunday he gave us a reminder of just why we should all really be talking about him. I was at Loftus Road and Sterling put in a wonderful display. He had energy, was zipping past people and at times looked like he could run through a puddle without making a splash. He is a special player and the last thing we want is for him to start feeling that playing for England is a chore when it’s a privilege. Any future issues have to be kept in house because he is a prized asset to be nurtured, not criticised. Raheem Sterling was back in Liverpool's starting XI for their 3-2 victory against QPR at Loftus Road . Only two teams in the top seven tiers of English football are still undefeated this season - Chelsea and Bristol City. More brilliance from Bristol . What a job Steve Cotterill is doing at Bristol City. He has an intense way of working but it’s obviously doing the trick. A win against Coventry means they already have a five-point lead at the top of League One and remain unbeaten. Bristol is something of a sleeping giant as a football city, but Cotterill is doing his best to wake them up. Steve Cotterill's Bristol City side beat Coventry 3-1 on Saturday to remain unbeaten and top of League One . Bright futures . On Saturday I went with a friend of mine to watch his lad play for Chelsea’s Under 7s team. It was so good to see so many young kids with lovely skill and technique. One boy in particular really looked the part. He stepped up and took two corners — one with his left foot and one with his right. He was so comfortable with both feet and it was a real pleasure to see that in a young kid. People often complain that we don’t produce technically gifted youngsters in this country but there’s no reason why we can’t. Watching those kids on Saturday, it was reassuring to know that they were being developed in just the right way. 10 - Despite their 4-1 drubbing, Spurs showed good attacking intent against Man City. Mauricio Pochettino’s side had 10 shots at goal in the first half at the Etihad, including blocked shots. That’s the most by any team against Man City so far this season and no team had more than 10 in the whole of last season - Southampton matched that total in December 2013. 8 - Since the start of last season, Everton’s Seamus Coleman  has scored eight league goals, more than any other defender in the same time frame. Seamus Coleman scores Everton's third goal in their 3-0 win against Aston Villa at Goodison Park . 4 - Mohamed Diame has now scored four goals in five Premier League games. That’s the same as his total last year and he has never scored more than four in a PL season. 700th - West Ham's 3-1 win at Burnley was their 700th game in the Premier League. They are only the ninth team to reach that total after Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester United and Newcastle. 1st - Liverpool's 3-2 win at Loftus Road was the first time in their Premier League history that they have benefited from two own goals in the same game. Centre halves Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker were the unlucky pair for QPR. Liverpool beat QPR 3-2 at Loftus Road, but were helped by two own goals from the home side . 1982 - Sunderland's 8-0 hammering at Southampton was their heaviest league defeat since an 8-0 loss to Watford in September 1982. 2012 - Gabriel Obertan scored his first league goal for Newcastle since February 2012, when he scored in a 2-0 win at Blackburn. It ended a run of 24 games without a goal. Gabriel Obertan scored the only goal as Newcastle beat Leicester 1-0 at St James' Park .","Tottenham were thrashed by Manchester City once again .

Russell Wilson, who has earned a reputation as a devout Christian and a positive role model in the much-maligned league, began divorce proceedings against his wife, Ashton Meem, back in April after two years of marriage. A short time later, rumors began circulating that Ashton Meem had an affair with Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate, who has since gone to play for the Detroit Lions - Joseph Fauria's team. The 24-year-old tight end for the Lions has made a name for himself in the NFL for his over-the-top touchdown celebrations.

"By allowing only the best eggs or embryos to be selected for IVF, the Oxford University test is expected to slash the odds of miscarriage and greatly boost the chances of a woman having a healthy baby (picture posed by model) A three-in-one test that could almost guarantee the chance of having a baby could be available within months. By allowing only the best eggs or embryos to be selected for IVF, the Oxford University test is expected to slash the odds of miscarriage and greatly boost the chances of a woman having a healthy baby. This would cut the financial and emotional costs of trying time after time to start a family. IVF costs between £3,000 and £15,000 a course, but success is far from guaranteed. Just one in four of the 40,000 women who have it each year have a baby. The test's inventor, Dagan Wells, said: 'It offers the possibility of enhancing success rates of IVF, allowing couples to more rapidly get to the point of having a child and avoids the heartbreak of miscarriage and termination of pregnancies affected by serious disorders.' The new technique builds on an existing test called array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) which counts the number of chromosomes in an egg or embryo. Healthy eggs should have 23 chromosomes and embryos 46, but many have more or less than this, greatly increasing the risk of miscarriage and of having a child with a condition such as Down's syndrome. Up to three-quarters of miscarriages are thought to be due to embryos having the wrong number of chromosomes, with eggs from older women particularly likely to be defective. 'Astonishing' results released two years ago revealed array CGH to more than double a woman’s odds of getting pregnant. Now, the technique’s pioneer Dr Wells is trying to make it even better by bolting on two other checks. He told the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference that one involves counting the number of mitochondria – the tiny ‘batteries’ inside cells that turn the food we eat into energy. The other involves checking structures called telomeres. These are tiny biological clocks that cap the ends of chromosomes, protecting them from damage, much like the caps on the ends of shoelaces prevent fraying. Studies suggest that short or fraying telomeres can make the difference between ‘life or death’ for an embryo. Dr Wells said testing for three defects rather than one could take the IVF success rate from the 80 per cent or so of array CGH to approaching 100 per cent. ‘We hope to fill in that gap and get closer to getting a successful pregnancy from every IVF cycle.’ He added that his test won’t help women whose pregnancies fail because of problems with the womb. But this is not a major cause of IVF failure and other researchers are working on ways of getting round it. Dr Wells plans to make it available to around 15 British IVF clinics within weeks.  However, initially, only the chromosome data will be used when deciding which embryos to use in IVF. After around six months, he will look at the telomere and mitochondria data taken from the embryos at the time and see whether it also helped predict the women’s odds of becoming pregnant. If so, he plans to make the full three-in-one test available to British clinics. It will only be available privately initially and is expected to add around £2,000 to the cost of IVF, the same as array CGH. The British Fertility Society has previously cautioned against the use of array CGH until there is large-scale data on how well it works.","Financial cost of trying to start a family would be cut .

"Margaret Thatcher would have secretly ‘cheered on’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage for speaking out on immigration and Europe, ex-Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken has claimed. As the Conservatives brace themselves to be beaten by Ukip in May’s European elections, Mr Aitken said Baroness Thatcher would have had ‘not just a sneaking sympathy but a lot of leanings towards Nigel Farage’. The remarks risk reigniting the row over the former Prime Minister’s views almost a year after her death. Margaret Thatcher would have 'a lot of leanings' towards Ukip leader Nigel Farage, according to Jonathan Aitken . Mr Aitken, a former MP who went out with Baroness Thatcher’s daughter Carol for three years, said many of her political views were closer to Mr Farage than the Tory leadership. Speaking at the Oxford Literary Festival, he said: ‘I think secretly she would have cheered him on. I think he voices a lot of her prejudices. ‘She would never have said I vote for Ukip, I vote for Farage. But a lot of the views Nigel Farage expresses ... on immigration, on the idea [that] Britain can manage as a worldleading nation without relying on the European Union, and above all she was really fed up [with] centralism and liberalism and Brussels domination,’ the Telegraph reported. ‘I think she would have had not just a sneaking sympathy but a lot of leanings towards Nigel Farage, without ever quite coming out for Ukip.’ Mr Aitken was a Tory MP from 1974-97, serving in John Major’s Cabinet for a year as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He was jailed for perjury in 1999. He made the remarks while promoting his book, Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality, which he says covers the period when ‘she goes off the rails’ after her resignation. Former Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken who dated Baroness Thatcher's daughter Carol for three years . Earlier this month he claimed Baroness Thatcher promoted male MPs based on whether they were good-looking or not. She was a ‘surprisingly insecure’ woman who was ‘very influenced by male good looks’, he told a book festival in Bath. The claim that Baroness Thatcher would have sympathy with Ukip was controversially made by Mr Farage himself last year, days after she died at the age of 87. Speaking at a Parliamentary Press Gallery lunch, Mr Farage sought to claim Baroness Thatcher as a UKIP supporter, arguing that if a young Margaret Roberts were setting out on the journey into British politics today she would reject Mr Cameron. He said: ‘What is absolutely clear is that Margaret Thatcher from the mid-1990s thought this country should leave the European Union. ‘And I cannot believe that a young Margaret Thatcher leaving Oxford today would join the Conservative party led by John Major. ‘I think she’d come and get involved in UKIP and no doubt topple me within 12 months or so.’ When journalists pointed out to him that Sir John is not the Tory leader, and has not been since 1997, Mr Farage added: ‘Sorry Cameron I meant, but then what is the difference? I can’t spot them.’ However, the claims were dismissed at the time, with Tory MP Therese Coffey saying 'Farage talking garbage’. And Conservative MP Conor Burns, a friend of the former premier, added: 'Sadly for him Margaret Thatcher was a tribal Conservative throughout her life and died a Conservative.","Aitken, who dated Carol Thatcher for three years, claims 'leanings' to Ukip .

"An asteroid the size of three double decker buses and travelling at at 33,000 mph came closer to Earth than the Moon last night. At 21:07 GMT (16:07 EST), the asteroid made its closest approach, reaching a distance of less than 217,000 miles (350,000 km), or nine-tenths of the distance between the moon and Earth.

"A teenage girl has died and four other have been left in hospital after taking a pill known as 'Mortal Kombat'. Regane MacColl, 17, is understood to have fallen ill after taking a red tablet with a dragon image on it while on a night out with her friends at Glasgow nightspot The Arches on Saturday. The pill, believed to be an ecstasy-style drug, is thought to have been the same substance which hospitalised four other young people over the weekend. Her death comes amid warnings of a new type of slow-releasing narcotic called PMA, which means users take more without realising the effects are delayed. Regane MacColl, 17, has died after taking an Ecstasy-style pill called Mortal Kombat while out clubbing in Glasgow . PMA has been found in Mortal Kombat pills in the past but it is unclear whether the narcotic was present in the tablet Miss MacColl took. Miss MacColl, from Clydebank, in West Dunbartonshire, has been described as a 'popular, hardworking and enthusiastic pupil' at the town's St Peter the Apostle High School. Headteacher Linda Booth said: 'Our whole school community feels a deep sense of grief and our thoughts and prayers are with Regane's family and friends at this devastating time. 'Regane was a popular, hardworking and enthusiastic pupil and staff always found her to be very pleasant and well mannered. 'This is a real tragedy for a girl who worked so hard and I'm sure she would have gone on to achieve so much in her life. 'We are doing everything that we can to support all of our young people and staff at this sad time.' A post-mortem examination will be carried out on the schoolgirl, who died at the weekend. Miss MacColl has been described as a 'popular, hardworking and enthusiastic pupil' The Mortal Kombat pill is also understood to have hospitalised four other young people over the weekend . Police have said the 'Mortal Kombat' pill is believed to be a common link between Regane's death and the four other young people who were taken ill. A 19-year-old woman was admitted to Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Sunday and later discharged. Two 18-year-old men and one man aged 26 received treatment at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock after being out on Friday. One of the 18 year-olds was later transferred to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride where he is in a serious but stable condition. Miss MacColl fell ill at Glasgow nightspot The Arches after taking a red tablet with a dragon image on it on Saturday night . As part of the ongoing investigation a 19-year-old woman was arrested on Sunday in Clydebank in connection with alleged drugs offences. She has been released for report and is due to appear at a later date. It is understood the arrest was not in connection with mortal kombat pills. According to The Times, police believe Miss MacColl's death may have been caused by mixing the drugs with alcohol or other substances. Speaking to the paper, Harry Shapiro, of charity Drugscope, said a recent rise in the number of deaths connected to taking ecstasty was often because of the tablets containing another substance called PMA. While the full contents of the Mortal Kombat pill are not yet known, drug experts have warned it may contain another substance called PMA, which was blamed for the deaths of more than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester last year. It is better-known in the form of pills costing as little as £3. They are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an 'M', but it also comes in a crystal-like form (pictured above). The drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy's main chemical, MDMA. But the active ingredient in PMA is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in, meaning many revellers take extra pills. The youngest known victim was 16-year-old Ellie Jones, who died after suffering breathing difficulties at a friend’s house in Warrington. Nine recent deaths in the north-west have been linked to possible contaminated ecstasy.PMA has also been linked to deaths in Canada, Norway and Denmark. Gym instructor Travis Barber, from Salford, was just 19 when he suffered a violent fatal reaction to PMA. His mother, Dr Louise Barber, said after an inquest: ‘I would say [to young people] just don’t do it and please avoid all drugs. 'It’s like playing Russian Roulette with your life.' It is not known whether the Mortal Kombat pill does contained the substance PMA, but the substance does often have the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy's main chemical, MDMA. But the active ingredient in PMA is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in, meaning many revellers take extra pills. Mr Shapiro told The Times: 'It could turn out that this ""Mortal Kombat"" pill is an ecstasy tablet that has PMA in it.' Last week the Scottish Drugs Form issued a warning about another type of pill with a Superman logo on one side and a 'half score' line and 'R' logo on the other. The forum said some of the tablets had been examined and were found to contain para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA). A spokesman for The Arches said: 'The Arches are deeply saddened by events that took place in the early hours of Sunday morning. First and foremost our sincere condolences go to the young woman's family. 'We are working closely with Police Scotland to assist them in any way we can with their inquiries into the circumstances of this tragic incident. Until the police have concluded those inquiries it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.' Police and doctors have warned people to beware of illicit drugs. Detective Inspector Sharon MacGregor said: 'I can't stress enough how dangerous drugs are, sadly a young woman has died and several other young people are ill in hospital. 'Illicit drugs are unstable, unpredictable and extremely dangerous as this outcome shows, often the content of the drugs is unknown but they could contain dangerous chemicals and people need to understand the devastating effect they can have. I would strongly advise people to avoid illicit drugs and report any information to the police.' Dr Alastair Ireland, emergency medicine director at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, said: 'We are deeply concerned about people taking this dangerous drug and cannot stress enough the effects they can cause including death. I would urge anyone who has taken one of these tablets and begins to feel unwell to seek immediate medical help.' James Stevenson, an A&E consultant with NHS Ayrshire and Arran, warned that people who take drugs are 'playing Russian roulette with their life'.","Regane MacColl, 17, died after taking Mortal Kombat pill while out clubbing .

"A DJ who killed a friend with a single punch after a row about a cartoon penis was cleared of manslaughter today. Victim Anthony Thompson, 26, had woken up after a house party to find a crude lipstick drawing had been scrawled on his face while he slept as a joke. Fists flew when a furious Mr Thompson challenged fellow party-goer and DJ Thomas Evans, 32, to a fight - after mistakenly assuming he had drawn the genitalia, the court heard. Cleared: Thomas Evans, 32, claimed he had acted in self-defence when Anthony Thompson, 26, challenged him to a fight outside a block of flats in south London. The pair squared up outside a block . of flats in south London and Evans punched Mr Thompson after he was hit . with a glancing blow. Mr Evans claimed he had acted in self-defence when he delivered a knock-out blow to Mr Thompson, adding that the victim swung the first punch at him, the court heard. Mr Thompson fell to the floor, hitting his head and sustaining fatal brain damage. Evans was cleared of manslaughter by an Old Bailey jury after nearly 15 hours’ deliberation spanning three days. Row: A fight broke out after Anthony Thompson, pictured, woke up to find a penis has been drawn on his face . He doubled over in the dock as the . verdict was announced before clasping his hands and beaming at jurors, . while Mr Thompson’s family stormed out of the courtroom. Describing the clash in a police interview, he said: ‘It was like a Rocky film where they both punch at exactly the same time. ‘But he threw the first punch. Then I flung my left hand out. ‘It was just a straight reaction, a defence mechanism - that’s what it was. ‘I didn’t even think. I just done it.’ Fatal blow: Anthony Thompson, 26, died after he was struck with a single blow and hit his head on the floor following argument at a party in Tooting Bec in February of 2012 . Both men had been to a party at a one-bedroom third-floor flat in Holmbury Court, Tooting Bec, on February 5 last year. Evans . had spent the previous evening DJing at the nearby Bec Bar while Mr . Thompson had been to a nightclub at the O2 Arena in North Greenwich. The house party, organised by Vanessa . Barrows, had started at around 4am and continued until 2pm, by which . point Mr Thompson had fallen asleep in an armchair. Spark: Vanessa Barrows told the court she drew the cartoon penis on his face using lipstick . Ms . Barrows, who smiled and winked at Evans as she entered the witness box . on crutches, said: ‘Some condoms fell out of his pocket. We had a laugh. ‘So I got my lipstick out and drew a penis on his face.’ Friend Marlon Fuller was also smeared with lipstick while he was sleeping. Mr Thompson was not initially upset by the cartoon penis, but began boasting he could knock Evans out. As the older man tried to leave, Mr Thompson followed him and squared up to him outside. He continued to challenge his opponent and stripped off his top before delivering a glancing blow to his jaw. Evans then punched Mr Thompson with enough force to send him crashing to the ground with his head spinning. Prosecutor Peter Clement said: ‘This defendant didn’t know it but the expert evidence is that his first punch is likely to have been fatal.’ Mr Thompson was pronounced dead two days later and Evans handed himself into police the same day. Evans, of Morden, south London, had denied manslaughter.","Thomas Evans, 32, denied manslaughter claiming he acted in self-defence .

"ABC News correspondent Mara Schiavocampo has written about how she lost an impressive 90lbs, revealing her 'formula for lasting success'. In her new book, Thinspired: How I Lost 90 Pounds - My Plan for Lasting Weight Loss and Self-Acceptance, the mother-of-one, 35, says her weight-loss is largely thanks to diet, though sleep and exercise also played a part. In an article about the book on ABCNews.com, she wrote: 'This seems obvious, but what you eat and how much, is the single biggest factor in weight loss. Period. You will never exercise your way out of a bad diet. Scroll down for video .

But it plays a much smaller role in weight loss than so many of us believe.' Ms Schiavocampo has been married to husband Tommie Porter since 2005 and the couple welcomed daughter Nina Isabella Porter three years ago. She says she 'desperately' wanted to lose the 40lbs she gained during her pregnancy - especially because she had already been 50lbs overweight beforehand.

But having been ridiculed for her weight as a child and later suffering from an eating disorder in her twenties, she admits she struggled with a 'tortured and complicated' relationship with food for years. 'I love sugar so much I have literally poured it down my throat,' she admitted. She found that the key was to eliminate all processed foods, flour and dairy, and adopt a diet of fruits, vegetables, chicken, fish, beans, nuts and whole grains. 'Once I made that change, losing weight felt like rolling downhill,' she said. Handsome couple: Ms Schiavocampo and her husband Tommie Porter (pictured in May 2013) have been married for nine years . Ms Schiavocampo also advises getting seven to nine hours of sleep, noting that it's easier to have strong willpower around food when you're well-rested. She also emphasized the importance of planning meals, making sure to stock your kitchen with groceries and schedule time to cook. As for exercise, she enjoys spin classes at SoulCycle and interval training at Barry’s Bootcamp. 'Find an activity you love.

"A carer murdered a former champion boxer he was looking after - and dismembered his body before using his credit cards to go on a shopping spree, a court heard today. Thomas Dunkley, 29, allegedly murdered Shaun Cummins, 45, then stole more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight boxer and stored his body parts in freezers at his bungalow. Dunkley, of Leicester, dismembered the body after killing Cummins and placed the parts in bin bags before sealing them with duct tape and putting them in the freezer, Leicester Crown Court heard. Scroll down for video . Death: Thomas Dunkley, 29, allegedly murdered Shaun Cummins (pictured), 45, then stole more than £25,000 from the ex-WBA light-middleweight boxer and stored his body parts at his bungalow . When he ran out of space, Dunkley allegedly went to buy another freezer from a Comet store. He then put down a deposit on a Vauxhall Astra and bought some new clothes, the court was told. ‘He admits dismembering the body but denies killing him,’ William Harbage, prosecuting, said. ‘The prosecution say, having killed Shaun Cummins, he left the body where it was for a few days. ‘It started to decompose and smell. Dunkley embarked on a plan to try and cover up what he'd done in a callous and deliberate way.’ Mr Harbage told the court Dunkley used the former boxer's credit cards to buy a chainsaw, gloves, a mask, overalls and goggles. ‘He set about the grisly task of dismembering the body,’ he said. Afterwards Dunkley allegedly placed the parts in liners before putting them in the freezer. Mr Harbage asked the jury: ‘Who does that? Who goes to those extremes, unless he's responsible for the killing.’ Former boxer: Shaun Cummins (right) on the attack against Tony Velinor (left) 23 years ago in January 1990 . Mr Harbage said: ‘Having murdered Shaun Cummins, the defendant then went on a shopping spree.’ The court heard Dunkley stole a total of . more than £25,000 from Mr Cummins's bank accounts and a trust fund set . up after an accident in 2004. Flowers in tribute: Police made the gruesome find on September 12 last year after concerned nurses who cared for the paraplegic contacted the police . Dunkley has admitted four charges of fraud relating to using Mr Cummins' credit cards after his death as well as cashing cheques from the trust fund. He denies two charges of fraud relating to taking out a payday loan in Mr Cummins's name and stealing one of his credit cards before the boxer's death. Mr Harbage told the jury of seven women and five men that Dunkley had cared for Cummins at his bungalow after the sportsman was left paralysed from the chest down in a road accident in 2004. Dunkley had given up his job to look after the ex-boxer with his daily tasks involving shopping, giving Mr Cummins his medications and carrying out banking transactions. Mr Harbage told the jury Dunkley carried out the tasks unpaid and while he did so, his personal debts were increasing. The court heard Dunkley owed around £16,500 to creditors. ‘He certainly had a need for money,’ Mr Harbage told the court. However Mr Harbage told jurors Mr Cummins was a ‘strongwilled and somewhat overbearing man who seemed bitter about the consequences of his incident’. Dunkley felt bullied and manipulated by Mr Cummins, the prosecutor told the court. He said one motive for the murder may have been for Dunkley to ‘free himself’ of Mr Cummins and the way he ‘dictated his life’. Another motive may have been for him to ‘get at Cummins's money’, the barrister added. Police made the gruesome find on . September 12 last year after concerned nurses who cared for the . paraplegic contacted the police after they had not heard from Mr Cummins. Investigation: Dunkley allegedly dismembered the body after killing Mr Cummins and placed the parts in bin bags before sealing them with duct tape and putting them in the freezer at his home in Leicester (pictured) Dunkley was arrested at a service station near Wakefield on the M1 in the early hours of the next day. Following his arrest, Dunkley claimed Mr Cummins had died of natural causes and he said he had panicked, the court heard. However experts who examined the internet history of a laptop found at the house discovered searches asking ‘what happens when you are stabbed in the stomach?’ and ‘how long does it take to die after you are stabbed?’. 'Who does that? Who goes to those extremes, unless he's responsible for the killing' William Harbage, prosecuting . The court heard the pathologist was unable to determine the precise cause of death of Mr Cummins due the dismemberment and early signs of decomposition. ‘There is an overwhelming inference from the evidence that the defendant murdered Shaun Cummins on September 1 or 2 last year,’ Mr Harbage said. ‘His calculative and deceptive behaviour prevented the discovery of the body. The explanation that Shaun Cummins died of natural causes is simply not true. ‘Rather than call 999 or notify a doctor he panicked and chopped him up with a chainsaw. His actions were intended to mask the true cause of death. He knew the deceased had substantial funds still at his disposal, none of this money had yet come his way.' Dunkley has admitted a charge of preventing a burial but denies murder. The trial continues.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their baby son George Alexander Louis. When he rules this country, perhaps not for half a century or more, he will be King George VII. Until then, he will be known formally as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. William and Kate came to a relatively quick decision yesterday about the hugely anticipated name. George had long been the favourite, with bookmakers shortening the odds in recent days. Scroll down for videos . Heir to the throne: Kensington Palace revealed the baby's full name will be George Alexander Louis . New life: William and Kate's baby is third in line to the throne will one day be king . While there will be much speculation as to the inspiration behind the names,  palace officials were quick to insist it was simply ‘because they liked them – no more no less’. The Mail understands that William and Kate had already decided by the time they introduced the Queen to her heir – and third great-grandchild – at Kensington Palace yesterday morning. There is no royal protocol which dictates the sovereign must be given approval, but it is believed the couple discussed their choice with her during their 30-minute meeting. They then told other members of their immediate family before making the news public at 6.15pm. A statement issued by their office at Kensington Palace said: ‘The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis. ‘The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.’ It took only two days for the name to be released, compared with seven when William was born in 1982. At around 1pm yesterday the new parents were seen leaving Kensington Palace in a Range Rover with their son. They were on their way to Bucklebury in Berkshire, where they will stay with Kate’s parents.

New mother: Kate waved with her left hand and appeared to have her right hand resting next to her baby . It is likely the Queen will have been thrilled by the choice of name, given that her father was George VI. He was christened Albert and was known to his family as Bertie, but monarchs are allowed to pick a name under which to rule. He chose George in honour of his father, George V, and to create the impression of stability after the scandal caused by the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII. George is also the fourth name of the Prince of Wales. Historian and biographer Robert Lacey said: ‘George is obviously a tribute to the Queen’s father and will, I imagine, give Her Majesty great pleasure.’ On Tuesday, the BBC’s royal correspondent, Peter Hunt, asked William whether he would name his son George in line with the bookmakers’ predictions. The duke laughed and said: ‘Wait and see.’ Louis, the baby’s third name, is William’s fourth name – he is William Arthur Philip Louis. It was chosen by Charles as a tribute to his close friend and mentor, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh’s uncle. He was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979 when his boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of Ireland. The less obvious choice is Alexander, although there are also some royal relatives: Prince Philip’s grandfather was Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, for example. The first Prince George of Cambridge, born in 1819, led something of a scandalous life after refusing to have an arranged marriage because he fell in love with a commoner . When he wed actress Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, without the sovereign’s approval, she was already the mother of two of his children and pregnant with his third. Heading home: After half an hour with the new prince, Kate and William, where they may have discussed names, the Queen went back to Buckingham Palace . Down the drive: Her Majesty visited without the Duke of Edinburgh, who is still at Windsor Castle recuperating after an operation last month . Happy day: The Queen arrives at Kensington Palace today to meet her new great-grandson for the first time and see his parents . Happy to be there: The Queen looked expectantly . towards the palace as she arrived and she will be pleased to see the . baby before she goes on holiday on Friday . Magic: With the world watching, Kate and William hold their prince outside the Lindo Wing in a historic moment for Britain . Gentle: The trio take their first steps together into the outside world together as the prince starts his life . Arrival: The new family arrive at Kensington Palace with their newborn son, where Kate's sister Pippa Middleton was waiting for them . By naming their son George Alexander Louis, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have picked a name which is synonymous with British kings.

"After being stolen from her eight years ago, single mother Lashena Harris had come to terms with that fact that she would never see her English Bulldog Fatcat again. The dog was taken from her Memphis, Tennesse home when it was just two years old, and Ms Harris has since moved halfway across the country - all the way to Phoenix, Arizona. So it is safe to say she was a little shocked when she received a phone call, telling her Fatcat had been found dumped by the roadside in West Memphis, Arkansas. Reunited: Recent pictures of Fatcat, who has been returned to her owner eight years after being stolen . Even once Ms Harris, 34, had heard the incredible news, it looked like they might never be reunited - as making the near 3,000 mile round trip looked an impossible task. As a working single mother she was not able to drive the mammoth trip, and because of the condition Fatcat was in, putting in her a crate in the hold of a plane would have been too much stress for her to take. As soon as the amazing story had begun, it looked as if it might end tragically, and Ms Harris was faced with the horrifying call of having her long-lost dog put down. It was only by complete chance that a worker at the shelter Fatcat had been taken to happened to have a friend moving to Arizona, and they said they would drive the dog there and reunite her with her overjoyed owner. Great to be back: Lashena Harris and Fatcat were overjoyed to be brought back together . 'I stopped in the driveway entrance of the lot and ran over to her,' she told AZCentral.com. 'I can't really put into words the feelings because I just kept saying thank you, thank you, thank you so much. I never thought I would see her again — in came the tears and boo-hooing.' She said Fatcat rolled over onto her back to have her tummy scratched when they were reunited, and then rode home with her in the front seat, head flopped in her lap. She wrote on her Go Fund Me page, set up to get donations to help pay for the dog's veterinary care: 'Overjoyed isn't the word... I cried like a baby at hearing she was found. But, of course, I knew if someone had turned her in, it was because they were done with her.' When Fatcat was found she was in awful condition - she had tumours, periodontal disease and heartworms, along with other conditions. She couple who found her had taken her to the vets, but could not afford to pay for the treatment. And it was only when she was taken to a shelter, where her microchip was scanned, that Fatcat was linked back to Ms Harris. Bark to the future: Fatcat at Ms Harris' home when she was just two years old, before she was stolen . Rare: The all-while English Bulldog's puppies would have been worth around $4,000 each to the thieves . It is believed that whoever had stolen Fatcat had used her to breed puppies, and dumped her when she became too ill to be useful. 'I can't see someone having a dog for that long and not creating some attachment to it,' Ms Harris told Fox10News. 'Apparently she was just a puppy mill for him and when she could no longer be used, they dumped her. 'What are the chances of us four crossing paths in this manner? This wasn't supposed to happen and it did.' White bulldogs are very rare, and Fatcat's puppies could have made as much as $4,000 each for the people who took her. Now that the miracle is complete Ms Harris is doing her best to give her the best possible end to her traumatic life. She has set up a Go Fund Me page called 'Operation welcome home Fatcat' to try to raise the $5,000 she needs to pay for her veterinary care. 'She's had a hard life and I just want to make her as comfortable as possible while she's home,' she said. Ms Harris said that her 14-year-old son, who was just eight when the pet disappeared, was delighted to see her again.","Fatcat was stolen from Lashena Harris' Memphis, Tennessee home .

"A University of Virginia student who shared a freshman suite with 'Jackie' when she was allegedly gang-raped at a fraternity party has defended her former roommate. Emily Clark spoke out in support of Jackie in a letter published in The Cavalier Daily on Monday, three days after Rolling Stone acknowledged 'mistakes' in its reporting of the claims. 'While I cannot say what happened that night, and I cannot prove the validity of every tiny aspect of her story to you, I can tell you that this story is not a hoax, a lie or a scheme,' Emily wrote. 'Something terrible happened to Jackie at the hands of several men who have yet to receive any repercussions.' Scroll down for video . Shut:  Students walk past the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at UVa on Saturday after Rolling Stone apologized for mistakes in its story about an alleged rape there. The victim's friend has now spoken out in her defense . In the Rolling Stone article, Jackie said she had been lured into a room by a  member of Phi Kappa Psi and raped by seven men in 2012, when she was just starting out as a freshman. The explosive article portrayed a culture of sexual violence at UVA, one of the nation's leading public universities, and rocked the campus. The fraternity, which was suspended after the story was published, has denied the assault and in a statement on Friday, it said it didn't host an event on the night Jackie alleged she was raped. After the statement, Rolling Stone released an apology that some took to blame Jackie. 'Our trust in her was misplaced,' it said. The magazine then quietly modified the apology to say: 'These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie. We apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening.' accusation: A student identified only as Jackie, pictured, said she was raped by seven men in 2012 . In her letter on Monday, Emily said she has no doubt something happened to Jackie, who was 'bright, happy and bubbly' when she started at the college. 'That all notably changed by December 2012,' she wrote. She - and others girls - noticed Jackie was becoming 'withdrawn and depressed', was skipping class and watching hours of TV instead. Then that December, she broke down. 'All of a sudden she was going home and none of us knew why,' she wrote. 'It was right before finals, and I couldn't believe she was leaving. She was distraught, and only said she needed to go home. Her teachers had given her allowance to take her finals over break. 'At that point, we knew something big had happened. I didn't know until this year with the publication of Rolling Stone's article how bad that time was for her.' She said that later that year, Jackie did tell her that she had been attacked by several men at a party but that she did not give any more details on the incident. 'I fully support Jackie, and I believe wholeheartedly that she went through a traumatizing sexual assault,' she wrote. Despite Rolling Stone's apology, Jackie has said she stands by her story. Amended: Rolling Stone's first apology apparently put blame on Jackie for mistakes in the article, but a second apology (pictured) now says 'these mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie' Protests: A member of the audience holds a sign during a board of visitors meeting about sexual assault at the University of Virginia last week in Charlottesville following the damning article's publication . The magazine said it shouldn't have agreed to her request not to contact the alleged assailants to get their side of the story, out of sensitivity to her. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, has said that Jackie is now unsure if the man who allegedly lured her into the room to be raped by the seven men was a member of Phi Kappa Psi. After the apology, some advocates for rape victims expressed concern that the magazine's backpedaling could undermine efforts to combat campus sexual assaults. The UVA Inter-Fraternity Council said that should not be allowed to happen. 'Sexual assault is a problem across college campuses, and we remain committed to being leaders in the campaign for long-term change,' the council said in a statement. Scandal: The Rolling Stone article accused the school of repeatedly hushing up sexual assault victims in order to protect their reputation. An aerial view of the campus, designed by Thomas Jefferson, above . But three organizations said that, in light of the statement from the magazine, the university should lift its suspension of fraternity and sorority activities, which is underway until January 9. The Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee, the National Panhellenic Conference and the North-American Interfraternity Conference said U.Va. should apologize for a 'rush to judgment'. 'We believe universities must demonstrate more respect for the fundamental rights to due process and freedom of association for students and student organizations when allegations of misconduct are lodged,' they said in the statement. 'A rush to judgment on campus all too often turns out to be wrong, especially when applied at the organizational level.'","UVA student Emily Clark wrote in a letter on Monday: 'I believe wholeheartedly that she went through a traumatizing sexual assault'

"Formula One ace Michael Schumacher lost control when he hit a rock and ended up smashing his head into a bolder 34 feet further down the mountain, it was revealed yesterday. The horrific details emerged as it was announced that French investigators have ruled out any criminal wrongdoing in the freak accident. Closing the case, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, in charge of the inquiry, ruled 'no infraction by anyone has been turned up'. Formula one World champion Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher holding his skis before a giant slalom race in Madonna di Campiglio . He cleared the French ski resort of Meribel of any wrongdoing. He . said the accident occurred just over 14 feet from the edge of the ski . run in an off-piste area and that the resort had conformed to the French . standards for marking ski runs. He . said: 'No one was found to have committed any offence. The accident . occurred in an off-piste area. The signage, marking, staking (marker . poles in the snow) and information provided about the edge of this slope . were all consistent with French standards in place.' He . said the rock that caused him to lose balance and the rock on which he . struck his head 'are 10.40 metres from each other and both are located . at 4.50 metres from the boundary of the piste'. His decision does not, however, prevent Schumacher’s family from taking civil action. It . was seven weeks ago yesterday that Schumacher, 45, suffered his . life-threatening accident while skiing with his son in the French resort . of Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He remains in intensive care as doctors try to ease him out of an artificially-induced coma. An investigation into the crash was launched immediately, as is usual in France for accidents of such gravity. It was conducted by mountain police in Bourg-Saint-Maurice and gendarmes in Meribel and Albertville. Formula One driver Michael Schumacher gesturing at the end of the Brazil's F-1 GP at the Interlagos racetrack in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 2012 . The former examined the terrain and the signage on the ski runs. Experts . from ENSA, the ski and climbing academy in the French ski resort of . Chamonix, performed tests on his equipment including his skis, bindings, . ski boots and a piece of his helmet. Tests were also conducted to see . if the presence of his camera on his helmet had weakened the structure . causing it to shatter so dramatically. But his equipment was not found to be faulty in any way. Schumacher . had been skiing on the piste with his son and family friends. But . shortly after 11am he 'deliberately' skied on to a patch of off-piste . located in between two runs 'with a number of dangers, notable rocks', . according to investigators. It . was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing . fast but he lost control and catapulted on to another rock. Corinna Schumacher, his wife, arrives at Grenoble University Hospital Centre where her husband is being treated . Lawyers . had argued that managers of the ski resort might face up to three years . in prison because the dangers lurking within the off-piste section were . not properly marked. But, . presenting initial findings 10 days into the investigation, police chief . Stephane Bozon said: 'The piste markers conformed to the regulations. 'Unfortunately . this off-piste area had a number of dangers, notably the rocks being . only barely visible, covered with five to 10 cm of snow because of the . poor snow.' Quincy, a former . policeman who has been the prosecutor at Albertville since 2009, added . that all safety procedures by mountain authorities 'had been respected'. The . resort hired a top lawyer, Maurice Bodecher, who is a specialist in ski . and criminal law. Up until 2010 he was the head lawyer for the French . Ski Federation. The footage . from Schumacher’s helmet camera, which includes audio, was minutely . analyzed by N-Tec, a research division within the police at Albertville . that specializes in new technology. The seven-time world champion is receiving round-the-clock care in intensive case in Grenoble University Hospital. Wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. His . family issued a statement last week saying that they 'strongly believe' he will recover. But they admitted he was 'still in a waking-up . process'. The family . said the most important element of his recovery was not the speed but . that it progressed in a 'continuous and controlled way'. The update came in the wake of reports that Schumacher had contracted pneumonia. The . statement said: ""Michael's family would like to again express their . sincere thanks for the continuous sympathy coming from all over the . world. The good wishes they receive help the family and we are convinced . they also help Michael, who still is in a waking up process. 'As . often in such situation, no day is like the next. The family is . thankful for ones understanding that they would not wish to disclose . medical details in order to protect Michael’s privacy. 'As . assured from the beginning we will continue to communicate any decisive . new information on Michael’s health state. We are aware that the wake . up phase can take a long time. The judge found there was no criminal wrongdoing and Schumacher fell more than 30 feet onto a rock . 'The . family continues to strongly believe in Michael's recovery and place . all their trust in the doctors, nurses and nursing auxiliaries team. 'The . important thing is not the speed of the recovery but that Michael’s . healing process progresses in a continuous and controlled way.' Schumacher . receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a . machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently. Three . times daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and . bed sores. The coma . suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory . drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this . wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally - if at all. His . blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned . and even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing. He lies on a . special air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary . tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste . bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing another potentially fatal . infection.","Investigation on Schumacher's accident focused on his ski helmet .

"Several Wyoming schools have dropped the new federal rules pushed by First Lady Michelle Obama after saying they had an overwhelming negative reaction from students. Wyoming Sheridan Country District One business manager Jeremy Smith said 'there were just too many complaints' for his district to stay in the National School Lunch Program. 'Universally, it was, ‘We are starving. We are hungry. This isn’t enough food for us.’ But we couldn’t blame them, because I looked at that school lunch and said, ‘I wouldn’t eat it either,’ he told Wyoming Public Media. Scroll down for video . Several Wyoming schools have dropped the new federal rules pushed by First Lady Michelle Obama after saying they had an overwhelming negative reaction from students . Students have complained that the small portions are not enough for them to have a satisfying lunch . The rules set by Congress and the administration over the last several years require more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in the lunch line and set limits on sodium, sugar, and fat. This Summer Michelle Obama met with officials who claimed the guidelines were working in their schools. The Education Action Group reports that the Wyoming district had sales jump 20 per cent after abandoning the new rules. They now offer bigger portions and have increased their prices as well as offering 'locally sourced produce and beef.' The district's food service director Dennis Decker told reporters: 'A one-size-fits-all program doesn't work everywhere. Smaller districts may have more problems with the guidelines since they have a smaller staff to deal with the changes and many students have chosen to bring lunches to school rather than purchase the new offerings . 'And I also think that food is a little too personal to make a law. You can tell someone they can’t speed, but I don’t you can tell everybody what they have to eat every day.' The districts that have left the federal program do not get reimbursements. Big Horn student Ethyn Etchechoury told Wyoming media that last year the portions were not big enough and he often brought his won lunch to school. Big Horn High School in Wyoming is one of several schools to abandon the regulations citing poor sales and student complaints . But since the changes he's satisfied with the school's offerings. 'I've never brought a bag lunch this year,' he said. At least one rural Oregon district has also dropped the regulations. Administrators blamed poor sales to students and a large amount of paperwork. 'Kids quit eating. More whole wheat, more green veggies, no salt - it's not as palatable,' said Jordan Valley District business manager LeeAnn Conro, who added that the paperwork to ensure each serving met the standards for nutrition was too much to deal with. Smaller districts may have more problems with the guidelines since they have a smaller staff to deal with the changes.","Wyoming Sheridan Country District One business manager Jeremy Smith said 'there were just too many complaints' for his district to stay in the National School Lunch Program .

"Sabrina Rubin Erdely also fell for a dubious testimony from a boy claiming he was sexually abused by priests, it has been claimed . The author behind a Rolling Stone article claiming a University of Virginia student had been gang-raped at a fraternity also fell for a dubious testimony from a boy claiming he was sexually abused by priests, it has been claimed. Sabrina Rubin Erdely forced the magazine into an apology after the story published in November based on the account by alleged victim 'Jackie' was found to have a large number of inaccuracies. Now it has been claimed that she accepted the claims of petty criminal Billy Doe, who claimed he was raped by members of the Philadelphia Archdiocese, testimony which a legal website claims had a series of discrepancies. According to Big Trial, Doe told his story to the archdiocese, police, and a grand jury, and would subsequently before recounting it to two different juries in separate criminal cases. Each time he told his story, the site accused the details of changing. A grand jury report published in January 2011 was revealed to have 20 inaccuracies, however Erdely's piece ran the following September without addressing the differences. She also allegedly did not address any credibility issues, ignoring in the piece that Doe had been arrested six times - once with 56 bags of heroin he was planning to sell. The piece titled 'The Catholic Church's Secret Sex Crime files', describes Billy as a 10-year-old who was raped and 'sodomized' by three men and sometimes made to drink sacramental wine after mass. Erdely repeatedly quoted from the secret archive files formerly kept by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in a locked safe. The files chronicled the secret history of four decades of sex abuse in the archdiocese involving 169 abuser priests and hundreds of child victims. However, the site reported that there is no mention in 45,000 pages  of a predator trusting another predator enough to share a victim. Doe's story about serving at an early morning weekday Mass was contradicted by extensive calendars  his mother kept, the site says. They apparently showed that Billy did not serve as an altar boy during an early morning Mass for the entire 1998-99 school year he was enrolled in fifth grade at St. Jerome's Church. A court was also told that following the string of attacks, Doe had taken out books about sexual abuse from the school library when in fact the site says it was taken out by a female student. According to the site Doe initially detailed rapes, being punched in the head and knocked unconscious, being tied up with altar sashes, being strangled with a seat belt, and threatened with death. He later dropped those claims. The story concerning the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at the University of Virginia prompted the paper into an apology because of a number of inaccuracies in the story . Three priests and a school teacher were convicted following Billy's story, which Big Trial says has been undermined because of the inaccuracies. One of the suspects reportedly died while handcuffed to a hospital bed last month. On Monday Rolling Stone clarified its apology over the story telling readers the mistakes were the magazine's fault, not the alleged victim's. That's a shift from the original note to readers, issued Friday, when it said of Jackie, the woman who claimed to have been gang-raped at a Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, 'Our trust in her was misplaced.' The updated note removes that line, which struck some critics as blaming the victim. The magazine said that it shouldn't have agreed to Jackie's request not to contact the alleged assailants to get their side of the story, out of sensitivity to her. 'These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie,' wrote the magazine's managing editor, Will Dana. 'We apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening.' The decision not to contact the alleged rapists prompted criticism from other news organizations.","Sabrina Rubin Erdely article on the University of Virginia fraternity published in November forced magazine into an apology .

"Three people have died and seven others needed medical attention after using cocaine laced with a narcotic painkiller, authorities said on Monday. The deaths and injuries took place over a span of several hours early on Saturday in North Carolina's Chatham County, sheriff's office spokesman Doug Stuart said. All the deaths and injuries happened within six hours of each other and in three different locations. Six people were taken to hospital and one was given medical treatment. Perry Saunders, 23, of Aurora, Missouri, was named as one of those who died on Saturday from ingesting cocaine laced with painkiller in North Carolina . One of those hospitalized is believed to be in a critical condition. A sheriff's deputy told WNCN that the drugs killed each victim within an hour of being taken. The dead were named as Michael Currie, 42, of Bear Creek; Randal Welch, 24, of Franklinville; and 23-year-old Perry Saunders of Aurora, Missouri. Currie died at his home while Welch and Saunders died at a separate address in Bear Creek. Autopsies are being performed by the North Carolina Medical Examiner. The state crime lab studied a sample of the cocaine and found indications it had the narcotic painkiller Fentanyl in it. Fentanyl is estimated to be 80 times as potent as morphine and hundreds of times more potent than heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The substance, which is odorless, is an opioid painkiller in the morphine family and used as part of anesthesia to help prevent pain after surgery. It depresses the central nervous system and respiratory function. 'We haven't determined how it ended up in there. We don't know if it was a mix-up, or something done on purpose,' Captain Doug Stuart said. The police officer said that they are working with state and federal agencies because 'what’s in North Carolina today could be in Chicago tomorrow'. Stuart said federal officials are helping to investigate but that no arrests have been made. Fentanyl is an opioid painkiller in the morphine family.

Appearing pale and speaking in a soft voice Monday, she told Judge Darold McDade that she understood what it meant to waive her right to a preliminary hearing. Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said he expects plea negotiations to begin for Huntsman, who is facing six murder charges in the case, though it's too early to say what penalty his office will seek. Bad mother: Megan Huntsman, who is accused of killing six of her seven newborns and storing all of their bodies in her garage, appears in court Monday . Making a deal: Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman says a plea agreement could be in the works for Huntsman, though it's too early to say what penalty his office will seek . 'This is a significant case, unique in our county both in its heinousness and in the number of victims,' Buhman said. 'It's an unusual case, something that you don't expect to see anywhere much less in Pleasant Grove, Utah.' McDade set an arraignment hearing for January 26, when Huntsman is expected to enter a plea. If talks break down, she could go to trial. Defense attorneys didn't take questions from reporters or immediately return a call for comment Monday. The woman's estranged husband discovered the bodies of the seven newborns in April while cleaning out the home they had shared in Pleasant Grove, Utah, a city of about 35,000 south of Salt Lake City. Police said Huntsman strangled or suffocated six infants over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006, and a seventh baby found in her garage was stillborn. Crime scene: Police tape the front of the house where seven infant bodies were discovered and packaged in in Pleasant Grove, Utah . Troubled: Investigators believe Huntsman was addicted to methamphetamine and didn't want to care for the babies . 'Serial killer': Police said Huntsman, pictuered here during a court appearance in October, strangled or suffocated six infants over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006, and a seventh baby found in her garage was stillborn . Investigators say she was addicted to methamphetamine and didn't want to care for the babies. DNA results have revealed that all seven newborns were full term and that her now-estranged husband, Darren West, was the biological father of the infants. She lived with him during the decade the babies were killed, but he is not considered a suspect in their deaths. Dan West went to prison in 2006 and spent more than eight years behind bars after pleading guilty to drug charges. West made the grisly discovery while cleaning out the garage April 12. He called police to report finding a dead infant in a small white box covered with electrician's tape. Six other bodies were found wrapped in shirts or towels inside individual boxes in the garage after police obtained a search warrant.

"Anna Soubry said she was 'obsessed' by Kim Kardashian . Kim Kardashian is ‘the most appalling role model’ for young women, a top Tory has claimed. Defence minister Anna Soubry said she was ‘obsessed’ by the US celebrity because of her body. But she insisted the reality TV star, who ‘broke the internet’ with a series of fully nude photos last month, did not have a ‘normal body’ which ordinary women could aspire to. Miss Soubry’s remarks came in an outspoken interview on BBC Radio 4’s PM programme this evening in which she also hinted that David Cameron was preying on people’s prejudices over immigration . Admitting she has never read a political book, she said: ‘The big downside of my life is that I don’t have enough time to read. ‘At the moment, I work such long hours I don’t even have the time to read the paper that I’ve downloaded on my iPad in the morning. I do try to read because I am obsessed with Kim Kardashian.’ She then added: ‘I think she’s the most appalling role model. Somebody who young women aspire to. In my opinion, that is not a normal body.’ A Tory minister – who describes herself as a feminist and a ‘tough old bird’ – also risked an angry backlash from Conservative colleagues by raising concerns about the Prime Minister’s planned crackdown on EU immigration. Miss Soubry’s remarks said she wanted to know why the Prime Minister had decided to pledge a benefit crackdown on European workers. She said the government should not be ‘pandering’ to the view of parties such as Ukip, and warned there was a risk of ‘playing to people’s prejudices’. The Prime Minister announced last month that he wanted to stem the flow of European migration by cutting in-work tax credits for EU migrants until they have paid taxes in the UK for four years. But Miss Soubry questioned whether people were really coming over here to sign on to benefits, asking: ‘Is that the real problem?’ The comments highlight on-going differences in Conservative ranks over Europe and immigration following the party’s abject failure to meet its promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands. Two weeks ago, figures showed that net migration had risen 78,000 over the past year to 260,000 – well above the 244,000 in 2010 and fuelled mainly by incomers from the EU. In a major speech the day after the embarrassing figures were released, Mr Cameron unveiled plans to deny in-work benefits for EU workers for four years. These hand-outs top up low wages and are seen as a key ‘pull factor’ for incomers to Britain. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian sparked an internet sensation with a series of fully-nude photographs for the magazine Paper . In one of two covers for the magazine, the reality star pours champagne into a glass balanced on her bottom . Ms Soubry questioned Mr Cameron’s insistence that benefits were drawing people to the UK – when what migrants were really interested in was jobs. ‘I want to know and understand why my Prime Minister who I have huge amounts of respect for, I genuinely do, I think has done an outstanding job, I want to know why he’s come to that conclusion,’ she said. ‘Is that the real problem, that people might be able to claim benefits? ‘There’s a danger that you create false fear and sometimes you play to people’s prejudices.’ She added: ‘It’s really important that we make it clear that the majority of people who come to our country come here to work these are good people. ‘Just because some people have a particular view, doesn’t mean to say that you should pander to it. I think we’ve got to be very, very clear about all of this. We’re obsessing about it. ‘The biggest issue in my constituency, it’s absolutely key marginal, is not immigration, it is the economy. The economy will determine the next election.’ Asked about Miss Soubry’s comments on Mr Cameron’s benefits crackdown, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has set out a very clear plan to control migration from within the EU.’ Kim Kardashian pictured at the Paper Magazine 'Break the Internet' issue launch in Miami (left) - and out in New York (right) It is not the first time Ms Soubry has made a controversial intervention. Last year she said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that Ukip leader Nigel Farage looked as though he has ‘a finger up his bottom’. Asked about the gaffe on PM, she said she ‘almost forgot that people were actually watching it’. The defence minister also had a run-in with Mr Farage on Question Time, when she told him: ‘You do not talk facts; you talk prejudice’. Yesterday she said that many people had rung her up to complement her on how she had tackled the Ukip leader. Among those who rang her, she said, was Lynton Crosby, the Prime Minister’s Australian strategy chief. In the interview she adopted a broad Australian accent as she spoke about a phone call she had received from Mr Crosby. ‘The next day, my mobile went. I got: “it’s Lynton Crosby here… yeah, what you said last night, absolutely brilliant”. And I said: “Oh wow, great, thanks Lynton”. ‘The other person who rang me… I was in the pub… you see one of these “caller unknown” you think, who is this? ‘You get this “Oh it’s Downing Street switchboard here, could you hold the line”. I thought, “Oh my Lord, who is this?”. ‘I rushed outside, and it was the boss, it was David Cameron, saying, “What you said last night… absolutely”.’ She went on: ‘The next person who said something… Oh I can’t tell you that, I’ll probably get into trouble. It was Ed Miliband who actually came up to me the next night and said it was the right thing to say. And it was. We mustn’t ever forget that.’","Defence minister Anna Soubry said she was 'obsessed' by the US celebrity .

"A teenager who killed a girl in a Satanic ritual gouged out her eye as she begged for her life, a court has heard. Jose Reyes from Houston, Texas, is on trial for capital murder over the killing of 15-year-old Corriann Cervantes, allegedly as part of a satanic ritual which involved mutilating her body. Reyes, 18, and a 16-year-old accomplice, who faces capital murder charges as a minor, are said to have lured Corriann to an empty flat where they raped her before beating her to death. In court: Jose Reyes appeared in court for the first day of his trial for a Satanic murder. He and another teen are accused of brutally killing a female classmate in a bid to make a deal with the devil . Brutally slain: Corriann Cervantes was found half naked with her clothes torn. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped and there was an upside down cross carved into her flesh . Haunting: Jose Reyes (pictured right and left) is charged with the sadistic murder of 15-year-old Corriann Cervantes in February. Opening statements in his trial began Monday . Reyes faces a life sentence if convicted but would be eligible for parole after 40 years. He is being tried as an adult even though he was 17 when the killing took place. His accomplice is expected to stand trial later. Prosecutors say the two boys were hoping to make a deal with the devil when they disfigured the girl's body, including gouging one eye and carving an upside down crucifix on her stomach. Reyes reportedly confessed to the horrific crime and said he had killed Corriann so that his younger friend could 'sell his soul to the devil,' according to KTRK-TV. 'Whether or not the devil was involved, what happened in that apartment was sadistic and inhumane,' Assistant Harris County District Attorney John Jordan told jurors. 'He said he had no regrets.' Premeditated? Authorities say that after the boys lured Cervantes to a vacant apartment in southeast Houston (pictured) on February 5, they hit her with an ashtray, a toilet tank lid and a window blind rod, strangled her and also stabbed her in the face with a screwdriver . Deal with the devil: Prosecutors say the two boys were hoping to make a deal with the devil when they disfigured the girl's body, including carving an upside down crucifix on her stomach . Mr Jordan told the court Corriann and her alleged killers went to the apartment south east of Houston to have sex after a late night of alcohol and cannabis use at a friend's home. All three were pupils at the same school. While the sex was initially consensual, the encounter descended into a brutal beating with the heavy porcelain lid of a toilet tank. 'There were pieces of porcelain embedded in her face,' Mr Jordan said. They also stabbed her dozens of times in the face and torso with a screwdriver, the court heard. 'What happened in that vacant apartment was sadistic. What will eventually happen in the... courtroom will be justice,' said Mr Jordan. In court on February, Reyes looked directly into the camera and smiled. A judge ordered him held without bail. Sick: Reyes confessed that the pair sexually assaulted Corriann. When she tried to leave the vacant apartment, they grabbed her by the arms and pulled her back in again, according to police . Corriann was found in the empty flat three days after she was kidnapped. One of the neighbors who found her body said there were religious items placed around her body. A police report says she was found half naked with her clothes torn. Her body showed signs that she had been violently raped. Authorities had previously said that after the boys lured Corriann to the flat on February 5, they hit her with an ashtray, a toilet tank lid and a window blind rod, and strangled her. Reyes confessed that the pair sexually assaulted Corriann. When she tried to leave the vacant apartment, they grabbed her by the arms and pulled her back in again, according to police. Mr Jordan said Reyes' family went to authorities after the teenager made 'some admissions' to them about what had happened. 'They did the right thing. Clearly they were offended by his conduct,' he said. At Reyes' home, 'there were some signs of devil worship and things of that nature,' Mr Jordan said.","Jose Reyes, 18, is accused of killing Corriann Cervantes in a satanic ritual .

"Former Liverpool defender Daniel Agger has revealed his differences with manager Brendan Rogers after the pair fell out last season. Although Agger was named as Liverpool's vice-captain in August 2013, he did not feature for the Anfield club on a regular basis last season. As a result, the 29-year-old Dane moved back to Brondby in the summer for a fee of £3million. Daniel Agger has returned to his first club Brondby having fallen down the pecking order in Liverpool's defence . Agger chats with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers in training but relations between the two deteriorated . Agger told Danish programme Onside: 'Let me put it this way, the manager and me were perhaps not on the same page in all of last season. For most of last season at least. 'There was much between us, and for me it was just enough. I felt that he didn't appreciate the things I could and contributed. When I feel that, then it's time to move on. 'Where me and him maybe went wrong from each other, was that I'm very direct. I say things as they are, and so I also expect that people are the same to me. Maybe it's wrong to expect it sometimes.' Brendan Rodgers gives Steven Gerrard instructions during Liverpool's 3-1 loss to West Ham on Saturday . Agger left Liverpool this summer after eight years at Anfield and claims he left after differences with Rodgers . After their start to this season, Liverpool could have done with holding on to a centre half like Agger. They have conceded eight times in their five matches so far but looked particularly ragged in the defeat by West Ham on Saturday. The Hammers' first goal came from a set-piece and Liverpool look vulnerable to crosses, as well as quick breaks.","Denmark defender moved back to his first club Brondby this summer .

"An Orlando abortion clinic ran by a controversial, unlicensed physician has outraged locals by offering discount abortions. The Orlando Woman’s Center, which was shut down in June and had all of its equipment seized, has brazenly thrown its doors back open – and even more boldly, it has begun circulating coupons for bargain-basement abortions on Sundays. The coupons offer a $50 discount for abortions performed on Sundays. Outrage: A Florida abortion clinic is offering discount abortions . Open since July, it’s not clear when the clinic began the promotion, but it is clear who the clinic is targeting. ‘An abortion center that’s open seven days a week in Florida is giving away coupons to poor women in a crisis pregnancy so they can save money on their abortions,’ said Rachel Burgin, executive director of Florida Right to Life. Ran by Dr. James Pendergraft, a physician who has had his license revoked five times, according to WFTV, the clinic is open seven days a week and is working with borrowed equipment. All the equipment was seized in June as part of the proceedings in an unpaid $36million medical malpractice judgement against Pendergraft, according to WFTV. The most recent license revocation, in April, came after the good doctor performed an illegal third-trimester abortion, according to the station. He maintained he did not know the pregnant woman was in her third trimester. Controversial: Dr. James Pendergraft's Orlando Woman's Center is open once again, despite his medical license being suspended five times . Borrowed equipment: The Orlando clinic is working with borrowed equipment, but is it also on borrowed time? Repo men: A crew seized the clinic's equipment in June as part of an effort to settle a $36million judgement against Pendergraft . Pendergraft has also been accused of performing faulty abortions, the station reported. The scandal-stained doc was able to reopen the clinic because he is not performing any medical procedures, instead delegating that work to six other physicians, he told the station. In the process of recovering both his equipment and medical license, Pendergraft told the station ‘I've done nothing that I thought was inappropriate, illegal, immoral or wrong.’ The state of Florida, the legions of protestors outside the clinic and the 270,000 people who 'liked' Burgin's post on the pro-life group's website disagree.","The clinic is run by a former physician who has had his license revoked FIVE TIMES, most recently for an illegal third trimester abortion .

"Lovelorn Prince Harry toured Elvis Presley’s Graceland to the sound of Heartbreak Hotel as it emerged he has shunned his hard-partying friends in a bid to win back Cressida Bonas. A sombre Harry, 29, refused to join in late-night high-jinks to celebrate the wedding of close pal Guy Pelly in Memphis this weekend. While others in the 150-strong party stayed up until 3am at Memphis’s five-star Peabody Hotel – at one point racing through the lobby slapping each other’s bottoms while clutching overflowing champagne glasses – an absent Harry remained resolutely out of public view.

"In the nineties the difference in the sexes was highlighted in the bestselling book Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus but has anything changed in the last two decades? In the modern era, are males and females becoming more aligned on issues from what's considered attractive to gender equality? Not all the time, according to a new nationwide sex survey carried out by Men's Health and Women's Health magazines. Different ideals: Women think Cameron Diaz has the perfect figure, left, while men prefer curvy Kate Upton . According to their poll of 1,000 men and 1,000 women, when it comes to having the perfect body, men and women think differently about what is sexy. While women are hell-bent on achieving the slim, boyish shape of Cameron Diaz it is the curvy figure of Kate Upton that men most desire. Meanwhile, while Hugh Jackman's beefy Wolverine look was the dream physique for men, more than half of women yearn for their man to look like Ryan Gosling. Mr muscle: Men aspire to look like Hugh Jackman but women prefer Ryan Gosling's look . According to Women's Health readers, the sexiest body part of a man is his chest, closely followed by his face and bottom. And they would rather their man had hairs on their chest with just 28 per cent thinking it was acceptable for men to shave it. This contrasts to 44 per cent of men who think shaving their chest is an acceptable grooming ritual along with moisturising (84 per cent) and tweezing their eyebrows (43 per cent). These statistics led Men's Health Editor Toby Wiseman to comment: 'Understanding what women want is one of the great mysteries all men have confronted down the ages, and some of our female respondents' answers have been genuine eye-openers. 'The good news is we can stand down on the preening – women are still in the market for someone distinctly masculine.' The sexes were in agreement over a hairstyle influencing their opinion of someone and 67 per cent of women and 63 per cent of men think tattoos are sexy. Footing the bill: Eighty per cent of men think they should pay for dinner on a first date compared to 59 per cent of women . When it comes to our most secret desires, half of those British men surveyed would love a two-girl threesome, whereas a woman's favourite fantasy is light bondage (48 per cent). Both Men's Health and Women's Health readers also add spice to their love lives with some sexy role play. Which of the following counts as cheating? Which of the following grooming rituals are acceptable for a man? Have had one to four one night stands . Men: 58%, women: 41% . Men should pay for dinner on a first date . Men: 80%, women: 59% . Would be happy if their partner earned more than them? Men: 81%, women: 91% . Relationships in the modern era have become influenced by technology and social media - but men and women's opinions differ on what constitutes cheating which could cause some heartache. A majority of 82 per cent of women think sexting is cheating while just 67 per cent of men feel the same way. Meanwhile nearly half of the women questioned think having a Tinder account is being unfaithful while only 37 per cent of men agree. When it comes to promiscuity, the genders are becoming more aligned with 58 per cent of men admitting to having one to four one night stands compared to 41 per cent of women. Women's Health Editor Farrah Storr said of the findings: 'The notches on the bedpost might be equal but the gender revolution hasn't reached all corners of a relationship. 'Our sex survey shows how certain attitudes of young men and women are increasingly aligned but when it comes to physical attraction, there's confusion over what attributes the opposite sex really desire most. We always have and always will want a real man.' When it comes to starting a family, the effect of the rising cost of living in the UK is the number one factor putting half of all men and 28 per cent of women off having a child. Loss of social life (18 per cent) and mess (11 per cent) are also contributing factors for men, but women worry about their career (23 per cent) and loss of figure (20 per cent).

"He may be a future king but he’s certainly not as glamorous as his wife – and yesterday Prince William clearly felt the need to apologise. The Duke of Cambridge said sorry not once but twice for his presence on a two-day tour of Malta that was supposed to be Kate’s first independent overseas visit. Prince William told his hosts that his 32-year-old wife was feeling ‘so-so’ after suffering acute morning sickness and added: ‘She’s very disappointed she couldn’t be here… Unfortunately you have me.’ Scroll down for video . Prince William with the Maltese PM's daughters - The Duke of Cambridge earlier apologised for Kate's absence . Later, as he visited Prime Minister Dr Joseph Muscat at the Auberge de Castille he added: ‘I’m sorry you’ve got me instead of Catherine.’ Royal sources say the Duchess, who was due to deliver a message from the Queen to the people of Malta, was ‘absolutely desperate’ to make the trip but her medics advised against her travelling. She is believed to be resting at home at Kensington Palace with Prince George and his nanny. The Duke also joked it would be some time before he would bring the couple’s rumbustious 14-month-old son to the country. William watches a fireworks display with Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat . When the president said she would love to see Prince George and the new baby in Malta one day, William laughed: ‘Malta might not survive Prince George. There’s too many precious things around here.’ The Duke, who was celebrating 50 years of Maltese independence, said in a speech: ‘Catherine has asked me to say how very sorry she is that she couldn’t be the one to pass on the Queen’s greetings to you all. ‘She was looking forward to coming here enormously.’ The Duke of Cambridge watches a pageant in St George's Square . Officials involved in planning the trip say every effort was made for the Duchess to attend and that requirements for an ambulance to be on standby throughout, as well as access to facilities and a chair at all times, had been accommodated. The highlight of the visit was a fireworks display at Malta’s Grand Harbour last night where William delivered a message from the Queen: ‘Prince Philip and I send our congratulations to the President, the Prime Minister, and the people of Malta, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of Independence. ‘Prince Philip and I are grateful to the people of Malta for always making us, and our family, feel so welcome. I send my warmest good wishes to you for your celebrations this week, and for the continued success and prosperity of Malta in the future.’ The Queen lived in Malta for two years after marrying Prince Philip while he served on HMS Chequers in the Royal Navy’s Mediterranean Fleet and considers it one of the happiest times of her life.","The Prince said Kate was feeling 'so-so' after suffering morning sickness .

"England women's captain Steph Houghton says there will be nothing especially friendly about the national team's technically non-competitive clash with Germany at Wembley next month. With both sides going through their qualifiers for the 2015 World Cup in Canada undefeated, England and two-time World Cup winners Germany are eager to get one over on their European rival on November 23. 'We have a World Cup to prepare for next year, against world-class opposition in Germany,' says Houghton. 'We are taking it very seriously. England women and Steph Houghton play Germany at Wembley on November 23 . The match against Germany will be England women's first at national stadium Wembley . Anja Mittag of Germany celebrates her goal  during the Women's World Cup 2015 qualifier against Ireland . 'Even though we are trying to attract as many people as we can, it is all about how we perform on the day and how we test ourselves against one of the best.' Germany went through their 10 group games with an astronomical goal difference of plus-58 to England's plus-51. But while not as prolific in front of goal, Mark Sampson's Three Lions women conceded just once and were never in danger of defeat before finishing off their campaign with a 10-0 thrashing of Montenegro. Germany leaked four in total and needed an injury time winner to claim a 3-2 victory over Republic of Ireland, a major scare for the team who have won the last six European Championships. 'We want to be part of big games, and it doesn't get much bigger than England v Germany at Wembley,' says Houghton. Houghton met fellow England captain Wayne Rooney at St George's Park on October 7 . 'We want to take our confidence that we have from the last 10 qualifying games, our perfect record, our great win against Sweden (who also went through their qualifying group with 10 wins) in a friendly, into this game with Germany.' 'It is important that we play against the best teams in the world. We want to create a buzz before the World Cup. We want to play at Wembley, play the best we can, try and get people on our side, so that when do go to Canada for the World Cup we have the full support of the country back home.' While the Germany clash will be a first for an England women's side at Wembley, Houghton has fond memories of her appearance there at the Olympics for Great Britain against Brazil where the second-minute goal from the defender turned out to be the winner in front of 70,584 fans. Houghton skips over Brazil keeper Andreia to score the winner for Great Britain at Wembley at London 2012 . Houghton thanks the crowd of 70,584 at Wembley in the group match at Wembley, where she'll return to captain England against Germany in November . The Games were a turning point for women's football, says Houghton, and with a nail-biting end to the Women's Super League season this weekend just gone - with Houghton's Manchester City beating Chelsea to deny the Blues the title and Liverpool winning their game to retain the trophy - the time is ripe to impress again. 'The Brazil game atmosphere was something that has never been heard of in women’s football - that was a massive time when we were able to change people’s perception,' says Houghton. 'It was the Olympics as a whole. Everybody wanted to see any event that was connected with the Olympics, any Great Britain team. We were lucky that we managed to get 70,000. It was an opportunity to go and see Wembley Stadium, like our game against Germany in November, and an opportunity to watch an English team.' The last time England and Germany women's side met was in the 2009 Euros final, with the Germans winning 6-2. The heavy grass of Wembley will be about as far removed from the controversial artificial surfaces that await Houghton's side in Canada from June 6, 2015. An outcry against the planned use of non-turf pitches in Canada is at such a level more than 50 leading players have joined to file a law suit against the Canadian Soccer Association and FIFA at the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal on the basis of gender discrimination. But while players from the USA, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea and Spain have backed the protest, no England players have joined. 'As a footballer I grew up playing on grass, so of course I want to be playing on what the men play on,' says Houghton. 'But we can't do anything about it now. We are just fully focused on preparing whatever pitch it is, and go and do our country proud. 'Before the last game against Montenegro, we trained every session on the 3G pitches indoors. A lot of players at clubs play on that surface anyway so it is not if it is anything new to anyone.'","England women play Germany at Wembley on November 23 .

"With its secluded yet central location, elegant grounds and distinguished history, it is, you might think, the perfect Royal Family home. Add to that a Peter Rabbit-themed nursery and a £4.5 million recent refurbishment (courtesy of the taxpayer) and Kensington Palace would appear to be the ideal place for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to bring up baby George. Yet The Mail on Sunday has learned that despite all this – and the official protestations that Kensington does indeed remain their long-term family home – the Cambridges have decided that they would rather be in Norfolk. Scroll down for video . With a secluded location, elegant grounds and a £4.5m refit, Kensington Palace would appear to be the ideal place for the Duke and Duchess to bring up baby George, but the couple have decided to move to Norfolk . With William starting his job with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service later this year, they have decided to base themselves at Anmer Hall, their new Norfolk home. An announcement about the new post is expected imminently. Royal aides are insisting that ‘KP’, where Kate and William have lived since moving there from Anglesey  in September 2013, will remain the couple’s ‘full-time family home and long-term residence’. But a source close to the couple has told The Mail on Sunday that William and Kate intend to spend the next two years in Norfolk. They added: ‘William and Catherine are not pavement people; they prefer the countryside. They really miss Anglesey. They can’t wait to move into Anmer Hall. All of George’s things will be there – it’s very much going to be their family home. ‘William has told me that while Kensington Palace is their long-term home, and I think the plan is that it will always be so, they both love the countryside. Kensington Palace, London, is only a short drive from Kate's family home in Berkshire. Kate and Wills may have only an 'apartment' in the Palace - but with 20 rooms over four storeys, it's hardly modest . ‘They enjoy the quiet life they can  have there, and feel somewhat imprisoned in the Palace. Anmer is going to be perfect for a couple of years – that is the plan,’ she explained. The Cambridges have already attracted controversy over the cost of Kensington Palace, not least when the Duchess replaced the existing kitchen of their London residence – Apartment 1A at the Palace – at a cost of £170,000, before opting to build a second one. Despite a private drive, courtyard and spacious walled garden, the Palace overlooks Kensington Park Gardens –  a public space – and William and Kate often find themselves being photographed going about their daily lives. Anmer Hall, Norfolk, where the couple will bring up baby George. It has its own tennis court and £38,000 kitchen put in six years ago has been ripped out  by the Cambridges during a £1.5million refurbishment . The Duchess no longer walks Prince George through Kensington after she was snapped in the Royal park last year. She is routinely caught on camera when she pops into local stores on Kensington High Street and both she and William have told friends that  they miss the freedom they enjoyed when they lived in Wales. Anmer Hall, situated on the Queen’s Sandringham Estate, is in the last stages of a two-year, £1.5 million refurbishment, which has been paid for privately, and the couple intend to spend most of August there to oversee the final details. They are expected to stay at Wood Farm, a cottage on the Royal estate, while works are completed. Norfolk has always been a special part of the world to William, and Anmer Hall, a 200-year-old, Grade II listed property, was a 30th birthday present to him from the Queen. The Duchess no longer walks Prince George through Kensington after she was snapped in the Royal park last year. She and William have told friends they miss the freedom they had when they lived in Wales . The ten-bedroom mansion has a swimming pool and tennis court and its refurbishment includes a new kitchen and garden room, rerouting the driveway to the property to make it more private, converting a garage block into accommodation for their team of protection officers and converting an outhouse into a space for George’s nanny. The Duke and Duchess’s decision to base themselves in East Anglia  is apparently supported by Prince Charles. A source confirmed: ‘Charles is very much behind it. He wants William to have as ordinary a family life as he can before he becomes a full-time Royal.’ William has taken a ‘transitional’ year out since quitting the RAF last September. He has said he misses flying and is expected to work a shift pattern with the Air Ambulance – four days on and three off – which means he will have plenty of time to spend with his new family. William Van Cutsem with wife Rosie. William and Harry spent much of their childhood at Anmer Hall  when it was the residence of the  Van Cutsem family, who are long-established friends of the Royals . It is anticipated that Prince George will go to nursery and primary school in London, when the time comes. William and Kate know North Norfolk well and have a wide circle of well-connected friends – dubbed the ‘Turnip Toffs’ – in East Anglia. They have been seen shopping at local stores such as the Mews Antiques Emporium and Shirehall Plain Antiques in nearby Holt. William is fond of the Dabbling Duck Pub in Great Massingham and the bakery in Great Bircham, both  a short drive from the Hall. And recently the Cambridges were made honorary members at the prestigious Royal West Norfolk Golf Club. William and Harry spent much of their childhood at Anmer Hall  when it was the residence of the  Van Cutsem family, who are long-established friends of the Royals. William’s cousin Laura Fellowes – daughter of Lord Robert Fellowes and Lady Jane, Princess Diana’s sister – also lives in Norfolk. William's cousin Laura Fellowes, left, daughter of Lord Robert Fellowes and Lady Jane - Princess Diana's sister - also lives in Norfolk, as does Davina Duckworth Chad, right, who is an old friend of William . A guest at the Royal Wedding, she is an Edinburgh University graduate and known as ‘Mavis’ to her family and friends. There are other friends close by. The Duckworth-Chad family, who live at Pynkney Hall near King’s Lynn, have enjoyed a long friendship with Prince Charles. Landowner Anthony Duckworth-Chad’s daughter Davina is an old friend of William and has six-year-old twins – India Honor and Siena Beatrice. The couple can also count Baron Howard of Rising and his family as friends in the area. William and Harry play in an annual football match close to the famous castle ruins of Castle Rising and are regular guests at the grand stately pile. Baron Howard’s children Annabel, Charlie and Tom, are close in age to William and Kate. Further along the coast at Holkham, where William and Harry played on the beach as children, is Viscount Thomas Coke and his family, who run Holkham Hall. William’s friend, Etonian Archie Soames, is also a Norfolk boy. His father, Jerry Soames, brother of Tory MP Nicholas Soames, lives at the family seat, West Barsham Hall in Fakenham, less than an hour from Anmer Hall. The Cambridges will also be within easy reach of the Queen’s close friend and Lord Great Chamberlain of England, the Marquess of Cholmondeley, and his young wife Rose Hanbury, who is close to William and Kate’s age and recently had twins. They live at Houghton Hall near Sandringham. ‘The North Norfolk scene is incredibly tight and very posh. William and Kate will fit right in,’ says a local. ‘They know the area very  well already. They will be very well protected here and they will be  able to come and go without being worried about the paparazzi. ‘Historically the Royals are very social with their neighbours and that’s largely because most of  them are aristocrats and wealthy landowners.’ Traditionally Royals split their time between the country and the capital, favouring their rural retreats. The Prince of Wales spends most of his time at Highgrove, his Gloucestershire pile, while the Queen retreats to Windsor when she is not required at Buckingham Palace. William and Kate’s aides and private office will remain at Kensington Palace and the couple will be based there when they carry  out engagements and need to be  in London. Aides say their diaries will remain busy and they will frequently be in the capital.","Couple spent £4.5m refurbishing 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace .

"Not all incidents in football are clear or black and white - often there are shades of grey. Bolton Wanderers' penalty is one if those. Zach Clough jinked into the Liverpool penalty area and Liverpool's Martin Skrtel committed a rash challenge and certainly didn't play the ball. There was probably a little, almost imperceptible amount of contact which technically makes the challenge a foul. Bolton Wanderers' Zach Clough (right) goes down under the challenge of Liverpool's Martin Skrtel . Clough (left) appeared to go down extremely easily but there was slight contact from Skrtel .

Clough didn't dive as there was contact; however he certainly exaggerated the affect that contact made. So, depending on your viewpoint it was either a penalty, and a soft one, or an understandable error from referee Roger East. In such cases I always back the referee and, as he gave a penalty, I'd say he was right. Eidur Gudjohnsen (left) steps up to dispatch the penalty and put Bolton 1-0 up against Liverpool .
