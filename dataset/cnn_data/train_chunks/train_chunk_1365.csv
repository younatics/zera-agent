"A mother-of-six has defended her decision to share her bed with her two children every night – and even claims it saved her marriage. Amanda Moss, 43, from Liverpool, sleeps with her six-year-old and two-year-old daughters while her husband Simon is banished to the spare room. Appearing on ITV’s This Morning, Amanda revealed she ‘cherishes’ waking up with Ezme, the youngest, and Darling – calling it a ‘beautiful moment’. Scroll down for video . Amanda Moss, left, who shares her bed with her two children every night, and mother-of-one, Ally Einsten, right, who thinks co-sleeping is 'disgusting, wrong, lazy and bad parenting' on This Morning . Amanda, right, with Ezme, two (bottom left), Darling, six (top), and  Albany, nine (middle) She said: ‘I spend all day with my husband and we have a very healthy marriage. Our children are the most important things at this moment. ‘Now, it's the right thing for our family.' Amanda also revealed she snuggles up with all of her children at bedtime, including Saxon, 14, Honey, 12, Floyd, 11, and Albany, nine, before the eldest go to their own rooms. Discussing her reasoning for sharing her bed with her two youngest children, Amanda, who runs Lifestyle Monthly magazine and is director of Liverpool Fashion Week, said: 'It started because I was made redundant and I was setting up a new business. 'I already had four kids who were in their own beds and, with a baby, I needed to be able to sleep through the night so that I could attend breakfast networking meetings so I needed to have my sleep. Amanda said sleeping in separate rooms made her marriage to Simon stronger . Amanda, pictured right with Ezme, centre, and Darling, left, says it's lovely waking up with her children . 'Just because I breastfed the baby, it was easier to have her in bed next to me, in between me and my husband Simon. ‘And then the next one came along and rather than getting up in the night to tend to her, it was much easier to have her in the bed.’ Amanda explained that when she welcomed her new baby, her five-year-old daughter, Darling, didn't want to get out of the bed. 'I thought: ""Why should she?"".’ Explaining how her husband Simon felt about the situation, Amanda said: 'If I don't get my sleep, I'm not the easiest person to live with. ‘It actually kept our marriage together, he went off to the spare room and we both got our sleep.' Amanda added: 'It's lovely waking up with your children and feeling them in the night and cuddling up to them. Ally questions how Amanda will ever get her children into their own rooms if they're constantly in a bed with her and tells her to teach them independence by giving them their own space on This Morning . 'My kids are extremely independent. They have boundaries but I am creating a nice safe and secure environment for them.' Amanda’s comments come after This Morning research revealed 70 per cent of mothers have allowed their youngsters to sleep next to them. And a third admits they regularly let their child snooze alongside them and will continue to let them do so until they are well over the age of six. Mother-of-one Ally Einsten also appeared on the show. However, she said she completely disagreed with Amanda’s views. ‘It's a beautiful moment that doesn't last forever so I think it's nice to cherish that time.’ She continued: ‘It's only in the last 150 years that parents have put their children into their own rooms. ‘Historically it's very normal for parents to sleep with their children, and in other parts of the world it's normal. Mother-of-two Amanda believes sharing her bed with her two children (Darling, left, six, and Ezme, two, right) is so important she's even forced her husband to sleep in the spare room . She said: 'I have one child and initially I had her in the bed with me for a few weeks but we put her into the cot and it's important that children develop routine and if you have them in the bed with you for a long period of time, they think that's normal. 'They flourish on boundaries, it's very important with relationships with your children and your partner that you set those boundaries. 'Why can't then come in for a cuddle and then go in their own bed? Co-sleeping isn't appropriate.’ She added: ‘We will see more and more families divorcing because mothers are choosing their children over their relationship.' Caroline Hartwell, Nanny, Maternity Nurse and Childcare Expert at Tinies (www.tinies.com) said: 'We all know the risk of co sleeping , the risk of smothering etc. But what about the long term effect on your child? How they miss out on independence, and be taught their coping mechanisms. 'The benefits I do believe initially are fabulous, for breast feeding and bonding with your baby. And although it is not recommended I do feel at the age of a few weeks they should definitely be put in a Moses basket / cot. This encourages independence for the baby and teaches them to self sooth and that it is OK to be put down and sleep without being so close to a parent . 'Another benefit is to be able to sleep with limited interruptions. I'm also a great believer that the behaviour patterns you install from a very early age with your baby will help them grow and develop into independent and less anxious individuals that will have the coping mechanisms to embrace life and all its challenges with strength and gusto. All because they have been taught to be strong, trust their ability and be as independent as they can with their thinking .'","Amanda Moss, from Liverpool, shares bed with six- and two-year-old .

"Mexican immigrants can now obtain birth certificates from their government's consulates in the United States, fast-tracking their applications for American work permits and driver's licenses. Until now, Mexico has required its citizens to get birth certificates at government offices in Mexico, and the delay can hold up their applications for various benefits. The change will make it quicker and easier for Mexican immigrants seeking protection from deportation. Now, even as Republicans in Congress try to undo President Barack Obama's plan to shield millions of immigrants living illegally in the U.S., Mexico is trying to help them apply for programs that would allow them to remain in this country and continue sending money back to relatives across the border. Scroll down for video . Change: Mexican immigrants will no longer have to return to their country to get documents needed for US benefit applications. It means the process for seeking protection from deportation is radically sped up . 'It is a huge help. It helps individuals really begin to formulate their formal identity in this country,' said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. About half the 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are from Mexico, and immigration experts say roughly 3 million of them could be eligible to apply for work permits and protection from deportation under the administration's plan. People applying to stay in this country will probably have to produce photo ID, such as a passport. And a birth certificate is necessary to get a passport. About two weeks ago, California — home to more Mexicans than any other state — began issuing driver's licenses to immigrants who are in the country illegally. From now on, Mexico's 50 consulates in the U.S. will be able to get access to data maintained by regional governments in Mexico and print birth certificates, said Arturo Sanchez, consul for press and commercial affairs in Santa Ana, California. Consulates should be able to issue birth certificates for nearly all places in Mexico, though some villages where documents are not digitally recorded may not be covered, Sanchez said. Over the past year, the Santa Ana consulate has seen a surge in the demand for documents. Daily appointments have jumped by a third to nearly 400, with many people trying to get birth certificates, Sanchez said. Those who cross the border illegally to reach the United States rarely carry documents with them on the treacherous journey, partly to avoid detection. Controversy: The move comes a day after House Republicans voted to overturn Obama's immigration policies . And many Mexicans born in remote, rural communities do not make the necessary journey to the nearest government office to obtain a birth certificate, Salas said. The move comes a day after House Republicans voted to overturn Obama's immigration policies and remove protection for immigrants brought illegally to America as children. Rep. Duncan Hunter, who represents a San Diego-area congressional district, complained that U.S. and Mexican policies have combined to send more people across the border illegally. 'The administration's position and efforts seem to better align with Mexico's interests than they do with our own — and that's disappointing,' he said. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said she believes Mexico is trying to make it easier for its citizens to stay here because of the money they send back. Mexican migrant workers living abroad sent home $21.6 billion to their families in 2013, according to the country's central bank. Vaughan, whose organization wants tighter limits on immigration, said ensuring birth certificates are authentic is critical because they are used to obtain key identity documents such as passports. 'If we can trust the Mexican government to do its due diligence and establish a system with integrity, then this will work,' she said. But she added: 'That is a big if.'","Previously, Mexicans had to go home to get birth certificate for applications .

"The Church's two most senior figures came under fire yesterday after claiming the poor are being left behind and whole cities swallowed up in a 'cycle of decline'. In a highly political intervention – coinciding with the start of the General Election campaign – the Archbishops of Canterbury and York insisted that the Coalition was 'casting aside' the poor while chasing votes in Middle England. As a result, they said, Britain had become dominated by 'rampant' individualism, is 'ill at ease with itself' and was in many places 'trapped in apparently inevitable decline'. Intervention: The Archbishops of Canterbury (left) and York (right) said Britain is caught in a 'cycle of decline' Last night David Cameron said he 'profoundly disagreed' with the two archbishops. And angry MPs said their comments were simply inaccurate and accused the primates of straying too far into the political arena. The controversy drew comparisons with the 'Faith In The City' saga of 30 years ago, when the CofE's views on poverty in the cities were dismissed by Margaret Thatcher's government as 'Marxist'. The comments were made by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York in a campaigning book to be published next week. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, and his counterpart from York, the Most Reverend Dr John Sentamu, put their names to a series of essays that quoted the words of Karl Marx with approval and attacked politicians for trying to appeal to 'the swing vote of Middle England'. Anger: Lord Tebbit said the church should concentrate on dealing with its own problems . Their book, On Rock or Sand?, declared that many are 'left behind' by 'rampant consumerism' and individualism. One Tory source described the bishops' analysis as 'ridiculous', adding: 'It's so far out there I'm not sure it merits a response.' Former Tory Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine, who built his reputation in the 1980s on reviving the fortunes of northern cities, called the archbishops 'out of touch'. He said on Radio 4's World at One that Archbishop Welby's description of the spiral of decline of cities outside London was wrong. 'I have spent some 30 or 40 years dealing with leaders in local authorities,' he said. 'And the transformation, and they acknowledge this, is extraordinary.' Lord Tebbit said the Church should concentrate on dealing with its own difficulties with falling congregations, lack of money and shortage of priests, before it started telling other people what to do. Downing Street, however, sought to play down the row. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said the Church had made 'important points about the need to do more to support families'. However, the spokesman stressed the Government had launched many initiatives to boost growth in England's cities, particularly in the North. And northern business chiefs said they were deeply angered by the views of Archbishop Welby. James Ramsbotham, chief executive of the North East Chamber of Commerce, said: 'We have been growing faster than any other region, and our exports mean we have a positive balance of payments.' Critics of Archbishop Welby said that Treasury figures show that over the past year 65 per cent of all private sector job growth has come from outside the South East. They added that Manchester and Leeds are growing faster than London and unemployment is falling across the North of England. The book was edited by Dr Sentamu and featured a contribution from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Despite assurances that it did not amount to socialism, it was greeted with enthusiasm by Ed Miliband. He said: 'David Cameron used to say 'we're all in this together'. Today, Church leaders are saying they don't believe him.' They were wrong last time... this time they're irrelevant: Commentary by DAMIAN THOMPSON . The quickest way to ruin a dinner party is to talk about the Christian belief in an after-life. ‘Heaven? It’s just a fantasy cooked up by clergy to keep themselves in a job,’ a typical metropolitan hostess might say, her lip curling as she spoons out the asparagus soufflé. To which I can only reply: in 20 years of covering religious affairs as a journalist, I have almost never heard vicars or priests talk about heaven – except from the narrow confines of the pulpit, and even then not very often. Echo: One of Margaret Thatcher's ministers described similar comments as 'Marxist' But I certainly hear clergy talk incessantly about another fantasy world. It’s a Britain in which they talk about the ‘gulf between rich and poor’. This always seems to be a nicely flexible concept that they never precisely define. Above all, it is always ‘widening’ and they argue that society’s ills can be miraculously solved if only more taxpayers’ money was spent on them as if it was holy water. This week, they are it again with a book that deliberately echoes the infamous ‘Faith In The City’ report published by the Church of England in 1985 when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. It controversially called for greater government spending in every conceivable area (except on the country’s military defences, of course) and was denounced by one Thatcherite minister as ‘Marxist’. Such criticism was, I believe, over the top – but make no mistake: the truth is that the Church of England tried to strangle the Thatcherite reforms that turned Britain into the economic capital of Europe. The Church failed in it efforts – and it seems that Archbishop Sentamu is still very bitter. In his new book, he says he is sorry that the Church lost its nerve in its response to what he calls the ‘savage attack’ of Thatcherism. But he is wrong. The Left-wing bishops did not lose their nerve: they actually did everything in their power to elect Labour’s Neil Kinnock as prime minister. And then when that failed, too, they went into a sulk. Perhaps the most depressing aspect of this offensive by the Church of England is the involvement of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The fact is that some of what he says is patently not true. Of course, there are parts of Britain that, sadly, struggle with poverty and addiction, but that does not make us ‘a people in crisis’. We are embarked on a fragile economic recovery, under a Government that is attempting to reduce inequality by ambitious and expensive welfare reforms. Yet, as in 1985, the Church of England apparently wants to derail that recovery, by painting a picture of an economic landscape so apocalyptic that voters will take the risk of making Ed Miliband prime minister and putting Ed Balls – God help us – in charge of the country’s finances. This is surprising given Justin Welby’s background: having worked for an international oil company and having been a supporter of Mrs Thatcher. He is the first Primate of All England who can argue with economists in their own language. Veering: With a background in the oil industry, Justin Welby's lurch to the left is somewhat surprising . So why has he veered so sharply to the Left? One reason is that he was appalled by the poverty he encountered for the first time when, having packed in his business career, he trained for the Anglican ministry in Durham. Also, his stepfather, Lord Williams of Elvel, is a Labour peer. Even so, no one expected him to be quite so hostile to the government led by his fellow Old Etonian David Cameron. Central to the current Church/State battle is the Archbishop of York – a vigorous Christian and a brave man who, in his native Uganda, was jailed for criticising the country’s blood-drenched leader Idi Amin. But – and I’m sorry if this sounds rude – he is also an unreconstructed old Lefty whose interminable anti-colonialist rants had General Synod members rushing for the door back in the early-1990s. To coincide with his new book, Dr John Sentamu has given an interview to the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman. She asked him what right the Church has to poke its nose into politics when its congregations are dwindling. His response was feeble –blathering on about the number of people who attended the carol service at York Minster. He also claimed that the ‘Bishop of Blackpool’ invited him to an event and that they ‘fill the ballroom in Blackpool with 350 people who want to come and find faith in Christ.’ Three hundred and fifty people? That hardly compares with the thousands who attend Pentecostal rallies in the developing world. And there is no Bishop of Blackpool. Presumably he means Blackburn. The truth is that church congregations have shrunk by a third to just 800,000 a week since Faith In The City was published. The CofE’s bureaucracy, though, is bigger than ever – and invested with a public-sector mentality that makes its pronouncements hard to distinguish from those of the public service union Unison. Ultimately, a key reason for the Church of England’s hostility to market forces lies in its own failure to sell itself. Church attendance has fallen off a cliff – and the same would be true of Catholics, too, if it were not for the presence here of immigrants. Embarrassed by this fact, bishops are reduced to pontificating about the ‘scandal’ of food banks and issues such as climate change. I hate to say this, but perhaps it’s just as well that, come the election, most of us won’t pay the slightest attention to the advice of our Christian leaders.

"Furious pensioners branded the launch of the Government's much-heralded bonds for over-65s a 'shambles' The launch of the Government's much-heralded pensioner bonds was in chaos yesterday when a sales hotline and website went into meltdown within minutes. Huge demand for the high-interest investments for the over-65s caused the National Savings and Investments (NS&I) site to crash. Frustrated callers also found that a helpline was constantly engaged, with no queuing system or call back service. Experts last night claimed bosses had wildly underestimated demand for the bonds despite months of planning, while furious pensioners branded the launch a 'shambles'. Telling savers not to panic, NS&I insisted the fixed-rate bonds would not sell out – saying it would be several months before sales reach the Treasury's £10billion limit. But financial experts said they could go within weeks or even days, warning it could be a case of 'blink and you'll miss them'. Susan Hannums, at comparison website Savingschampion.co.uk, said: 'Experts have been warning NS&I for months that demand for the long awaited pensioner bonds would be high. 'However, it seems these warnings have been ignored with insufficient measures to cope with demand. 'This is causing pensioners to panic that the bonds will sell out before they get a chance to apply.' The Treasury launched the eagerly-awaited bonds in a bid to help older people suffering from record-low interest rates on savings accounts. A one-year bond offers a 2.8 per cent interest rate – almost double the typically rate on the high street. Despite the problems, savers had taken out some £270million worth of bonds in 26,000 separate transactions by 3.30pm yesterday. But the figures suggest that if demand remains steady the bonds could sell out within five weeks. If pensioners continue to deposit an average of about £10,400 each, then about one million of Britain's 11 million over-65s would benefit from the bonds before they run out. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said as few as 500,000 savers would be able to get their hands on the bonds if everyone used their maximum allowance. Sylvia Waycot, of Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: 'This bond is going to be gone in days if not sooner.' Experts claimed bosses had wildly underestimated demand for the bonds despite months of planning . Yesterday, complaints flooded in from angry savers fearing they would miss out because of the problems on launch day. Mike Harvey, from Ealing, west London, spent five hours trying to get through before giving up. The 65-year-old former surveyor said: 'It's been a total joke.It's been so badly managed I'm going to give up.' Robert Coulsom, 79, from north Wales, branded the service 'a total shambles' after also waiting five hours to get through. Former nurse Susan Smith, 67, from Lincoln, accused NS&I of 'woeful' behaviour, adding: 'I can't believe it's got the government backing it and it still falls apart on day one.' n Savers should be allowed to 'roll up' their unused ISA allocation and use it later for one-off financial windfalls such as house sales and inheritance, a think-tank will say today. Policy Exchange says people should be given more flexibility to build up their tax-free savings pots during the course of a lifetime and called for the creation of a 'Bonus ISA'.","Launch of the Government's much-heralded pensioner bonds was in chaos .

"Renewing a push for paid leave for workers, President Barack Obama on Thursday will call on Congress, states and cities to pass measures to allow millions of workers to earn up to a week of paid sick time a year. He'll also ask Congress for more than $2 billion in new spending to encourage states to create paid family and medical leave programs, the White House says. In addition, Obama will use executive discretion to give federal employees – men and women alike – up to six weeks of paid sick leave to care for a new child. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama speaks at Cedar Falls Utilities on Wednesday in Cedar Falls, Iowa. President Obama will call on Congress, states and cities today to pass measures to allow millions of workers to earn up to a week of paid sick time a year . 'The fact is this is not a partisan issue. It’s a family issue, and it’s an economic issue, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, said. 'Adopting policies that are good for working families is both good for business and good for workers.' More than 40 million U.S. private sector workers don't have any type of paid sick leave, Jarrett said, 'Not a single day.' That means they lose pay if they stay home when sick or to care for someone who is. The White House confirmed Thursday night that Obama's policy proposal dealing with paid time off for new parents will apply to men as well as women. A White House fact sheet on the policy proposal argues that 'many workers will go to work sick, putting their coworkers and customers at risk of illness. And even if workers have access to paid sick leave for themselves, they may not be able to use it to care for sick children. 'This forces many parents to choose between taking an unpaid day off work—losing much needed income and potentially threatening his or her job—and sending a child who should be home in bed to school,' the White House said. The president's spokesman said today that the policy is both family-friendly and business-friendly because going to work sick with an illness like the flu will 'only serve to spread the flu to your fellow coworkers. That is bad for businesses because they have a whole slew of employees out sick, he said. Details on how Obama would raise the $2 billion to help states will be released in the president's budget proposal next month, Jarrett said Wednesday. Obama wants Congress to pass legislation that has been sponsored since 2005 by Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro to allow workers to earn up to seven days, or 56 hours, of paid sick leave to care for themselves or a sick family member, obtain preventive care or deal with domestic violence. Under the Healthy Families Act, workers would earn an hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours they work. Employers that already provide paid sick time would not have to change their policies as long as the time earned can be used for the same purposes. Obama will call on states and cities to adopt similar legislation. Some already have, as the White House noted in a fact sheet. The president will also outline ways to broaden access to paid family and medical leave. Under the 1993 federal Family and Medical Leave Act, workers may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off without losing their job to care for a new child, recover from an illness or care for an ill family member. The White House says most families cannot afford such long stretches of time off without pay. 'We can't say we stand for family values when so many women in this country have to jeopardize their financial security just to take a few weeks off of work after giving birth,' Jarrett said in a Linkedin post previewing the initiative on Wednesday. Three states — California, New Jersey and Rhode Island – offer paid family and medical leave. To encourage others to follow, Obama will propose $2.2 billion in new spending to reimburse up to five states for three years for the actual and administrative costs associated with implementing similar programs. The White House says Obama's budget will also include a request for $35 million to be put toward competitive grants for states working toward implementing paid leave programs. Additionally, the Department of Labor will spend $1 million in funds it already has to help states and localities conduct studies to determine the ramifications of paid family leave policies. President Obama returns by night to the White House after a day trip to Iowa. Obama has been travelling across the country, giving near-daily previews of initiatives geared toward the middle class and working families that he plans to highlight in next Tuesday's nationally televised State of the Union address . With regard to the federal workforce, Obama will propose legislation providing six weeks of paid administrative leave for the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child. Federal workers receive paid sick leave and vacation time, but no paid time off specifically for family or parental leave. Under the proposal, federal workers could use sick time to care for a healthy child after birth or adoption. Obama also planned to direct federal agencies to advance six weeks of paid sick leave that federal workers could use as paid family leave, something agencies can do if they decide to, said Obama economic adviser Betsey Stevenson. Workers would be required to pay back the sick leave over time. Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate's labor committee, said Obama's proposed measures would set back workers and make it more difficult for entrepreneurs to start their own businesses . 'Americans have great freedom when it comes to work—they can choose the career they like and negotiate with their employer for the things they need, and they can one day become employers, opening businesses with few restrictions compared to the rest of the world,' the Republican senator said. 'One more government mandate, however well-intentioned, will only reduce those freedoms—making it harder for employees to find jobs, negotiate for the things they need, and open and run businesses. Alexander said the federal government 'should do what it can to encourage employers to offer paid sick leave' but should 'not impose a big new mandate' that he claims will 'cost employers $11.4 billion over five years and make it harder for them to hire new employees.' Sen. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, said employers should provide paid sick leave on a 'voluntary' basis. She and Maine Sen. Angus King, an Independent senator, have introduced legislation that would 'encourage' businesses to do just that by giving organizations that offer their employees at least four weeks of paid leave a tax credit. Meanwhile, DeLauro and women's groups applauded the president's announcement. 'Workplaces need to respond to the reality of family life in the 21st century, and allowing employees to have seven sick days a year is a bare minimum,' DeLauro said. 'The fact that the United States is one of just a handful of countries that does not require paid family or sick leave is nothing short of shameful.' The chances that lawmakers will send DeLauro's bill to Obama in the next two years appear slim to none, given that the congresswoman first introduced the bill a decade ago. But Debra L. Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, said the announcement amounts to the 'boldest action' in support of family-friendly workplace polices in a generation. 'This is fantastic news for workers, families and our economy,' she said. Obama's actions follow up on a White House Summit on Working Families the president held last June in Washington, Jarrett said. It is also the latest in a series of near-daily previews by Obama of initiatives geared toward the middle class and working families that he plans to highlight in next Tuesday's nationally televised State of the Union address. The White House said Thursday it would use the State of the Union to try to drum up support for the measure.","President will propose that Congress pass legislation to give an additional six weeks of paid parental leave to federal workers who are new parents .

"For 45 years, the Charlie Hebdo magazine has unashamedly poked fun at taboo topics the mainstream publications would not dare to. But one of its founders, Henri Roussel, believes it was the former editor Stephane Charbonnier's 'pig-headed' insistence on satirising Islam that lead to his, and seven of his colleagues' deaths. The man known as 'Charb was among 17 people killed in a wave of terror attacks in Paris last week, which began with a massacre in his own office. Writing in this week's Nouvel Obs magazine, Roussel accuses Charbonnier of 'dragging the team' to their deaths by releasing increasingly provocative cartoons such as the images of the Prophet Muhammad. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Charlie Hebdo's former editor Stephane Charbonnier (pictured) 'dragged the team' to their death by continuously mocking Islam, according to the magazine's founder Henri Roussel . Six of the Charlie Hebdo staff killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac . He described Charb as a 'brilliant bloke', but says he was foolish to 'over do' it by printing the controversial November 11 edition featuring images of Islam's central figure. Roussel, asked: 'What made him feel the need to drag the team into overdoing it?' referring to Charb' s decision to first post a Mohammed character on the magazine's front page in 2011. He was referring to the first time the Prophet Muhammad featured on Charlie Hebdo's cover in 2011 - sparking furious reactions from the Muslim world, who consider the images blasphemous. Their headquarters were burned down by an unknown arsonist in a fire-ball attack a short time later. Even Charb's former partner, Jeanette Bougrab, believed he would some day be 'assassinated'. In an interview with BMFTV, the 41-year-old said: 'I begged him to leave France but he wouldn't. My companion is dead because he drew in a newspaper.' Miss Bougrab, who had lived with Charb and her adopted daughter May for three years, added sadly: 'He never had children because he knew he was going to die. He lived without fear, but he knew he would die.' Mr Roussel, who contributed to the first issue of the satirical weekly in 1970, said: 'He shouldn't have done it, but Charb did it again a year later, in September 2012.' The magazine's founder claims his friend Georges Wolinski - one of the cartoonists who died in the deadly attack on January 7 - also had reservations about the controversial edition. 'I think we are thoughtless imbeciles who have taken a useless risk, that's all,' Roussel claims that Wolinski told him back in 2011. 'We think we're invulnerable. For years, decades even, we stir things up and then one day all our stirring blows up in our face. We shouldn't have done it.' Richard Malka, the lawyer who has represented Charlie Hebdo the past 22 years, reacted furiously at Roussel's comments.

Sold out: A sign at a Paris news-stand informs customers that they have already run out of copies . He said: 'Charb has not yet even been buried and Obs (the magazine which printed Roussel's column) finds nothing better to do that to publish a polemical and venomous piece on him.' Defending his decision to publish the piece, Nouvel Obs' editor Matthieu Croissandeau,  said: 'We received this text and after a debate I decided to publish it in an edition on freedom of expression, it would have seemed to me worrisome to have censored his voice, even if it is discordant. 'Particularly as this is the voice of one of the pioneers of the gang.' The first issue of the magazine since the attacks again depicts the Prophet Muhammad on the front cover. Unprecedented demand for the magazine across Europe has meant an extra two million copies of the 'survivors' edition will be printed - adding to the three million which already have been. The issue sold out instantly around Paris on Wednesday, as people queued around the corner to get their copies.","Henri Roussel blames Stephane Charbonnier for Charlie Hebdo attacks .

"A pretty girl wanders off from an anniversary party and heads to the beach for a late-night swim. Shortly afterwards, the girl is found dead — apparently murdered. So begins a new TV mini-series, Ascension, which starts on British television tonight. The plot is not, however, quite as formulaic as it sounds. The party and even the beach, it soon emerges, are on board a vast spaceship. As for the milestone being celebrated, it is the 51st anniversary of the original 600-man U.S. crew blasting off from Earth in a rocket powered by nuclear bombs. They are halfway through a 100-year journey to colonise a planet so secret its existence was kept hidden from the public. Scroll down for video . A U.S. defence project, codenamed Orion, planned to send a rocket (pictured in illustration) the size of an ocean liner to other planets . The founders of Project Orion  originally envisaged sending a 50-strong crew to Mars (pictured)... or farther . Project Orion was given the green light after Sputnik I (pictured) was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957 . This may all sound like a variation on Star Trek, if it weren't for the astonishing fact that Ascension is based on a real U.S. defence project, codenamed Orion, the details of which are so sensitive that many remain classified even now more than half a century later. In what must be one of the most incredible chapters of the space race, American, British and European scientists drew up plans in the late Fifties and Sixties for the U.S. Defence Department to send a rocket the size of an ocean liner to other planets. It would get there by exploding thousands of small atomic bombs. Project Orion might now sound like the stuff of Dan Dare — only infinitely more dangerous — but it was based on solid technical research and attracted some of the finest scientists of their generation, headed by a British physics and mathematics genius named Freeman Dyson. Back in 1957, when the Soviets launched the first satellite, Sputnik 1, into space, the U.S. was plunged into panic. President Dwight Eisenhower was ready to say yes to just about any proposal that might give the Americans a lead in the space race. Project Orion was certainly the boldest. The plan originated from General Atomics, a cutting-edge technology company and defence contractor near San Diego, California. The idea of using atomic explosions to provide a rocket with thrust had been put forward a decade earlier by one of the architects of America’s atom bomb project. The founders of Project Orion argued that it could propel the U.S. far ahead of the Russians. The original plan envisaged sending a 50-strong crew as far as Mars, but to get the multi-million-dollar government backing required, the project needed a scientist of international fame. They approached Dyson. A maths prodigy who would calculate the number of atoms in the Sun when he was four, Dyson was later involved in strategic planning for the RAF’s wartime bombing of Germany. He’d been given a job for life at Princeton University when he was asked to join Orion. The Belt Stars of Orion. The ultra-secret project was named after the highly-visible, recognisable constellation . Former US President Dwight Eisenhower (left) said yes to the original Orion proposal while his successor, President John F Kennedy (right), was 'reportedly appalled by the thought of a new space weapons race' when he was presented with blueprints for a floating military fortress inspired by the atomic bomb-driven rocket .

Illustration appeared in The Soviet Weekly and was obtained by the United Nations in 1957 . Dyson needed little persuasion: since childhood he had dreamed of travelling into space. He did a few calculations before announcing that, yes, he thought it could be done, and he and Ted Taylor, Orion’s project leader, recruited a 50-strong team of scientists. Many of them had worked on developing the bombs that had devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Like Dyson, they were driven by a high-minded hope that nuclear bombs could now be harnessed for good rather than destruction. What was special on paper about the Orion concept was that it not only provided a rocket with enormous thrust, but also the fuel was very efficient. Conventionally powered rockets wasted so much fuel just to get into orbit, and travelled so slowly, relatively speaking, that they couldn’t get anywhere useful in space in their crews’ lifetime — even if they had room for the necessary fuel. Its disciples argued that nuclear pulse propulsion, as it was called, was the only known technology that provided the thrust and speed to get to other planets and back in a matter of years. Even in those days of starry-eyed enthusiasm for atomic energy’s potential, the scientists knew they had to overcome a forbidding array of technical challenges. The spaceship would be propelled by a series of explosions from highly directed nuclear bombs dropped out of the back of the bullet-shaped rocket, each instantly generating temperatures many times hotter than the Sun. Wouldn’t the explosions simply vaporise the rocket? Apparently not. Tests with high-explosive fuel showed it could propel a scaled-down rocket up into the sky without destroying it. Obviously, an atomic bomb would create a far more powerful explosion than TNT. The bombs would drop out of the rocket in their thousands, one after the other, exploding some 20 metres behind it. One of Dyson’s most taxing problems was getting a level of acceleration that would be tolerable for humans. Consequently, the Orion would be protected by a 1,000-ton and immensely thick steel ‘pusher plate’, bolstered by shock absorbers, that would absorb the brunt of the explosion while propelling the rocket forwards. The scientists calculated it would take nearly 1,000 nuclear explosions to get into space, and thousands more bombs to accelerate it to its cruising speed of 50,000 mph. Simply lining up and ejecting the bombs correctly would be tricky. Looking for inspiration, the Orion teams consulted the Coca-Cola company for insights on its Coke bottle production lines. As for the rocket’s living quarters, the enormous power of its fuel source meant the spaceship could be as big and heavy as its designers liked. Various Orions were envisaged, their size depending on the length of their intended journey. The original design was one weighing 4,000 tons and as tall as a ten-storey building. However, a ‘Super Orion’ that might get even further than Saturn had a diameter of 400 metres and weighed eight million tons. It had enough room for thousands of passengers. Even on the smaller spaceships, the interior and fittings would include reading rooms, kitchens and lounger chairs for the astronauts to relax in comfort. Everything would be built from steel, and drawings show the interior looking more like a rather spacious submarine than a conventional cramped rocket. Even then, there were concerns about radiation, although Orion’s leaders claimed that fallout could be reduced to nothing if advanced nuclear fusion technology was used (where two or more atoms are fused into a larger one) rather than the conventional fission (when one atom is split). The intention was to launch at least the smaller Orion rockets from huge barges far out at sea. Today, surviving Orion scientists still go misty-eyed as they describe what a launch would have looked like — the mother of all firework displays as the huge rocket soared into the sky thanks to a series of progressively bigger explosions. The International Space Station in 2009. Unlike the Orion rocket, the ISS actually made it into orbit . An area of the southern Milky Way containing Eta Carinae, Crux and Alpha and Beta Centaurus. British physics and mathematics genius Freeman Dyson dreamed up a nuclear-powered spaceship that he believed could travel 4.37 light years away and reach Alpha Centauri . But where was it going to go? ‘Mars by 1965, and Saturn by 1970 was the slogan we went by,’ said Dyson, now 91 and living in the U.S. The team envisaged a four-year return trip to one of Saturn’s colonisable moons, where the itinerary would include time to explore the surface, try to grow some crops and then return to Earth. Dyson later unveiled two concepts for an even vaster nuclear-powered spaceship that he believed could reach Alpha Centauri, 4.37 light years away and the nearest star system to the Sun. This image sequence shows the explosion of the first atomic bomb during the Trinity test in New Mexico in  1945. Atomic bombs would have propelled Orion if the project had ever gotten off the ground . Dyson’s rocket would take as little as 133 years to get there, but would cost $3.67 trillion — or America’s annual gross national product in the late Sixties. The premise of TV’s Ascension is that the interstellar expedition is never revealed to the public. In reality, we can be fairly certain Orion never happened. It was, to some extent, a victim of its own success. Orion’s Pentagon paymasters realised its enormous military implications. The generals ordered plans for a floating fortress rather like the Death Star in Star Wars, bristling with nuclear weapons and orbiting above Russia. The blueprints were presented to President Kennedy, who was reportedly appalled by the thought of a new space weapons race. The last straw was the 1963 treaty signed by the U.S., the UK and the Soviet Union, which banned all but underground nuclear tests. By then, even Freeman Dyson was getting cold feet, after calculating that as many as ten people would die from the atomic fallout every time a rocket was launched. # . The project was quietly killed off at the beginning of 1965. Dyson still looks back fondly on what he insists would have been a major leap forward for human technology. ‘We were a bunch of crazies in a way,’ he said of the Orion team. ‘And it was an unusual time, when crazy people were given a chance to do their stuff.’ ASCENSION, a three-part mini series, starts on Sky 1 at 9pm tonight.","Sky's Ascension TV series is based on a U.S. defence project called Orion .

"Newly-announced Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper has defended his potential awards vehicle, American Sniper, against criticism the film is a pro-war portrayal of 'a hate-filled killer who was treated like a hero'. The movie - directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the memoir of Navy SEAL sharpshooter Chris Kyle, who claims to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career - has come under fire for celebrating a racist 'American psycho' who referred to Muslims as ‘savage, despicable evil' and enjoyed killing. In one part of the book Kyle wrote: 'I couldn’t give a flying f-- about the Iraqis.' But Cooper, 40 - who has twice been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar but missed out both times - has hit back, saying the film is one man's story about being a soldier and shouldn't be treated as a political compass for or against the war. Scroll down for video . Shooting back: American Sniper star Bradley Cooper says the Oscar-nominated film should be looked at as the story of one solider and not a political tool . Memoir: American Sniper is based on the book by Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who claims to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career. He was shot dead at a gun range in 2013 . 'My hope is that if someone is having a political conversation about whether we should or should not have been in Iraq, whether the war is worth fighting, whether we won, whether we didn’t, why are we still there, all those (issues), that really—I hope—is not one that they would use this movie as a tool for,' Cooper told The Daily Beast. 'And for me, and for Clint, this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier. 'The guy that I got to know, through all the source material that I read and watched, and home videos - hours and hours - I never saw anything like that. 'If it’s not this movie, I hope to god another movie will come out where it will shed light on the fact of what servicemen and women have to go through, and that we need to pay attention to our vets. 'It’s not a political discussion about war, even … It’s a discussion about the reality. 'And the reality is that people are coming home, and we have to take care of them.' Cooper went on to say he doesn't think that American Sniper is so much concerned with Iraq as it is what it's like to serve in a war and then go home. Portrait: Cooper said he and director Clint Eastwood the story of Kyle (left) as 'a character study about what the plight is for a soldier' 'Our whole idea was to do a character study about a soldier, and a soldier and a family, and what it’s like having to deal with the schizophrenic nature of having to jostle between a home life and being in theater,' he told The Daily Beast. 'I think hopefully it could be a universal story.' While American Sniper has received support from the military and received a nomination for Best Picture today at the Oscars, liberals have attacked it for pandering to the narrative of a violent patriot. In one section of his book, Kyle wrote of one of his four tours of Iraq: 'If you see anyone from about sixteen to sixty-five and they’re male, shoot ’em. Kill every male you see.' Journalist Rania Khalek described Kyle as 'an American psycho'. Michael Atkinson from In These Times said the film 'perfectly epitomizes a certain kind of American horsesh--'. Author Max Blumental tweeted: 'I haven’t seen American Sniper, but correct me if I’m wrong: An occupier mows down faceless Iraqis but the real victim is his anguished soul?' The Guardian journalist Lindy West wrote: 'The real American Sniper  was a hate-filled killer. Why are simplistic patriots treating him as a hero?' David Edelstein from Vulture called the movie 'a Republican platform'. Criticism: Director Clint Eastwood said it was a 'stupid analysis' to say he was celebrating war or violence . In a separate interview, director Clint Eastwood, 84, said criticism he was celebrating war and killing was a 'stupid analysis' to make. 'Pardon me for sounding defensive, but it certainly has nothing to do with any (political) parties or anything,' Eastwood, 84, told The Toronto Star. 'These fellows who are professional soldiers, Navy personnel or what have you, go in for a certain reason. 'Their commander-in-chief (President Barack Obama) is a Democrat and the administration is, and there’s no political aspect there other than the fact that a lot of things happen in war zones.' Like Cooper, Eastwood maintained American Sniper was a soldier's story, but does believe Kyle was a hero. 'This picture was interesting, because I’m seeing it from the point of a person who was sort of an American hero, as far as his ability to be this ultra-sniper,' he told The Star. 'And his family and his beliefs were very strong about defending the country and defending the guys who are defending the country, as a sort of an oversight warrior. 'It was an important story, but you have to embrace his philosophy if you’re going to tell a story about him.' Kyle was shot dead at a Texas gun range in 2013 by a war veteran apparently suffering post traumatic stress disorder. Movie pundits say American Sniper has a target to pull in over $50 million at the box office this weekend as it goes to wide release. It will open at 3,555 theaters across the country.","American Sniper attacked for being 'a Republican platform' that celebrates war and killing .

"The blogger who was jailed and sentenced to 1,000 lashes for 'insulting Islam' was given new hope last night, when it emerged that Saudi Arabia's king would refer his case to the country's supreme court. The Saudi government has not made an official statement regarding Raif Badawi's freedom, but his wife says the king's intervention came before he received the first 50 lashes last Friday. In an interview with the BBC, Ensaf Haidar said: 'Now his case has been passed by the royal office to the Supreme Court, he hopes something will happen soon, perhaps next week.' She had accused the government of killing her husband week by week - as the second round of his punishment was postponed due to 'health reasons'. The country was accused of 'utter brutality' and 'outrageous inhumanity' yesterday after it interrupted the father of three's flogging sentence - so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again. Mr Badawi is being flogged 50 times every Friday for supposedly insulting religious figures and undermining the regime - a charge he and his wife Ensaf Haidar strenuously deny. The first 50 of the lashes were inflicted in front of hundreds in the main square in Jeddah last week - and the same was due to happen again today, and for the next 18 weeks, until all 1,000 have been completed. Scroll down for video . Raif Badawi (left) was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years behind bars for 'insulting Islam' - but his wife Ensaf Haidar (right) says all he did was write a blog about social change and human rights . Shocking footage of Mr Badawi receiving his first 50 lashes was secretly filmed outside a Mosque last week . Ensaf - pictured here, centre, campaigning for his release on Tuesday - fears each week, the floggings will kill Raif a little more . Ensaf has since feld the country with their three children, Najwa, 11, Terad, 10, and Miriam, seven, pictured here with their father . It is believed Raif, a 31-year-old father of three, will need hospital attention after each flogging; it has been suggested his body will not be able to sustain the assault over the coming weeks. Already, the horrendous toll being taken on his body is clear. Adoctor today said the government was not allowed to go ahead with the punishment. For Ensaf, almost 6,000 miles away in Quebec, it is too much to bear. Speaking to the MailOnline, she said: 'Saudi Arabia is endangering his health and life – if they go through with the whole 1,000 lashes, they are killing him more every week. 'It is a criminal act.' Ensaf and the couple's three children, Najwa, 11, Terad, 10, and Miriam, seven, have been living in a small town in Canada since November 2011. They fled Saudi Arabia when Raif was arrested, spending two years living in Lebanon before being granted refugee status. It means - although they are safe - none of them have seen Raif for more than four years and, since he was moved to a new prison two-and-a-half weeks ago, no one has spoken to him either. However, Ensaf, 35, did have friends in the square last Friday - including Raif's sister. 'She unfortunately witnessed the flogging,' Ensaf said. 'She was there to try and support her brother. 'He was very strong - he was silent during the flogging.' But the advent of technology means Ensaf has also been able to see what happened to her husband. Shocking footage of Raif being whipped in the square is available online, filmed secretly. Just as those present reported, Raif stands strong, and quietly, while two guards dole out the punishment, and the crowds jeer. Ensaf is still shocked it has come to this: she knew her husband wrote a blog called Free Saudi Liberals, but never thought it would draw the attentions of the authorities like it did. He was arrested in June 2012 - although it had been expected for a while, as the government had blocked his bank accounts and banned him from leaving the country in 2009. At first, he was accused of apostasy - or renouncing Islam, a charge which, if found guilty, would have meant beheading. But it was thrown out by Sadi Arabia's high court, and Raif was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes after being found guilty by an anti-terrorism court of 'undermining the regime and officials,' ''inciting public opinion' and 'insulting the judiciary'. 'Criminal act': Raif Badawi's wife, Ensaf (pictured), told MailOnline: 'Saudi Arabia is endangering his health and life' Raif and Ensaf in happier times together, while they were both still living in Saudi Arabia . Escape: Raif Badawi's daughter Najwa (left), 11, and son Tirad (right), 10, fled Saudi Arabia when he was arrested . It was upped to 10 years and 1,000 lashes after he appealed the sentence. 'I was surprised, because I never thought it would go this far,' Ensaf said. 'What he is has been accused of is not true. He did not insult the religion and Islam or any member of the government. 'The blog was only about social change and human rights. 'He did not do anything wrong - he is a prisoner of conscience.' Yet on Thursday the Saudi government confirmed this week's flogging would go ahead in the Jeddah square, which has earned the grisly nickname 'Chop Chop Square' as the site of executions. In all the time of Raif's imprisonment, Ensaf worked to shield her children from the reality of her husband's situation. But when they knew the floggings were due to go ahead, she realised she would have to tell them. 'They only knew their daddy was in prison, they didn't know he was sentenced to flogging,' she said. Raif hasn't seen his three young children for four years, ever since they fled Saudi Arabia . 'The school and I decided that we had to tell the kids - without going into detail. 'I wish I didn't have to tell them. They cried and don't understand. 'They are not normal kids anymore.' But Ensaf, who married Raif in 2002, still hopes international pressure will make the Saudi government stop the punishment. Raif has many supporters in the international community, including the backing of Amnesty International - one of the first groups Ensaf contacted when she arrived in Canada. 'This case has so many violations of human rights,' said Amnesty's Mireille Elchacar, who has become a close friend of Ensaf over the past two years. 'He is a prisoner of conscience. It is a question of freedom of speech.' Protests against Raif's treatment at the hands of the Saudi government have been taking place all over the world - including this one outside the country's embassy in Washington DC yesterday . Amnesty International is calling on government's around the world to condemn the floggings . Amnesty around the world is calling on governments to intervene on behalf of Raif, and the other victims of torture in Saudi Arabia. 'Saudi Arabia is a country which uses torture in a systematic way. It is unfortunately a champion of the death penalty,' said Mireille, who also noted the irony of Saudi sending a representative to the Charlie Hebdo march in support of freedom of speech. Ensaf is now learning French and settling into her new country. It is, she says, 'impossible' to ever return to Saudi Arabia. 'They are acting in a criminal way, and I cannot have respect for a country which does not respect freedom of speech.' And she is clinging onto the belief her husband will one day join her in Canada. 'I will see him again, for sure, for sure, for sure. I will never give up hope and I am sure Saudi Arabia will stop what they are doing and release him,' she said.

"Two thugs who terrorised vulnerable pensioners by filming themselves carrying out 'Jackass' style stunts have been spared jail. Ian Hatwell, 32, and Scott King, 29, ambushed victims around Suffolk and Norfolk by pulling various pranks including asking for directions before blowing an air horn in their face or shouting insults. The pair hoped to make money from their exploits - in the style of the American reality series - by recording them and turning the clips into a DVD which they could sell. Ian Hatwell, 32 (left) and Scott King, 29, were spared jail after they filmed themselves terrorising vulnerable pensioners in a bid to make a 'Jackass' style DVD to make money . Ipswich Crown Court heard how they pulled up in a car beside one pensioner and asked directions before telling her: 'You're a bit of a c***'. The woman told them to have a nice life as she walked away in Kessingland near Lowestoft, Suffolk and the man replied: 'Have a short life'. She later told police the jibe had made her feel 'sick'. In another incident they approached a security guard at Pontins holiday camp in Pakefield, near Lowestoft, who had just had a hearing aid fitted. They filmed him as they blew an air horn in his face, which he told the court left him 'shocked'. A third victim was seen to have liquid, believed to be water, thrown at him as he was working on a wall in the town. During an investigation, police found the DVD with 70 clips in 16 minutes of footage, which was taken in 2011 around parts of Suffolk as well as Gorleston in Norfolk and parts of Kent. They had been called to the home of the parents of Hatwell's then partner who said they had some DVDs belonging to him in December 2013. The footage showed that most of the abuse was filmed by King as he drove Hatwell around in his car. It also revealed another clip of Hatwell setting off a rape alarm in a Tesco supermarket. A laptop was also recovered showing other images of abuse. Michael Crimp, prosecuting, said people's reactions varied on the video from distress to not being particularly bothered and walking away. The court heard how PC Kevin Durrant who investigated the footage had found it to be 'completely abhorrent'. Hatwell, of Lowestoft, and Scott, of Norwich, previously admitted an offence under the Public Order Act. Judge David Goodin, hearing the case at Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) described them as 'hooligans' and ordered each of them to do 200 hours unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order . During police interviews about the incidents, which occurred over a three-month period in 2011, King and Hatwell expressed remorse and said the DVDs were never sold on. Judge David Goodin described them as 'hooligans' and ordered each of them to do 200 hours unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order. Judge Goodin said: 'This course of conduct which might have been fashionable at the time actually was bullying, cruel and frightening because you picked on vulnerable victims and gave them the fright of their lives. 'No middle-aged matron is going to be other than appalled by ""you're a bit of a c***"" and ""have a short life"". 'It was pitifully pathetic, puerile, immature and just plain stupid which mitigates to some extent any intention to be deliberately cruel. 'I accept that you have both grown up a bit.' Andrew Thompson, defending Hatwell, said: 'It was appalling behaviour. It's behaviour that's profoundly regretted by Mr Hatwell.' Laura Kenyon, defending King, said his adolescent immaturity had 'trickled over into adulthood' and he did not appreciate the effect of his actions at the time. Bob Blizzard, the Labour parliamentary candidate for Waveney, north Suffolk, said after the hearing: 'I think the sentence is wholly inadequate. One of the victims was a security guard at Pontins in Pakefield, who had recently had a hearing aid fitted . 'This is effectively violence against a person and older people could have had trauma, heart attacks or all kinds of things. 'I think they should have gone to prison. It's disgraceful behaviour and the fact they were filming it shows it was pre-meditated and makes it even worse.' Peter Aldous, the Conservative MP for Waveney said: 'It's appalling, pre-meditated and there was intent to make money. 'However, they have shown remorse. I would just ask the question of whether this was the maximum sentence they could have got without a custodial sentence? Could they have got a longer period of community work?' A Suffolk Police spokesman said after the hearing: 'There is no doubt that their behaviour, as demonstrated by the DVD, would have caused distress to the people targeted, with older residents being subjected to verbal abuse at the roadside and, in some cases, an air horn being used to frighten people. 'They will now have to face the consequences of their actions and we hope this will go some way to reassuring those who were subjected to these incidents.' Tim Passmore, the Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner, said: 'There is absolutely no excuse whatever for such disgraceful behaviour. 'I don't believe for one moment their intentions weren't deliberate as they filmed the sorry episodes. 'These are two supposedly adult individuals and they need to understand the impact of their obscene behaviour. 'I hope that while they serve their community sentences they are made to reflect on their despicable actions and the huge distress caused.'","Ian Hatwell, 32, and Scott King, 29 ambushed victims in Suffolk and Norfolk .

"The head of the RAF has warned that Typhoon jets could crash into airliner planes resulting in a massive loss of life because the fighter jet has not been fitted with a collision avoidance system. Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford told Defence Secretary Michael Fallon about the dangers of the £126m Eurofighter Typhoon, which is not fitted with an airborne collision warning system, an official report has revealed. The annual report revealed the UK's military aviation watchdog has said a collision avoidance system must be fitted to the RAF's fleet of Typhoons 'with full haste'. A Eurofighter Typhoon - the head of the RAF has warned that such jets could crash into airliner planes resulting in a massive loss of life because the fighter has not been fitted with a collision avoidance system . The annual report from the Military Aviation Authority also warned that a collision between a Typhoon and a commercial jet, however improbable, would be 'catastrophic'. The MAA's advice follows a critical report issued last year into a mid-air collision between two RAF Tornados. The Ministry of Defence said programmes had started for the fitting of systems. The MAA said that the failure to fit a collision avoidance system to Typhoon jets aircraft was 'unsustainable' and must be pursued 'with full haste'. In his annual report into air safety, the director general of the MAA, Air Marshal Richard Garwood, said anti-collision software should also be fitted to the new F35 fighter. Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford (pictured) has warned of the dangers of the Eurofighter Typhoon, which is not fitted with an collision warning system . AM Garwood said there were 'well documented failings over the fitment of an airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS) to Tornado GR4'. He added: 'In the worst case, which is judged improbable but catastrophic, a Typhoon colliding with commercial air traffic could result in severe consequences for the MoD because of the likely substantial third party loss of life.' Such a crash, he warned, could result in more than 50 deaths, and 'would have adverse repercussions for the institution responsible, in this case the government of the day'. The report says the majority of mid-air collisions involving UK Military aircraft have taken place below 3,000ft, and with RAF aircraft now spending more time at a medium level than they did previously, there is an increasing likelihood of a fast-jet conflict with commercial air traffic. The report goes on to state that in the annual UK AirProx Board report in 2013, it detailed 14 incidents ranging from four Class B (safety not assured) to one Class A risk of collision. AM Garwood said: 'The provision of an ACAS to Typhoon is an important issue for Defence. 'Ultimately, the Typhoon will be in service for many years, and if the MoD elects not to fit an ACAS, the decision will need to be well documented and the risk held at the highest levels of defence.' An MoD spokesman said: 'The department has welcomed the MAA's report, and is acting upon its comments and recommendations. 'Air safety is at the core of all our aviation activity and we take very seriously our obligations to our people and the wider community to ensure that our activities are both as safe as reasonably practicable and comply with relevant policy and legislation.' The MoD said a collision avoidance system was being fitted to the Tornado GR4, the type of aircraft involved in the crash over the Moray Firth in 2012. Three crewmen died in the incident off the Caithness coast in aircraft flown out of RAF Lossiemouth in Moray. Typhoon FGR4s from 1 (Fighter) Squadron based at RAF Lossiemouth pictured flying over the Grand Canyon . Work was also underway to have a system developed for Typhoons, the MoD said. It added that 'further technologies' and 'planned upgrades' were proposed for the new F35 fighter. In October it was revealed that plans to fit Moray-based RAF Tornado jets with a potentially life-saving crash warning system had been hit by fresh delays. Defence chiefs had promised that the anti-collision system would be installed in the aircraft by the end of last year, having been first identified in 1990 but plans have repeatedly been shelved. The pledge was reiterated in July, after a scathing report into the 2012 crash involving two RAF Lossiemouth Tornado GR4s over the Moray Firth found the failure to fit the technology contributed to the deaths of three crew. But trials of the new equipment found a 'number of issues' that will lead to 'revised timescales'. Angus Robertson, the Moray MP and SNP defence spokesman, discovered the latest delay after tabling questions in Westminster. The questions have also revealed that the MoD has already spent £49.7million developing the system. In response to a query about the equipment, Defence Minister Philip Dunne said in October: 'Flight trials of the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II in two Tornado aircraft during 2014 have revealed a number of issues that require resolution before the system can be rolled-out across the fleet. 'It is not possible to give an indication of revised timescales until the scope of the additional work has been properly assessed.' The MoD said a collision avoidance system is being fitted to the Tornado GR4, the aircraft involved in a crash over the Moray Firth in 2012 when three crewmen died - pictured is some of the recovered plane wreckage . Tornado jets are currently involved in UK military action against the Isis terror group in Iraq. Mr Robertson said last year: 'This further delay is the latest broken promise in a long running and scandalous situation. 'It is utterly unacceptable that the timetable for installing a collision warning system has slipped further. 'The publication this summer of the Military Aviation Authority report into the tragic fatal collision over the Moray Firth highlighted a chain of bad decisions based on cost-benefit-analysis which is completely wrong when we are talking about service personnel's lives. 'Now that the MoD has extended the life of the Tornado's after their botched Defence Review it is even more imperative that these systems which were recommended over 15 years ago are finally installed.' An MoD source told added: ‘Avoidance of collision in the air cannot be purely reliant on equipment of any sort as it is not effective against all types of aircraft. 'This is why a multi-layered approach is more effective incorporating de-confliction planning, extensive flying supervision, sound airmanship, equipment fitted to aircraft to aid situational awareness, employment of suitable radar services and ultimately an effective lookout from the aircrew to “see and avoid” each other.’ The MAA's inquiry into the 2012 crash found 17 factors contributed to the deaths of Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders, Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole. It recently emerged an RAF Typhoon fighter and a light aircraft came dangerously close to colliding over East Anglia because of an air traffic control blunder. The jet was taking part in a training exercise when the pilot spotted a Cesna in its path at around 2,600ft. It dived and shot underneath the smaller plane within around 200ft of it. A report said the pilot of the single-engine Cessna did not see the Typhoon before it passed beneath him. The UK Airprox Board, which examines near-misses, classified the degree of risk of a collision as A, or high. They said safety margins were reduced 'to the minimum' in the scare over Fakenham, Norfolk on the morning of July 31. The board blamed an air traffic controller at RAF Marham for allowing the Typhoon to fly 'into conflict' with the C172 Cessna. RAF Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft on exercise in Malta - it is not fitted with a collision avoidance system . They said the pilot of the private plane had correctly informed the base of his plans to fly. He telephoned the control tower at Marham before taking off from a nearby airstrip and was told Tornados would be operating from the base but was not given any specifics. The Marham air traffic controller said he was controlling three different types of aircraft at the time the near-miss occurred. He did not see the Cessna on his radar until he received a warning that another plane was in front of the Typhoon. He said when he radioed to warn its pilot, he was told the jet had just passed beneath the Cessna. HQ Air Command said: 'The Typhoon pilot was in a reasonably busy phase of flight, descending and configuring his aircraft for an approach, so his lookout would have been compromised.' The report concluded: 'The Board felt that the C172 pilot had done his best to inform Marham of his intentions to fly close to their radar pattern, had called them on the radio, and had attempted to route away from their normal radar pattern. 'The Board discussed at length the cause of the Airprox and eventually agreed that Marham ATC had allowed the Typhoon pilot to fly into conflict with the C172.' It added: 'The incident had just stopped short of an actual collision where safety margins had been reduced to the minimum.'","Head of RAF has warned that Typhoon jets could crash into airliner planes .

"A schoolgirl was left looking like a victim of an acid attack after spilling nail glue on her leg while having a do-it-yourself manicure. Lois Archer, 15, could be scarred for life after the accident, and doctors have told her she may need a skin graft after the wound became infected. The incident happened when she was at a friend's house earlier this month and the pair were giving each other beauty treatments. Warning: graphic content . Warning: Lois Archer, pictured with her mother Adrienne, suffered burns after spilling nail glue on her leg . Burns: The unbranded chemical, left, caused an ugly wound to appear on the 15-year-old's leg, right . The glue, which was bought online and is manufactured by an obscure chemicals firm, fell onto Lois' leg and left a horrific burn. Her mother Adrienne, 36, said: 'It was incredible - it is like she was burned in an acid attack. 'Her friend was doing the false nails on her and Lois was holding the glue bottle on her knee - but it slipped and tipped. 'It burnt through her trousers. Her leg was sizzling and smoking and the glue left a big huge burn on her thigh. 'Doctors are going to decide if she needs a skin graft to repair the damage.' Anger: Mrs Archer has now complained to the local trading standards authority about the manicure glue . Lois, from Cwmavon in South Wales, went to the minor injuries unit at Neath Port Talbot Hospital following the incident on January 5. However, the injury became infected and the schoolgirl had to be transferred to the burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Her leg was still tingling three days after she was initially hurt, and she has been told further medical intervention may be necessary. Similar kits are available from multiple websites as well as High Street shops across the UK. A product identical to the one which left Lois injured is currently on sale via Amazon for £6.40 a bottle, or £10 for a set of six. Neath Port Talbot Council is now investigating the potentially dangerous substance after Mrs Archer complained to trading standards.","Lois Archer was doing her nails at  friend's house  when accident happened .

"Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary has denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair had met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December. McNary was taken into police custody on Wednesday night after charges of rape, criminal confinement with bodily injury and battery resulting in bodily injury were filed against him. On Thursday morning, McNary's attorney, Edward Schrager, released a statement in which he said his client ‘unhesitatingly denies all accusations made against him.’ Scroll down for video . Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary has denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair had met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December . ‘Following the public release of these allegations, Joshua immediately reported to law enforcement officials in a respectful and peaceful manner,’ read the statement. ‘The charges and affidavit publicly disseminated on Wednesday afternoon are not evidence of wrongdoing, but simply one side's story.’ The statement went on to say that McNary believes the matter should be addressed in court rather than in the media. The Colts had issued a statement on Wednesday saying they were aware of the allegations - but did not immediately suspend 26-year-old McNary. The player, who has been with the team since 2013, currently remains listed as active on the team's roster for Sunday's AFC Championship game. According to the probable cause affidavit, two Indianapolis police officers said a 29-year-old woman accused an unknown man they later determined to be McNary of attacking her in the early morning hours of December 1. Serviceman: Joshua McNary, 26, (seen at left during an Army game in 2010) was an Army officer before signing with the Colts as a free agent in April 2013 . Police, according to the report, determined the man was McNary after investigating a cellphone the woman claimed she took from the man's apartment. 'At one point, the female can be heard crying and becoming emotionally distraught,' the report said. Police reported that a nurse found dried blood behind the woman's ear and other injuries following a sexual assault examination, and that a friend of the accuser played a 2-minute voicemail from the women for police. The woman, whose name was redacted from the document, claimed the two engaged in a 'physical fight' and that she scratched his neck, face, back and shoulder before the alleged sexual assault took place. In the report, police said the woman also picked McNary's image out of a group of photos. The police also wrote that when they arrived at McNary's apartment to investigate, McNary said: 'I know why you're here.' The report said McNary claimed to have preserved evidence because he expected the police would be coming. McNary has been with the Colts for two seasons after finishing his college career as Army's career leader in sacks and tackles for loss. The Rice incident, along with a spate of domestic abuse cases among players including Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, brought down a firestorm of public criticism on the most popular U.S. sports league . He spent two years on active military duty to fulfill his commitment before signing with Indy in 2013. He had 20 tackles during the regular season and no tackles in the playoffs, and still serves in the National Guard as part of his military obligations. The Colts issued a statement saying they're aware of the allegations. 'Unfortunately that's the limit of our knowledge,' the team said. 'At this time we are very concerned and trying to find out what the relevant facts are, but we have insufficient information to venture any opinion. As we learn more we will make appropriate updates.' According to the report, the woman also said she believed the man slapped her on the left side of her face with his hands before forcing himself on her. Since the alleged incident, McNary has played in four regular season games and two playoff games for the Colts, according to NFL.com. McNary attended West Point played football at Army before signing with the Colts as a free agent in April 2013. The charges against McNary come a day after an independent probe found the league failed to properly investigate a domestic assault incident in which running back Ray Rice punched his then-fiancee on an elevator in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Rice incident, along with a spate of domestic abuse cases among players including Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, brought down a firestorm of public criticism on the most popular U.S. sports league.","Former Army officer Josh McNary, 26, was charged with rape, criminal confinement and battery after a December 1 incident .

"Labour's Siobhain McDonagh said some satellite stations are able to broadcast attacks on religious minorities in rare dialects . British youngsters are being radicalised by hate-filled sermons broadcast on satellite TV in obscure foreign dialects, MPs have warned. Labour's Siobhain McDonagh said some satellite stations are able to broadcast attacks on religious minorities in rare dialects because regulators cannot understand what they are saying. It comes amid warnings that the threat from home-grown terrorists is at its highest level since 9/11 - with Home Secretary Theresa May revealing today that at least three serious terror plots have been foiled recently. Ms McDonagh called on the Government crack-down on channels that may be radicalising people in Britain. During culture questions in the Commons, the Labour MP asked him: ‘On December 22 Geo TV broadcast a programme entitled Hatred Against The Ahmadi Muslim Community and five days later an Ahmadi Muslim was murdered in Gujranwala, Pakistan.’ Culture Minister Ed Vaizey revealed the media watchdog Ofcom was now investigating complaints about hate sermons being broadcast over satellite TV. The revelation comes amid growing fears over the terror threat posed by fanatics returning from the front line in Syria. Chancellor George Osborne this morning confirmed that the emergency services were practising for ‘marauding’ Paris-style gun attacks which spread out from a city centre and last for days. He said: 'We have put more money into counter-terrorism, into organisations like MI5, even during these difficult times when we’ve have to make cuts elsewhere, it is all about getting your priorities right. 'And at the same time, we are looking now at armed response, we’ve done quite a lot of practises in this country for situations where people have guns and there marauding around town centres.' In a Commons statement yesterday afternoon, Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs that innocent lives were being put 'at risk' by a failure to give the security services the powers they need to prevent a terrorist attack. She said the UK's anti-terror agencies were increasingly powerless to tracking British-based fanatics because the law stops them from monitoring emails. The Tory Cabinet Minister said every day that passed without giving MI5 and the police new powers meant 'crimes will go unpunished and innocent lives will be put at risk'. She also claimed that around 600 Britons are now thought to have travelled to Syria to fight on the front line with ISIS. Across Europe there are now thought to be up to 5,000 Islamist fanatics at large after returning from the Middle East. Scroll down for video . George Osborne, speaking to Kate Garraway and Ben Shephard on ITV's . 'Good Morning Britain', said the emergency services had been training for the possibility of Paris-style terrorist attacks . The Home Secretary said the UK's anti-terror agencies were increasingly powerless to tracking British-based fanatics . It comes after David Cameron held talks with spy chiefs earlier this week to step up Britain's defences against the threat posed by a 'fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence'. The Prime Minister asked the police and military to 'continue to work closely together' to ensure that the police, who lead on counter-terror measures, can call on military back-up when needed across the country. Discussion centred on levels of preparedness for 'marauding' gun attacks, similar to those seen in Mumbai in 2008 when 164 people died in 12 shooting and bomb attacks over four days. Police and security agencies 'regularly' carry out training exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris, Downing Street said. 'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios.' It is understood that particular focus has been on the way brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi moved from central Paris after carrying out their attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. They are said to have spent a night in woodland before trying to return to the capital, before becoming holed up on an industrial estate in the small town of Dammartin-en-Goele. Terrorist brothers Cherif Kouachi (left) and Said Kouach (right) died after murdering 12 people in last week's gun rampage . A spokesman for the media regulator Ofcom this morning insisted it had experienced translators for non-English channels to ensure hate speech was not broadcast in the UK. He said: 'Ofcom has strict rules forbidding the broadcast of harmful extremist material and hate speech over the airwaves. 'This is a matter we take extremely seriously and when broadcasters break our rules we take robust enforcement action, which can range from fines to revoking licences. 'We also have targeted monitoring of programming to ensure compliance with the Broadcasting Code and use experienced translators for content not broadcast in English. 'We have already fined one UK TV station £25,000 for abusing the religious beliefs of Ahmadis, and two others a total of £170,000 for broadcasting hate speech.'","MP Siobhain McDonagh raised the scandal in the House of Commons .

"A Malaysian defense contractor at the center of a probe into a multi-million dollar Navy bribery scandal has scheduled a change-of-plea hearing. Leonard Glenn Francis, chief executive of a Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd., or GDMA, is expected in federal court on Thursday in San Diego. His lawyer could not be reached for comment on  Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Will change plea: Leonard Glenn Francis (right) was known 'Fat Leonard' is expected to plead guilty on Thursday after previously pleading not guilty to conspiracy in a bribery case . Prosecutors declined to comment. Francis has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy in a bribery case that has led to the arrest of Navy commanders and rocked the military branch. Prosecutors say Francis bought information from Navy officials that allowed his company to overbill the military branch by at least $20 million for services it provided to Navy ships at Asian ports since 2009. Francis paid for plane tickets, hotels and prostitutes for Navy officials who helped him, according to prosecutors. GDMA has provided fuel, food and supplies for Navy ships for 25 years.  He was arrested in 2013 on a trip to San Diego. The hearing comes barely a week after a Navy commander acknowledged sharing confidential information with Francis, who is known in military circles as 'Fat Leonard.' Jose Luis Sanchez said he provided shipping schedules and other information to Francis in exchange for bribes. He became the highest-ranking Navy official to plead guilty in the case after Daniel Layug, a petty officer who admitted providing classified shipping schedules and other internal Navy information to Francis. Guilty: Jose Luis Sanchez said he provided shipping schedules and other information to Francis in exchange for bribes and became the highest-ranking Navy official to plead guilty in the case . Sanchez faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison when he is sentenced March 27 for bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery. Sanchez admitted taking bribes valued between $30,000 and $120,000 from 2009 to 2013, a prostitute, $7,500 to travel from Asia to the U.S. and five days at Singapore's luxury Shangri-La Hotel, according to a 24-page plea agreement. In exchange, he provided classified Navy ship and submarine schedules and other internal information to Francis. Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz, has pleaded not guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for providing confidential information to Francis. He was indicted last week on an additional seven counts of bribery. An agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, John Beliveau II, and a manager for the contractor, Alex Wisidagama, who is Francis' cousin, have pleaded guilty.","Leonard Glenn Francis, chief executive of a Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. is expected in federal court on Thursday .

"A UK Border Agency officer read secret files at work to give migrants 'tailored' visa advice in a £113,000 scheme run by her fake lawyer boyfriend. Anjali Patel passed on confidential information to 28-year-old law student Abdul Farooq, who was charging desperate immigrants up to £13,000 while posing as a fully-qualified lawyer. Farooq - who had gambling losses of £12,000 - then used the information to 'subvert' the system, a court heard. Scheme: Anjali Patel (right) passed on confidential information to 28-year-old law student Abdul Farooq (left), who was charging desperate immigrants up to £13,000 while posing as a fully-qualified lawyer . Patel and her boyfriend, from Croydon, south London, will both be sentenced next month after she admitted two counts of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. Farooq had already pleaded guilty to identical counts, alongside two charges of unlawfully providing immigration services. Those caught up in the scheme in 2010 and 2011 were immigrants from Bangladesh, Colombia and Pakistan who were nearing the end of their visa terms or facing deportation. Desperate to stay in Britain, they handed over thousands of pounds in cash to Farooq. He was secretly assisted by Patel, who also had gambling debts and owed money to payday loan firms - though she insisted she did not receive a penny. She was an executive officer with the UKBA's case resolution directorate, Croydon Crown Court heard, so was able to access personal information which would help the so-called clients' cases. Justice: The pair will be sentenced next month at Croydon Crown Court, but Patel is likely to avoid jail . But the scheme unravelled when one migrant - failing to get the results she was promised - became so fed up that she reported Farooq to police. Karen Robertson, prosecuting, said: 'Despite not having a law degree Farooq held himself out to be a solicitor or someone qualified to give immigration advice. 'He persuaded vulnerable individuals to part with substantial amounts of money in the hope he could assist them stay in this country. 'Patel assisted him by the unlawful access of database and document files, personal data and other sensitive information. Patel - who claimed she did not receive a penny - pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office . 'The information she provided enabled Farooq to tailor advice to applicants and she gave advice to Farooq on how to subvert the application process.' Failed Colombian asylum-seeker Maria Garcia-Zuniga, who had been in Britain for more than a decade and was working illegally as a cleaner, was the one who called police. She had paid Farooq £2,000 cash to 'regularise' her status after he 'told her that he was her solicitor and she did not need anyone else to help', said Miss Robertson. After shopping Farooq she pursued a bid herself to remain in Britain under human rights legislation. Investigators later discovered an image on Patel's phone of Farooq illegally giving immigration advice to a client at a hotel. One client, Bangladesh-born Mamunmar Rahman, gave Farooq £12,950 cash to help him secure a five-year work visa which could lead to permanent residency for his wife and child. Farooq - also known as Zen - falsely told Mr Rahman he was an employee of Voyage International Relocation Ltd. The firm offered work experience placements to students at London's Brunel University, where he studied. Their meetings took place in a Croydon hotel and Farooq always insisted on cash payments, but the visa Mr Rahman wanted never materialised. Another client, Pakistani-born Arman Ali, was in custody for immigration offences and facing deportation when Patel told him to lie his way out of trouble, the court heard. 'That was advice designed to frustrate the removal of an illegal person from this country,' added Miss Robinson. Prosecutors had initially charged Patel with laundering £73,000 in criminal property, but the charges were dropped after an aborted trial. The total losses to the victims were estimated at £113,000. Judge Nicholas Ainley told Patel, who left the UKBA and joined the Ministry of Justice's parole board, that she would be unlikely to be sent to prison when she is sentenced next month.","Anjali Patel, 31, read secret files at work to give migrants 'tailored' advice .

"Britain and the US are to set up a joint ‘cyber squad’ to carry out fake hacking attacks on banks, aircraft and nuclear power plants. In talks at the White House today, David Cameron and Barack Obama are set to agree an unprecedented level of co-operation, with a team of agents to help safeguard both countries. A report from British spy chiefs to be published today says four in every five big firms in the UK last year experienced some sort of serious cyber security breach. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Barack Obama make their way from the Oval Office to the Residence to begin their working dinner last night . The PM and President have agreed an unprecedented level of co-operation on cyber crime . Mr Cameron and Mr Obama dined together in the White House last night, Attackers range from lone criminals to rogue states seeking to steal industrial secrets or spread mayhem and fear. There is mounting concern that Islamic fundamentalists or an enemy country could seek to mount a crippling attack on Western banks, sensitive sites such as atomic power plants or even planes, by targeting air traffic control systems. In the wake of North Korea’s attack on Sony Pictures, UK and US security services will now establish a joint team of agents to confront the issue and respond to attacks. Agents at GCHQ and MI5 will work with their US counterparts to encourage information about threats to be shared at a greater pace. They will also conduct a series of ‘war games’ to test the resilience of both the UK and US in the face of cyber attacks. The first exercise will simulate an attack on the financial sector, for example on banks in the City and Wall Street, and will take place later this year. This will be followed by further ‘war games’ to test critical national infrastructure – likely to include air traffic control, power stations and healthcare systems. The pair appeared to be in good spirits as they chatted before settling down to business . Mr Cameron and Mr Obama are pictured inside the Oval Office moments after the Prime Minister was invited inside . The leaders' discussions were undertaken last night during a 'working dinner'. Judging by the menu, it looks to have been one of Mr Cameron's more enjoyable duties. The US and UK have also agreed to align cybersecurity standards to ensure multinational firms receive consistent advice on keeping their systems safe from cyber attack. The two countries will train up a new generation of ‘cyber agents’ and allow the brightest experts on both sides of the Atlantic to carry out research placements for up to six months. Mr Cameron, who began two days of talks at the White House last night, said: ‘Just as we have worked with our closest ally, the US, to protect our people and our countries from traditional threats, so we must work together to defend ourselves from new threats like cyber attacks. ‘This is an evolving threat which poses a real risk to our businesses and that’s why we’re taking our cooperation with the US to an unprecedented level. ‘This is about pooling our effort so we stay one step ahead of those who seek to attack us.’ Today’s report from GCHQ reveals the growing scale of the threat, with more than 80 per cent of large firms in the UK reporting some form of security breach last year, at a total cost of between £600,000 and £1.5million. Director Robert Hannigan said: ‘In GCHQ, we continue to see real threats to the UK on a daily basis, and I’m afraid the scale and rate shows little sign of abating.’ GCHQ is urging all businesses to take greater steps to protect themselves from cyber attacks. On a daily basis, its agents see computer systems and the information on them being compromised by malicious attackers. The report says: 'The internet can be a hostile environment. The threat of attack is ever present as new vulnerabilities are released and commodity tools are produced to exploit them. 'Doing nothing is no longer an option; protect your organisation and your reputation by establishing some basic cyber defences to ensure that your name is not added to the growing list of victims.' The report gives examples of attacks identified by GCHQ, including a previously unknown espionage campaign against the UK energy sector. The world was shaken after North Korea's apparent hack of Sony, which made The Interview (above) David Cameron last night urged Barack Obama to help create a rapid response team of specialists to stamp out outbreaks of ebola and other deadly diseases before they can spread across the world. Over dinner in the White House, the two leaders were updated on the latest infection rates in Sierra Leone. They also discussed the idea of having a standing army of epidemiologists who could be deployed quickly to any area of the world – to assess emerging epidemics and offer swift advice about how to overcome them. Attackers used a technique known as a ‘watering hole’ attack to distribute 'malware' - malicious softward - into businesses working in the energy sector. After discovering that a single web design company hosted a number of energy supply sector businesses’ websites, attackers added a code to one website which redirected the visiting user’s browser to one of three websites controlled by the attackers. GCHQ believe that these watering hole attacks were part of a continuing commercial espionage campaign against the UK energy sector. Fortunately, agents detected the attack and was dealt with before it could affect the targeted businesses. In another attack, a technique called 'spear-phishing' was used to attack a high profile organisation. An email was sent to a targeted individual containing an attachment with malicious software. The attacker was then able to access information about the company's wider network and sensitive informatiob. The report says attackers range from cyber criminals interested in making money through fraud or sale of valuable information to industrial competitors and foreign intelligence services, interested in gaining an economic advantage for their companies or countries. In other cases, 'hacktivists' may seek to attack companies for political or ideological motives, or just to show they can. The worst case scenario would be a rogue state or terrorists using cyber attacks as a form of warfare. Chief executive of cyber firm Darktrace Nicole Eagan said: 'The growing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks underlines that we are in a new era of cyber-security. 'Unfortunately the old systems just don’t work, whether that’s individual countries trying to deal with the cyber threat alone or whether it’s organisations thinking they can keep intruders out of their networks. 'Countries need to work more closely together, governments need to work more openly with the business world and companies need to be able to detect unusual patterns of behaviour on their networks and address them before a breach becomes a crisis.'","Leaders set to agree unprecedented level of co-operation in Washington .

"A third of male students questioned in a survey admitted they would rape a woman if they could get away with it. The study found that 31.7 per cent of the mostly white American participants questioned admitted they would force a woman to have sex in a ‘consequence-free situation’. Academics quizzed volunteers on how they would act in a situation where they could have sex with a woman against her will 'if nobody would ever know there wouldn’t be any consequences’. A third of male students questioned in a survey admitted they would rape a woman if they could get away with it (file picture) But when asked specifically whether they would 'rape' a woman in a consequence-free situation, only 13.6 per cent of the male participants said they would. The findings suggested that many of those who admitted they would commit rape did not recognise their actions as such, the Independent reports. ‘Some men will endorse items asking whether they have used force to obtain intercourse, but will deny having raped a woman,’ wrote the authors of the study, which has been published in the scientific journal Violence and Gender. The gap in the proportion of people who did not consider their actions as 'rape' and those who would endorse the use of coercion could have implications for sexual education programs, the authors of the report said. A study found that 31.7 per cent of the mostly white American men questioned would force a woman to have sex in a ‘consequence-free situation’ (file picture) researchers used analysis to 'separate men who do not report intentions to be sexually coercive, those who endorse behaviorally descriptive intentions but deny it when the word rape it used, and those who endorse intentions to rape outright.' The research was carried out by experts at the University of North Dakota and the North Dakota State University. They questioned 86 people over the age of 18 -most of them college juniors and all of them describing themselves as heterosexual. The findings could have knock on effects for educational schemes, the authors suggest, adding: ‘Our results suggest that there is no one-size-fit-all approach to sexual assault prevention. ‘If men who sexually assault harbor different motivations to varying degrees, identifying them ahead of time and targeting interventions toward groups of men with similar motivations, or better even, providing personalized prevention programs, may be more successful.’ It goes on to say that men who show intentions to use force but deny intentions to rape 'exhibit a unique disposition featuring an inverse construct of hostility toward women but high levels of callous sexual attitudes.' The authors pointed to findings from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in 2012 which stated that about one in five women become the victim of sexual assault while in college - with most of the attacks carried out by people known to the victim.","Academics questioned 86 mostly white American participants for survey .

"A former Michigan high school tutor convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old male student will spend the next 8 to 25 years in prison, a Kent County judge decided on Wednesday. The sentence comes after she rejected a plea deal that could have put her behind bars for just months. Abigail Simon, 35, collapsed twice during the hearing, which lasted over two hours. In court on Wednesday: Abigail Simon enters Judge Paul Sullivan's Kent County courtroom where she was sentenced to eight to 25 years behind bars . Collapsed twice: Abigail Simon is helped by deputies after she almost passed out in Judge Paul Sullivan's Kent County courtroom where she was sentenced on Wednesday . Simon pleaded for mercy during her hearing and tearfully gave a ten minute statement, still expressing the belief that she was a victim. 'I’m asking you to take a chance on me,' begged Simon. 'I’m lost and I’m broken,' she said expressing that she was tired and that she wanted to go home. 'I was overtaken by fear, scared and lost, felt like I was drowning,' she told the judge with a look of desperation. 'I’m sorry I was not strong enough to get away from him.' Claims to be the victim: Abigail Simon is shown in Judge Paul Sullivan's Kent County courtroom where she was sentenced on Wednesday . The victim's mother also made a statement saying that her son was the victim and that she hoped Simon's sentencing would be severe, reports Woodtv.com . She said her son 'has experienced a lot of pain and suffering in his short life. A huge percentage of it was caused by Abigail Simon’s actions.' 'This theater of the absurd has closed its curtain,' the mom told the judge. 'I ask you to be severe in your sentencing.' Simon's lawyer Mike Manley stood by his defense saying that the young man first told police that he was the aggressor. 'It’s not a defense we made up. It’s not a defense we created,' Manley said. Simon was in November found guilty on four of the five charges against her - three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of accosting a minor for immoral purposes - and will be sentenced in January, with a maximum penalty of life in prison. In pain: Abigail Simon's family is shown in Judge Paul Sullivan's Kent County courtroom where she was sentenced on Wednesday . However, according to MLive, Simon turned down numerous opportunities to receive a lighter sentence in order to try and fight to clear her name. She could have gotten off with a few months behind bars. Between April 2013 and the beginning of a probable cause hearing for Simon in Grand Rapids District Court in August, the Kent County Prosecutor’s Office gave Simon the chance to plead guilty to second-degree criminal sexual conduct, which would have ended her expensive, lengthy and at-times humiliating trial. The charge has a maximum sentence of 15 years but, in exchange for the plea, she would have been offered a one-year cap in Kent County Jail, which also offers time off for good behavior. Convicted: Former Catholic school tutor Abigail Simon was found guilty on November 26 of sexually assaulting a teenage student . Then, after the probable cause hearing, she received another offer to plead guilty to accosting a child for immoral purposes and assault with intent to commit sexual penetration. That plea had a minimum sentence of five months and a maximum of 23 months, but Simon again turned it down. What followed was a three-week trial that came to a dramatic conclusion when Simon's guilty verdict was handed down in November. A weeping Simon insisted she was the victim in her relationship with the 15-year-old boy and during one of her aggressive exchanges with Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Helen Brinkman even declared: 'I'll never forgive you!' It was a scene so unusually emotional that even Judge Paul Sullivan was having trouble dealing with it. 'This thing is totally out of control.' the judge told his courtroom. 'I've tried to be patient but I'm beginning to lose it.' Guilty: Simon, 35, was found guilty on four of the five charges against her, three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of accosting a minor for immoral purposes . Emotional: Accused sexual predator Abigail Simon strikes a pained pose in court in November as an emotional exchange erupted between her and prosecuting attorney Helen Brinkman . 'I'll never forgive you!': Simon accused Brinkman's client of lying. Her defense spins upon the argument that she is the victim and was manipulated by a 15-year-old student . Out of control: At one point Simon mouthed 'I want to go home' during questioning. Even the fed up judge declared to the courtroom 'this thing is totally out of control.' 'I want to go home,' Simon mouthed to her attorney at one point as she sat at the stand, the last witness in the two-week courtroom saga. 'Did you tell anybody he forced you or threatened you before you were caught?' Brinkman asked. 'No, I said that 1,000 times already,' Simon said. Arrested: Abigail Simon is seen here in a booking photo after being arrested for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old boy . 'I'm not sitting up here lying like your client,' shouted at Brinkman at one point. According to MLive.com, Brinkman accused Simon of 'mirroring' the boy’s victimization as a means of defending herself. The dramatic interaction brought the trial to a memorable close on Monday, with the jury expect to begin deliberations sometime Tuesday. Throughout the proceedings, lawyers for the 35-year-old former tutor are tried to convince a jury the teenager 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' the woman into sleeping with him. The boy, who was 15 when he allegedly had a short but intense fling with Abigail Simon over spring in 2013, would undergo two days of cross-examination. In that time he was pressed on the more than 1,000 text messages exchanged between himself and Simon as the defense attempted to show he was no victim. However the prosecution used the same texts to depict Simon as a predator who went after an innocent virgin, according to M Live. Simon was fired from her position as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic high schools after the boy's mother found pictures of Simon in a garter belt on her son's phone. Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified. He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV. ASmiling days before: Simon is on trial for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old male student. Here, she smiles in court days before her trial's dramatic conclusion . The teen - now 17 - said their relationship was consensual and that they both knew it was wrong. One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I’m scared that you’re only 15.' The pair were allegedly together between February 1 and April 26 of 2013. Almost all of their encounters allegedly took place at Simon's apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West in Grand Rapids. Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida, Wood TV reported. Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I’m just too old, as much as that stinks.' However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.' The teen started undergoing questioning on Monday November 17. He denied that he slapped Simon before they started having sex with each other and laughed at suggestions he stalked Simon. Simon is charged with first-degree sexual assault and accosting a minor for immoral purposes.

"Disputing the conclusions of the CIA's independent watchdog, an independent board has asserted that CIA officers acted reasonably when they secretly searched Senate computers last year after learning that Senate aides had removed certain classified documents related to the torture investigation. The board, which was led by former Democratic Senator Evan Bayh, found fault with some of the findings by the CIA's inspector general, who said in July that five CIA employees 'improperly accessed' a Senate portion of a shared computer network. The inspector general, David Buckley, resigned in December in what CIA officials insist is an unrelated development. CIA Director John Brennan apologized after the release of the inspector general report and convened the accountability board. The Bayh-led board said the five CIA employees did not deserve to be punished. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report on the CIA's interrogation practices that said the CIA misled Americans and government policymakers about the effectiveness of the program that was secretly put into place after the 9/11 terror attacks – and the CIA was allegedly frightened enough about the outcome that it snooped on the committee's computers . Aides to Democratic Senator from California Dianne Feinstein (center) took documents from a Virginia CIA facility that they considered incriminating, and the CIA sought to find out where they were . CIA Director John Brennan (center) apologized after the release of the agency's inspector general report and convened the accountability board which has now cleared everyone . 'They acted reasonably under the complex and unprecedented circumstances involved in investigating a potential security breach in the highly classified shared computer network,' the board said in a statement. The CIA accessed five emails of Senate aides, but the board concluded the access was a mistake and did not reflect malfeasance or bad faith. The board's report amounted to a remarkable turnabout in a long running dispute between California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and CIA Director John Brennan about whether Feinstein's aides acted appropriately when they removed CIA documents they deemed highly incriminating – documents the CIA considered an internal review to which the Senate was not entitled. The aides took the documents out of a Virginia facility run by the CIA which had been set up to allow Senate investigators to review classified material. The documents were redacted and taken to the Senate's secure facility in the Hart building near the Capitol. They were not used in the Senate report on CIA interrogations, which was harshly critical of the agency. The documents, part of what is known as the 'Panetta review,' were compiled by CIA officers who were sifting through the millions of pages being turned over to the Senate as part of the Senate investigation into the CIA's brutal treatment of al-Qaida detainees after the 9-11 attacks. Feinstein said last year that the Panetta review supported the Senate conclusions that CIA torture did not produce unique intelligence. And she said they were not consistent with the later CIA response, which disputed parts of the Senate report. In a statement Wednesday, Feinstein said she continues to believe the 'CIA's actions constituted a violation of the constitutional separation of powers' that led the CIA to make an erroneous referral for criminal charges against Senate staff to the Justice Department. No charges were ever filed. 'I'm thankful that Director Brennan has apologized for these actions, but I'm disappointed that no one at the CIA will be held accountable. The decision was made to search committee computers, and someone should be found responsible for those actions,' Feinstein said. A statement by the CIA simply restated the board's conclusions. The documents in question were stored on a shared drive in the Virginia facility. The system contained extremely sensitive documents, including the true names of covert operatives. Central Intelligence Agency Inspector General David Buckley resigned in December after clearing the agency's employees, but the CIA insists his departure is unrelated . Camp Justice at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre in Cuba is home to around 150 prisoners being held without trial on suspicion of terrorism; the Senate's CIA torture report revealed tactics worse than the agency has previously admitted to . According to the board's report, a message flashed on the screen that said, 'Your use of this system may be monitored and you have no expectation of privacy.' Feinstein has said that Senate aides accessed the Panetta review using a Google search tool, and printed it out and removed it because of its importance. After the CIA learned that Senate aides appeared to have taken the Panetta review without authorization, they began an investigation of the computer system to learn how the breach happened. There were no formal procedures governing how such a security check should be conducted, the board found. The CIA conducted three separate searches of the computer system, one of which involved 'inappropriate access to Senate work product,' the board found. Five Senate emails were accessed. But 'because there was no formal agreement – or even clear common understanding – governing the procedures to be followed in investigating a potential security incident in these circumstances, no course of action was free of potential complication or conflict,' the board said in justifying the CIA actions.","CIA's inspector general resigned in December after blaming five CIA employees who 'improperly accessed' computers in Senate offices .

Then, the couple had to stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes in total silence. In the end, the two  participants who had walked into his laboratory through separate doors as total strangers fell in love.

"Most holidaymakers will only see majestic killer whales in captivity at aquariums around the world. But these sailors managed to capture a rare glimpse of orcas in the wild as they came within feet of the beautiful mammals. Not only did the pod approach the sailing boat off the coast of Chile, the spectacular animals appeared unperturbed by their audience as they played with a dinghy tied to the back of their vessel. The amazing up-close footage was filmed in Northern Patagonia, at the mouth of the Reloncavi Estuary. The filmmaker Jose Jiminez said: 'I was sailing toward the estuary and in the distance I saw some weird splashes. There were no waves in the area, the wind had just picked up but in no means enough for walls of water seen from over a mile and a half away. 'So as I got closer, I zoomed in with a telephoto lens and shot some pictures then zoomed into the picture and saw Orcas leaping out of the water! The young killer whales swim up extremely close to the boat as it motors along towards the estuary . The two whales seem to enjoy swimming in the drag of the boat underneath the small dinghy . 'We kept on sailing and as we got closer, I turned the motor off and waited, I’ve been around whales before and know not to get in their way. 'The juvenile Orcas came over with the Alpha male while the females stayed away with the baby calves.' In the video, the two young orcas approach the boat and begin swimming behind where it is creating a drag. The family caught the amazing scene on video before the young whales swam off to rejoin their pod . In the video, the viewers exclaim in Spanish: 'They are playing!' The orcas can be seen swimming on their sides right under the small boat being dragged behind the fishing vessel as if they are playing. While the larger whale waits further off, the two younger mammals criss cross under the boat and put on a show for the sailors. Eventually, the playful whales swim off into the distance and back to their pod.","Sailors were motoring off the coast of Chile when whales approached .

Margarito Flores Sr was killed when he travelled south of the border from his home in the Little Village neighborhood of the city in 2009 because his drug-runner sons Pedro and Margarito Jr  were considered to be 'rats'. A note found at the scene where he was abducted revealed that information the brothers, both 34, provided to agents about the Sinaloa cartel was the main reason for his death. Their cooperation led to the indictments of leader Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, his top Sinaloa cartel leaders and dozens of other drug wholesalers from Chicago to Mexico, and meant they avoided an almost certain life prison sentence. Cost of cooperation: Margarito Flores Sr was killed when he travelled to Mexico in 2009 because his drug-runner sons Pedro (left) and Margarito Jr (right)  were considered to be 'rats' Toppled: Their cooperation led to the indictment of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison in November for his part in the $1billion operation . Prosecutors say the Flores brothers cut deals with Guzman, cartel lieutenant Alfredo Vasquez-Hernandez and others to distribute drugs in several cities, including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Washington. Secret recordings and other evidence provided by the twin brothers in 2008 led to the Chicago indictments of Hernandez and 10 others, including Guzman and the Flores twins themselves. In all, the Flores twins pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy involving the distribution of more than 64,500 kilograms of cocaine . In November Guzman was sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in a $1 billion trafficking conspiracy. The court heard how the cartel leader would fly planes with clothes and goods on a humanitarian mission to Mexico City. On the return journey his associates would pack the plane with around 14 tons of cocaine. The case is regarded as one of the U.S. government's most important against Mexican cartels. Guzman remains jailed in Mexico and Mexican authorities haven't said if they might extradite him to Chicago. Diplomacy: The case is regarded as one of the U.S. government's most important against Mexican cartels. Guzman remains jailed in Mexico and Mexican authorities haven't said if they might extradite him to Chicago . According to court documents filed by federal prosecutors this week, and seen by the Chicago Tribune, attorneys will ask U.S. District Chief Judge Ruben Castillo for as little as 10 years in prison for the twins who have been in custody in the witness protection program for more than six years. Defense attorney Paul Brayman has said that anything longer would be a 'death sentence' for his clients. Prosecutors wrote: 'As two of the most well-known cooperating witnesses in the country, the Flores brothers (and their families) will live the rest of their lives in danger of being killed in retribution. The barbarism of the cartels is legend, with a special place reserved for those who cooperate.' Investigators relied on the Flores twins to paint 59-year-old Hernandez as a close friend of Guzman who used his logistical skills to ship tons of drugs by train from Mexico to Chicago concealed amid furniture cargo. But the defense described him as an auto repairman who got caught up in a one-off drug deal. They also attacked the credibility of the Flores twins, saying they exaggerated Hernandez's role in the cartel to curry favor with prosecutors.","Margarito Flores Sr was killed when he travelled to Mexico in 2009 .

"An Indonesian woman accused of ordering a deadly hit on her Australian husband will face charges that could see her handed the death penalty if found guilty. Police on Friday handed over dossiers of evidence in the case of Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis, who is charged with plotting the murder of her businessman husband Robert Ellis. It is alleged Mrs Ellis paid her maid's boyfriend to kill her wealthy husband last October. Mrs Ellis allegedly paid 150 million rupiah ($A14,200) for the hit. She is accused of taking someone's life, deliberately and with planning. The maximum penalty is death. Scroll down for video .

Mrs Ellis, who was taken into custody after confessing to her role in the crime, helped local officials to recreate the murder of Mr Ellis in Bali last November . Her five alleged accomplices - including the men who allegedly slit Mr Ellis' throat in the kitchen of his Bali villa - face the same charges. The police dossiers tell of a troubled marriage spanning years. The couple had been married for 20 years and had had two Perth-based sons, Jon and Peter, together. ‘Regarding motive, the police dossiers are more about cheating and wealth,’ Prosecutor Made Dipa Umbara. Mrs Ellis' lawyer Ketut Suwega Arya Dauh said she regretted the crime. ‘She did it out of stress and being hurtful because she felt unappreciated as a wife. We're ready to defend her in the trial,’ Mr Suwega said. The body of the 60-year-old was found wrapped in plastic and dumped in a ditch in the rice field near Sedang Village in late October. He was set upon in his own Bali kitchen by the killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig', police said, after Mrs Ellis employed the men along with two housemaids to clean up the murder.

"Mystery surrounds the discovery of a 132-year-old rifle found propped up against a tree in the Nevada wilderness. The .44-40 calibre Winchester rifle was found frozen in time on a remote rocky outcrop in the heart of the Grand Basin National Park. Archaeologists discovered the gun, which was manufactured in 1882, leaning against a juniper tree while they were carrying out surveys. Discovery: The .44-40 calibre Winchester rifle  was found frozen in time in the heart of the Grand Basin National Park . The refile, known as 'The gun that won the West' is one of the most popular selling rifles in US history . Experts do not yet know for certain how long it had been there, but with its wooden base discoloured and partially buried and the metal barrel rusted, it is possible the rifle could have been undisturbed for more than a century. The Washington Post reports that the Great Basin was a mining site at the time the gun was manufactured, but that farming was also common in the area and the rifle may also have been used for game hunting. In 1882, 25,000 Winchester rifles of that make were produced costing about $25 each, indicating that they were in plentiful supply. The newspaper quotes Basin National Park chief of interpretation Nichole Andler as saying: ‘It looked like someone propped it up there, sat down to have their lunch and got up to walk off without it. ‘It probably has a very good and interesting story, but it probably is a story that could have happened to almost anyone living this sort of extraordinary existence out here in the Great Basin Desert.’ Experts are scouring local archives in a bid to piece together the history of the weapon, which was found unloaded in November. A statement on the National Park's Facebook page says: 'The park will provide a viewing opportunity for the community before sending the rifle to conservators to stabilize the wood and apply museum conservation techniques. 'The treatment will keep the gun looking as it was found and prevent further deterioration.' Archaeologists discovered the gun, which was manufactured in 1882, leaning against a juniper tree while they were carrying out surveys . John Wayne with a Winchester rifle in the 1961 Western, The Comancheros . Winchester Model 1873 rifles hold a prominent place in America's history, having been the most successful of the gun-maker's products. They are often referred to as 'the gun that won the west' thanks to its popularity with Western settlers in the 1800s. According to the Great Basin National Park Facebook page, 720,610 were manufactured between 1873 and 1916 when production finally came to an end. In 1882 alone, over 25,000 were made and their accessibility meant prices plummeted from about $50 when they first came out to just $25 in 1882. They were so widely used that they became known as 'everyman's' rifle and became an important part of life on the frontier. A lever-action breech mechanism allowed users to unleash a number of shots before having to reload. Typical guns weighed about 9.5lbs and were nearly 50ins long with a barrel length of 30ins. Winchester went on to produce three variations of the Model 1873: the rifle, carbine, and musket. Production of the earlier Model 1866 had started in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1867. Its prominent role in the nation's history is reflected in its use in a series of Hollywood Westerns including 'Stagecoach' with John Wayne and 'Winchester '73' starring James Stewart.","Weapon was found leaning against juniper tree in Nevada's Grand Basin .

"Three-month-old chocolate Labrador Fleur (pictured) was mauled to death by a Staffordshire bull terrier in August . A three-month-old chocolate Labrador puppy was savaged to death by an out-of-control Staffordshire bull terrier in front of two young girls - leaving them 'traumatised'. Magistrates have ordered the destruction of Benji, after he escaped from his owners' garden and mauled the 15-week-old chocolate Labrador. Fleur was being walked by her owners - two girls aged 11 and 14 – in Slinfold, West Sussex, when the aggressive dog bounded over and attacked her. The puppy was taken to a vet for treatment after the attack in August last year, but died of her injuries the next day. She had only been with the family for seven weeks after being given to the young girls as an early Christmas present. The girls' father, who does not want the family to be identified, said: 'Children fall in love with things very quickly, and having their own puppy was their life. They were so proud of their little puppy. 'My 11-year-old is very shaken and very reluctant to leave the house. They are feeling a lot of guilt but they did nothing wrong.' He said they had been left terrified by the shockingly brutal attack, which saw Fleur being shaken around like a 'rag doll.' Police had previously warned Benji's owner, Julie Cooksley, 61, that she must keep control of her pet after the animal had attacked another dog. She was fined £250 and ordered to pay £215 in costs and compensation when she appeared at Crawley Magistrates' Court. The owner has 21 days from the sentencing to appeal against the decision. Inspector Di Lewis, the head of the Sussex and Surrey dogs unit, said: 'We asked the magistrates to make an order for the destruction of the Staffordshire bull terrier as it was clear it had attacked other pets and could do so again. The puppy was taken to a vet for treatment after the attack, but died of her injuries the next day . 'The dog killed the puppy and left its young owners traumatised by what they had seen and we felt it should be destroyed to protect the public and other animals. 'We do not make any such requests lightly but consider all the circumstances including whether the incident could be a one-off and whether the dog involved could do the same thing again. 'We encourage all owners to seek training for their dogs to ensure they are always kept under control. 'It is also important to make them familiar with other people and dogs. 'Unfortunately in this instance we believed that the dog could attack other animals or people in the future and the magistrates agreed with us.'","Three-month-old chocolate Labrador Fleur was mauled to death in August .

"Fashion house Lanvin has called upon some of fashion's most iconic style stars for its latest womenswear campaign, which sees the industry veterans posing alongside their equally-photogenic offspring. The Spring 2015 campaign stars the likes of former Karl Lagerfeld muse Pat Cleveland, 62, who poses with her lookalike daughter Anna, 80s fashion icon Violetta Sanchez and her daughter Luz Godin, and Prada model Kirsten Owen, 44, who is featured alongside her daughter Billie Rose. 'I like that the campaign doesn't only have images, it has a story,' Lanvin creative director Alber Elbaz told WWD.com of his decision to feature the fashion-focused family members in his campaign. Like mother, like daughter: 80s fashion icon turned actress Violetta Sanchez poses alongside her 15-year-old daughter Luz . Blonde bombshells: 44-year-old Kirsten Owen and her daughter Billie Rose are the only mother daughter duo not to be featured in all-black ensembles . Spot the difference: Both Pat Cleveland and her daughter Anna have the same high cheekbones . 'Every time we do a family shoot, it feels like we're going to their place; we feel like visitors.' In each of the ad campaigns, the mother and daughter duos are dressed in near-identical ensembles, modeling a variety of bold hairstyles and posing with the kind of intimate familiarity that can only be found among close-knit family members. Speaking to AnOthermag.com, model turned actress Violetta, who also walked in Alber Elbaz's Lanvin 125th anniversary show, explained that her career has been as much a part of her 15-year-old daughter Luz's life as it has her own. 'She has seen me all my life modelling and acting and curating,' she said. 'She knows modelling doesn’t have to be restrictive. She knows it is something she wants to do but not only. It’s also how you survive.' Family ties: Pat and Anna have modeled together in the past when they starred alongside one another in Zac Posen's Resort 2014 lookbook . In good hands: The campaign was shot by renowned fashion photographer Tim Walker . A splash of color: This shot of Kirsten and Billie Rose is the only one to feature some of Lanvin's brighter prints . And while this campaign is thought to be Luz's first fashion campaign, the other two young women featured have both tried their hands at modeling in the past - both with and without their mothers. In Spring 2013, Billie Rose posed in a series of stunning images, some of which featured her mother Kirsten, while others featured her alone, for Flare magazine. Meanwhile Pat and her daughter Anna, 25, starred together in Zac Posen's Resort 2014 lookbook in June 2013. And Lanvin continues its exploration of familial bonds in its menswear campaign, calling on the talents of sibling style stars Callum and Haydn Rockall, as well as DJ partners Joshua Quinton and Andy Bradin. The four men feature both as a group and in a variety on separate ads, which sees them posing as pairs. Let's hear it for the boys! Lanvin's new menswear campaign also explores the idea of family bonds and features sibling style stars Callum and Haydn Rockall, as well as DJ partners Joshua Quinton and Andy Bradin . Music maestros: Josh, 24, and Andy, 22, have previously performed for the likes of Kate Moss, Miley Cyrus and Riccardo Tisci . Budding style stars: Josh and Andy (L) have appeared in a number of high profile fashion publications in the past, while Callum and Haydn are known as some of the industry's hottest up-and-comers . Josh, 24, and Andy, 22, who DJ together under the name Disco Smack, showcase their infamous orange-red hairstyles while modeling a collection of smartly-tailored jackets and trousers. While the duo, who have performed at a number of celebrity events, from Riccardo Tisci's recent birthday party in Ibiza to Kate Moss' 40th, are not thought to have worked on any other fashion campaigns in the past, they boast an impressive amount of posing experience thanks to a series of high-profile spreads in the world's top magazines. Callum and Haydn meanwhile, are thought of as two of the industry's hottest up-and-comers, a label which has no doubt been cemented thanks to their appearance in this campaign. Shot by renowned fashion photographer Tim Walker, who has worked with the likes of Cara Delevingne for Mulberry, and siblings Dakota and Elle Fanning for W Magazine, the campaign is set to debut in print in March.","Style icons Violetta Sanchez, Pat Cleveland, 62, and Kirsten Owen, 44, all feature alongside their daughters .

"A taxpayer-funded youth group has drawn up controversial plans for Britain’s first school for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender pupils. LGBT Youth North West wants the school to cater for children aged 13 and older who have been bullied and hopes the idea will be copied across the country. Organisers yesterday denied that the school would become a ‘ghetto’ for gay children and said mainstream schools can be ‘one of the last bastions of homophobia’. Scroll down for video . Controversial: A  youth group has unveiled plans for Britain's first all-LGBT school (posed by model) But critics said the move would amount to segregation and would harm efforts to improve tolerance of gay people. Amelia Lee, the group’s strategic director, said the idea was based on the Harvey Milk School in New York, named after the American politician later played by Sean Penn in a Hollywood movie. She visited the Harvey Milk school last year, and said she had secured a meeting with officials at the Department for Education. But Tory MP and former education minister Tim Loughton said: ‘We need to do a lot more to combat homophobic bullying and to create a more tolerant society. Elizabeth Lowe, 14, killed herself in misplaced fear that her Christian parents would reject her . ‘But I cannot see how segregating a group of young people identified by their sexuality can aid better engagement and understanding. ‘The way to achieve more integration, understanding and empathy is not by segregating members of one group, and this would seem to me to be a step backwards from achieving tolerance.’ UKIP deputy leader and education spokesman, Paul Nuttall said: 'This idea does nothing but foster division. “At a time that successive governments have closed all but a few special schools, why this sudden exception, if not for reasons of political correctness? “Integration is the key to understanding, and it is utterly bizarre to be taking a step that highlights differences and adds nothing of value to a child’s education.' Miss Lee said her organisation has carried out a survey of gay, lesbian and transgender young people which found many felt teachers had been unsupportive and in some cases simply urged them to ‘ignore’ bullying. ‘Teachers in mainstream schools have problems in tackling issues like homophobic bullying and coming out,’ she said. ‘Unfortunately, schools can be one of the last bastions of homophobia. ‘We have also seen tragic cases such as that of Elizabeth Lowe, a 14-year-old who committed suicide in a park in Manchester because she was struggling with coming out and was worried about telling her parents. ‘It’s to combat problems like those that we want to work with schools and pupil referral units to help young people who are struggling in mainstream education.’ The group received a grant for £63,000 from the Department for Communities and Local Government to enable it to purchase the building where it is based, the Joyce Layland LGBT Centre in central Manchester. And it used part of the funding to conduct a feasibility study into setting up a school. Miss Lee paid for the visit to the U.S. out of her own pocket. Miss Lee said that by coincidence Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was also visiting the Harvey Milk School last year at the same time she was there. She also praised the ‘climate of change’ within the department towards homophobic bullying in schools. City: City council officials in Manchester (pictured) say they are open to the idea, which is in early stages . A source close to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan told the Mail: ‘There is simply no way that we will approve a free school specifically for LGBT young people. ‘Pupils regardless of their sexuality should be educated in mainstream schools which should be equipped to tackle any bullying that should occur.’ Miss Lee said the proposed school would also be open to pupils who were not gay or transgender but felt more comfortable in such an environment and those who are questioning their sexuality. Critic: MP Tim Loughton said the idea would segregate students from one another even more . LGBT Youth North West is a regional organisation that seeks to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans young people in the North West of England. It receives funding from a raft of state funded bodies, including the region’s councils and parts of the NHS. It also says its work is ‘supported by’ the National Lottery, Comic Relief and Children in Need. Miss Lee said she intends to wait until after the General Election to decide whether to go ahead with an application to set up a free school, with the first pupils starting in around three years’ time. She said around two-thirds of the anticipated 60 pupils would be full-time, with the rest attending for around a day a week from their usual schools. ‘The last thing we want is for young people to fall out of mainstream education permanently, or for this to become a ghetto for lesbian, gay and bisexual students,’ she said. ‘This would be somewhere that students who are struggling with the negative effects of issues like bullying could attend classes for a period of time while ensuring they get the grades they are capable of.’ She said children would not be enrolled in the school as their first-choice secondary, but referred there if they were having problems in mainstream education, potentially staying for a year or more. A spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government said the grant was to help the group purchase the community centre from Manchester City Council and was not to set up a school. A spokesman said: ‘The Department for Communities and Local Government has not funded this school.’ ‘Rather, through the organisation Social Investment Business, grants have been given to local areas wishing to run buildings for community uses.’ A spokesman for Manchester City Council said: ‘We supported LGBT Youth NW in their bid for funding to look at the feasibility of expanding their premises and developing the work they do. ‘One of their development ambitions is around how they might make additional educational support available to LGBT young people. We’ve had an initial discussion with them about that, but there are no current plans that we’re aware of to open a LGBT school in the city.’","Centre for 60 teenagers is by taxpayer-funded LGBT Youth North West .

"The Royal Mint has revealed a new £20 collector's coin featuring wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill to commemorate the 50 years since his death. Arguably Britain's most famous Prime Minister, Sir Winston is the only statesman to have ever been honoured on three official  coins.

Mr Churchill said: 'This year marks 50 years since the death of my great grandfather and 75 years since his finest hour, on becoming wartime Prime Minister. 'It is fantastic to see so many and such varied activities taking place to celebrate everything that he achieved during his long life.

'To do so with my young son is a special honour which encapsulates the important link between past, present and future.' Shane Bissett, The Royal Mint's Director of Commemorative Coin and Medals said the mint first produced a commemorative coin bearing an image of Sir Winston Churchill to mark his death in 1965. He added: 'Churchill holds a significant place in Britain's history as a great leader, soldier, artist and writer, not only acting as Prime Minister on two occasions but also leading the country twice through the dark days of war. 'His image, reputation and legacy are instantly recognisable all over the world; therefore it is only fitting that he takes pride of place on The Royal Mint's third £20 for £20 coin.' Sir Winston is perhaps best known for his defiant Second World War speech vowing to 'never surrender' to Nazi Germany. The mint's coin comes as part of Churchill 2015 - an international celebration of the life and legacy of Sir Winston. Organisers say they hope it will keep his memory alive as well as educate and inspire future generations.

"California health officials confirmed that six new measles cases are connected to an outbreak at Disney theme parks last month, bringing the total number of illnesses to 32. The new cases of the airborne illness include five in Los Angeles County and one in San Diego County. Craig Sturak with the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency said Thursday that the latest case in his area posed no threat of public exposure. Officials are also awaiting measles test results on five people who showed up with fevers and rashes Wednesday at a health clinic in La Mesa, an east San Diego suburb. Scroll down for video . Rising: The total number of measles cases linked to an outbreak in Disney theme parks in December has increased to 32 after authorities confirmed six new patients in Los Angeles and San Diego County . Many of those infected in the outbreak either weren't vaccinated because of a parent’s choice or were too young to be vaccinated. The Sharp Rees-Stealy Urgent Care Center closed for about six hours after the patients arrived, spokeswoman Frances Schnall said. The five were released about three hours later, and the clinic reopened after allowing fresh air to circulate. About 40 patients at the clinic Wednesday were questioned about their measles and vaccination histories, and none believed they were at risk, Schnall said. Their answers were given to county health officials, and they were released. Until test results come in, it's unclear if the La Mesa patients are related to the measles outbreak at Disney parks. Officials said 28 of the confirmed cases are in California, two are in Utah and one apiece in Colorado and Washington. Most of the patients visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure (pictured) between December 15 and December 20, but some may have contracted the illness from others who visited . Contagious: Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body . Most of the patients visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20, but some may have contracted the illness from others who visited. Disney officials have said they are working with public health authorities to provide any necessary assistance. Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"The toy company that gained notoriety earlier this year by creating a meth lab play set inspired by the hit TV show Breaking Bad is at it again, this time turning their attention to adult entertainment. Just in time for Christmas, the Chicago-based Citizen Brick specializing in custom-printed Lego pieces has come out with the Citizen Brick Center for the Performing Arts - a play set featuring a swinging strip club scene. The plastic jiggly joint is called the Foxy Blox club, and it comes with buxom strippers in bikini tops, a hairy-chested male dancer and a stage with a pole in the middle. They're at it again: Citizen Brick, the company that came out with a Breaking Bad-inspired meth lab set earlier this year, has now created a strip club toy set called The Center for the Performing Arts . Cheeky: The set comes with two customized Lego strippers in bikini tops and G-strings . Plastic showgirls: The adult toy even comes with a stripper pole on a raised platform . The company posted this tongue-in-cheek description of the grownup toy on its website: 'The Citizen Brick Center for the Performing Arts is place where dreamers can dream, and dancers can dance. And dream. And also dance.’ The attention to detail is impressive: from plastic dollar bills scattered around the podium to the strippers' fishnet stockings and clear plastic pumps, this set has got it all. The decor at the Foxy Blox is classic nudy bar circa 1970s, complete with a 'Girls Girls Girls' poster on the wall, zebra-printed couches and pink leopard-printed floors. A series of colorful hologram foil printed paintings and a palm tree in the corner add a touch of class to the establishment. The set comes with four minifigs: two scantily clad female strippers, a mustachioed male performer with a bow tie a la Magic Mike and a pompadour coif, and a DJ in sunglasses positioned behind a turntable. Make it rain: To make the Foxy Blox club feel like a real strip joint, the toy makers included a pile of plastic dollar bills . Something for everyone: The Foxy Blox is an equal opportunity strip club where hairy-chested, mustachioed performers are just as welcome as buxom female entertainers . Supporting characters: No jiggly joint would be complete without a DJ who knows his way around a turntable . Pricey present: The Lego-inspired sets are available to pre-order for $275 . The adult play set is currently available to pre-order on Citizen Brick's site for $275. In an effort to avoid any confusion (or trademark lawsuits), the plucky Chicago manufacturer posted a disclaimer online making it clear that they are not affiliated with the Danish toy giant The LEGO Group. ‘Our friends at Lego asked that we remind you... “This is not a LEGO® Product. These are re-used LEGO elements that have been repackaged or altered from their original form,’ the notice reads.","Chicago-based Citizen Brick is selling a play set featuring a strip club scene .

"The Princeton graduate charged with murdering his hedge fund father may inherit a portion of his $1.6 million will. The will of Thomas Gilbert Sr., filed in a Manhattan court on Wednesday, says Thomas Gilbert Jr., 30, should receive quarterly payments from a trust in his name until he’s 35 and then he'll receive the remaining amount in a lump sum. The New York Post reports that the will splits the $1.6 million between Gilbert Sr.'s charged son Thomas Gilbert Jr., his wife Shelley Rea Gilbert, and his daughter Claire Stevens Gilbert. Tommy Gilbert Jr. appeared bedraggled and do wncast in his orange, Department of Corrections jumpsuit as he was indicted  on Friday at Manhattan Criminal Court . Estate attorney William Zabel said that inheritance following a death or even a murder is a 'real gray area.' The intent of the killing comes into play when deciding whether Gilbert Jr. gets the cash or not and even if he is found guilty it will need to be proven that the murder was 'intentional or reckless.' 'Say they were scuffling over the gun and it’s not premeditated, then he could still inherit,' Zabel said. If Gilbert Jr. pleads insanity he could also seek to inherit the large sum of money. The Post reports that Gilbert Junior's defense attorney could even petition the estate to cover his legal fees. Gilbert Jr. is accused of executing his 70-year-old father in his bedroom on January 4 and then staging the body to make it look like suicide . Court papers say Gilbert Sr. had $50,000 in bank accounts, $477,000 in hedge funds, $1 million in private equity shares and $100,000 in property when he died. The estate documents, signed by Shelley on January 13 made a slight reference to possible father-son discord. 'A delay is expected in connection with the admission of the will to probate and the issuance of letters testamentary, as process must issue to the decedent’s son, a distributee, who is unavailable to execute a waiver and consent,' the papers state. On Wednesday Shelley applied for her husband’s funds so that she could pay her household bills. Gilbert said nothing as he nodded in response to a judge's questions. He appeared alongside Alex Spiro (left), a Harvard-educated criminal defense lawyer who has been hired to represent him . Gilbert Jr. Will return back to court in February and was in court just last week. Tommy Gilbert Jr appeared bedraggled and downcast as he stood before a judge in his orange prison jumpsuit last week to be indicted over the fatal shooting of  his multimillionaire father. The Princeton grad, with his hands cuffed behind his back, said nothing and nodded in response to the judge's questions during the short appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court during the last minutes of Friday afternoon's session. He did not enter a plea. The 30-year-old, his 6-foot-3, broad frame hunched in a padded, Department of Corrections jacket, appeared unshaven and his blond, surfer locks unwashed. He stood in court alongside defense attorney Alex Spiro, a Harvard-educated criminal  lawyer from one of the city's top firms. It's not clear who is paying Spiro's fee. Gilbert Jr was being held without bail at Rikers Island while he awaits trial and is due back in court on February 5. The charges will be made public at that hearing. A grand jury voted to indict him on Friday over the death of his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, boss of $200million Wainscott Capital Partners. The New York Medical Examiner's office confirmed to Daily Mail Online  Thursday that Gilbert Sr. died of a gunshot wound. The death of Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70,  was ruled a homicide on Thursday after he suffered a gunshot wound to the head . An autopsy ruled his cause of death as a homicide. Gilbert Jr.'s lawyer, told reporters outside the court hearing: 'No statement in light of the recent tragedy and no comment from the family.' Mr Spiro works for Brafman and Associates, one of New York's most prestigious criminal law firms. Benjamin Brafman, the founder of the firm, successfully defended Dominique Strauss-Kahn and - most recently civil rights lawyer Sanford Rubenstein. Mr Spiro has a Harvard law degree and worked for the CIA and as a New York Assistant District Attorney before going into private practice. Thomas Gilbert Sr was found dead by his wife in the bedroom of his luxury midtown apartment on January 4, shot once in the head. Gilbert Jr. had allegedly tried to stage the body to make it look like a suicide - placing the .40-caliber Glock pistol on his chest. Gilbert Jr. allegedly murdered his father after he cut the 30-year-old's allowance from $600 a week to $400 and threatened to stop paying the rent on his $2,400-a-month Chelsea apartment, according to authorities. Police found a case for the weapon, as well as extra magazines and ammunition at Gilbert Jr.'s apartment when they broke down the door and found him hiding out there on Sunday night around 10.30pm. He was arrested on murder charges the following day. Investigators also discovered a skimming device - used for stealing credit card numbers - and 21 blank credit cards inside the ground-floor home. Gilbert Jr. is also the main suspect in a September blaze that destroyed a historic Hamptons mansion that belonged to the family of a former friend-turned love rival, according to multiple reports. The New York Post reported that Gilbert Jr. burned down the home belonging to the family of Peter Smith Jr. because he believed Smith was sleeping with his girlfriend. Three days after the blaze - which razed the 19th-century mansion - Gilbert Jr. was arrested by Southampton police for violating a protective order taken out by Smith Jr. He was later released on bail, though that trial remains ongoing. He has not been charged with any crime related to the fire. Gilbert appeared calm but said nothing as he appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday before being remanded to Rikers over the shooting death of his father, Thomas Gilbert Sr . Medical examiners carry away the body of Thomas Gilbert Sr. from his apartment, where he was shot dead in his bedroom . Gilbert Jr., was a fixture at New York society events - often seen with a different women on his arm at charity galas and parties. But he was jobless, and didn't seem to have any interest in finding serious employment - despite graduating from Princeton University with a degree in economics. Instead, friends said, he was a yoga enthusiast and gym rat who spent most of his time at his family's $10million Hamptons home, where he enjoyed surfing. Gilbert Sr. was a longtime Wall Street fixture, who ran the $200million hedge fund Wainscott Capital. His son's ex girlfriend, twice-divorced Manhattan socialite Anna Rothschild, 49, said Tommy was obsessed with his father. He frequently complained about how controlling he was with money and said that his father was hard on him. Gilbert Jr. said he was upset because 'nothing he ever did was good enough' for his dad, Ms Rothschild said. Friends and family said that Gilbert Jr. suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder that had become more severe in recent years and made his behavior increasingly erratic. When he went to his parents' apartment on January 4 to confront his father, he sent his 70-year-old mother out and get him a sandwich and a soda. When she was gone, he is believed to have killed his father, investigators say. His mother, Shelley, returned 15 minutes later because she had a 'bad feeling' and found her husband had been executed. Gilbert Jr.'s eyes appeared blood-shot and his long surfer locks were unwashed after spending nearly a week behind bars . Gilbert Jr. ex Anna Rothschild, 49, said he was obsessed with his father and how he was 'never good enough' for his dad's lofty expections . Gilbert Jr. (seen left in his Princeton school picture) arrived at his parents' apartment on January 4 and promptly sent his mother Shelley (right) out to get him a sandwich.

"House Speaker John Boehner credited a controversial government surveillance program on Thursday for helping uncover an alleged plot by an Ohio man to bomb the U.S. Capitol and kill government officials. 'The first thing that strikes me is that we would have never known about this had it not been for the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] program and our ability to collect information on people who pose an imminent threat.' He addressed the topic during a news conference at a retreat of Republican lawmakers in Hershey, Pennsylvania. FISA allows the FBI to obtain search warrants and communications intercepts in intelligence cases, subject to the approval of a specialized and secretive court. Scroll down for video . House Speaker John Boehner (left) spoke alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (right) on Monday, saying he credited the secretive FISA program for thwarting an early-stage bombing plot aimed at the US Capitol building . This Jan. 14, 2015 photo made available by the Butler County Jail shows Christopher Lee Cornell, who plotted to attack the Capitol and kill government officials inside it – and said he wanted to support the ISIS terror army . 'I'm going to see this one more time because you will hear about for months and months to come as we attempt to reauthorize the FISA program,' Boehner said. 'Our government does not spy on Americans, unless they are Americans who are doing things that frankly tip off our law enforcement officials to an imminent threat. It was our law enforcement officials and those programs that helped us stop this person before he committed a heinous crime in our nation's capital.' 'We live in a dangerous country,' Boehner said, 'and we get reminded every week of the dangers that are out there. We saw what happened in Paris a week ago.' He declined to dwell on a separate case, involving a man with a history of psychiatric illness who was charged last week with threatening to murder him, possibly by poisoning his drink. 'My personal situation, I'm not going to get into it,' Boehner said, 'but, you know, it's one thing to get a threat from far away. It's another when it's three doors from where you live.' 'Obviously, this young man has got some health issues, mental health issues, that need to be addressed, and I hope he gets the help that he needs.' It is somewhat unusual for officials to publicly disclose investigative techniques. Government officials say Cornell's suspected terror plot was in the early stages of development and posed no immediate threat to lawmakers and Capitol staff, but they took him down out of an abundance of caution . But Boehner said he was mentioning FISA deliberately in the investigation of Christopher Lee Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, because it must be renewed by Congress soon. Cornell was arrested Wednesday after buying two semi-automatic rifles and about 600 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. The public was never in danger, said John Barrios, acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Cincinnati division. A criminal complaint filed in the case indicates that a confidential informant brought Cornell to the FBI's attention in the fall of 2014, after the two began communicating over Twitter. It is possible the FBI obtained search and surveillance warrants aimed at Cornell under FISA, but the criminal complaint doesn't say so.","The Ohio Republican credited the FISA courts and secret government snooping for uncovering the plot .
Program allows intrusive surveillance subject to a specialized court system, and is due to be renewed soon by Congress .

"The staff at a car dealership who decided to post a video in which they shame a pizza delivery man are now getting a taste of their own medicine. Workers who have been identified as employees at F & R Auto Sales in Westport, Massachusetts, made a worker from Palace Pizza return and give them back their tip after they claimed that he just ran off with the money. Making the entire thing even more cruel is the fact that they gave him two twenties and two fives on a bill of $42, making it seem clear that the extra money was for him - something he even confirmed with the workers.

'It just doesn’t make sense why you’d hand me a bill that you were just gonna have me drive back here to give you back anyway,' Tansey says in the video. 'I’m not mad, I just had to waste my resources coming back here.' At this point, the ringleader of the group says to him; 'So listen: The manager apologized once for you. Do you want him to apologize again for you?' Tansey decides to leave at this point, and as he does the woman in the office can be heard saying; 'Out the door before I put my foot in your ass.' Another man in the office says; 'Get the f***ing owner and the manager on the phone, I want that motherf***er done.' He then adds, 'I want him fired.' 'So listen: The manager apologized once for you.

"Two murderous rapists will be put to death today at executions in Oklahoma and Florida. Charles Warner, who raped and killed an 11-month-old baby girl, will today become the first Oklahoma inmate to be put to death since the botched execution of Clayton Lockett. Lockett writhed on the gurney, moaning and trying to lift his head after he had been declared unconscious, prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony. The same three-drug method will be used on Warner and Florida death row inmate Shane Kormondy, who shot a man in the head before raping his wife. Scroll down for video . Charles Warner (left) is set to be executed today in Oklahoma for the rape and murder of a baby girl, while Shane Kormondy (right) faces the death penalty in Florida for killing a man and raping his wife . Warner, whose execution was delayed by nearly nine months after Lockett's death, will face the lethal injection at 6pm (CST) for raping and killing 11-month-old Adrianna Waller in 1997. Despite the obvious suffering Lockett went through, the same lethal cocktail of drugs will be used on Warner and Kormondy. Kormondy, who, along with two accomplices, killed a man in 1993 with a gunshot to the back of his head and raped his wife, will be executed an hour earlier in Florida. He wants his sentence to be reduced to life in prison as that is what his accomplices are serving. Both Oklahoma and Florida plan to start the executions with the sedative midazolam, which was used in Lockett's botched execution. Midazolam has been challenged in court as ineffective in rendering a person properly unconscious before the second and third drugs are administered, creating a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering. Attorneys for Oklahoma say a failed intravenous line and a lack of training led to the problems with Lockett's injection, not the drugs. Warner and three other death row inmates have filed a petition with the Supreme Court, calling for their executions to be called off. Oklahoma's last execution saw murderer Clayton Lockett writhe and moan in the gurney after he was declared unconscious . The same three-drug method used on Lockett, involving sedative midazolam, will be used on Warner . The appeal states: 'There is a well-established scientific consensus that [midazolam] cannot maintain a deep, comalike unconsciousness.' Clayton Lockett moaned and tried to lift his head, prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony . Oklahoma has increased the amount of midazolam to be used by five times to mirror the recipe used in 11 successful executions in Florida. But the drug was used in other botched executions in Arizona and Ohio last year, where inmates snorted and gasped after lethal injections. Oklahoma has ordered new medical equipment such as backup IV lines and an ultrasound machine for finding veins and has renovated the execution chamber with new audio and video equipment to help the execution team spot potential problems. Last year Shonda Waller, the mother of the raped and murdered baby, told KFOR that she did not want Warner to be executed. She said: 'I don’t want to see him to be sentenced to death. 'If they truly want to honor me then they will do away with the death penalty for him and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole because that’s the only thing that’s going to honor me. 'I don’t see any justice in just sentencing someone to die. 'To me, the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you to your family, and having to live with that the rest of their life knowing they will never get to walk out those doors.'","Two men guilty of rape and murder will be executed in Oklahoma and Florida today .

"Helicopter parents - those who meddle too much in the lives of their children - can often be an annoyance for kids as they attempt to become independent adults. But a study says that such methods can actually be advantageous when rearing pets, specifically cats and dogs. The study found that neurotic parents took better care of their pets - with 'cat people' said to be more anxious, and dog people being described as more extroverted. Scroll down for video . A study by the University of California, Berkely examined personality traits of pet owners. They found that cat people (stock image shown) were more creative and dog owners were more extroverted. But both were overbearing when it came to their pets - a trait that is usually an annoyance for children . The research was carried out by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and published in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science. They conducted a web-based survey of more than 1,000 pet owners nationwide to analyse the key personality traits and nurturing styles of people who identified as a 'cat person,' a 'dog person,' 'both' or 'neither.' Surprisingly, those who expressed the greatest affection for their pets also rated among the most conscientious and neurotic. Last year a study by Carroll University, Wisconsin found that cat owners scored more highly on an intelligence test than dog owners. Dog lovers tend to be more energetic and outgoing than cat owners and follow rules more obediently. Speaking at the annual Association for Psychological Science meeting in Chicago, psychology professor Denise Guastello said that cat owners are more introverted, sensitive and open-minded than dog people. They also tend to be better at breaking rules. She thinks that the reason for these differences if the types of environment that cat and dog owners are drawn to. This suggests that the qualities that make for overbearing parents might work better for our domesticated canine and feline companions, who tend to require lifelong parenting. The results echo those of a 2010 study by University of Texas psychologist Dr Sam Gosling, a UC Berkeley graduate. He showed dog owners to be more extroverted, but less open to new experiences, and cat owners to be more neurotic, but also more creative and adventurous. 'The fact that higher levels of neuroticism are associated with affection and anxious attachment suggests that people who score higher on that dimension may have high levels of affection and dependence on their pets, which may be a good thing for pets,' said Mikel Delgado, a doctoral student in psychology at UC Berkeley and co-author of the study. Previous studies have focused on people's attachment to their pets. But this is the first US study to incorporate the principles of human attachment theory - which assesses the bond between parents and children or between romantic partners - with pet owners' personality types, including whether they identify as a 'dog person' or 'cat person.' It is also the first to find a positive correlation between neuroticism, anxious attachment and the care of and affection for pets, said California State University East Bay psychologist Dr Gretchen Reevy, co-author of the paper and a graduate of UC Berkeley. The researchers conducted a web-based survey of more than 1,000 pet owners nationwide (stock image shown) to analyse the key personality traits and nurturing styles of people who identified as a 'cat person,' a 'dog person,' 'both' or 'neither' in order to make their findings . The researchers recruited male and female pet owners of all ages through the Craigslist classified advertising website, their personal Facebook pages and pet-related pages on the Reddit news and social networking site. Nearly 40 per cent of those surveyed said they liked dogs and cats equally, while 38 per cent identified as dog people and 19 per cent as cat people. A mere three per cent favored neither. People were also asked to answer questions on their own personality traits. Those who scored high on anxious attachment tended to need more reassurance from the objects of their affection, and in the survey those tended to be younger people who chose a cat as their favourite pet. Both cat and dog lovers also appeared to require close attention with their pets, suggesting they spent a lot of time with them and were 'needy'. The researchers plan to dig more deeply into the link between neuroticism and affection for and dependence on one's pet. 'We will investigate further whether greater affection for and greater anxious attachment to one's pet, and neuroticism, are associated with better care and understanding of the pet's needs,' Dr Reevy said.","Study by University of California examined personality traits of pet owners .

"Sydney may boast acclaimed restaurants like Tetsuya’s and Sokyo, but there’s one Japanese dining experience the city has been sorely lacking-until now. For two nights in February, the sensory-overloading Robot Restaurant is appearing in Australia as a popup experience. Leading travel brand Contiki is organising the surreal dinner-and-show in a bid to bring a unique taste of Japan down under. The event, titled Robots Unrivalled, will be a theatrical barrage of neon-lights, fembots and cabaret performances that transports diners into a mind-boggling robotic future. Scroll down for video . A robot-tank takes to the stage accompanied by a grinning dancers clad in metallic bikinis. For two nights in February, the sensory-overloading Robot Restaurant is appearing in Australia . Scantily-clad women dance at the Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku, Japan. The restaurant is coming to Australia for a two-day popup event . Leading travel brand Contiki is organising the surreal dinner-and-show in a bid to bring a unique taste of Japan down under . The sci-fi eatery has amassed a cult following in Japan for its out-of-this-world appeal, and with good cause; where else can you enjoy a meal watching bikini-clad women dance with robot pandas? Maybe you’d prefer the transformer-esque robots going toe to toe in a boxing? Or android dinosaurs dancing to techno amid a bombardment of lasers? In another segment, girls dressed as rave bunnies play along to the frantic music in a synchronised drum line. To help immerse diners in the experience, LED bikini-clad waitresses will be serving cocktails to your tables. There truly is something for everyone, though a word of warning: epileptics should probably not be touching the event with a ten-foot pole. The official website for the Sydney event has the following description: 'Expect amazing dance routines set to thumping J-Pop beats, more fluorescent lights and lasers than should ever be allowed in one place and of course… HUGE FREAKING ROBOTS doing battle in an attempt to destroy mankind once and for all!' Diners are given glow sticks to wave at the performers throughout the robot cabaret . In another segment, girls dressed as rave bunnies play along to the frantic music in a synchronised drum line . It’s being hosted by popular travel brand Contiki in conjunction with their 13 day Japan Unrivalled trip, a bid to bring a unique taste of Japan down under. The Robot Restaurant was launched in 2012 in Shinjuku’s Kabukicho area, a prominent red-light district. With reports it cost some $10 million to construct, nearly every surface of the club is decorated in lights, mirrors, or flat panel monitors. It has since earned a reputation with locals and tourists alike as being an otherworldly experience. While it is deemed a restaurant, the food reportedly takes a backseat to the performance, with diners being served a simple bento box akin to what is found in Japanese convenience stores.

"A high-flying estate agent has been told she faces jail after stealing £1.3million from her firm and used it to fund a luxury lifestyle of private planes and exotic holidays. Karen Chin, who worked as the financial controller of upmarket estate agents Hurford Salvi Carr in Clerkenwell, central London, diverted clients' money into her own account between 2008 and 2013. The 45-year-old, who earned £38,000-a-year, stole a total of £1.3million after making 304 payments into her own bank accounts - taking an average of £260,000 a year over a five year period. Karen Chin, who worked as the financial controller of upmarket estate agents Hurford Salvi Carr in Clerkenwell, central London (pictured) has been told she faces jail after stealing £1.3million from her firm . Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Chin, who lived in a £1.5million house in Highgate, north London, spent the money on flash watches, handbags, clothes and jewellery - as well as luxury holidays. The court heard how she even chartered a private plane as well as splashing out £35,000 on a luxury family holiday to Mauritius. David Markham, prosecuting, said Chin had worked at the firm since 1999, but was sacked in June 2013 after she was suspected of stealing from client accounts. Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Chin, who lived in a £1.5million house  in Highgate, north London, spent the money on flash watches, handbags, clothes and jewellery - as well as luxury holidays . 'She was trusted with the company chequebook and all the online payments, but an audit report revealed she had been dishonestly siphoning off client account funds into her own accounts,' he said. 'She was authorised to make payments and transfers and was a co-signatory with the directors of the company.' Chin is accused to moving the cash to 'secret accounts' after she was sacked - and now faces an investigation to locate the missing money under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Judge David Richardson told Chin, who admitted nine counts of fraud between February 2008 and February 2013, that she was facing an 'inevitable prison term'. The court heard how Chin even chartered a private plane and splashing out £35,000 on a luxury family holiday to Mauritius (file photo) He told her: 'You are plainly going to prison and the only question is for how long. I want to know what you have done with the money and if it is true you have been shifting assets.' He remanded her in custody ahead of sentencing on February 13, telling her: 'I have no intention of leaving you outside prison where you may cause further mischief in relation to your assets.' A spokesman for Hurford Salvi Carr said: 'An audit carried out in 2013 identified a number of accounting irregularities. 'These were reported to the police and have culminated in a former employee pleading guilty to nine counts of fraud at Blackfriars Court. No financial losses were incurred by clients, tenants or third parties.'","Karen Chin, 45, was the financial controller of Hurford Salvi Carr .

"Kevin Pietersen is a man notorious for his tattoos, and the former England international cricketer has inked his body once more... this time with a map of the world. In a picture posted on his Instagram site, the South African-born batsman showed off his new design, stretching from his chest around to his back. The map, which Pietersen insists is not the wrong way around - 'just the reflection!' - has red stars on certain places around the globe... but what exactly do they signify? Kevin Pietersen posted a picture of him getting the tattoo, as he takes a break from the Big Bash League . 'It isn't the wrong way around. It's just the reflection'... Pietersen reassures fans that his tattoo of a map of the world isn't inaccurate. Each red star indicates somewhere Pietersen has scored an international century .

UK (1) Riverside Ground, Chester-le-Street . India (1) Barabati Stadium, Cuttack . Each mark represents a place that Pietersen has scored an international century for England - be it Test or ODI - including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Pakistan and Australia. He has scored 32 international tons, 23 of those in Test matches for England over a career spanning nearly nine years. Pietersen made his Test debut in an Ashes triumph in 2005, scoring his maiden ton in the final Test at The Oval - noted by a red star on his rib. Pietersen, celebrating England's Ashes victory in 2005, shows off his Three Lions tattoo to fans . The batsman is well-known for his tattoos; on his bicep he marks the first three of his four Ashes victories . He finished the series as top scorer, with 473 runs over the five Tests - and a highest average of 52.55 too. There are seven countries in which Pietersen has scored a Test century - England, Australia, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Pakistan, India and the West Indies - while South Africa and the UAE are added to his tattoo with ODI hundreds. Before it was clear what the stars indicated, an initial theory was that they marked locations in which Pietersen has played cricket; a missing star in the Melbourne area dispelled that particular idea. Indeed, Pietersen is currently plying his trade in southern Australia, in the Big Bash League for Melbourne Stars. There is a star in Adelaide, the location of Pietersen's England centuries in 2006 and 2010, but not in the far south of Melbourne. Pietersen himself fuelled the speculation on Thursday morning when he tweeted: 'Work the stars out yourself on my last Instagram post!' Pietersen congratulates his Melbourne Stars team-mate Glenn Maxwell as he reaches 50 in the Big Bash . Pietersen bats for Melbourne Stars against Melbourne Renegades on January 10, where he scored 49 . The batsman is currently averaging 39 runs across five innings in the Big Bash for the Stars, who sit fourth of eight in the standings. And it appears Pietersen is enjoying his time down under, finding himself a 'superstar tattooist' in Melbourne. In his autobiography, the 34-year-old was honest in his assessment of his tattoos, admitting that he 'overplayed his Englishness' in getting Three Lions inked on his shoulder. Lets hope he doesn't feel the same way about his new addition in years to come. Pietersen spent almost nine years playing international cricket for England, scoring 32 centuries overall .

"If you’re rarely without your smartphone, then chances are that it’s teeming with bacteria - as seen in this collection of alarming photos. In many cases, this bacteria is relatively harmless and comes from touching unclean surfaces or not washing your hands properly. But in others, the bacteria found can lead to infections such as food poisoning, impetigo and even septicaemia. Scroll down for video . Students from the University of Surrey imprinted their phones into Petri dishes (pictured) containing so-called ‘bacterial growth medium’. After three days, they studied the bacteria that had grown in the dishes . To study the level of dirt on a person’s phone, students studying bacteriology at the University of Surrey imprinted their mobile phones on to so-called ‘bacterial growth medium’ in Petri dishes. After three days, they studied the bacteria that had grown in the dishes - and were shocked by what they discovered. Staphylococcus aureus: It is thought that 20% of people are long-term carriers of the bug, which often lurks inside nasal passages. Many healthy people carry it on their skin and in their noses without getting sick. But when skin is punctured or broken, staph bacteria can enter the wound and cause infections. It is a common cause of Staph infections including food poisoning, impetigo and even septicaemia. Bacillus mycoides: This bacteria is typically found in soil, which suggests the phone or its user had been in contact with soil recently. Bacillus mycoides are found in common pesticides and are used to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi.

"Jonathan Evans, 50, has been put on the Sex Offender Register after he thrust his crotch in a woman's face, pictured at Manchester Crown Court . A married father-of-two has been put on the Sex Offender Register after he thrust his crotch in a woman's face and then forcefully groped her bottom at a crowded pub. Former Royal Navy weapons expert Jonathan Evans, 50, asked a woman to bend down to pick up a train ticket, then grabbed her head and simulated oral sex in front of onlookers. On the same evening, the Barnardo's volunteer groped the woman's bottom while she was at the bar of a Wetherspoons pub in Manchester and rammed his finger through her skirt. He has been handed a three-year community order and must pay a £60 victim surcharge after being found guilty of two counts of sexual assault in an earlier trial at Manchester Crown Court. The victim did not complain on the night of the assault but subsequently went to police and described feeling 'stupid, gullible and worthless.' In an interview the woman said: 'He grabbed the back of my head by the hair and pushed my face in his private parts and started moving. I couldn't get up. 'I was probably only down there a couple of seconds but it felt a lot longer. I was angry and embarrassed and ashamed. He'd done it front of people, and just the fact he thought it was alright to do that. I remember being angry at myself for being upset.' Prosecutor Gavin Howie told the court how the trouble started on a night out in July 2013 when Evans got drunk and picked on the woman at Wetherspoons Picadilly while waiting to get a train home. He said: 'At some point the defendant appears to have indicated a ticket on the floor. He invited her to pick it up. She did bend to pick it up where Mr Evans took hold of the back of her head, thrust his groin in her face and simulated oral sex with her. 'She describes it as humiliating and degrading. There was another incident a short while he put his hand behind her. He accepts there was some boisterous horseplay and the first incident was a laddish prank.' Describing the second attack the woman said: 'I remember he did it with a lot of force and that it was painful. It sounds really stupid, but he did it quite fast and in exactly the right place - I remember thinking, how did he know it was there? 'I was blaming myself for being stupid and decided to get really, really drunk, and it was more or less the day after I was just, really, really upset.' He has been handed a three-year community order and must pay a £60 victim surcharge after being found guilty of two counts of sexual assault at an earlier trial at Manchester Crown Court . Evans, who was sacked by Barnardos after being convicted, continues to protest his innocence, saying the first incident was 'horseplay', and claiming the second didn't happen. The father from Ramsbottom, near Bury sobbed as a female judge told him he had escaped jail 'by a whisker' Judge Lindsey Kushner QC told him: 'I have had so many references and letters of support and I don't think I have had a trial with so many. 'They say whatever you are accused of doesn't fit the man they know. All these people say what you were accused of is out of character. But as we do now know: there is another side to Jonathan Evans, which they have not born witness to. 'I can't emphasise enough that when people like you indulge in such conduct, even if you regard it as mild or funny, it is up to the recipient to decide whether that conduct is acceptable or not. The problem is that in this situation it is often the recipient that feels they are in the wrong if they are made to feel uncomfortable. 'They have to think, 'am I making a fuss about nothing?' they are made to feel it is their fault because they are lacking a sense of humour and failing to see the funny side. 'When I came to this courtroom I came ready and prepared to send you to prison. I can do so without losing one minute's sleep as a result. 'Although I think you probably deserve a prison sentence I'm going to err on the side of hopefully instilling some rehabilitation. I think this has really hit you hard, because you are egotistical. I think you need to show you are a worthy man and you are not. You have escaped prison by a whisker.' Evans had called character witnesses including a BA pilot, research scientist and a teacher to testify he was a 'pillar of their community' and a 'really decent man'. In court the father-of-two showed jurors the 'forward thrusting motion' he used to play his prank. But he insisted: 'It was a stupid, laddish, impulsive thing - I went 'wahey' and I may well have put my hand on her head or her neck, I certainly didn't grab her hair. I lurched forward towards her face. 'It was not meant in any way as a sexual assault - I would never do that. It was meant as a stupid prank  with someone I thought would have just laughed it off. I bitterly regret what I did. I'm sorry for what I did and I'm sorry that I have caused my poor wife to suffer.'","Jonathan Evans, 50, grabbed a woman's head and 'simulated oral sex'

"After 12 days of carrying a winning lottery ticket worth a staggering $2.7 million in her handbag, a NSW woman has stepped forward to claim her prize. NSW Lotteries had been searching for the lucky owner of the winning ticket, which was purchased in Wagga Wagga, since the January 3rd draw. The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, was on holidays when she and her husband bought the ticket at Hunters Newsagency, 68 Fitzmaurice Street. Scroll down for video . After 12 days of carrying a winning lottery ticket worth a staggering $2.7 million in her handbag, a NSW woman has stepped forward to claim her prize . 'My husband and I had been visiting Wagga Wagga', she said, when she asked her husband to buy a Lotto ticket when he bought a newspaper. The woman and her husband will now be able to top up their bank account with $2.72 million, their share of the $30 Million Megadraw. Belinda McDougall, spokesperson for NSW Lotteries, said that it is not unusual for winners to take a few days to come forward to claim their prize. 'It does happen from time to time that people take several days, or in this case twelve days, to come forward,' Ms McDougall said. 'We always encourage our customers to register their tickets to their players cards, so rather than having to discover that they're a winner, we get to break the news that they've won,' she said. 'It's pretty nice to break the news to people, and it's wonderful for people to come forward like this and start 2015 as a multimillionaire.' The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, was on holidays when she and her husband bought the ticket at Hunters Newsagency, 68 Fitzmaurice Street . NSW Lotteries had been searching for the lucky owner of the winning ticket, which was purchased in Wagga Wagga, since the January 3rd draw . The couple have plans to pay off their mortgage, and the woman said she would consider moving to part time work because of the windfall. Apart from paying off their mortgage, the woman said she'll probably now only work part time rather than full time. In November a Canberra family took a week to claim their  $30 million jackpot after buying the ticket in Woden. 'I was finishing off my Christmas shopping today and saw a sign at the outlet urging customers to check their entries because they'd sold the $30 million winning Oz Lotto ticket,' she told The ABC. 'I thought I'd better check my entry but I never considered that I actually had the winning ticket,' she said. 'I never win anything.' The family also said they would pay off their mortgage, donate some of their winnings to charity, and were entertaining ideas of flying first-class on their next family holiday.

"Friends of a missing 27-year-old man who launched a massive search effort to find him have been ordered by a government agency to take down posters of his face because they can damage signs and distract drivers. Dane Kowalski hasn't been seen since he withdrew $800 from his bank and left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin. His friends and family have spent the past month retracing his steps from Melbourne to Darwin looking for signs of Dane and putting up hundreds of missing person posters along the way. Scroll down for video . Dane Kowalski (front) hasn't been seen since he withdrew $800 from his bank and left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin . But in a strange move, the search team received a letter from the Northern Territory roads department on Wednesday ordering them to remove the posters from its highways. 'It has been brought to my attention that you have posted a number of posters to road signs and other furniture within the Northern Territory Road Reserve,' the letter read. 'This damages our signs and has the potential to endanger the motoring public. 'I request the immediate removal of all signs from NTG assets and to cease the placement of any further signage on this furniture. 'Non-compliance with this request may result in the removal of these by NTG contractors and cost recovery from responsible parties.' His friends and family have spent the past month retracing his steps from Melbourne to Darwin looking for signs of Dane and putting up hundreds of missing person posters along the way . Dane's search group continue to search the Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria - they have vowed not to stop until they find the 27-year-old . It has left the group, who are using the hashtag #FindDane on social media, feeling 'disgusted'. 'This is absolutely ridiculous... obviously we are not going to take them down,' Dane's friend, Chris Carrig, told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're not bowing down to threats. 'It's been pretty hard to take and really disheartening to think someone is basically going against us on this considering the circumstances.' The signs put up by the group are smaller than road signs and are made of cardboard or plywood. 'If he's up there, people driving are going to see the signs over and over... that's what will stick in their head,' Mr Carrig said. A spokeswoman for the department told the ABC some of the posters had obscured speed and other signs and they would have to be taken down. But they have since backed down and said they would not seek to recover the costs to have the posters removed. The department will now repost the signs in other areas, the spokeswoman said.

One of Dane's best friends, who has been friends with him since the age of 12, is so desperate to find him that he has offered a $25,000 reward from his own pocket for any information. Brittany Taylor, the partner of Dane's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry. 'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then (December 12); his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said. 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in. 'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.'

Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him. 'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's okay. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home,' Ms Taylor said.

"A 16-year-old thug who murdered the father-to-be who escorted him home from a drunken night out has been told he will spend at least 15 years behind bars. An intoxicated Connor Doughton had already tried to fight a nightclub bouncer and had hurled abuse at a woman on the street when Michael-Lee Emmett and John Williams decided to walk him back to his parents' house in Blackwood, South Wales. But once home, troubled Doughton ran to the kitchen to grab a knife, before heading outside where he stabbed both Mr Emmett and Mr Williams. Connor Doughton, 16, (left) who murdered Michael-Lee Emmett, 29,  (right) after the father-of-three escorted him home from a drunken night out, has been told he will spend at least 15 years behind bars . Mr Emmett, who was knifed in the stomach, died four weeks later after having to undergo a liver transplant. Mr Williams survived but suffered a serious stab wound to his back. Judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said an aggravating feature of the offence was that 29-year-old Mr Emmett had been profoundly distressed while doctors tried to save his life at a specialist hospital unit in London. She also said Mr Emmett's daughter Lola-Grace, who was born just days before his death on September 2, had been robbed of the chance to get to know her father, who also left behind twin boys, Logan and Riley. Sentencing Doughton, Mrs Justice Davies also lifted reporting restrictions which had previously prevented him from being named. She told the teenager: 'Neither victim did anything to provoke the stabbing. They were doing what they could to take you home, away from any trouble, realising that you were in aggressive frame of mind. Mr Emmett, pictured with his partner Natalie Preece and their twin sons Logan and Riley, now eight, died four weeks after the stabbing, having had to undergo a liver transplant . 'Nothing they said or did could justify your taking of a knife - still less pursuing them down the road and in turn stabbing each of them. 'In taking the life of Michael Emmett you have robbed twin boys aged eight of their father. 'Lola, his daughter, born when her father was critically ill in King's College Hospital, London, will never know him. 'Michael was excited about his daughter's birth and looking forward to this special event. 'His partner, Natalie Preece, not only lost her much-loved partner and father of her children, she lost a source of strength and support within this close family. Mr Emmett's daughter Lola-Grace was born two days before he died, while he was in a coma. She is pictured just after she was born, holding her father's hand. Mr Emmett also left behind two young sons (right) Judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told Doughton that in taking Mr Emmett's life he had 'robbed twin boys aged eight of their father'. The boys are pictured with their parents during a family holiday in 2010 . 'Their losses are devastating; such remorse as you have demonstrated has been limited.' The incident unfolded on August 1 last year after Mr Emmett and Mr Williams had been smoking outside the Stonehouse pub in Cefn Fforest. Doughton, a long-time family friend of Mr Williams, was walking along the road and told the pair he had been 'scrapping with bouncers'. An aggressive Doughton then lost his temper after being told to stop being abusive to a nearby woman. After Doughton tried to fight Mr Emmett and Mr Williams, the pair decided to take him back home to his father in a bid to prevent any further trouble. Ms Preece at Cardiff Crown Court. After Mrs Justice Davies completed her sentencing, more than 50 members of Mr Emmett's family and friends applauded from the public gallery . Mrs Justice Davies said: 'As the three of you approached your home, you ran from the two men and went through the front door. 'John Williams and Michael-Lee Emmett turned around and began walking back to the Stonehouse pub. Within a short time you exited the back door and began shouting at Mr Williams and Mr Emmett. Your family were trying to calm you down. 'Unbeknown to the two men in the road, when in the house you had gone in to the kitchen and picked up a kitchen knife. 'Once outside, you approached Mr Emmett and stabbed him in the abdomen, causing a penetrating injury to his liver.' Mr Williams was also stabbed - in the shoulder, arm and lower back, which caused a serious wound to his bladder. 'You subsequently dropped the knife down a drain ... (and) shortly after you were stopped by police,' added Mrs Justice Davies. 'You gave a false name, denied any knowledge of the knife and spat in the face of a policewoman.' An injured Mr Emmett was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, before he was transferred to King's College Hospital when the extent of the injury to his liver was discovered. Following a transplant at the specialist unit, he suffered a 'catastrophic airway bleed' and underwent several painful medical procedures. 'He had an open wound on his stomach that could not be closed, the tracheostomy meant that he was unable to speak,' added Mrs Justice Davies in her sentencing remarks. 'He was attached to a number of machines which caused him distress. 'Until a catastrophic bleed on August 27, Michael Emmett was aware of his surroundings and was distressed by his ill-health.' Mr Emmett's life support was switched off on September 2. The court heard that, although Mr Williams survived, he had been left physically and mentally scarred by the attack. Mrs Justice Davies said: 'He is distressed that a young male he befriended and supported in difficult times had attacked him.' Ms Preece with Logan, Riley and Lola-Grace. The court was told the family's loss had been 'devastating' The court heard in mitigation that Doughton had a low IQ and had had behavioural difficulties since the age of 11. He was also described as having a 'severe conduct disorder' which had been caused by 'genetic factors not associated with poor parenting'. The court was also told that Doughton began a spate of offending in 2013 - including criminal damage, battery and assault, as well as numerous breaches of an Asbo. While Doughton pleaded guilty and his young age was deemed a 'mitigating factor', Mrs Justice Davies decided to make him the subject of a minimum 15-year detention order - three years above the starting point. She added: 'It is important to emphasise the custodial term is not the actual one for which you will be detained. 'It is the minimum you must serve before you can be considered for release by the Parole Board. The time you serve may actually be longer. 'When you are released, you will remain on license for the rest of your life.' For the stabbing of Mr Williams, Doughton was given a 24-month detention and training order - which will run concurrently. After Mrs Justice Davies completed her sentencing, more than 50 members of Mr Emmett's family and friends applauded from the public gallery. Gwent Police Inspector Nicky Brain said the force's thoughts remained with the victims' families. He added: 'The sentence today reflects the seriousness of the crime. I hope it provides all of those involved by this terrible act of violence, a degree of closure to help them move on with their lives.'","Connor Doughton, 16, jailed for murdering Michael-Lee Emmett, 29 .

"Duke University has canceled plans to use the tower of its chapel for a weekly, amplified call to prayer for Muslims - just a day after the idea was announced and following an outcry from a prominent evangelist. The university said on Thursday that Muslims will instead gather on the quadrangle before heading into a room in the chapel for their weekly prayer service. 'Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students,' said Michael Schoenfeld, vice president for public affairs and government relations. Scroll down for video . Duke University has canceled plans to use the tower of its chapel for a weekly, amplified call to prayer for Muslims - just a day after the idea was announced and following an outcry from a prominent evangelist . 'However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect.' Under the canceled plan, members of the school's Muslim Students Association would have recited the call lasting about three minutes from the bell tower. However, the plan drew the ire of evangelist Franklin Graham, the son of the Rev. Billy Graham, who urged Duke alumni to withhold support because of violence against Christians that he attributed to Muslims. He wrote on Facebook that the decision is playing out as 'Christianity is being excluded from the public square.' The chapel is identified by the school as a Christian church but also hosts Hindu services and has been used for Buddhist meditations. The chapel's associate dean for religious life, Christy Lohr Sapp, said before the plans were canceled that the move showed the school's commitment to religious pluralism. The university said on Thursday that Muslims will instead gather on the quadrangle before heading into a room in the chapel for their weekly prayer service . Evangelist Franklin Graham had called for donors and alumni to withhold support for Duke over the initiative . In a column written for the News and Observer in Raleigh, Lohr Sapp acknowledged the headlines generated by violence by extremists in ISIS, Boko Haram and al-Qaida, contrasting it to what's happening on campus. 'Yet, at Duke University, the Muslim community represents a strikingly different face of Islam than is seen on the nightly news: one that is peaceful and prayerful,' she wrote. The private university in Durham, northwest of Raleigh, was founded by Methodists and Quakers, and its divinity school has historically been connected to the United Methodist Church. It has nearly 15,000 students, including about 6,500 undergraduates. The school's insignia features the Christian cross and a Latin motto translated as 'learning and faith.' The university says it has more than 700 students who identify themselves as Muslim, and it hired its first full-time Muslim chaplain in 2009. Muslim students have been holding prayer services in the basement of the chapel for the past two years.","University has canceled plans to use the tower of its chapel for a weekly, amplified call to prayer for Muslims .

"When Alexander and Danielle Meitiv waved goodbye to their children at a Maryland park just before Christmas last year, they thought nothing of letting the youngsters walk a mile home on their own. After all, Rafi, 10, and Dvora, six, had been on three trips together already, walking up to three quarters of a mile from their parents' house in Montgomery County. Alex and Danielle, who describe themselves as 'free-range parents', encouraged them to take the journeys to learn responsibility, build confidence, and teach them about the outside world. But on this occasion the kids made it halfway home before the cops arrived. They took the infants home, Child Protective Services were called, and Alex and Danielle were accused of neglect. Danielle (pictured) says she and husband Alexander often let their children Rafi, ten, and Dvora, six, walk alone to teach them about the world - but they have now been accused of neglect . Alexander was asked to sign a form saying he wouldn't let the children go out unsupervised and initially refused, but was told that Rafi and Dvora could be taken away otherwise, so he gave in. Workers from Montgomery County Child Protective Services (CPS) even went to their children's school and questioned the youngsters without their parents' knowledge. Alex and Danielle have yet to learn whether any further action will be taken against them, but say whatever happens next, the experience has left them furious. Danielle told the Washington Post: 'I think what CPS considered neglect, we felt was an essential part of growing up and maturing. Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. 'We feel we’re being bullied into a point of view about child-rearing that we strongly disagree with.' The Meitivs are advocates of 'free range parenting', a school of thought set up in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parents', who micro-manage every element of their children's lives in an attempt to keep them safe. Danielle insists that while their hands-off approach may panic some people, in fact she is just trying to give her children the same 'old-fashioned' upbringing she had. She told WUSA-TV: 'I grew up in New York City in the '70s and nobody hesitated to let their kids walk around. 'The world is actually even safer than when I was a child. The only thing that's changed between then and now is our fear. 'I think it’s absolutely critical for their development — to learn responsibility, to experience the world, to gain confidence and competency.' She describes parenthood as being 'an exercise in risk management' and say her and her husband spend the same amount of time as any parent worrying about what is and isn't safe. The only difference is where they decide to draw the line. She said parents should stop worrying that their children are going to be abducted, saying such disappearances are 'incredibly rare', and should instead focus on more likely problems, such as road safety. Danielle and Alex waved goodbye to their children at this park in Montgomery County on December 20. The next time they saw them they were in the back of a police car after cops picked them up . She often lets the children go for walks together, around the block, or up to the local 7/11. They even carry a card which reads: 'I'm not lost, I'm a free range kid.' However, when police stopped the children on December 20 as they were walking back home from Woodside Park, they didn't have the card on them. The children told officers that they weren't doing anything wrong by walking home, but were still put into a patrol car and driven back to their house. Alexander said he was given a 'tense' lecture by officers on the dangers of the world. But the real problem began after they left and the CPS showed up. Even now, more than a month on, their ordeal is not over. According to the Meitivs the CPS tried to search their house, but they refused to answer the door. They say they have a meeting set for next week at CPS offices in Rockville, but don't know what the outcome will be. A CPS spokeswoman told the Post that they couldn't comment on individual cases, but pointed to state law which says children under eight must be left with a responsible person aged at least 13. Police said they could not find information on the case, but a spokeswoman said that when concerns are reported, 'we have a responsibility as part of our duty to check on people’s welfare.'","Danielle and Alexander Meitiv regularly let children walk on their own .

"PC Neil Doyle, an off-duty police officer, was murdered on a night out with his colleagues . A European arrest warrant has been issued for a man wanted in connection with the murder of off-duty police officer PC Neil Doyle. The third suspect in the hunt for the killers of the police officer was today named as Timmy Donovan, 30. Detectives believe Donovan - who also goes by the surname O'Sullivan - left the country on the same day as PC Doyle's death. It is thought he was driving a five-door grey Mercedes A180 - registration YE62 NWG - which passed through the Eurotunnel at about 8.30pm on Friday December 19. Officers are working with the National Crime Agency, Europol and European police forces to try and locate Donovan. He is understood to be in Europe, possibly Spain. He is described as 5ft 8in tall, broad build, with dark brown hair and blue eyes and has a Liverpool accent. Donovan is originally from the Huyton area of Merseyside and has connections with Childwall in Liverpool. Detectives believe Timmy Donovan, 30 (pictured)  left the country on the same day as PC Doyle's death . PC Neil Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was set upon in the early hours of Friday December 19 in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, in what his boss described as an unprovoked and vicious attack. He was out in the city following a Christmas night out with two other off-duty officers Michael Steventon and Robert Marshall, when they were attacked at around 3.15am. His colleagues were treated in hospital for facial injuries. The attackers vanished when it became clear that PC Doyle was seriously hurt. Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived. A post-mortem examination concluded that PC Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am on Friday December 19 following the officers' Christmas party at a pub - police are now hunting a third suspect . Detectives believe Timmy Donovan, 40, left the country on the same day as PC Doyle's death . Mr Doyle married only five months ago and he and wife Sarah, 37, had booked a belated honeymoon for the new year. The couple were married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month. Following his death in hospital, his widow Sarah said in a statement: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all. 'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.' Two former non league footballers, Andrew Taylor, 28, and Christopher Spendlove, 30, are accused of his murder. Taylor, of Huyton, and Spendlove, of Stockbridge Village, are currently in custody. They also face charges of unlawfully and maliciously wounding officers Michael Steventon and Robert Marshall during the same incident. They will next appear in court on March 20 for a plea hearing. A provisional trial date has been set for June 22. Police said previously that it appeared the attackers knew their victims were off-duty police officers. Officers are appealing to Timmy Donovan, or anyone who knows of his whereabouts, to contact the Matrix Serious Organised Crime Major Crime Unit on 0800 230 0600, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.

"Accident and Emergency units where nurses are looking after more than four patients at a time are unsafe, new guidance from the health watchdog states. NICE has issued recommended staffing levels for casualty departments over concerns many are dangerously overcrowded, particularly during very busy periods, such as bank holidays. Recently there have been reports nurses have had to look after as many as 15 patients at a time. Now the guidance states that there must be at least one nurse for every four patients in a cubicle bed at all times of the day and night. Accident and Emergency units where nurses are looking after more than four patients have been deemed unsafe. Pictured, an overflow ambulance treatment at the Great Western Hospital, Swindon . And for life-threatening cases, such as cardiac arrests or road traffic accidents, there must be two dedicated nurses for each patient. The guidelines will be taken into account by the Care Quality Commission watchdog during inspections, meaning hospitals face a bad rating if they fall short of the ratio. But MPs and healthcare experts warned that many A&E units are ‘nowhere near’ this safe level. Only last week an unprecedented 13 hospitals declared major incidents within a 36-hour period and implemented plans reserved for rail crashes or terrorism. They included the Gloucestershire Royal, where at one point there were two nurses attending to more than 30 patients. Later today the NHS will publish its latest figures on A&E waiting times. The previous two weeks have been the worst on record. The new guidelines point out that at present, many casualty departments do not plan for particularly busy periods such as festivals, marathons or the first working day after a bank holiday. Now they must ensure these days are adequately staffed, and, if necessary, nurses should be banned from taking holiday if there is a major event in the local area. Managers are also urged to set up standby rotas whereby off-duty nurses can be drafted in if there is a surge of patients. Professor Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at NICE, said: ‘As demand on A&E services continues to increase, we want to ensure that each and every A&E department across the country is clear on how to get nurse staffing right and is able to provide safe care to the millions of patients who walk through the door.’ Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, pictured, declared a major incident after being overrun with patients in the A&E department . But the Royal College of Nursing said that in reality, most casualty departments are a long way off NICE’s new limits. Chief executive Dr Peter Carter added: ‘NICE have recognised that this is not just a winter crisis and that only long-term planning can tackle staffing issues.’ NICE said it did not yet have figures for how many A&E units do not have enough nurses. A Department of Health spokesman insisted that most A&E units did meet the requirement for at least one nurse for every four patients.","Recent reports say nurses have had to look after as many as 15 patients .

"Parents face an anxious wait to see if their child has got a primary school place because one in five schools are already over capacity, Labour warned today. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said many families will be left disappointed, with pupils forced to travel further or squeeze into over-crowded classrooms. Today is the deadline for applications for 380,000 children to start in September, with ministers admitting some will be offered places in schools parents cannot have confidence in. Official figures show that by 2023 there will be a total of 4.7million primary age pupils, up from 4.3million in 2014 . Parents have until midnight tonight to apply, naming at least three schools where they want to send their child. Figures collected by the Labour party suggest almost one in five primary schools does not have enough space for all its pupils. Out of 130 councils who replied to a Freedom of Information request, 18 per cent admitted they did not have enough capacity for their pupils. It means children forced to learn in makeshift classrooms, including one primary school in Northumberland holding lessons in a converted double-decker bus. More than three-quarters of councils in England said they would need more primary school places in the next three years. Writing for MailOnline, Mr Hunt said: 'As a parent there a few more anxious or exciting times. Getting your child into a good local school can feel no less a prize than securing their place in an increasingly uncertain world. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insists the government has put funding in place for sufficient school places . For whilst there is no doubt the digital economy of the future offers tremendous opportunities, for our children to thrive in this brave new world they need the best start in life.' But he warned: 'There is one anxiety parents of the 380,000 children applying for places this year need not face. 'Because this year's primary school admissions process is complicated by a crippling shortage in places that will leave many parents disappointed.' Mr Hunt added: 'A squeeze on places doesn't just mean bigger class sizes. It also means less choice for parents and longer school commutes, placing extra pressure on family life and relationships.' This week the Local Government Association warned schools could be pushed to breaking over the next decade, with almost a million more places for pupils needed. The continuing squeeze on places could lead to a 'tipping point' where there is no money or space left to expand schools any further, the LGA claimed. But the Tories have hit back at Mr Hunt. A Conservative spokesman said: 'I don’t know what’s worse, the scaremongering or the hypocrisy. Labour slashed the funding for school places and took 200,000 primary school places out of the system. 'They did this in the middle of a baby boom and at the same time as letting immigration get out of control. 'They wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on their failed school building programme. And they presided over a drop in school standards so that under Labour one in three pupils left primary school unable to read, write and add up properly.' Official figures predict that there may be around 900,000 extra pupils in England's schools over the next decade. The Association said its own analysis had concluded that it will cost £12 billion to create enough school places for all of these children. The Government has pledged £7.35 billion so far to create more places, but the LGA argued that this still leaves a major shortfall. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted money was being made available. She told Radio 4: ''We work very closely as a department with local authorities because obviously the provision of school places is absolutely right. 'It has to be the provision, obviously, of good quality school places and that's obviously why we've also had the new free schools, which is schools being set up by parents and others and 70 per cent of them being set up in areas where there is a need for more places.' She added: 'There may be places available but they may not be the places that families actually want – the school may not be good enough for parents to have confidence in. 'That's part, again, of what we've done over the last four and a half years – the standards are good enough, the quality of teaching is improved so parents have confidence so there are good schools right across the system.' Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said many families will be left disappointed, with pupils forced to travel further or squeeze into over-crowded classrooms . Forms filled; criteria analysed; open days attended; Ofsted reports scrutinised; head-teachers telephoned - now the waiting begins. Because as the clock strikes midnight tonight, the deadline passes for next year's primary school applications. As a parent there a few more anxious or exciting times. Getting your child into a good local school can feel no less a prize than securing their place in an increasingly uncertain world. For whilst there is no doubt the digital economy of the future offers tremendous opportunities, for our children to thrive in this brave new world they need the best start in life. And evidence repeatedly shows that the first few years of education are absolutely crucial to life-long success; how instilling a love of learning at an early age is the most effective way of ensuring our children fulfil their potential. We may well have become too obsessed with measuring the value of a great education in pounds and pence over the last few years. But there is no escaping the priceless nature of good schooling. However, there is one anxiety parents of the 380,000 children applying for places this year need not face. Because this year's primary school admissions process is complicated by a crippling shortage in places that will leave many parents disappointed. Statistics show that nearly one in five primary school across the country does not have enough capacity for all its pupils. Meanwhile, the number of infants in classes bigger than thirty pupils has soared by a staggering 200 per cent under the current government. Libraries, music halls, office blocks, converted buses - children are being squeezed into any space that can hold them. There are now five times as many children educated in 'titan' primary schools of more than 800 pupils. This despite a promise David Cameron made to parents back in 2010 to deliver 'smaller schools and smaller class sizes'. Clearly, overflowing classrooms, with children receiving less individual attention from their teachers, represents a serious threat to the high standards and excellence all children deserve as they begin their education. When teachers become overstretched or overworked then their performance inevitably suffers. Forty per cent of new teacher trainees leave the job within the first five years and far too many experienced teachers leave the profession altogether. Not only does this damage achievement and undermine discipline, it also creates enormous inefficiencies in our teacher training system. What is worse: it gets in the way of passing on a love of learning. But often it is the more hidden aspects of this squeeze which are the most pernicious. Playground prefab classrooms are not just a terrible environment in which to inspire young children with a thirst for knowledge and enquiry. They also mean less space for the sport and play which nurtures character and helps develop healthy lifestyles. Similarly, a squeeze on places doesn't just mean bigger class sizes. It also means less choice for parents and longer school commutes, placing extra pressure on family life and relationships. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan might be relaxed about this because it only affects - in her words - a 'very, very small' number of pupils. Never mind that the number of infants in classes bigger than 30 is actually close to 100,000, this attitude denies the broader impact upon parents lives. Ignoring, alongside great teaching in a good local school, one of the biggest factors upon children's achievement in the process. Yet the truth is this primary school places crisis was entirely avoidable. The government has spent its time in office diverting precious resources away from areas in desperate need of places, ploughing them into expensive Free School pet projects in areas where there are no shortages. Whatever anybody else feels about Free Schools, such largesse, in a time of severe public finance pressures and rising demand for places, is extraordinary. Labour will end the Free School programme and prioritise spending on providing good school places in areas that need them most. 'My school taught me to work, to read and to think. It gave me great friendships. It filled me entirely and utterly for nearly the space of seven years. Outside the cottage, I had nothing but my school; but having my school, I had everything.' All parents would want their children to feel like Sir Ernest Barker, a twentieth century principal of Kings College London, felt about his schooling. But when they open that precious National Offer Day envelope on April 16th many are sure to be disappointed.

"A teenage girl spent three years of her life convinced she was dead due to a rare medical condition known as 'Walking Corpse Syndrome'. Haley Smith, 17, suffered from the ultra-rare illness Cotard’s Syndrome.

But with the help of a therapist – and, bizarrely, Disney films – she recovered. Haley Smith, 17, suffered from a very rare illness called Cotard’s Syndrome, also known as 'Walking Corpse Syndrome', where sufferers genuinely believe they are dead or have body parts missing . Sufferers such as Miss Smith (with her boyfriend, Jeremy) often die from starvation because they feel they no longer have to eat. But with the help of a therapist - and Disney films - she has now recovered . Cases of Cotard’s Syndrome date back to 1788 but it was formally identified by French neurologist Jules Cotard in 1880. Among the handful of cases over the years was a 53-year-old woman in New York who in 2008 claimed that she stank like rotting fish because she was dead. Like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, Cotard’s is another form of delusional psychosis, the only self-certifiable form of its kind. Those with this condition often describe a loss of blood, organs and/or body parts. This distorted reality is caused by a malfunction in an area of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which recognses faces, and also in the amygdala - an almond-shaped set of neurons that processes your emotions. Aware the disease is incredibly rare, Miss Smith, of Alabama, in the US,  has decided to speak out to support others.

Those with this condition often describe a loss of blood, organs and/or body parts. This distorted reality is caused by a malfunction in an area of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which recognizes faces, and also in the amygdala, an almond-shaped set of neurons that processes your emotions. The combination is a lack of recognition when viewing familiar faces (even the face of the sufferer), leaving the person feeling disconnected with reality. There is no current cure for Cotard’s Syndrome. Common treatments include anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, as well as the controversial electroconvulsive therapy. She said: 'My parents had just divorced and I didn’t cope with it well. 'Then one day when I was sitting in an English class I had this really weird sensation that I was dead and I couldn’t shake it.’ She went to see the school nurse, who, baffled, could not find anything wrong. Miss Smith continued: 'As I walked home I thought about visiting a graveyard, just to be close to others who were also dead. 'But because there wasn't one nearby I went straight back to my house and tried to sleep it off.' It seemed to work but a few days later, the macabre sense struck again. ‘I was out shopping when the sudden feeling returned. ‘My whole body went numb and I dropped all the dresses I was holding and ran out of the shop. I felt like I was going mad.’ This time, the feeling did not go away. Instead, Miss Smith began missing school, sleeping through the day and staying awake at night. She said: ‘I’d fantasise about having picnics in graveyards and I’d spend a lot of time watching horror films because seeing the zombies made me feel relaxed, like I was with family.’ As time went by, Haley decided to embrace her ‘new’ life. ‘I decided to eat whatever I wanted because I couldn’t put on weight if I was dead,’ she said. She stopped talking to her friends who suspected something was wrong. Miss Smith said: ‘Watching Disney films gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling.  I asked my boyfriend Jeremy: “How can I be dead when Disney makes me feel this good?”' Eventually, in despair, she spoke to one of them about her situation. She said: ‘I thought he’d think I was a freak but he just nodded and listened. 'It gave me the confidence to tell my dad.’ Her father, Floyd, urged her to see a psychiatrist. But it was two years until she finally plucked up the courage - and was immediately she diagnosed with Cotard’s, or Walking Corpse Syndrome. ‘It’s a rare condition where sufferers believe they or parts of their body no longer exist,’ Miss Smith said. ‘It was so amazing to find out it was a real illness. ‘I went online and found stories of other people who suffered from it. 'They wanted to spend time in graveyards too. It made me feel so much better that I wasn’t the only one.’ Talking with the therapist set her on the road to recovery. She also discovered Disney films were a huge help in her recovery. Miss Smith said: ‘Watching Disney films gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling. 'The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Bambi – I watched them all. I asked my boyfriend Jeremy:  “How can I be dead when Disney makes me feel this good?”.’ Gradually, she began to better. ‘Jeremy helped me so much – as did Disney – and we’re hoping to get married soon and then get jobs in Disney World,’ she said. She added: ‘Being a corpse was the most bizarre experience, but I’m so glad I managed to get out alive.’ Aware the disease is incredibly rare, Miss Smith has decided to speak out to support others suffering from it .","Haley Smith, 17, suffered from the ultra-rare illness Cotard’s Syndrome .

"Rural motorists could receive a 5 pence a litre price cut under a government scheme which has been approved by the European Commission. Some 17 remote areas of Great Britain will benefit from the discount, including Cumbria, Devon, North Yorkshire and the Scottish Highlands. The scheme, which is similar to one already used on the Scottish Islands, now requires final approval from other EU member states through the EU council. The government scheme comes as a report by the AA warned that motorists in many small towns are paying up to 4p more for their petrol than in urban areas  such as at the Harvest Energy Petrol Station in Birmingham where the cost of petrol has dipped below £1 . It comes as a report by the AA warned that motorists in many small towns are paying up to 4p more for their petrol - despite average petrol prices dipping to their lowest level for five years. The UK Government is pressing ahead with a formal consultation on the price cut scheme with a view to implementing it in the current Parliament. Those living in the UK’s most remote islands already get a 5p per litre fuel reduction under the Government’s Rural Fuel Rebate scheme. But the AA warned that some drivers might find it difficult to tell if the full rebate has been passed on while the RAC doubted whether rural motorists would ever see fuel parity with those in urban areas. But AA president Edmund King (pictured) warned that a uniform price drop doesn’t always reduce the price gap between small rural towns and big cities . Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said of the EC decision: ‘This is great news for motorists in these areas and brings a duty discount a step closer. Even though fuel prices are falling across the country, they are still higher in very rural areas.’ The Government claims up to 125,000 motorists will benefit from the changes. The latest AA fuel report said the average UK petrol price is 108.91p - a 7.41p dip on the mid-December figure and only 0.5p short of the second-biggest monthly fall recorded by the AA. However supermarket chain Asda has been selling unleaded for just over 103p while an independent Harvest trader in Birmingham has sold it for 99p. The AA says average mid-January diesel prices are 116.11p a litre, which represents a 6.05p cut on the mid-December figure. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (pictured) welcomed the news which brings a duty discount one step closer for motorists in rural areas . These average figures do not take into account the latest 2p-a-litre reduction in petrol and in diesel by the four big supermarkets. The AA said a family with two petrol cars is spending around £16.30 a month less at the pump than in mid-December, and more than £50 a month less than last July, when petrol was at 131.70p a litre. But the AA president Edmund King warned ‘A uniform price drop doesn’t always reduce the gap between small rural towns and others. ‘Buxton, in Derbyshire, with a population of more than 20,000, has now come under the spotlight for supermarket petrol at 109.9p a litre on Monday – a penny above the UK average and 4p dearer than in towns with competitive supermarket prices. ‘Other rural towns paying 4p a litre more for their cheapest petrol include places like Ludlow in Shropshire with 11,000 residents and Liphook in Hampshire with a population of 7,000.’ Mr King added: ‘Discrimination against small rural towns of up to 20,000 inhabitants – having to pay £2 a tank more for supermarket petrol than in towns with competitive pricing. ‘Towns like Jedburgh, Hawick and Dumfries were paying 107.9p and 108.9p a litre for supermarket petrol. On either side of them, supermarket petrol was being sold for as little as 103.7p in Carlisle and Kilmarnock.’ ‘Many rural towns would say that predictions of petrol at 99.9p a litre are a bad joke as they continue to struggle with the pump price lottery.’ Drivers in south west England, Yorkshire and Humberside, the north of England and Northern Ireland are enjoying the lowest petrol prices, all averaging 108.8p a litre. East Anglia has the most expensive, at 109.4p a litre. The average price of diesel is cheapest in Northern Ireland, at 115.7p a litre, while Scotland is most expensive, averaging 116.9p.","Scheme proposes a 5p rebate for rural locations to match urban fuel costs .

"Disney really does make dreams come true, at least for one talented young performer who has become the first Australian to be a Disney Princess. After moving to New York City as a teenager to pursue her dream of becoming a Broadway star, Sheridan Mouawad said that being chosen to play Princess Jasmine' in ‘Aladdin – A Musical Spectacular’ at Disney’s California Adventure was the opportunity of a lifetime. 'I grew up watching Disney movies as a child and looking up to all the Disney princesses. Suddenly I was given the opportunity to be one, which is such an amazing feeling,' Sheridan told Daily Mail Australia. Australian performer Sheridan Mouawad has become the first Australian to land a role as a Disney Princess . 'As my background is Middle Eastern, having the opportunity to not only be a Disney Princess but to be Princess Jasmine is definitely a dream come true- my five-year-old self inside was jumping like crazy,' Sheridan said. It has been a long and exciting road for Sheridan, 22, who began ballet lessons at the age of three and landed her first professional performing contract with Universal Studios in Singapore at only 18, the start of a career which has seen her travel to dozens of international cities. Sheridan, from Merrylands in Sydney's western suburbs, said that while she 'loves attention' and being paid to play dress-ups, she also values the adrenaline she gets from performing in front of an audience. 'I love knowing that you left a piece of yourself with every person out there, and knowing you had a part in taking them on an emotional journey,' she said. While Sheridan's ultimate goal is to land a role performing on Broadway, she said that she has been cast in amazing roles which have taught her invaluable life lessons and how to adapt to different cultures. Sheridan, from Merrylands in Sydney's western suburbs, said that she 'loves attention' and being paid to play dress-ups as a full-time job . Sheridan said that being chosen to play Princess Jasmine' in ‘Aladdin – A Musical Spectacular’ at Disney’s California Adventure was the opportunity of a lifetime . 'I grew up watching Disney movies as a child and looking up to all the Disney princesses. Suddenly I was given the opportunity to be one, which is such an amazing feeling,' Sheridan . 'I was only 19 when I picked my whole life up again and moved to the Big Apple to live in a tiny dorm room with a budget to study at The American Music and Dramatic Academy,' Sheridan said. 'Leaving a job and going back to school would have been one of the hardest decisions I have made, but one of the most rewarding as well.' After landing a role with West Side Story, which saw her perform in Europe and on London's iconic West End Stage, Sheridan was offered a full-time role as Princess Jasmine, a moment which she calls one of the highlights of her life. 'It just honestly feels so special. Knowing that so many children all over the world idolise the Disney Princesses, you have the power to make those children’s dreams come true by meeting you,' Sheridan said. As the first Australian to be given a title role as a Disney Princess, Sheridan said it was exciting to meet the cast and be the exotic 'foreigner'. 'Meeting the cast and knowing I was foreign kept a fun buzz throughout the contract,' Sheridan said. 'Everyone was excited because they had never had an Australian on the cast before and I was proud to be the first and make a great impression.' Sheridan was offered a  role as Princess Jasmine, a moment which she calls one of the highlights of her life . In her role as Princess Jasmine, Sheridan said that one of her favourite elements of performing in the musical was riding Aladdin's magic carpet and seeing all the children in the audience respond . 'When Jasmine comes down, children in the audience wave, and when Jasmine waves back and catches a little boy or girls eye, they begin to wave back passionately,' Sheridan said . One of the highlights of Sheridan's time with the musical was being a part of Disney's 'Make a Wish Foundation', which gives terminally ill children the opportunity ask Disney for a 'wish'. 'Children have requested to meet the cast of Aladdin, or take a photo with Jasmine and Aladdin,' she said. 'Knowing what these children are going through, having a hand in making their wish come true would truly have to be the most beautiful and heart-warming experiences I have ever encountered,' Sheridan said. 'Disney magic really does exist and it’s when you experience events like this.'

"Ten years ago today one of the most remarkable moments in human history took place, when the Huygens probe landed on Saturn’s largest moon - Titan . It remains the only landing of a spacecraft in the outer solar system to date - and to celebrate the accomplishment Nasa has released a stunning video visualising the approach. It shows what the probe would have seen as it approached the moon and passed through the atmosphere, before finally coming to rest in a dried-up methane riverbed. Scroll down for video . This incredible image of Titan was returned by the Huygens spacecraft from six miles (10km) high as it made its way to the surface on 15 January 2005. It revealed highlands and darker areas, and also channels thought to have been carved by lakes and rivers of liquid methane at some point in the past . The Cassini-Huygens mission, which launched on 15 October 1997 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, is a joint project between Nasa, Esa and the Italian space agency - ASI. The Huygens probe itself was built and operated by Esa. Launch: 15 October 1997 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida . Dimensions: 22 feet (6.7 metres) high; 13.1 feet (4 meters) wide . Total weight: 5,712 kilograms (12,593 pounds) with fuel, Huygens probe, adapter, etc . Orbiter weight (unfueled): 2,125 kilograms (4,685 pounds) Power: 885 watts (633 watts at end of mission) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators . Distance traveled to reach Saturn: 2.2 billion miles (3.5 billion kilometres) Key instruments: Imaging radar, cosmic dust analyser, infrared mapping spectrometer . The video, made using real images from Cassini and Huygens, begins at a great distance from Titan and Saturn, a ‘billion times further’ than the final view at the surface according to the narrator. As the camera zooms in, the definition of the shadows on Saturn can be noticed, cast by its rings, and Titan’s brown hazy atmosphere can also be seen.. The camera then begins to move down onto the moon, showing light regions - highlands - and dark regions, which are mostly dune fields. The probe also measured colour on the surface using spectrometres, which is exaggerated as the camera approaches the surface. Most of Titan’s surface is brown, and its atmosphere is so thick that it is darker on the surface during the day that it is on Earth during an extremely cloudy day. During its descent Huygens also revealed a complicated system of channels where rivers of methane were thought to have once flowed. Other regions on the moon still have rivers and lakes of this thick substance. This animation shows a sped-up view of the approach and landing of the Huygens probe on the surface of Titan ten years ago on 15 January 2005. Credit: Nasa . The Cassini-Huygens mission, which launched on 15 October 1997 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, is a joint project between Nasa, Esa and the Italian space agency - ASI. The Huygens probe itself, shown here in an artist's illustration, was built and operated by Esa . It is now ten years since Esa's Huygens probe landed on Titan. To celebrate the achievement Nasa released a video visualisation using real images taken by the probe. This graphic reveals some of the stats about Titan. While the Huygens prove is now dead, Cassini continues to flyby the moon every month or so . Perhaps the most amazing image of Titan by Huygens is this one from the surface, showing pebbles that have been rounded by liquids . The descent on 15 January 2005 lasted a total of two hours, with Huygens landing on a frigid floodplain surrounded by icy cobblestones. It is the only landing that has ever been performed in the outer solar system to date, and one of only a handful of bodies - the others being Venus, Mars, the moon, two asteroids and most recently a comet - that manmade probes have ever landed on. On the surface the probe continued to send back data for more than an hour, until its batteries were drained. Since that historic moment, scientists have pored over volumes of data about Titan sent back to Earth. Perhaps most surprisingly, the results over the years have shown Titan to be a somewhat Earth-like world - at least, the most Earth-like in the solar system aside from our own. ‘A mission of this ambitious scale represents a triumph in international collaboration,’ said Earl Maize, Cassini Project manager at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘From the mission's formal beginning in 1982, to Huygens' spectacular landing 23 years later, to the present day, Cassini-Huygens owes much of its success to the tremendous synergy and cooperation between more than a dozen countries. 'This teamwork is still a major strength of the project as the Cassini orbiter continues to explore the Saturn system.’ This illustration shows how the Huygens probe made its descent to the surface. After passing through the atmosphere a parachute was used to slow its descent. The descent on 15 January 2005 lasted a total of two hours, with Huygens landing on a frigid floodplain surrounded by icy cobblestones . This picture of Titan, taken by Huygens on its way to the surface, showed what appeared to be channels that were once carved by lakes and rivers. It is now thought that Titan has highly viscous bodies of water on its surface composed of liquid methane, as evidenced by further radar imaging of the surface . With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. Ben Biggs, editor of All About Space Magazine, added: ‘The successful landing of Huygens on Saturn's moon Titan has to be one of my personal highlights in the history of human space exploration. ‘The lander might have only sent back an hour and a half or so of data before the Cassini orbiter lost contact with it, but in that time the world got a glimpse of exactly what was beneath the previously impenetrable cloud layer of Saturn's biggest moon: lakes of liquid methane, ice volcanoes and an otherwise surprisingly terrestrial moon. ‘It returned the only image we've taken from the surface of an object in the Outer Solar System, it's the only lander that's successfully touched-down on a moon or planet this far away, plus it was made by Esa too. ‘It's just nice to have such a successful and high-profile mission that we can call our own, in a scientific field that's dominated by Nasa.' While Huygens might have long since passed away, the hugely successful Cassini mission is continuing around the Saturninan system. It will continue observing the gas giant and its moons until 2017, when it will be sent burning up in the atmosphere of Saturn as it runs out of fuel to prevent it crashing on and contaminating any of its moons.","It is now ten years since Esa's Huygens probe landed on Titan .

"The Ministry of Defence are to order £228million of super missiles to protect the Falklands as Argentina seeks to bolster its air force, it has been reported. The British territory in the South Atlantic is currently protected by ageing Rapier missile batteries. Last month, it was reported that Argentina was looking to strengthen its air force by leasing attack jets from Russia. Scroll down for video . A Future Local Area Air Defence System prepares for launch during trials. It has been reported that the Ministry of Defence are to buy this system to protect the Falkland Islands . A computer generated image of what one of the missiles from a FLAADS launcher could look like. The Ministry of Defence say missiles from the system will be able to travel at 1,000 metres per second . And according to the Sun, the MoD are to buy a truck-based Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS) to protect the islands. A source told the newspaper: 'Argentina's air force has not improved since their defeat in 1982, but they've repeatedly tried to sort that despite being cash-strapped. 'Britain must always stay one step ahead when it comes to defending the Falklands. Rapier has been a great asset, but it's time for a new system to counter further threats.' In May last year, the Ministry of Defence announced it has awarded a £36million contract to missile company MBDA UK to explore the capabilities of FLAADS, a land-based air defence system. They added that the missiles from the system would be able to travel at 1,000 metres per second and defend against threats, including jets or cruise missiles travelling at supersonic speeds. An ageing Rapier missile defence battery stationed in London. The same batteries are currently being used in the Falkland Islands but could be replaced . At the time, the MoD said that following an assessment phase, a decision on whether to buy FLAADS as a replacement for Rapier was expected to be made next year. An MoD spokesperson said: 'Our overall military posture in the South Atlantic is based on regular assessments of the threat and the Falkland Islands remain well-defended; we do not offer comment on specific operational details. 'We remain vigilant and committed to the protection of the Falkland islanders.' The Falkland Islands have formally been a British territory since 1833, but Argentina dispute this saying sovereignty of the archipelago belongs to them. Waged over the course of ten weeks, the Falklands War was sparked when Argentina invaded remote British territories in the South Atlantic on April 2, 1982. Argentina, which refers to the islands as Las Malvinas, had claimed it had inherited them from Spain during the 1800s. A British taskforce was sent to the Falklands in April 1982 after Argentina invaded the disputed territory . There have been a series of recent flare ups between Britain and Argentina and in July the Argentinian football team were fined after their players posed with a banner laying claim to the islands . The invasion prompted the UK, which had ruled the islands for 150 years to retaliate, a task force to reclaim the Falklands, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saying the 1,800 Falklanders were 'of British tradition and stock'. Some 28,000 troops and more than 100 ships were deployed, with the ensuing war lasting for 74 days, claiming the lives of 255 British military personnel, 649 Argentinians and three Falkland Islanders. Recently, there have been a series of flare-ups between Argentina and Britain. Earlier this year, Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina during filming of the show's Christmas special, which aired on the BBC last month. An angry mob took offence at the 'H982FKL' number plate on Clarkson's Porsche 928GT, which some interpreted as a Falklands reference, but the production team maintain was a coincidence. In July, Argentina's football chiefs were fined £19,500 by FIFA after their players posed with a political banner laying claim to the Falkland Islands.","MoD could be set to order £228million super missiles to protect Falklands .

"The ISIS commander who appeared alongside a child executioner in a chilling video just days ago it believed to have been killed in Syria. Abu Sa'ad al-Dāghistāni has died in Kobane, ISIS fighters on Twitter are claiming. al-Dāghistāni - who is described variously as a fighter and an ISIS intelligence commander - featured in what's believed to be ISIS' last video, which claimed to show a young boy executing two Russian spies in the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Abu Sa'ad al-Dāghistāni was killed days after he appeared in ISIS' latest shocking video . In the video, al-Dāghistāni is shown standing alongside a young boy behind two so-called Russian spies . The footage showed the boy standing next to al-Dāghistāni, behind two kneeling 'spies', after which the boy apparently shoots the grey-clad men in the back of their heads. However, lack of visible injuries on the men and evidence of blood after the killings suggest the executions may be staged for the cameras. The seven-and-a-half minute video starts with interviews with the two men where they admit to spying on ISIS on behalf of Russia. The men tell an interviewer off-camera their names are Mamayev Jambulat Yesenajovich and Ashimov Sergey Nikolayavich, that they are Kazakh and were recruited by 'Russian Intelligence'. The 'execution scene' sees al-Dāghistāni dressed in a camouflage uniform, with the young boy standing next to him holding a handgun. al-Dāghistāni - who is understood to have been killed in Kobane - claims they have confessed to being spies . The young boy is then shown apparently shooting the two men dead - although the footage has not been independently verified . The boy then tells the camera he hopes to be a fighter in the future . al-Dāghistāni speaks during the video, telling the cameraman 'Allah has gifted the Islamic State with these two spies'. 'By Allah's grace, they are now in the custody of the lion cubs of the Khilafah,' he adds. The boy walks up behind the 'spies' and appears to be shooting them both in the back of the head, before raising the gun and cheering. MailOnline has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video, which was uploaded to an anonymous vidme account linked to a Twitter user no longer in use.

With $59.1 million at the North American box office (opening all the way back in March), it's also the most money-making best-picture entry. That, however, is likely to change soon after American Sniper expands nationwide this weekend. The eight best-picture nominees left out two wild cards that might have added a dose of darkness to the category: the creepy Jake Gyllenhaal thriller Nightcrawler and the tragic wrestling drama Foxcatcher. She won a Golden Globe this year already: Julianne Moore in the film Still Alice; she received a nod . In the three previous years since the category was expanded (anywhere between five and 10 film may be nominated), there were nine movies contending for best picture. The nominees for best actor are: Cooper, Steve Carell (Foxcatcher), Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game), Michael Keaton (Birdman) and Eddie Redmayne. David Oyelowo, who stars as Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, was left out. There was not a single person of colour nominated in the acting or directing categories. Marion Cotillard for the French-language Two Days, One Night was the surprise nominee for best actress. She was joined by Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything), Julianne Moore (Still Alice), Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) and Reese Witherspoon (Wild). The nominees for best supporting actor are: Robert Duvall, The Judge; Edward Norton, Birdman; Mark Ruffalo, Foxcatcher; Ethan Hawke, Boyhood; and J.K. Simmons, Whiplash. The nominees for best supporting actress are: Patricia Arquette, Boyhood; Laura Dern, Wild; Keira Knightley, The Imitation Game; Emma Stone, Birdman; and Meryl Streep, Into the Woods. A long trek for this Oscar winner: Reese Witherspoon, who took home the gold for 2005's Walk The Line, was nominated for playing Cheryl Strayed in Wild . This year's modestly sized but much-beloved favorites - Boyhood, Birdman - have been largely locked in place throughout much of the ever-expanding industrial complex of Hollywood's lengthy awards season, where statuette-hunting campaigns span months and are feverishly chewed over by Oscar prognosticators. As studios have focused more and more on easily marketed blockbusters, Oscar season increasingly exists apart from the regular business of the movies, in its own highfalutin, red-carpeted realm. Ratings are on the rise. Last year's Oscars, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, drew 43 million viewers, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast in a decade. 12 Years a Slave took best picture. This year's ceremony on Feb. 22 will be hosted by Neil Patrick Harris. He will be at the Oscars in February: Clint Eastwood's Navy SEAL drama American Sniper did especially well, landing six nods including best actor for Bradley Cooper . A bright future for this newlywed: Redmayne received a Best Actor Oscar for The Theory Of Everything . Golden boy: Hawke, pictured with Coltrane, got a nod for Boyhood; he already picked up a Golden Globe Best Actor Drama award for the part . Shortly after the announcement, the host shared a video on his Twitter page. He told his 12.9million followers: ‘The Oscar nominations just came out this morning and that can only mean one thing – I just lost 20 bucks.’ Neil then turned to his four-year-old daughter Harper and handed her the cash, claiming he had bet on who would be up for Best Credit Design Of A Foreign Language Film – a made up category. The new host: Neil Patrick Harris is taking a stab at hosting the 87th Academy Awards on February 22 .","Clint Eastwood's  American Sniper lands six nods including best actor for Bradley Cooper .

"Lorna Clymo, who suffered with depression, jumped to her death from a multi-storey car park after calls  to NHS out-of-hours numbers went unanswered . A mother-of-one who suffered suicidal bouts of depression jumped  to her death from a multi-storey car park after calls by her desperate family to NHS out-of-hours numbers went unanswered. Lorna Clymo, 42, from Haworth, Keighley, suffered so badly from depression her partner, Mark Feather, was given a list of telephone helpline numbers for doctors to call in case she had depressive episodes after her discharge from hospital. But although she was rated by health professionals as being at 'red' - at high risk of harming herself - Mr Feather found all the numbers rang out and he was unable to leave a message when he tried to contact them. On February 1 last year Ms Clymo, a homecare worker, drove her Peugeot to the top of a car park in Keighley, near Bradford, and jumped. She died a short time later in hospital from chest, spinal and pelvic injuries. Her anti depressants had been switched by doctors in the run up to her death. At an inquest Ms Clymo's family condemned Bradford District Care Trust over its failure to have a messaging service and claimed she was not on the correct medication. Her sister Sharon Charlton, 44, told Bradford Coroner's Court: 'If you are providing a service and somebody said 'just ring us up' and there was no message how would you know who was ringing you? 'If someone crying for help - you wouldn't know. The number you gave, there was no answer. 'For somebody high risk, there was no support. 'Lorna was agitated and we were getting agitated because nobody was there. 'You are professionals. You should have already had that in place. I am just thinking about it to make it safer. 'To me her mood was down but she tried to act normally as if everything as okay. 'She was struggling and her mood just got low and I think the only people who could help her with the professionals. Ms Clymo's family have condemned Bradford District Care Trust over its failure to have a messaging service . 'We were out of our depth because that is not what we do. 'You go to professionals and hopefully you think they are going to look after her. I just do not think she was on the right medication. 'On the day she was sent home, even though she was high risk, she had to manage her own medication. She had to wean off one and increase another. 'I feel as if she was neglected, a lack of care. 'Why she was not sectioned? For somebody who tried two attempts in such a short space of time, why did you feel the need to let her go home? 'The community nurses rang her but how can you see down a telephone?' Earlier the Bradford hearing was told Ms Clymo had suffered from depression since 1998 but since September 2013 her condition deteriorated and she made two suicide attempts. A month before her death she told Mr Feather she had taken dozens of pills and was rushed to hospital. She was subsequently admitted to the Airedale Centre for Mental Health where she was kept as in-patient for a week - but she was still allowed out to visit friends and go home for period of time. Just nine days after taking the pills, Ms Clymo attempted to hang herself and was readmitted again to the Heather ward and kept in from January 11 until the January 22, when her anti-depressant medication citalopram was changed to mirtazapine. Engineer Mr Feather, 46, said in a statement: 'Since leaving the hospital she had more bad days than good days but still came across well to all of the mental health visitors. 'I woke up on February 1 at 5am and Lorna got up with me. She had a coffee and said she felt fine. Bradford Coroner's Court (pictured) heard Ms Clymo's medication had changed in the run up to her death . 'But the police came to my place of work just after 8.30am and I knew what had happened straight away. 'I have been told a car was found at the top floor of the carpark and she had told me in the past she had driven there and thought about jumping off.' Dr Andrew Aspin, a consultant psychiatrist for Bradford District Care Trust, said Ms Clymo's medication had been switched due to a deterioration in her condition, but that she was not mentally ill enough to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He said: 'There was a risk, but toward the end of January Lorna was firmly saying she wanted to be out of hospital. 'She did have capacity - she was not suffering from confusion or memory loss which made her unable to understand the situation. 'There was no doubt she suffered from depression and a risk of harming herself, however parties felt the risk could be managed in the community in part because she was compliant with her treatment, she took her medication and was willing to sit down and talk with the intensive home treatment team. 'We also have a duty to use the least restrictive option. Lorna expressed the view that being in the hospital was detrimental for her. 'She clearly and firmly said that she wanted to be home. 'I would say she did not have any immediate plans to harm herself but there remained a large concern about her depression and impulsivity. 'The intensive home care treatment team grade or rate patients they are seeing according to how concerned they are. 'She was rated as a red which is the highest level of concern. But it was the opinion of doctors and nurses that the level of risk was not such that such immediate action be taken.' Jackie Haw-Wells, who works for the Serious Incident Department told the inquest: 'Everybody felt there was a risk that she had had two previous suicide attempts and there was a concern but she would not have met the criteria.' She said the lack of response from the out of hours hotline as an 'oversight' and an answer message service has been put in place. Recording a verdict of suicide Coroner Martin Fleming said: 'She did receive in that regard the best care from her doctors and they factored into the equation what they thought Lorna wanted. 'The family have raised concerns and certain issues and I am grateful the concerns have been acted open as far as the trust and hospital are concerned.' After the hearing Mrs Charlton added: 'We left Lorna's care to the professionals and the outcome was fatal. 'They are supposed to know what's best but at the end of the day my sister died even though she is high risk. 'Everything seems to stop on a Friday in adult health services. 'When you have got an out of hour's number and somebody is supposedly on duty you expect to speak to someone and yet we could not do that. 'Where are they all at these times? Do they not work Saturday and Sunday?'","Lorna Clymo, 42, tried to kill herself twice in weeks leading up to her death .

"It's the exclusive new club for men with one  strict membership requirement. They have to prove their manhood is at least seven inches long. The Brisbane-based club dubbed 'The 7th' went live with its website on Thursday and claims to already have 12 members. They boast that only men that belong in the 'top 7th percentile world-wide' are able to join the so-called club and those who meet the seven inch criteria are given a silver ring to confirm their membership. Scroll down for video . A Brisbane-based club dubbed 'The 7th' that went live with its website on Thursday asks members to prove their manhood is at least seven inches to receive a silver membership ring . 'Until now... it hasn't been verifiable on sight if a gentleman has the capacity to fulfil a natural desire and preference that cannot be compensated for,' they said. While it isn't clear if The 7th is some sort of stunt, its website does lay out how people can join. 'Members are posted an initiation pack containing a set of uniquely coded documents,' the website reads. 'The pack allows members to securely upload qualification photos whilst maintaining discretion so that The 7th may assess and award them status. 'Only those who qualify will be granted a ring.' The 7th have been posting photos of events on its Instagram (pictured) and held a launch party for the new exclusive club on Wednesday night in Brisbane . They claim 'empowering endowed men' with an exclusive membership ring allows it to serve as the 'modern symbol of a gentleman' They claim 'empowering endowed men' with an exclusive membership ring allows it to serve as the 'modern symbol of a gentleman'. The 7th says its members embrace seven different values - respect, integrity, loyalty, honour, duty, innovation and vision. They say they want to re-empower these values in today’s digital era where people don't have intimacy and are disconnected from each other. Members have to upload qualification photos  so that The 7th may assess and award them status in the club . People who see and promote the values, but do not physically qualify can still be associated with The 7th via an ambassador program . 'To do this, we chose to focus on something that is at the very core of our nature and so centric to human relationships,' they said. 'One which we subconsciously already accept, but is a social taboo: the endowment of a man.' People who see and promote the values, but do not physically qualify can still be associated with The 7th via an ambassador program. 'Any member of the public, regardless of endowment or gender may become an ambassador and for introducing three qualifying members can be a part of The 7th,' they said.","Men have to prove manhood is seven inches to join Brisbane club The 7th .

"Condoleezza Rice has said she was stunned when she learned the classified mission to thwart Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions had been leaked to the press. The former national security adviser to George W. Bush's administration told the trial of ex-CIA case officer Jeffrey Sterling on Thursday that it was one of the most closely held operations during her tenure. Prosecutors say Sterling told journalist James Risen about the program involving a key Russian asset because he was bitter about his treatment at the agency. Defense lawyers however say that the leak could have come from anywhere and that Sterling has faced unfair suspicion because he sued the CIA for racial discrimination. In testimony Thursday in federal court, the CIA manager testified that more than 90 people knew about the covert operation. Shock: Former national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said she was stunned when she learned a classified mission to thwart Iran's nuclear weapons plan had been leaked to the press (file picture) The mission involved using a Russian asset nicknamed 'Merlin' to funnel deliberately flawed nuclear blueprints to Iran. In the trial that began on Tuesday, Sterling was accused of unnecessarily exposing one of the agency's top assets. Sterling, 47, was charged back in 2010 but his trial has been delayed for years, largely due to wrangling over whether Risen could be forced to testify about his dealings with Sterling. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court turned aside an appeal from Risen seeking immunity from a trial subpoena on First Amendment grounds. Ultimately, though, prosecutors opted against putting Risen on the stand after free-press advocates lobbied Attorney General Eric Holder to avoid a legal showdown that could have ended with the reporter being thrown in jail for contempt of court for refusing to testify about his confidential sources. From 1993 until 2002, Sterling was a CIA agent assigned to a classified, clandestine operations. In 2011 he was indicted, accused of leaking defense secrets.

Risen is a Pulitzer award-winning journalist and author of the 2006 book State of War which details the CIA's covert spy war with Iran. Earlier this week the Justice Department announced revised guidelines for obtaining records from the news media during criminal leak investigations, removing language that news organizations said was ambiguous and requiring additional levels of review before a journalist can be subpoenaed. The updated policy revises protocols announced last year amid outrage among news organizations over Obama administration tactics.","Former national security adviser said it was a one of the most closely held operations during George W.

"A TV glamour model's 21st birthday meal ended in tears after a waitress shouted at her 'At least I don't get my t**s out on TV'. Police were called after Rachel Hobbs, who goes under the name Lacey Lorenzo for her adult work, said she received a tirade of abuse when she complained that plates used to serve her birthday cake were dirty. The 21-year-old, who works for late-night TV channels says that the waitress at The Crown in Bromley, south London, had recognised her from her work. Glamour model Rachel Hobbs' (pictured) 21st birthday meal ended with police attending the restaurant after a waitress shouted at her 'At least I don't get my t**s out on TV' Miss Hobbs' 76-year-old grandmother, who was at the family celebration, had not known what she did for a living until then. Bosses at the Toby Carvery restaurant dialled 999 after Miss Hobbs lost her temper in response but police took no action over the December 8 incident. The chain has now apologised for the 'unprofessional comments' of its waitress. But Miss Hobbs, of Bromley in south London, says that the row has 'ruined' her birthday. She told how she complained that the paper plates used to hand out her cake were dirty. She recalled: 'They gave us dirty plates. They had bits of dried food stuck to them. 'When I said 'Excuse me, these plates are dirty', the staff had such bad attitude that they just grabbed them back. 'I said 'That is not very good customer service' and the waitress shouted out in front of everybody 'At least I don't get my t**s out on TV'. Toby Carvery, in Bromley, south London, has now apologised to Miss Hobbs for the 'unprofessional comments' of its waitress . 'The restaurant manager was right there. She shouted it in front of him and he did not know what to say. 'It's so unprofessional to do that for someone, especially when you can see it is their 21st birthday because there are balloons saying that on the table. 'It's just my job. My nan didn't even know about my job until then but they obviously knew who I was in there. 'I just wanted to go there because I really enjoy roast dinners. It was so messed up. 'It ruined my birthday. I was crying. I just wanted to have fun on that day. 'For the rest of my life, I am always going to remember being insulted by some stupid little idiot on my 21st birthday.' Miss Hobbs (pictyred posing with mother Maria Draa) goes under the name Lacey Lorenzo and says the waitress recognised her from her 'adult work' Miss Hobbs' mum Maria Draa, 55, said: 'The police were called because my daughter lost her temper. We were just gobsmacked.' Miss Hobb's grandmother Joan Skipper, 76, said: 'It was a pretty bad commotion. 'I am not up with what Rachel does. I was not expecting the police to turn up at her birthday.' A Toby Carvery spokesman said: 'We apologise to Rachel or her family for any upset caused and for the unprofessional comments made by a member of our team. 'We have investigated the complaint fully and are dealing with the employee involved. 'Our manager apologised unreservedly to the family at the time and also waived the meal bill as a gesture of goodwill.' A Met Police spokesman said: 'Officers attended the scene but were not required as there had only been a verbal altercation between a staff member and a customer.'","Rachel Hobbs is known as Lacey Lorenzo for  'adult work' on late-night TV .

"Strolling out of court with his hoodie zipped up to his eyes, this is Cherif Kouachi denying terror charges seven years before his massacre in Paris. Newly-emerged footage from 2008 shows the Charlie Hebdo gunman claiming he was 'set up' over a plot to smuggle Islamists into Iraq to fight U.S. troops - a crime of which he was later found guilty. Kouachi, who spent half of his three-year sentence in jail before being freed to commit his rampage, told journalists he and his six co-defendants were just 'passionate young kids from the suburbs'. Scroll down for video . 'We're just passionate': Footage has emerged of Cherif Kouachi defending his extremist views in 2008 . Kouachi, pictured, was later found guilty of a plot to smuggle extremists into Iraq to fight U.S. troops . His voice muffled by the jumper drawn round his mouth, he told reporters: 'The whole thing has been set up. We are just young kids from the suburbs, that is all. 'We get passionate, we talk like this but there is nothing more, that's it. We did nothing wrong. 'There was no intention (from us), now they pretend things, but who cares. We will see and I hope that it will show evidence.' Then aged around 25, Kouachi was sentenced for his part in the Buttes Chaumont network, named for the park in northern Paris where they used to meet. They were accused of recruiting radicalised worshippers from a Paris mosque and organising their transfer to Iraq, where the battle between insurgents and U.S. and British troops was at its height. All seven of the men, six French and one Algerian, were found guilty of 'criminal association in a terrorist enterprise'. Protest: Kouachi, then 25, said he was innocent and the trial by a French court had been a 'set-up' 'Tell them it's not true,' he called up to reporters before leaving the courthouse. 'I did nothing wrong' Monitored: Cherif Kouachi served 18 months of a three-year sentence in jail and later travelled to Yemen . The video, found in the archive of the news agency Reuters, showed another of the accused running down the steps of the courthouse with his hoodie pulled up, refusing to be interviewed. Kouachi then stopped again on the steps and called up to reporters: 'Tell them it's not true. I did nothing wrong'. Also on trial was Kouachi's alleged mentor Farid Benyettou, who was found guilty and jailed for six years. Now 33, Benyettou was jailed for six years and has since trained at a nurse - even working at a Paris hospital which treated victims of the massacre. Earlier this week he distanced himself from the attacks and said they were would be condemned by the Islamic faith itself. 'I condemn what was done,' Benyettou said in an interview with the iTELE news channel. 'I want to send this message: Islam condemns everything that has been done - the cowardly and monstrous murder of journalists, of police officers and members of the Jewish community. Murder: Cherif and Said Kouachi before fleeing the scene of the attack on Charlie Hebdo's Paris offices . Regret: Co-conspirator from 2008 Farid Benyettou (left) has slammed the actions of Cherif Kouachi (right) 'That should not be attributed to Islam. It's the worst crime that a Muslim could commit.' Benyettou said two months ago Kouachi came to see him 'out of the blue'. 'The only thing he wanted to talk about was fighting,' he said. 'He didn't want to know about good relations with his neighbours, or acting like a good Muslim'. Benyettou dismissed suggestions that he had ever been tempted to use violence and rejected the idea that France 'oppressed' Muslims. 'I am the proof that it's the opposite,' he said. 'I have a criminal record that is rather hard for people to swallow. I have been convicted for terrorism, which is the worst offence. 'But even so, I have never been discriminated against.' He added that in the wake of the attack he voluntarily went to the intelligence services. He was questioned for two hours before being freed. Grief: Flowers on the pavement near where the brothers launched their attack on the magazine's offices . Solidarity: Protests in the Spanish capital Madrid, one of dozens of cities which saw marches after the attack . Kouachi, 32, and his brother Said, 34, killed 12 people including a Muslim police officer when they stormed the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last Wednesday. Questions have been raised over whether the men could have been stopped after it emerged there were extensive links between them and other jihadis known to the security services. Cherif Kouachi had been forbidden from leaving France after he travelled to Yemen in 2011 for weapons training. Two senior Yemeni sources told Reuters on Sunday that both Cherif and Said Kouachi were smuggled into Yemen after arriving in Oman on July 25, 2011. Meanwhile the attacks' alleged mastermind Hayat Boumeddiene, whose husband killed four people at a kosher deli, was also days from being caught by agents in Istanbul before the attacks. She went on the run to Turkey on January 2 and police raided the Bade Otel where she had stayed on January 5, but she had already departed on her way to Syria.","Unearthed footage shows Cherif Kouachi with hoodie zipped to his eyes .

"More than a third of new guards at Rikers Island had serious red flags raised against them - but were hired anyway, it has emerged. One applicant to be a New York City correction officer had been fired from his last job as a security guard for stealing. Another admitted he had regularly socialized with gang members. Another had debts of more than $400,000. A city investigation into New York City jail hiring practices has found dozens of recently hired guards had gang ties, previous arrests and otherwise checkered histories . Yet all those candidates and dozens like them were hired last year to be part of the force overseeing nearly 11,000 inmates on Rikers Island, according to a yearlong city probe of jail hiring practices released Thursday. The probe found systemic problems with the Department of Correction hiring system, including no recruiting strategy for the past six years, that allowed an alarmingly high number of hires who had arrest records, gang ties or other red flags that are markers for corruption. Department of Investigation Commissioner Mark Peters said the chronic problems of violence, smuggling and bribery that plague the city jails can all be traced to the character and qualifications of the employees. 'Unless you have consistently qualified correction officers, solving the other problems we care about is an almost insurmountable task,' Peters said. 'This is just a function of, for a decade, hirings and screenings and investigations being ignored.' A barbed wire fence outside inmate housing on New York's Rikers Island correctional facility in New York . City investigators randomly pulled 153 application files of guards hired last year and found that 54 — or 35 percent — 'presented significant red flags that should have either precluded their hiring outright or required further follow-up.' The probe found 79 hired officers admitted having friends or family members who were inmates — including one with nine relatives who had done time in Rikers. Ten new hires had been arrested more than once, and another 12 had been rejected by the significantly higher standards of the New York Police Department, including six for psychological reasons and one who failed a drug test. In all, this group appeared 'simply unfit for law enforcement — whether working on the streets of New York City as police officers or in its jails,' according to the report. Jails Commissioner Joseph Ponte, who has pledged to reform the troubled correction department, said in a statement he was committed to 'improving staff recruitment, training and retention' and would implement many of the investigators' recommendations. Those included automatically disqualifying applicants who had been fired from a public agency or had any felony convictions in the past five years. Since the investigation, three of the problem hires have been fired for misconduct, including one who had an 'unduly familiar' relationship with an inmate later arrested in a murder-for-hire plot. Two of the hires resigned. Corrections officials wouldn't say what they will do with the rest. The probe found systemic problems with the Department of Correction hiring system, including no recruiting strategy for the past six years . Among other findings, there was no evidence applicants had been screened for gang affiliation, even though the jails' own intelligence officers rank it as the top threat to safety. It wasn't until after probe began that the jails began taking photos of applicants' tattoos to check for possible gang ties. Investigators deemed application investigators undertrained and found they failed to make meaningful background checks or run credit reports. They were also reliant on an applicant evaluation scale of 1 to 5 despite no clear understanding of whether a '1' or a '5' was the best score. Thus, the report found, 90 percent of applicants received a meaningless '3' on the scale. Investigators found seven instances when the deputy commissioner in charge of hiring reversed decisions to reject unqualified candidates. In one case, a reject who scored poorly on the psychological exam was hired after her file noted she was a family friend of Norman Seabrook, the powerful president of the union representing 9,000 city correction officers. Seabrook didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.

"A  beggar commutes more than 200 miles to sit in a doorway outside an exclusive  London restaurant where he accepts cash using his own chip and pin machine, it was revealed today. Damien Preston-Booth, 37, has taken money from the rich, tourists and celebrities to pay for gadgets like an iPad and trips across Europe, while apparently claiming benefits. On his Facebook page today he posted a picture of himself with music mogul Simon Cowell in the West End with the caption: 'Simon didn't give me 50 pounds it was 20'. Professional beggar: Damien Preston-Booth, 37, commutes from Preston to London to beg in Mayfair and is pictured here taking money from Simon Cowell and offering him a sweet in return . Celebrities: Mr Preston-Booth is pictured here with Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh outside a Mayfair club . Defence: Mr Preston-Booth said that the music mogul gave him £20 and he has also admitted he has a chip and pin card reader for 'regulars' Mr Preston-Booth travels by bus, train or rental car from Preston in Lancashire to Mayfair and spends Thursdays to Sundays taking cash from passers-by and card payments from 'regulars'. He was last seen in the area over Christmas and New Year, local businesses have said. He usually finds a spot outside a Lebanese restaurant but is said to book into a nearby hotel if the weather is inclement. Upset: A friend claims the beggar, pictured in Spain, is 'taking everyone for a ride' and made around £4,500 over the New Year period - including £1,000 from a rich Arab outside the Dorchester Hotel . Using the cash he has travelled to  Monaco, Paris, Ibiza and Bruges in the past six months. A friend claims he is 'taking everyone for a ride' and made around £4,500 over the New Year period - including £1,000 from a rich Arab outside the Dorchester Hotel. The 37-year-old is renting a £300-a-month flat but appears to have been saying he has been homeless for five years. Mr Preston-Booth is also believed to be on Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for his depression, which could earn him up to £108 a week. It is now likely he will face a benefit fraud investigation, a Government source told MailOnline. Mr Preston-Booth has been contacted for comment by MailOnline. Other beggars have said that they are 'scared' of Mr Preston-Booth, who denies he is a bully and claims he gives cash to others on the streets. His Facebook profile shows he has been flying all over Europe since the summer and he told online friends he had a 'great year'. In  July pictures show he spent time in Ibiza and came home to the UK via Paris. A month later he spent some time in Monaco. Mr Preston-Booth says he is £100-a-fortnight in benefits for depression and denies he is pocketing thousands from his begging activities. He told James Mills from The Sun: 'I'm saving up for a little flat and I'm trying to get a CV together so I can get a job. 'I have nothing to hide. I've been homeless and I did beg while I was in London and I have been down since I got my flat in October. I do it to buy things for the flat — not like smackheads who spend it on drugs and beers'. He said his trips abroad were to look for work and he slept rough and got his chip and pin reader when he was selling the Big Issue. His main haunt appears to be the Mamounia Lounge on Curzon Street - a hotspot for the rich and famous. Chief porter Emil Staykov, 45, told the Evening Standard said: 'That guy is really arrogant. He asks our customers for money as they go in and then sleeps in the doorway. 'I have called the police on him loads of times and have been tempted just to throw him out myself. I knew he had money, he always had two phones. 'He was horrible to the restaurant staff but would then be all smiles and jokes with the customers so they gave him money. That is a guy I do not like. We do not want him back'. Well travelled:Mr Preston-Booth has spent time in Ibiza, left, and in Paris, right, in the past six months . Jetting off: The beggar was pictured here at Stansted last year but said his trips abroad were to find work . New home: The beggar says his begging helps him by things for his new £300-a-month flat . Yesterday The Sun said he bought himself a coffee machine, a bathroom cabinet and a plug in grill with more than £100 in total for his new flat. Friends defended him today and one said: 'Everybody has to earn a living damo. There's no judgement here pal'. A female friend told him in an online message: 'You're brill Damien' and another said: 'Damien, you are a legend!' Mayfair business owners alleged Damien Preston-Booth would even arrive in his car before pounding the streets pretending to be disabled to rake in thousands of pounds on the streets of Mayfair. Damien Preston-Booth, 37, is believed to be on Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for his depression, which could earn him up to £108 a week. The Government allows ESA to be paid to people of working age who are too ill to work because of a health condition or disability. You must be under state pension age, not getting statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay and not receiving any jobseeker's allowance. In order to qualify you will have be assessed and after that can earn another £104 a week on top of your benefits for certain types of work. But Mr Preston-Booth's  begging - which is illegal in Britain and punishable by a £1,000 fine - could be considered benefit fraud. The Department for Work and Pensions told MailOnline it never comments on individual cases. However a spokesman said: 'Benefit fraud is a crime and our fraud investigaters will look into all suspected cases. 'If you suspect someone of claiming benefits fraudulently you can report it to the Benefit Fraud Hotline on National Benefit Fraud Hotline 0800 854 440'. Manager Emile Salame said: 'He's a clever man – he speaks to the tourists with a bit of French, Spanish or Arabic. 'When the Arabs come over in the summer he says hello to them in Arabic and gets some money. I've seen some of those guys give him £50 at a time. 'I did wonder if he is homeless. He has two or three phones, an iPad, a camera. We see him outside every night but we've not seen him since last week. He's always on the move but he stays in this area. 'As a homeless man I don't think he should be doing that with the card machine. He told me it was given to him by the Big Issue. 'We've given him sandwiches and hot drinks before but we've had to get the police to move him on from sleeping right outside the restaurant. 'He drives a car though and one morning I even saw him arrive and get coffee out of the back of his car for some police officers. 'I don't think it's fair what he is doing. We all work hard and pay taxes and it pays to help out the genuine homeless people. 'I've seen him acting up and hobbling down the road before and pretending to be disabled, even though there is nothing wrong with him. 'And he dresses up for the occasion, so at Christmas he was wearing a Santa outfit. He's a real entrepreneur, he's making a real business out of it.' Police are looking to ban a fraudulent beggar from Mayfair. Local businesses have grown fed-up with his behaviour and now police are urging them to put their complaints in writing to help them secure a ban against him. The 37-year-old was moved on by officers after allegedly harassing a customer at Noura on December 20. Mr Salame received a note from local officers asking him to fill out a business impact statement to help them apply for a criminal behaviour order against Preston-Booth that would prevent him from operating in the area. He said: 'We are in the process of putting together everything in writing. It is not fair when we are trying to run a business and he is simply irritating customers. 'He was harrassing one of the female customers sitting outside, he was insisting on sitting with her and it wasn't really on. 'We called the police and we have an ongoing thing with them about harassment. He's a naughty person, he should be more respectful, especially with what he gets out of the area.'","Damien Preston-Booth commutes from Preston to London to beg for cash .

"A Spanish court is to hear a paternity suit brought against ex-King Juan Carlos by a 48-year-old Belgian woman who claims to be his daughter. Ingrid Sartiau maintains her mother had a relationship with Juan Carlos that lasted into 1966, the year she was born. Juan Carlos and former Queen Sofia were married in 1962. The 78-year-old could be ordered to take a paternity test if there is sufficient evidence to back the woman's case, a court spokesman said. Scroll down for video . 'He's my father': Belgian housewife Ingrid Sartiau (left), 48, has launched a paternity suit claiming she is the daughter of 78-year-old former Spanish King Juan Carlos (right) It is a further embarrassing episode for the father of King Felipe VI who abdicated last year in a move aimed at restoring the Spanish monarchy's popularity. A string of scandals had identified the royals as woefully out of touch, including a secret, luxury elephant-hunting trip by Juan Carlos in Africa at the height of Spain's economic crisis. The abdication of the 78-year-old former king, who has had health problems and walks with a cane after multiple hip operations, also led to the loss of his judicial immunity. A palace spokesman declined comment on the case yesterday. Paternity suit: Ingrid Sartiau maintains her mother had a relationship with Juan Carlos that lasted into 1966, the year she was born. Juan Carlos and former Queen Sofia were married in 1962 . Spanish King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia wave as they appear on the balcony of the royal palace after the wedding ceremony of Crown Prince Feleipe de Bourbon and Letizia Ortiz in Madrid, Spain, in 2004 . The court rejected another paternity case brought against the former king by a 58-year-old Spanish man, Albert Sola, saying it did not meet legal requirements. Sola has claimed for years that his birth mother, the daughter of a well-known Barcelona banker, may have had an affair with Juan Carlos before he married Queen Sofia. He and Sartiau made headlines in Spain in 2012 when they teamed up and underwent DNA tests that they said showed there was a 91 percent chance that they had one parent in common. Spanish lawmakers rushed through legislation after his abdication to prevent Juan Carlos being tried in ordinary courts. However, he can still be tried in the highest Spanish court, the Supreme Court. Although King Felipe consistently scores highly in opinion polls, his family continues to draw unwelcome headlines. His sister, Cristina de Borbon, is due to stand trial on tax fraud charges in the second half of this year. She will be the first member of the royal family to stand trial since the monarchy was restored in 1975. Juan Carlos was for decades held in high esteem for steering Spain from military dictatorship to democracy. He took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime dictator Gen. Francisco Franco. But his reputation plummeted after he took a secret elephant hunting trip to Botswana in 2012 at the height of Spain's financial crisis. He later apologized for the trip.","Belgian  Ingrid Sartiau, 48, has filed paternity suit against Juan Carlos, 78 .

"The mysterious world of espionage, top secret missions and adventure has intrigued children for generations. Now MI5 and Blue Peter, the BBC’s long running children’s programme, have teamed up to try to find potential 007s of the future. As part of a unique competition, three lucky youngsters will be offered the chance to go on a very special mission behind the scenes at HM Secret Services, in London. Scroll down for video . Blue Peter, Britain's longest-running children's television show (pictured), is seeking three young spies . Former Blue Peter presenter Peter Purves pictured with Petra - the show's beloved pet dog after which the new MI5 venture has been named . Their visit to MI5 headquarters will be filmed for the programme - the first time television cameras have ever been allowed into the top secret building at Thames House. The decision by MI5 to open its doors to television cameras is a milestone in the history of the secret services and a move away from its shadowy past. Viewers aged between the ages of eight and 14 will be invited to apply to ‘Project Petra’ – named after one of the show’s earliest pets – through the Blue Peter website to see if they have what it takes to become a spy. The top eight candidates will be invited to attend a special ‘spy school’ weekend, where they will be put through their paces in a rigorous selection procedure consisting of mental and physical challenges. Three will eventually be chosen to head to the secret base. Bestselling author Anthony Horowitz, who has written the Alex Rider series of books about a teenage agent, is on the selection panel to find the three CBBC Intelligence Officers. Horowitz - also the writer of ITV’s secret service drama Foyle’s War – said: ‘Children are fascinated by the world of spies and secret intelligence and so, for that matter, am I. ‘I’m really thrilled to have been invited to join this top secret panel, it’s going to be a real adventure.’ The contest was launched on tonight's edition of Blue Peter. Editor Ewan Vinnicombe said: ‘Project Petra is one of the most exciting opportunities Blue Peter has ever given its audience. The winners of the competition will tour Thames House (pictured) - the headquarters of MI5 . Bestselling author Anthony Horowitz, who has written the Alex Rider series of books about a teenage agent, is on the selection panel to find CBBC Intelligence Officers . ‘We’re always looking for new ways to help kids understand the world around them and join in with our content and this is a brilliant example of how we can do this on the show, both for the kids taking part and the audience watching on TV and online.’ Cheryl Taylor, controller of CBBC, said: ‘We’re aware that children are fascinated by the mysterious world of intelligence and we’re thrilled to be in a position to feed their passion for intrigue and adventure with this unique proposition. ‘With MI5 and Anthony Horowitz on board we know they will be awestruck by the expert credentials of our partners in this once in a lifetime CBBC opportunity.’ Progress made by the domestic intelligence agency – once notoriously paranoid about hiring gay employees, who were banned until the early Nineties - was further noted earlier this week when it was named among the top ten gay-friendly employers. Campaign group Stonewall described the secret services as making ‘incredible progress’ in hiring gay, lesbian and bisexual workers in a relatively short period of time.","MI5 and Blue Peter team up to launch competition for three lucky children .

"David Cameron may have an uphill task securing the release of Briton Shaker Aamer from Guantanamo Bay because several US Republicans have proposed legislation that would keep most of the prisoners locked up there. They want a moratorium on the release of most of the prisoners held at the notorious Cuban detention centre, saying they posed too much danger to the United States and its allies. 'It's clear that we need a ""time out"" so that we do not re-confront the terrorists that we had captured and are currently in Guantanamo,' said Senator Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire. Campaigners claim that Shaker Aamer, pictured, is assaulted on a regular basis by U.S. military guards . Prime Minister David Cameron, left, said he would raise Mr Aamer's case with President Barack Obama, right . She said the legislation would put a two-year moratorium on the transfer of 'medium- and high-risk detainees' from the facility, which she said were the overwhelming majority of the 127 prisoners still there. The bill would also prohibit transfer of any prisoners from Guantanamo to Yemen for two years. The news follows the revelation that Mr Aamer, the last British resident held in Guantanamo Bay, has been brutally beaten on film at least 315 times by guards. As David Cameron prepared to fly to Washington for talks with Barack Obama seeking his release, it was revealed the father-of-four is routinely assaulted by guards for peaceful protests. Campaigners said the 46-year-old terror suspect, imprisoned at the notorious military camp without charge or trial for almost 13 years, was subjected to a violent procedure known as a 'forcible cell extraction' by teams of riot officers. The prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba was opened in January 2002 to house suspected militants . They urged the Prime Minister, who will raise Mr Aamer's plight at the White House this week, to demand video footage showing chilling evidence of his ill-treatment. According to rights group Amnesty International, Aamer moved to Britain in 1996 and was in Afghanistan doing voluntary work for an Islamic charity when he was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in 2001 and handed to the U.S. military. Aamer's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, welcomed a letter from Cameron promising to raise the case but said this was not enough. 'He has said this before and little has come of it. Rather than just raising Shaker's case, Mr Cameron must come back from Washington with a concrete date for Shaker's return home to London,' said Stafford Smith, director of the charity Reprieve. The prison at the U.S. naval base in Cuba was opened in January 2002 to house suspected militants. President Barack Obama has pledged to close it but he already faces obstacles posed by Congress, not least of which is a ban on transfer of prisoners to the U.S. mainland. The Obama administration moved 28 prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay in 2014, the largest number since 2009. Further transfers are expected in coming weeks but the White House said on Tuesday that Congress is making it hard. 'It will be very, very difficult for us to achieve that goal (closing the prison) before the president leaves office as long as Congress continues to block that path,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain from Arizona said his committee would take up the new legislation, which is likely to gain considerable support in the new Republican-majority Congress. 'We know for a fact that roughly 30 percent of those who have been released have re-entered the fight,' McCain said, speaking at the news conference with Ayotte. An administration official disputed that figure as conflating vastly different categories of 'suspected' and 'confirmed' cases of returns by detainees to terrorist activity. That created a 'damaging misperception' about the rate of re-engagement of former detainees on the battlefield. 'Over 90 percent of the Guantanamo detainees transferred during this administration are neither confirmed nor even suspected of having reengaged in any terrorist or other hostile activity,' the official said. Nearly half of those suspected of 're-engaging' are either dead or in custody, he said. Explaining the proposed ban on repatriation to Yemen, Ayotte referred to the recent deadly attack on French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo. One of two brothers who carried out the attack had traveled to Yemen in 2011 for weapons training, a French official said this week. With such connections, 'the last thing we should be doing is transferring detainees from Guantanamo to a country like Yemen,' Ayotte said. More than half the remaining Guantanamo detainees are from Yemen.","Shaker Aamer has been held by U.S. forces in Guantanamo Bay since 2002 .

"Using the loo means a trip to the dunes, and the only shower is in a communal block - but for house-hunters looking for a back to basics bolthole, these seaside huts could be a perfect fit. The five tiny beach huts, all without a bathroom or mains electricity, sit on Mudeford Spit, near Christchurch, Dorset, which is so remote it can only be reached by ferry or a novelty train. But those looking to escape the stress of the city will need to have more than a little spare change. The huts are on the market for up to £240,000 - as much as a spacious family home in other parts of the country. Scroll down for video . Beach bolthole: Hut 145, pictured centre, on the remote Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, is on the market for a staggering £240,000 . Breathtaking: The five huts which are up for sale all sit on Mudeford Spit, Dorset, above, which can only be reached by ferry or a novelty train . Back to basics: Six people can squeeze into the hut for an overnight stay on two single sofa beds (pictured), bunks and a mezzanine level . Seaside retreat: Hut 78, pictured far right, which boasts breathtaking harbour views, is being sold privately and is on the market for £200,000 . With an asking price of £240,000, hut 145 is the most expensive one on the market. At just 15ft by 10ft, the property costs the equivalent of £1,6000 per square foot - a similar rate to a beachfront mansion in exclusive Sandbanks in nearby Poole. And for the same amount, potential buyers could snap up a five-bedroom home in Liskeard, Cornwall - or splash out on a Ferrari F12 Berlinetta. The property, which boasts picturesque views across to the Isle of Wight, can sleep up to eight people packed into two single sofa beds, fitted bunks and a separate mezzanine sleeping area. It is one of three that is being marketed by Denisons Estate Agents. The firm is also offering hut 224, which looks over the harbour, for £225,000, and hut 131, whose more restricted view gives it a more affordable £185,000 price tag. The huts’ electricity comes via solar panels on the roof which power the lighting, while the kitchen area has a cooker and small fridge which run off a cylinder of camping gas. The other two huts for sale are being sold privately by the owners, both for £200,000. Hut 78 has a harbour view and sleeps four and hut 335 has interrupted beach views. Buyers can only sleep at the huts between March and October, although they can visit any time of year. Last July a 18ft by 12ft hut at Mudeford became Britain's most expensive beach hut when it went on the market for £270,000. Escape the city: This sky-blue hut, number 224, is on the market for £225,000 and offers beautiful views over Christchurch Harbour . Compact: The wooden living area of hut 224 incorporates a kitchen which offers a cooker and small fridge that run off a camping gas bottle . Tight squeeze: The mezzanine level of hut 224, pictured above, offers guests another option for an overnight stay during the summer months . More affordable: Restricted views of the sea mean hut 131, pictured centre, comes with a £185,000 price tag - making it cheaper than average . Sought-after: The interior of hut 131 is bright and airy and offers a relaxed way of life to those looking to escape the stress of city living . Buyers will also have to shell out between £2,500 and £4,000 a year in ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council on top of the cost of a hut and pay a £15,000 transfer fee when they want to sell it. As beach huts are not classified as residential properties, buyers are exempt from paying stamp duty. This cuts thousands of pounds of the overall costs as 2 per cent stamp duty is paid on properties costing up to £250,000. But beach hut-owners are not spared all extra costs. Those who own beach huts on Mudeford Spit have to pay Christchurch Borough Council between £2,500 and £4,000 a year in ground rent. While anyone looking to sell has to pay a £15,000 transfer fee when it changes hands. Andy Denison, from Denisons Estate Agents, said January was a popular time of the year to sell the huts as, just as when booking holidays, would-be buyers often think about their summer plans now. He said: 'A million pounds does sound quite a lot just for five beach huts, but that does reflect how sought-after they are. It is not just a beach hut, it is a lifestyle you are buying into as well. 'It's a busy time of year for beach huts, people are starting to think about their summer plans. 'It's not that much different from travel companies starting to advertise their holidays now. It's something that has snowballed over the last few years. 'They do seem to be fetching around the £200,000-mark now and there are rumours of them going higher than that. 'It's very difficult for us to value the huts, it's governed a lot by location - whether you have that fabulous sea view - although some poeple prefer the harbour side, that's got it's own micro-climate. 'But size and condition come into it too. 'It seems like a lot of money but people are willing to pay that, even though they've still got to rent the land from the council as well. 'I think people just really want to be part of the community. It's quite a rare thing. 'Some people will spend six weeks at their beach hut for the summer holidays, getting into that way of life. 'It's a beautiful part of the world and has some of the nicest beaches. It's not an easy journey for the day so it tends to be quieter than Bournemouth or Southbourne.' In demand: One estate agent said that beach huts in the area tend to fetch around £200,000, adding that prices could rise even higher . Stunning: Hut 335, pictured right, offers uninterrupted sea views. It is being sold privately by the owner and is on the market for £200,000 . Worth the cost: Hut 145, which has no bathroom or mains electricity, does offer the owner stunning views across to the Isle of Wight, above . Carefully-designed: The kitchen inside hut 145, pictured, which is on the market for £240,000, offers a sink, small fridge and cooker .","Five beach huts are on the market for between £185,000 and £240,000 on extremely remote Mudeford Spit, Dorset .

Amy Adams actually won the Golden Globe for her Best Actress performance in Tim Burton's Big Eyes on Sunday night but she was, rather surprisingly, not recognised this year. Recognised: Jennifer and Amy were nominated for Best Actress at the Golden Globes but the later won the award on Sunday . No to Unbroken: Angelina Jolie's wartime epic did not pick up a Best Picture nomination or a Best Director for the actress . Amy had been nominated five times at the Oscars; once for Best Actress and four times for Best Supporting Actress. Instead Marion Cotillard, (Two Days, One Night), Felicity Jones (The Theory Of Everything), Julianne Moore (Still Alice), Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl), and Reese Witherspoon (Wild) are up for the highly-coveted prize. Angelina Jolie was also overlooked in both the Best Director and Best Picture category for her wartime epic Unbroken. Based on the harrowing but inspiring story of Olympian turned World War II prisoner Louis Zamperini, Unbroken seemed set to become an awards season frontrunner but it has been overlooked across the board apart from in the more technical categories. Surprise: Based on the harrowing but inspiring story of Olympian turned World War II prisoner Louis Zamperini, it was thought Unbroken would be an awards frontrunner . She wasn't the only female director to be snubbed as Selma's Ava DuVernay did not get recognised for her work on the civil rights period film. The shortlist was all male featuring Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman), Richard Linklater (Boyhood), Bennett Miller (Foxcatcher) Wes Anderson (The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game). Also missing from the list were the four time Oscar-nominated and twice-winning actor/director Clint Eastwood for American Sniper, as well as Christopher Nolan for his epic Interstellar. It's a shock for most film-lovers to see the Sci-fi blockbuster and Angelina's Unbroken missing from the Best Picture shortlist, considering there are 10 spots in the field and only eight filled. Another year for Jessica: Chastain did not get a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her turn in A Most Violent Year . Missed out: Jake Gyllenhaal and Reno Russo had been celebrated for their performances in Nightcrawler but neither received nods in the Best Actor or Best Supporting Actress categories . Elsewhere, Jessica Chastain did not receive a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her turn in A Most Violent Year but Emma Stone picked up her first ever Oscar nomination in the same category. Jake Gyllenhaal, Riz Ahmed and Reno Russo had been celebrated for their performances in Nightcrawler but not one of them received a nod in the Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor or Best Supporting Actress categories. Same goes for British actor Timothy Spall, who won the Best Actor award at last year's Cannes Film Festival for his role as the titular character in Mr. Turner, but failed to secure a nod at the Oscars or the BAFTAs.

"An airline passenger suffered serious head injuries after plunging 70ft at Gatwick Airport in the early hours of this morning. Armed anti-terror police were among the first on the scene to help the badly-injured man after the fall in the North Terminal at 12.50am today.

"Two miles below the surface of the ocean, researchers have discovered new microbes that 'breathe' sulfate. The microbes, which have yet to be classified and named, exist in massive undersea aquifers — networks of channels in porous rock beneath the ocean where water continually churns, researchers say. About one-third of the Earth's biomass is thought to exist in this largely uncharted environment. Scroll down for video . Researchers lowered this robolab complete with drill  through two miles of ocean and bored through several hundred feet of ocean sediment and into the rock where the aquifer flows. Sulfate is a compound of sulfur and oxygen that occurs naturally in seawater. It is used commercially in everything from car batteries to bath salts and can be aerosolized by the burning of fossil fuels, increasing the acidity of the atmosphere. Microbes that breathe sulfate — that is, gain energy by reacting sulfate with organic (carbon-containing) compounds — are thought to be some of the oldest types of organisms on Earth. 'It was surprising to find new bugs, but when we go to warmer, relatively old and isolated fluids, we find a unique microbial community,' said Alberto Robador, of USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, who led the study. Sulfate is a compound of sulfur and oxygen that occurs naturally in seawater. It is used commercially in everything from car batteries to bath salts and can be aerosolized by the burning of fossil fuels, increasing the acidity of the atmosphere. Microbes that breathe sulfate — that is, gain energy by reacting sulfate with organic (carbon-containing) compounds — are thought to be some of the oldest types of organisms on Earth. Other species of sulfate-breathing microbes can be found in marshes and hydrothermal vents. Microbes beneath the ocean's crust, however, are incredibly tricky to sample. Researchers from USC and the University of Hawaii took their samples from the Juan de Fuca Ridge (off the coast of Washington state), where previous teams had placed underwater laboratories, drilled into the ocean floor. To place the labs, they lowered a drill through two miles of ocean and bored through several hundred feet of ocean sediment and into the rock where the aquifer flows. 'Trying to take a sample of aquifer water without contaminating it with regular ocean water presented a huge challenge,' said Jan Amend, of the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI), which helped fund the research. The labs create a seal at the seafloor, like a cork in a bottle, allowing scientists to deploy instruments and sampling devices down a borehole while keeping ocean water out. To solve this problem, C-DEBI created Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit (CORK) observatories. The moniker was basically dreamed up to fit the term 'CORK' because these devices create a seal at the seafloor, like a cork in a bottle, allowing scientists to deploy instruments and sampling devices down a borehole while keeping ocean water out. Samples were then shuttled to the surface by remote-controlled undersea vehicles or 'elevators' — balloons that drop ballast and float samples gently up to the waiting scientists. Like the microbes on the forest floor that break down leaf litter and dead organisms, the microbes in the ocean also break down organic material like dead fish and algae. Unlike their counterparts, however, the microbes beneath the ocean crust often lack the oxygen that is used on land to effect the necessary chemical reaction. Instead, these microbes can use sulfate to break down carbon from decaying biological material that sinks to the sea bottom and makes its way into the crustal aquifer, producing carbon dioxide. Learning how these new microbes function will be important to getting a more accurate, quantified understanding of the overall global carbon cycle — a natural cycling of carbon through the environment in which it is consumed by plants, exhaled by animals and enters the ocean via the atmosphere. This cycle is currently being disrupted by man-made carbon dioxide emissions. 'This is the first direct account of microbial activity in these type of environments,' Robador said, 'and shows the potential of these organisms to respire organic carbon.'","Microbes exist in massive undersea aquifers beneath the ocean .

"The Duchess of York has been criticised for linking a top university to a controversial diet plan which she is endorsing on American television. Prince Andrew's ex-wife claims to have lost 4st thanks to a £65 blender which turns fruit and vegetables into smoothies and soup. In an interview promoting the product on morning TV, she said that she had been motivated to help beat obesity by her work with Imperial College London, one of the world's most prestigious scientific institutions. Scroll down for video . Controversy: The Duchess of York is endorsing the Fusion Xcelerator, a blender and diet plan . Row: Imperial College London, pictured, where the duchess is an ambassador, has distanced itself from her commercial activities . But the university has been quick to distance itself from the duchess' claims - saying that her commercial projects 'are not connected in any way' to its research, The Times reported. Experts said they were sceptical about the benefits of her diet plan, casting doubt on the nutritional benefits claimed to come from using the 'emulsifier' which she has promoted in a half-hour 'infomercial' as well as multiple TV interviews. The duchess, known in the US by her maiden name as Sarah Ferguson, has been outspoken about her battle with her weight since divorcing her husband in 1996 and is said to have been paid £1.4million a year as the face of Weight Watchers. Last year, she was named as an ambassador for Imperial's Institute of Global Health Innovation, a well-respected research centre headed by renowned surgeon and former health minister Lord Darzi. Her latest commercial endorsement, as part of a project named 'Duchess Discoveries', is the Fusion Xcelerator, a blender costing $100 (£65) which comes with a diet plan and fitness DVD. Earlier this week she appeared on NBC's Today show, giving an interview in which she linked the device to her unpaid work with Imperial. Promotion: The duchess used a TV interview to speak about losing weight thanks to the 'emulsifier' She told host Matt Lauer: 'I have just found out on my discoveries with Imperial College London... I'm an ambassador for the Institute for Global Health Innovation, and I found out that children, little children, are going to die before their parents because of obesity.' The duchess called the emulsifier 'a solution for behavioural change' as she claimed to have lost 55lbs by using the blender to liquify her food. Imperial warned that its scientists did not endorse the Xcelerator and cautioned against the use of the university's name in connection with the product. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Sarah Ferguson holds an unpaid role as an ambassador for Imperial's Institute of Global Health Innovation. The role is to raise the profile of the Institute and its impact. 'The commercial activities promoted by Sarah Ferguson in the interview with Today are not connected in any way to Imperial's staff or research activities, and the College does not endorse the suggestion of any possible link.' The duchess' spokesman told The Times: 'She is not trying to use her association with the institute to promote her personal interests. She was talking about ""behavioural change"", which is endorsed by the institute, and her own behavioural change.' Website: The product is prominently promoted on the duchess' personal homepage . Family: The duchess, pictured with her ex-husband Prince Andrew and their daughter Beatrice, has had a number of high-profile endorsements since her divorce . Imperial College London, which was founded in 1907 and specialises in science, technology and medicine, is considered to be one of the best universities in the world. A global league table recently ranked the institution second overall, joint with Cambridge and behind only the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The university has its headquarters in South Kensington, west London, around the corner from the Natural History Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum. Imperial teaches 13,400 undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as hosting thousands of top research scientists and professors. Its staff and alumni have won 15 Nobel Prizes - they include eminent scientists such as Peter Higgs, who discovered the Higgs boson, and Alexander Fleming. Other former students of the university found fame outside academia, such as sci-fi novelist H.G Wells and Queen's guitarist Brian May. An advert on the duchess' website claims that the Xcelerator has a 'powerful micro-emulsification system' and can 'break down whole fruits and vegetables into a micro-cellular pre-digestive state'. But scientists suggested that it was no different to any other blender and warned that a mixture of healthy eating and exercise remains the best way to avoid excessive weight gain. 'In terms of the particular product, no juicer or blender on their own can enhance how much nutrition your body will absorb,' Ayela Spiro of the British Nutrition Foundation told The Times. 'Any claims made about such products such that it accelerates weight loss, boosts energy and strengthens the immune system need to be treated with caution.' The interview in which the Duchess of York made her controversial comments previously made headlines after she used it to defend her ex-husband Andrew against claims he had sex with an underage girl supplied to him by a convicted paedophile. Other commercial products believed to be forthcoming from the Duchess of York include a range of kitchen utensils and specialist tea.","Duchess has endorsed £65 'emulsifier' which liquifies fruit and vegetables .

"A grieving dental nurse who piled on the pounds grieving the loss of her best friend has shed more than four stone to turn herself into a muscle-bound beauty queen. Sarah Jayne Maher, 26, from Denton, Greater Manchester, ballooned to 13 stone 12lbs and suffered severe depression after the loss of her best friend Simone Hill in a car crash in January 2011. But after seeing a picture of herself looking overweight on a night out with friends, the 5ft 3in blonde shed the pounds and bulked up into a body-building beauty queen. Sarah Jane Maher piled on the pounds after the death of her best friend, but has since gone on to lose 4st and now competes as a body building beauty queen (right) And she is set to compete as Miss Manchester in the Miss Galaxy UK pageant on February 8. Sarah was left severely depressed after the death of Simone, who was tragically killed in a car crash in Reddish, Greater Manchester, while travelling to meet up on her 18th birthday. The horse-mad pair had always been active as they groomed and cared for Sarah's first horse, Rusty, after he was given to her as an eighth birthday present. Sarah said: 'I was athletic as a kid and I was always with my horses and Simone, competing in horse shows three times a month. Sarah was inspired to go into body building after a chance meeting with female weight-lifter Kizzy Vaines . Sarah was determined to lose the weight after seeing a photo of her on a night out (left) she has since gone on to win the North Wales Miss Bikini trophy (right) 'But once she died, I just wanted to get rid of any reminder of her. The memories were just too painful. 'I realise now that it was a mistake. I even had to give my horse, George, to a friend to look after for me. 'I was so depressed. I didn't want to go out, I didn't want to do anything. All I did was stay in and eat.' Sarah binged on takeaways every night and scoffed crisps and chocolate for 18 months. But after seeing a picture of herself on a rare night out in York, she vowed to turn her life around and hit the weights. Before the tragic death of her friend Sarah lead an active lifestyle but says that grieving kept her housebound . Sarah swapped her diet of greasy takeaways and took on a seven days-a-week training schedule . Sarah attended the Body Power Expo at the NEC in Birmingham where a chance meeting with professional body builder Kizzy Vaines inspired her to sculpt her eight-stone frame. Sarah said: 'I saw the picture and I couldn't believe that was me. I just couldn't recognise myself. 'I just could not believe what I had done to myself. 'Meeting Kizzy changed my life. Without her, I would have just been another overweight person aimlessly jogging on a treadmill.' Sarah embarked on a seven-days-a-week training schedule, ditched fatty foods and takes on a rigorous 45-minute cardio regime to get into shape for competitions. She debuted at the North Wales Open in 2013 and stunned judges, grabbing second prize. Sarah said: 'I was really pleased with how I did at my first competition. Sarah, pictured here in her contesting gown, is now due to compete in several beauty pageants this year . Sarah, pictured with her Miss Galaxy Manchester sash, has already bagged several prizes . 'When you have gone from being huge to finishing second in a pageants it's like ""is this really happening?"".' Sarah, who works as a dental nurse, has dreams of turning professional after her Miss Galaxy appearance with several more pageants pencilled in for the rest of the year. She said: 'I would love to turn pro. I don't do this for the medals, I do it because it makes me feel great and I am really interested in the athletic side of it. 'The last time I competed I was in the best shape of my life and I just want to carry it on. 'And my family and friends are all really proud of me. My mum was initially against it because she was worried that I would become one of the really muscly body builders with no neck!

But when she prodded it with her cane, the snake's head moved. A policeman holds up the python snake after it's captured from Debbie LaMotte's home . The incident happened about 4 a.m. Tuesday at her apartment in Riverview Manor in Sharon - about 60 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. When Police arrived LaMotte wound up the snake on her 'old lady grabber' - a long-handled device that helps people pick up items without bending over. The snake was able to be safely put into a bag and taken away. She believes the snake may have been a slither-away pet that squeezed under her front door. The reptile was identified as a ball python - which is usually found in Africa but is a popular breed for pets. Adult ball pythons usually measure between 5 to 6 feet long. They roll up into a tight ball when they feel threatened.","Debbie LaMotte thought  a scarf was on her floor due to its pattern before realizing it was a snake .

"Four frogs, 22 birds and 27 mammals have become extinct since Australian colonisation and now the Bramble Cay melomys can be added to the list. The mouse-like creature has not been sighted since 2007 at the Torres Strait's Bramble Cay on Australia's most northern tip. Scientists appointed by Gregory Andrews - the nation's first Threatened Species Commissioner - were also unable to find traces of it in the Torres Strait's Bramble Cay. The Western Barred Bandicoot, one of 27 mammals have become extinct since Australian colonisation . The melomys was found only in four to five hectares of the area, and related to rats and mice, according to The Conversation. World Wildlife Fund Australia's conservation scientist Martin Taylor said Australia had the highest extinction rate in the world in the past 200 years for mammals. 'It really affects critical weight range mammals who are smallish mammals, a bit like Bramble Cay melomys,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Part of the reason why is they are ground dwelling mammals that are prey for exotic cats and foxes. Those are the sorts of mammals that go extinct.' The Christmas Island pipsterelle was the most recent animal to go extinct. The Lord Howe Boobook Owl, which is on the Federal Department of Environment list of extinct animals . Usually scientists wait at least 50 years before declaring an animal to be extinct. The Federal Department of Environment has a full list of extinct animals, including the Western Barred Bandicoot, Paradise Parrot and the Lord Howe Boobook Owl. But Dr Taylor said some of these extinct animals can be kept in captivity, while others do not exist on the mainland, they can still call an island home. For example, the Tasmanian Tiger lived on the mainland until 4,000 years ago when the dingo was introduced and was confined to Tasmania before becoming extinct in the 1920s. Dr Taylor said more direct efforts to conserve endangered species needed to be ramped up, not just through funding, but legislation as well. 'Money is definitely an issue but it's also how that money is applied. A lot of money is spent on ethical land care and natural resources management but not to obtain enduring change in the landscape,' he said. Paradise Parrot, last last seen alive in 1927. Usually scientists wait at least 50 years before declaring an animal to be extinct. 'First thing that could be done is protecting Commonwealth threatened species. 'We get $2 billion over five years so we should make sure this money is spent on enduring change and conservation. 'The biggest and strongest thing to do is to protect species by buying buy a national park to protect [where the species live]. 'But it's not just money, we've got legislation to stop land clearing, which has probably been far more effective than anything. 'We see the government in Queensland, for example, weakening that legislation and this is increasing the threat to native wildlife.'","The Bramble Cray melomys is the latest animal that could be extinct .

"President Barack Obama rolled out . a sweeping set of measures on Thursday to significantly ease the . half-century-old embargo against Cuba, opening up the country to . expanded travel, trade and financial activities. The new regulations, which take effect on Friday, will allow . Americans to travel to Cuba for any of a dozen specific reasons, . including family visits, education and religion, without first . obtaining a special license from the U.S. government as was . previously the case. Though general tourism will still be banned, those U.S. travelers who do visit will be allowed to bring home small amounts of . the Cuban cigars that are highly rated by aficionados. Scroll down for video . Tourists sunbathe as a vendor sells kites decorated with Cuba's flag on a beach near Havana, Cuba. A new set of U.S. government regulations that take effect on Friday, will severely loosen the 50-year long travel and trade restrictions on the country, but Americans still won't be able to go to Cuba just for vacation . The United States will ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba in keep with last month's agreement to begin normalizing ties with the Cold War-era foe. The White House said today it thinks Congress should throw out an embargo on travel to Cuba . Defying hardline critics in Congress, Obama . made good on a commitment he made a month ago to begin loosening . some U.S. economic sanctions against the communist-ruled island . as part of an effort to end decades of hostility. The Treasury and Commerce Departments issued a package of . new rules that will allow U.S. exports of telecommunications, . agricultural and construction equipment, permit expanded travel . to Cuba and authorize some kinds of banking relations. It was the first tangible U.S. step to implement the changes . Obama pledged on Dec. 17 when he and Cuban President Raul Castro . announced plans to restore diplomatic relations between the old . Cold War foes. 'Today's announcement takes us one step closer to replacing . out-of-date policies that were not working and puts in place a . policy that helps promote political and economic freedom for the . Cuban people,' Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a . statement. The revamped rules will also make it easier for U.S. companies to export mobile phone devices and software as well as . to provide Internet services in Cuba. U.S. airlines will be . permitted to expand flights to the Caribbean island. In an expansion of remittances allowed, Americans will now . be able to send up to $8,000 to Cuba a year, up from the $2,000 . previously permitted, and bring $10,000 with them when they . travel to the country. They will also be able to use credit and . debit cards in Cuba and bring up to $400 worth of goods back to America with them. That amount includes $100 of alcohol and tobacco products. In addition, there will be a change in the definition of . 'cash in advance' payment required by Cuban buyers, which could . help a variety of business interests, most notably U.S. agriculture, in gaining greater access to Cuban markets. The announcement was made after the Obama administration . said on Monday that Castro's government had fulfilled its . promise to free 53 political prisoners as agreed with the U.S. government. Keith Matasci shops for cigars at the Mission Pipe Shop on in San Jose, California, in December. Though general tourism to Cuba will still be banned, those U.S.travelers who do visit the country will be allowed to bring home small amounts of the Cuban cigars that are highly rated by aficionados . It also comes a week before high-level U.S.-Cuba . talks in Havana aimed at starting to normalize ties. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson will hold high-level negotiations in Havana on Jan. 21-22 aimed at starting the normalization process. The discussions will include efforts to reopen embassies in both countries. Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, called the steps a . 'significant step' in delivering on Obama's new direction on . Cuba. In announcing the shift in December, the president said . that decades of trying to force change in Cuba by isolating the . island had not worked. 'We firmly believe that allowing increased travel, commerce, . and the flow of information to and from Cuba will allow the . United States to better advance our interests and improve the . lives of ordinary Cubans,' he said in a statement. But Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and . forceful critic of the policy shift, said it would hurt ordinary . Cubans. 'This is a windfall for the Castro regime that will be used . to fund its repression against Cubans, as well as its activities . against U.S. national interests in Latin America and beyond,' he . said in a statement. While Obama is using executive powers to poke holes in trade . barriers with Cuba, only Congress can lift the longstanding . embargo. 'Normalizing relations with Cuba would allow greater travel,' Earnest told reporters today.

"A British woman dying of cancer faces being separated from her American husband after UK immigration officials say he can only stay in the country if she gets a job. Sally Piasecki, 63, from Wallington in Surrey, fled an abusive relationship in 1996 and moved to Florida in the U.S. where she settled and married master carpenter Walter Piasecki. She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008 and when doctors told her she had a maximum of 12 years to live, the couple decided to sell their Florida home and move back to the UK in 2012. Cancer sufferer Sally Piasecki, 63, faces being separated from her husband Walter (left) unless she gets a job . But now the couple have been told that Mr Piasecki has no right to remain in the country unless she has a job paying at least £18,600, despite the fact the disease has left her  disabled. Mrs Piasecki wanted to spend her remaining years with her family, including her two daughters Nicola, 42, and Joann, 40, but now faces being separated from her husband. She said: 'My parents were both in the navy, I'm a true-blue Brit. But I am disabled, I am losing the use of my left arm with thoracic outlet syndrome, my left side is wasting away. 'I don't have thyroids after I developed cancer. I will be visiting the Royal Marsden [Hospital] for the rest of my life. 'We gave up everything we owned in America, so I could spend my final years with my family. My husband looks after me, I can't even get in the shower on my own. 'I've only got a few years left and they are doing this to me.' The couple sold their home in Florida so they could be closer to Mrs Piasecki's family after she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008 . A change in immigration rules in 2012 brought in the ruling, which states returning British citizens must have a job that pays more than £18,600 if they wish to bring their partner with them. Last month they were told Mr Piasecki was being denied the right to remain, even though he works as her carer. Since July 2012, the Immigration Rules have contained a financial requirement to be met by a person applying for entry clearance to remain in the UK. The minimum income threshold for a couple is £18,600 - which rises to £22,400 where the application includes sponsorship of a non-EU child. However, the financial requirement does not apply to a child who is a British citizen. Acceptable 'evidence' includes bank statements  on official bank stationery, electronic bank statements,  building society statements or a letter from a financial institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for money in overseas accounts. Source: Home Office . Mrs Piasecki added: 'I have lived away from my children for so long and now we are reunited they want to take my husband away.' She has been told that if she wants to stay with her husband she should return to the States, but with her conditions it is unlikely she will find employment. Without a job she would be ineligible for medical insurance, making hospital bills expensive. A Home Office spokesman said applications were considered on their individual merits, 'including any compelling and compassionate circumstances, and in line with the immigration rules'. Her fight has been taken on by Wallington and Carshalton MP Tom Brake. He said: 'Every now and again there are immigration cases where there is a need for the Home Office to show flexibility and compassion and this is one of those cases. 'This is a couple who have been married for many years and who want to live with their family in the UK and can not return to America for medical reasons. 'I hope it might still be possible to allow them to remain in the UK. I will continue to see what other options might be open in terms of right of appeal.'","Sally Piasecki, 63, moved to Florida, U.S., in 1996 and married carpenter .

Police arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder after the attack and said they are not looking for any other suspects. The suspect, who lives locally, has not been charged. Police said they hope to release further information later today. Witnesses said that a man entered the store shouting 'white power' while carrying a large knife - possibly a machete - in one hand, and what looked like a hammer in the other. The store was closed by police yesterday as officers investigated the incident but has since reopened. Rich Fay, 20, of Eryrys, near Mold, was in the store with his father Dave at 1.40pm yesterday, when the attack took place. Mr Fay said: 'The incident took place in the aisle immediately in front of the front door.' 'We were in the magazine aisle and heard a loud scream which we thought, given the time, might have been some school kids or something. 'We hung around for a while and then heard someone shout ""white power"".

Police occupied the car park and blocked off all entrances to and from the store shortly after the incident. People were warned not to go near Tesco and the vicinity of the shop was cordoned off. Mr Fay said: 'It was chaotic. The staff told everyone to get out of the store. 'Everyone was bewildered, quite a few shoppers didn't realise what had gone on, it was surreal.' Michael Ball, from Mold, was walking past the store at Ponterwyl with his partner as the scenes were unfolding. He said: 'We spoke to staff and shoppers who said two men were running around the store, one chasing another, with a hammer and a long curved blade. 'Some described it as a machete, one man was heard to be shouting ""white power"".'

'As a result the man sustained serious but not life threatening injuries and was conveyed to a local hospital. 'Initial indications are this is a racially motivated attack and as such management of the community impact will feature significantly in order to provide public reassurance. He added: 'I understand speculation is circulating via social media but this will not help our investigation and is distressing to family and friends of the victim and so I'd ask for due consideration whilst investigators speak with witnesses to ascertain the full circumstances of this incident. A police van was photographed parked outside the supermarket yesterday as police investigated the scene . 'North Wales Police are treating the matter as attempted murder and if you witnessed the attack please contact Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and quote reference S006316.

"In a new wrinkle to an old crime, hundreds of New Yorkers have been tricked into paying ransoms by wire transfer to callers who falsely claim to have kidnapped their family members, according to the FBI. In these 'virtual kidnappings,' scammers make random calls to find their victims, saying a loved one has been snatched and demanding the immediate transfer of small sums of money to have them released, the FBI said. Some calls feature screaming in the background to convince a victim of the authenticity of an abduction, the FBI said. 'There have been hundreds of the hoax kidnappings just in New York over the last 18 months,' FBI spokesman Peter Donald said on Wednesday. Beware: 'Virtual kidnapping', in which someone calls claiming to have kidnapped a relative and demanding a ransom, is on the rise, with hundreds of cases in the past year,  the FBI warned . 'This is hundreds of people who have actually wired money to them.' The scammers appear to be Hispanic males, the FBI said, and victims have been instructed to send ransoms, which have reached up to $1,900, to Puerto Rico. They usually start around $600. The New York City victims are also Hispanic, and some 'may not be here legally and might not be comfortable reaching out to law enforcement,' Donald said. 'This is a scheme that takes advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in New York City,' George Venizelos, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York field office, said in a statement released on Tuesday. Potential victim: Maddie Montoya said that she call from a man claiming to have kidnapped her brother, however she was suspicious because the story 'didn't make sense' Perpetrators have resorted to an array of fictitious scenarios to coerce victims, many of whom were told the loved one was being held to settle a narcotics debt or to recover compensation for smuggling illegal immigrants or car accidents, the FBI said. The scheme has been around for years, according to the FBI, but its growing popularity has pushed the agency to raise awareness. Virtual kidnapping is most common in Latin America, according to a report from Control Risks, a strategic consultancy.","Scammers targeting New Yorkers with fake kidnappings .

"A man charged with the murder of his wife sold her clothes to buy drugs, her family claims. Kyle Crosby, 28, was charged on Tuesday with killing his 26-year-old wife Erica Crippen Crosby, two weeks after she went missing. Crosby, who is said to have gone on a drug binge after Mrs Crippen Crosby disappeared, sold some of her clothes to pay for narcotics, her family says. Kyle Crosby (left), who is charged with murdering his wife Erica Crippen Crosby (right), sold her clothes to buy drugs, her family says . The 26-year-old gave birth to her daughter (pictured) three months ago. The new mother has been missing for almost two weeks . The mother-of-two was last seen at a restaurant with her husband on New Year's Eve, posting a picture on Facebook that evening. Crosby told Mrs Crippen Crosby's family the next day that she had gone missing, but did not inform police until a week later after they visited to check up on his daughter who had not been to school for a week, NBC New York reported. After he was questioned, Crosby went missing and, until his arrest on Monday, had not been seen since going on a drug binge with a prostitute, sources said. Crosby was taken into custody by officers after a traffic stop and a short chase on foot. He was driving his wife's missing red Ford Taurus when he was stopped. According to a release from the Mount Laurel Police Department, investigators found several items they believe 'have evidential value in connection to her disappearance' in the trunk of the vehicle. The couple lived together in Mount Laurel, New Jersey with their two children - Crosby's seven-year-old daughter from a prior relationship and their three-month-old baby girl - and have been married for almost a year. Crosby (left), 28, was seen on a drug binge with a prostitute in the days after Mrs Crippen Crosby (right) went missing . Missing: The mother-of-two was last seen at a restaurant with her husband on New Year's Eve . Mrs Crippen Crosby left their apartment on the night she went missing without her coat, keys or purse, her family said. Her cousin Sonay Romas-Kellan said: 'It's not like Erica to just walk out of the house and leave her kids.' Her sister Janiya Crippen added: 'If you all were arguing you could have come to me or walked away. 'Kyle, she loved you! She loved you so much! She really wanted you to do better! He was in a rehabilitation center last month, trying to get clean. She loved him. And she wanted him to be a better father to her kid.' Crosby was also charged with two counts of child endangerment last week. He is being held in county jail on a $1.2million bail. According to reports, the alleged murderer has previous convictions for drug and robbery offenses. Mrs Crippen Crosby's body has not been found.

"She's been in the industry for more than 20 years, runs her own blog and was handpicked to style TU at Sainsbury's tenth anniversary collection, so it's safe to say that Louise Redknapp knows a thing or two about fashion. FEMAIL wanted to tap into Louise's magic so we've snapped her (and her best friend and business partner Emma Thatcher) up to serve as MailOnline's resident style gurus. The duo, who run A Style Album with their friends, will be sharing their top tips on fashion, beauty, interior and all things style. Scroll down for video . Meet FEMAIL's new resident style gurus: Louise Redknapp, right, and her best friend and business partner Emma Thatcher, left, will be blogging for MailOnline about all things fashion, beauty, interior and style . When Louise met Emma through their husbands they quickly bonded over their love of fashion. 'Emma and I got to the stage where we would constantly text each other pictures of what we were wearing or what we wanted to buy,' explained 40-year-old Louise. And now they want to share their passion with MailOnline readers. 'For me, knowing that you could show one of your friends something and get an honest opinion - especially  when I was working or doing a red carpet without a stylist - was great. 'Em and our circle of friends would offer me advice and it made me feel so much more confident. 'That's what we want our blog to be: like an online mate.' Louise has launched trend blog, A Style Album, with former Matches Fashion stylist Emma Thatcher . Louise and Emma want their blog to be an 'online mate' for women who work and lead busy lives but still want to be stylish. They also want to appeal to a wide audience, including older women who love fashion . Louise, who is married to football legend Jamie Redknapp, and Emma, who worked as a stylist for Matches Fashion and works as a Fashion Buyer for a boutique called Club, added: 'We're not saying we're fashion experts. 'We're saying that we're interested in it and bringing it to the masses who, like us, do have busy lives, have work, have children and still want to be in style.' The pair, whose personal blog is loved by the likes of Cat Deeley, say they want to help give women that 'little bit of morning inspiration' when it comes to dressing. 'We can all lose confidence and I definitely think that when you've had children  you lose your way for a little while afterwards,' admitted Louise, who is mother to two boys Charley, 10, and Beau, 4. Louise and Emma also want to appeal to a wide audience, including older women who love fashion. 'It's just about wearing your clothes in a way that suits you,' said Louise. 'My mum loves my wardrobe and nine times out of 10 she can be spotted in my clothes. 'She's in her 60s and she looks great, a lot of times better than me!' 'We can all lose confidence and I definitely think that when you've had children you lose your way for a little while afterwards,' admits Louise, who is mother to two young boys, and wants to help give women a little 'morning inspiration' The pair emphasise that you can wear whatever you want; it's all in the styling. If you're 19 and you want to wear leather trousers, the stylish duo recommend wearing them with a crop top and stilettos. If you're 60, wear them with a cute  court shoe and a blazer. 'You'd have to be a multi-millionaire to always be fashionable but to be stylish, it's just about accessorising to suit your figure and your age,' Louise said. So what should we all be channelling come spring? Bright, bold colours and playful prints, Louise and Emma advise. They also loved the romantic elements on the Chloe catwalk and think Victoria Beckham has done 'brilliantly'. Louise said: 'Her shop is incredible and she's completely respected. I take my hat off to her because she was really up against it and a lot of people wanted her to fail and I know how much hard work goes into being successful. 'She's got a great eye and is quite particular and has definitely grown into herself.' As well as offering fashion tips, the blog will delve into beauty, too. After launching and running her own organic make-up brand, Wild About Beauty, which is loved by the likes of Princess Beatrice, Louise is extremely well-placed to share her advice. Louise said: 'I've loved working on Wild About Beauty and I've learnt a lot, which has really helped with blogging because you have to be aware of what's going on around you and trends.'

"Director Peter Jackson has announced he is putting his energy into helping launch a museum to commemorate World War One after finishing his 'Hobbit' movie trilogy. If he has any plans for future blockbusters, he's certainly not saying. Jackson was speaking at his New Zealand post-production facility where he was helping host an event to promote the local film industry. Peter Jackson, giving actors Luke Evans (Bard the Bowman) and John Bell (Bain) some direction in the filming of the latest Hobbit film, is set to open a museum . Jackson is a World War I history buff who owns a number of planes from the era. He said the plan for the Wellington museum was to open during April to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli battle. The bloody campaign in Turkey left 130,000 men dead, including at least 87,000 Ottoman soldiers and 44,000 Allied soldiers. Of the allies, 2,779 New Zealanders (around a fifth of the number who had landed on the peninsula) and more than 8,700 Australians were killed. Jackson said more galleries would be opened over the coming four years to mark other battles in which New Zealanders fought. A scene from Jackson's blockbuster The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies film, featuring Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf (centre) Jackson hopes the museum will highlight the struggles of New Zealanders who fought in the Gallipoli campaign during the First World War . The New Zealand Herald newspaper reported earlier that Jackson had been recruited by the government to curate the museum, and he was expected to gather aircraft, tanks and other artifacts from private and public collections. 'That's where most of my time is now, which is good,' Jackson said Wednesday. 'It's fun. And it's free. The exhibits will be very, very interesting, and I'm enjoying it.' Jackson said he was also enjoying getting some rest after finishing the 'Hobbit' - although he wasn't entirely done, because he was still working on an extended version for DVD release. Jackson owns a number of aircraft that were used in the First World War (File Photo) Movie director Peter Jackson talks to reporters at an event to promote the New Zealand film industry . But he said he was happy to take a break from new film projects for a while. 'It's the first time in five years that I haven't woken up in the morning and had deadlines' he said. '... no phones ringing, screaming `When are we going to see this? When are we going to do that?' And I'd forgotten what that's like. So I'll let that last for a little bit longer before I destroy it.' The trilogy finale, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,' has so far earned $783 million  around the world after opening in most places in mid-December. To date, the trilogy has earned a total $2.76 billion at the box office.","Jackson owns  planes from era and is a World War I history buff .

"A Manhattan teen was distraught when she found the message 'trash like you' scrawled in her takeout box from trendy New York City burger spot Umami Burger, but learning the truth behind the message would make her feel even worse. Juliette Borghesan, 15, found the message on Sunday as she recovered from a nasty bout with pneumonia and her father treated her to the meaty treat. After her father called the restaurant to vent his outrage, the responsible Umami employee soon called to apologize--and to reveal that the to-go box had been filled with actual garbage throughout the day. Sick to her stomach: As she recovered slowly from a nasty bout with pneumonia, 15-year-old Juliette Borghesan was further sickened when she heard hear takeout box from Manhattan's Umami Burger had contained trash .

Not that that matters to Juliette. 'I’m sick to my stomach,' the teen told DNAinfo after the employee, who's not been identified, told the family the box had been used 'as a trash can for the entire day'. According to the employee, the trash was dumped out and the box used for Juliette's food after the restaurant ran out of takeout containers. 'It's a lot more severe now than just handwriting on a box,' her father Tom Borghesan fumed. 'You threatened the health of my daughter, who is presently very ill.' Juliette had already started digging in to her food when she noticed the message, DNA Info reports. And Umami Burger has since released a statement, which reads: . 'The writing on the box was an obvious mistake and was not intended for the customer. We've apologized to the customer and are dealing with the matter internally.' Unsatisfied, Juliette's father apparently pressed further and Umami Burger CEO Paul Clayton called him to personally apologize. Clayton also told Mr. Borghesan that the former employee was incorrect when he told them the box had contained trash. The Umami Burger spokesman also said the company was 'dealing with the matter internally.'

"The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson says the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. Google is working on sensors to detect road signs and other vehicles, and software that analyzes all the data. Scroll down for video . Google is talking to car giants including  General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, DaimlerAG and Volkswagen AG in a bid to bring self driving cars to the road in 2020. The small, bulbous cars without steering wheels or pedals are being tested at a Google facility in California. Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters Wednesday at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that Google doesn't know yet how it will make money on the cars. Urmson wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. 'What we really need is to get to the point where we're learning about how people interact with it, how they are using it, and how can we best bring that to market as a product that people care for,' he said. Google  may face state regulatory hurdles depending on where it chooses to test the cars in public. Under legislation that Google persuaded California lawmakers to pass in 2012, self-driving cars must have a steering wheel and pedals. Several other states have passed laws formally allowing autonomous cars on public roads without that restriction. The company in December announced that it had a fully functioning prototype that's been driving on its test track. The small, bulbous cars without steering wheels or pedals are being tested at a Google facility in California. It hoped to see the cars on the road in northern California this year, but they would have to have safety drivers and temporary manual controls. Google also confirmed that it has hired Roush Enterprises Inc., a Detroit-area company that designs and builds prototypes for the auto industry, to build 150 prototype Google autonomous cars. Urmson said Google is making laser and other sensors for the cars smaller and less costly. He predicted that the cars would fail at some point on public roads, but said Google's cars have been driven more than 700,000 miles on public roads without causing a crash. Google has begun discussions with most of the world's top . automakers in a bid to get self driving cars on the road by 2020. 'We'd be remiss not to talk to ... the biggest auto . manufacturers. They've got a lot to offer,' Chris Urmson, . director of Google's self-driving car project, said. Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to  begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. The cars are also expected to be electric, capable of going 100 miles (160 km) before needing to be recharging. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in an attempt to be safer for pedestrians. The prototypes are restricted to speeds of 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company's current fleet of vehicles. But ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service, using GPS technology to locate the vehicle's exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree 'view', with sensors linked to computer software able to 'see' and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. Those manufacturers, he said, include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, DaimlerAG and Volkswagen AG. 'For us to jump in and say that we can do this better, . that's arrogant,' Urmson said. Google has not determined whether . it will build its own self-driving vehicles or function more as . a provider of systems and software to established vehicle . manufacturers. Google's self-driving prototype cars, he said, were built in . Detroit by engineering and specialty manufacturing company . Roush. GM is open to working with Google on self-driving cars, Jon . Lauckner, GM's chief technology officer, said on Monday. Urmson's expectation that the first fully autonomous . vehicles will be production-ready within five years mirrors the . view expressed a day earlier by another Silicon Valley . entrepreneur, Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla Motors Inc . . Musk, who spoke Tuesday at the Automotive News World . Congress conference, said he expects the lack of clear federal . regulations covering self-driving cars could delay their . introduction until 2022 or 2023. Urmson, however, said his Google colleagues 'don't see any . particular regulatory hurdles.' Google has been briefing the National Highway Traffic Safety . Administration, the chief U.S. auto regulator, 'from early on in . our program,' Urmson said. 'The worst thing we could do is . surprise them.' Google has already adapted cars to include its self driving technology . Urmson said Google is developing and refining self-driving . systems and components with such auto parts suppliers as . Continental AG, Robert Bosch, ZF . and LG Electronics. Google's prototype cars use . microprocessors made by Nvidia Corp, a Silicon Valley . chipmaker that also supplies Mercedes-Benz and other automakers. Continental said it began discussions in 2012 about . supplying parts for Google's self-driving car. Google asked the . German supplier to provide tires, some electronics and other . components, according to Samir Salman, chief executive of . Continental's NAFTA region. Google shortly will begin deploying a test fleet of fully . functioning prototypes of its pod-like self-driving car, which . dispenses with such familiar automotive parts as steering wheel, . brakes and accelerator pedal. While each of the Google . prototypes will have a 'test driver' on board, the cars have no . provision for human intervention in steering or braking. Urmson suggested the no-frills look of the Google . prototypes, a far cry from the opulent appearance of the . self-driving F015 concept vehicle unveiled last week by . Mercedes, does not necessarily reflect the final design for . production. He described the Google prototype as 'a practical, near-term . testing platform' that will evolve over time. 'Airliners today don't look like the Wright brothers' flyer' of 100 years ago, he said. Urmson said self-driving cars represent a 'transformative' moment in the evolution of transportation, an opportunity to . extend motoring to blind, elderly and disabled persons who . otherwise could not drive. 'You're really changing the relationship you have with . transportation. You're changing what it means to get around.' Regarding Google's desire to partner with traditional . automakers and suppliers, Urmson said Detroit is more innovative . than is sometimes acknowledged. Automakers are 'doing something . incredibly complicated.'

"Nearly 120 wind turbines catch fire each year, according to new research - ten times the number reported by the industry. The figures, compiled by engineers at Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh, make fire the second-largest cause of accidents after blade failure. The researchers claim that out of 200,000 turbines around the world, 117 fires take place annually - far more than the 12 reported by wind farm companies. Scroll down for video . Engineers at Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh say 120 wind turbines catch fire each year. Here, a turbine in Ardrossan, North Ayrshire, catches fire during severe weather . Fire has a huge financial impact on the industry, the researchers report in the journal Fire Safety Science. Each wind turbine costs more than £2 million and generates an estimated income of more than £500,000 per year. Any loss or downtime of these valuable assets makes the industry less viable and productive. Dr Guillermo Rein of Imperial’s department of mechanical engineering, said: ‘Fires are a problem for the industry, impacting on energy production, economic output and emitting toxic fumes. ‘This could cast a shadow over the industry’s green credentials. ‘Worryingly our report shows that fire may be a bigger problem than what is currently reported. Our research outlines a number of strategies that can be adopted by the industry to make these turbines safer and more fire resistant in the future.’ Wind turbines catch fire because highly flammable materials such as hydraulic oil and plastics are in close proximity to machinery and electrical wires. These can ignite a fire if they overheat or are faulty. Lots of oxygen, in the form of high winds, can quickly fan a fire inside a turbine, the paper found. It contradicts the findings of a report into the wind industry, commissioned by the Health and Safety Executive in 2013, which concluded that the safety risks associated with wind turbines are very low. The wind industry last night questioned the validity of the new research. Chris Streatfeild, of Renewable UK which represents wind firms, said: ‘The industry would challenge a number of the assumptions made in the report, including the questionable reliability of the data sources and a failure to understand the safety and integrity standards for fire safety that are standard practice in any large wind turbine. ‘Wind turbines are designed to international standards to meet mandatory health and safety standards including fire safety risks. ‘The industry remains committed to promoting a safe environment for its workers and the public, and no member of the public has ever been injured by a wind turbine in the UK.’","Nearly 120 turbines catch fire each year - the reported industry figure is 12 .

"Killed: Jordan Brennan, 17, pictured, suffered a fatal blow to the head during a scuffle with a 16-year-old boy at a corner shop in Manchester in October . A teenager who started performing the Gangnam Style dance in a corner shop was killed by an Asian boy who thought his dancing was racist, a court heard. Jordan Brennan started doing the dance move made popular by South Korean artist Psy while visiting a corner shop with friends. But his actions angered a 16-year-old boy  in the store who thought his Chinese ethnicity was being mocked. A struggle broke out between the teenagers when the 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, demanded Jordan, 17, apologise after he bumped into him. As they tussled near the doorway, Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop in Gorton, Manchester, before his head hit the concrete floor below. The attacker then kicked him in the legs before returned to his shopping. Jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a fatal head injury. He was found lifeless in bed the following morning when his mother Kim tried to raise him for breakfast. Tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain during the incident on October 10 last year. The killer admitted manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court today after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted. Jordan started to dance after entering the corner shop in 'high spirits', the court heard, and within 17 seconds there was a 'flashpoint' between the two teenagers. The dance was popularised when the music video to Gangnam Style went viral in 2012. In it, South Korean pop star Psy repeats a 'horse-riding move' as part of the dance routine. Prosecutor Rob Hall said: 'On one view that is Jordan being in high spirits and exuberant and dancing to a popular current song, and on another view, and the view held by the defendant, is that the performance was a racist slur against him because of his appearance and ethnicity. 'The Crown would simply say the evidence is inconsistent as to the motivation of Jordan at the time. We understand why the defendant reached the conclusion that he did.' Mr Hall made clear that it was never a case where the attacker had any intention to kill, however he may have intended to cause serious harm. The boy accepts challenging Jordan and kicking him while he lay on the ground, it was said. He maintains he didn't have any idea that Jordan's injury would be serious until he saw media coverage and realised he was the subject of a manhunt and then turned himself in. Wanted: Police released this CCTV footage of a person (right) who was wanted in connection with the attack. Jordan, left, started doing the dance because he was in 'high spirits' while out with friends, the court heard . Reading his basis of plea, defence barrister Kate Blackwell QC said: 'The defendant accepts committing the unlawful act that led to the death. 'The deceased made remarks on the appearance of the defendant that he found racist in tone. They were making him embarrassed and angered him in front of his girlfriend.' It emerged he then followed Jordan out of the shop when he had his back to him in an attempt to force him to look at him and apologise, it was said. Fatal blow: As the teenagers struggled near the doorway of the shop in Gorton, Manchester (pictured), Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop  before his head hit the concrete floor . Tributes: At the time of Jordan's death, his father Nigel Hatton said: 'We'll always remember his smile and his loveable face. He was always very happy, always smiling. Above, tributes outside Jordan's home . She added: 'The defendant made contact with the deceased as he spun around and pulled and pushed him. 'The movement appeared to be the defendant punching towards him but none connected. Wounded: Jordan (pictured) walked home not realising he had suffered a fatal head injury . 'The deceased banged against the metal shutters and fell to the floor. He banged the left side of his head on the concrete pavement. 'The defendant continued to argue with him and kicked him in the leg in anger at his refusal to apologise.' The 17-year-old has been bailed until his sentencing in March. Judge David Stockdale QC told him: 'The fact I have granted you bail does not provide an indication of the type of sentence I may pass. 'What I mean by that is the fact that you have been on bail does not mean that you won't receive an immediate custodial sentence.' At the time of Jordan's death, his father Nigel Hatton said: 'We'll always remember his smile and his loveable face. He was always very happy, always smiling. 'At school he was a very good friend and he always listened to his mates. His two passions were BMXing and fishing. 'We can't describe the impact it's had on us. We've lost our son at 17, and we didn't expect to. If someone you love falls in or gets old, then you can start to take stock of things - but we never got a chance. You see this happen in the news to other people, but you don't expect it to happen to you.' In a statement Jordan's mother said: 'Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man. He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend. 'He would cheer them up with his usual larking about or joking around. He was a pleasure to have as a son and his loss is devastating. He was greatly loved by all that knew him.'

"Wendy Purcell, pictured, was suspended on full pay last summer after she commissioned seven custom-made chairs costing £95,000 . A university chief accused of wasteful spending has been allowed to return to work on her full £250,000 salary despite having her role drastically downgraded. Professor Wendy Purcell was suspended as vice-chancellor of Plymouth University after commissioning seven custom-made chairs costing £95,000. She was also criticised over a three-day trip to Miami, when she stayed in a luxury boutique hotel and spent £3,500 on business-class flights. Another report claimed she ran up a £15,000 expenses bill for first-class train travel. Miss Purcell was suspended on full pay last summer but returned to work as Plymouth’s vice-chancellor and president in November. However, she did not resume her duties running the university and it was announced last week that she is now president only, with her former deputy now the interim vice-chancellor. Despite her much reduced responsibilities, Freedom of Information requests from the Times Higher Education journal have revealed that Miss Purcell has returned to work on full pay. The university said: ‘The vice-chancellor’s present salary is £250,000, the same as in 2013/14.’ It refused to say whether Miss Purcell’s pay would be cut now she will not be vice-chancellor. Disclosures also show that the university has run up a £270,000 legal bill over the matter. The university did not reply to requests for a comment. The news will pile further pressure on Plymouth over its handling of several months of crisis. A second leading figure, retired judge William Taylor, resigned as university chairman last year amid allegations that he sexually harassed female colleagues. He denies the claims. The controversy over Miss Purcell includes claims she was responsible for initiating a project to commission seven hand-crafted ceremonial chairs – costing £13,500 each – to be used at graduation ceremonies. Prof Purcell is no longer the vice-chancellor of Plymouth University, pictured, but remains college president . She was part of a panel that selected designer John Makepeace to lead the project. But news of the £95,000 commission sparked anger among students and staff – despite the university’s insistence that the cost of the furniture would be met through fundraising. The university then said that ‘approval of the project was not sought from the University Executive nor the University Board’. It later said the vice-chancellor decided she wanted no further involvement with the project but ‘did not advise cancellation’. The Plymouth Herald newspaper reported that the university also spent £24,000 sending six staff, including Miss Purcell, on a three-day conference in Miami. It further reported that she had taken a first-class train journey on average once every eight days for three years on expenses.","Wendy Purcell was suspended after she commissioned chairs worth £95k .

"Cosmopolitan's front cover usually features the personality quizzes, sex tips and the latest Hollywood starlet, but the magazine has now gone for a completely different tactic. The publication have released a picture of a young girl suffocating as part of their long-running protest against honour killings, mocked up as if it is the magazine's February cover. The plastic-wrapped issue features a blurry black and white picture of a girl with dark hair, with her hands raised as though she is trying to break the wrapping and the magazine encourages readers to rip open the plastic and free her. The picture represents the story of Shafilea Ahmed, whose parents suffocated her with a plastic bag in front of her siblings in September 2003, for supposedly bringing shame on her family after she refused to agree to an arranged marriage. Scroll down for video . A young girl is pictured suffocating on the cover of a plastic-wrapped  issue of Cosmopolitan,  created specifically for an event at the House of Lords. The image represents the story of Shafilea Ahmed, whose parents suffocated her with a plastic bag in front of her siblings in September 2003, for supposedly bringing shame on her family after she refused to agree to an arranged marriage . The mocked up cover, which was created by advertising company Leo Burnett Change, is part of the publication's campaign, alongside women's charity Karma Nirvana, to raise awareness of honour-based violence. Readers can not buy it, as it was created specifically for an event at the House of Lords. They magazine is lobbying the government to get a UK law implemented that will help to prevent future deaths of this nature. A seven-second film has also been made to accompany the issue. In the clip, the plastic cover is ripped off the magazine, signifying the release of women from violence. Cosmopolitan posted a Vine of the video with the words: 'Shafilea Ahmed was suffocated by her parents in front of her siblings. 'Share to end the suffering of #honourkillings Karmanirvana.org.uk' The magazine's mocked up cover image was presented to UK parliament on Wednesday during a lobbying event hosted by Cosmpolitan and Karma Nirvana. The event was planned to launch a new report called Honour Killings In The UK, which uncovered severe failings by the British government, police forces and schools to recognise, report and prevent honour-based violence. The Day of Memory for Britain's Lost Women is July 14, the date of the birthday of Shafilea Ahmed. It also announced a new memorial day, called The Day of Memory for Britain's Lost Women, to comemorate all victims of honour killings, which has long been campaigned for both by Cosmopolitan and the Henry Jackson Society. It will take place annually on July 14, which was the date of Shafilea’s birthday, who was 17 when she was killed in 2003. It took nine years for Shafilea's parents to be brought to justice, but they were finally both sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2012 for the murder. This summer, forced marriage will become illegal in England and Wales and punishable by up to seven years in prison. But thousands of women are still being beaten, abused and raped in the name of honour across the UK. The government's own Forced Marriage Unit dealt with 1,302 possible cases of forced marriage last year - more than 80 per cent of them involving female victims. The Karma Nirvana helpline alone is currently getting an average of 700 calls a month, a 21 per cent increase from last year when the average was 550. But the secret nature of forced marriage means these figures are merely the tip of the iceberg. A Cosmopolitan spokesperson said: 'We are incredibly proud of our campaign to call for a day of remembrance for the victims of honour killings. More than 100,000 people have supported the campaign, run in partnership with the charity Karma Nirvana. It has also resulted in the 14th July being declared as a Day of Memory to honour British victims of this horrific crime. 'As part of that campaign, Cosmo ran a competition with three advertising agencies to create an image that could be used to raise awareness of the issue of honour based abuse and killings. 'The Leo Burnett image was one of the entries, and the image has been used for promotional use in a mocked up cover wrapped around the magazine and an independent think tank’s report on honour based violence for a specific House of Lords event. It is not a cover. Our February issue has been on sale for nearly two weeks, and does not feature the image that Leo Burnett created.'

"A woman is suing Fedex over her wife’s $400,000 spousal death benefit – which the company is refusing to pay because it would not recognize their marriage. Lesly Taboada-Hall, who was a driver for the company for 26 years, lost her battle with uterine cancer two years ago. But because she died six days before a landmark Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage, FedEx determined that wife Stacy Schuett, of California, was not eligible to receive the pension benefit, her lawyers say. Stacy Schuett (left), from California, lost her wife Lesly Taboada-Hall (right) to uterine cancer in 2013. The pair are pictured with their two children two years ago . NBC News reported that Ms Taboada-Hall passed away on June 20, 2013 – days before the Supreme Court struck down an important part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) which blocked federal recognition of gay marriage. Some firms used DOMA to decide who was the legal souse before paying out survivor benefits. Although FedEx did recognize 54-year-old Ms Schuett as a spouse for smaller survivor benefits, her lawyers believe she should be entitled to more. NBC News reported that the pair were married in hospital just a day before Ms Taboada-Hall died and that a judge in California later ruled the marriage was valid. Ms Schuett (right) said her wife Lesly Taboada-Hall (left) had enjoyed working for FedEx and that the firm had treated her well during her battle with cancer . The legal team for Ms Schuett, who has two children aged 19 and 15, have sued in the federal court, claiming the Supreme Court ruling should apply ‘retroactively’. She told NBC News that her wife had enjoyed working for FedEx and that the firm had treated her well during her battle with cancer – but that the couple learned of the company’s decision a week before her death. She said: ‘To discover at the 11th hour that there was this other looming problem was pretty shocking to us. She was really worried about what was going to be happening to us after she died.’ NBC News quotes a FedEx spokesman as saying that it was ‘saddened’ by the passing of Ms Taboada-Hall and that she was a valued member of staff adding: ‘Ms Schuett's claim has been carefully reviewed, and while we are sympathetic to her situation, we are required by federal law to apply the pension plan rules equally to all participants.’","Former FedEx driver Lesly Taboada-Hall died of uterine cancer in 2013 .

"An unlicensed driver accused of killing a four-year-old girl while fleeing from police could get a lighter sentence if he pleads guilty to the top manslaughter charge - prompting a fiery reaction from the accused's mother. The Manhattan state Supreme Court judge offered the three-to-nine year prison deal to 18-year-old Franklin Reyes Jr. on Wednesday. The offer prompted an explosive reaction from Reyes' mother, Lilia Reyes, who was in the courtroom as she reportedly screamed at the judge: 'It’s not fair! There is not justice in this country! He was only 17!' Lilia Reyes screamed at a judge on Wednesday who sentenced her son Franklin to up to nine years in prison. The teenage boy killed a four-year-old girl in 2013 while fleeing from police . Franklin Reyes Jr, 18, pictured on Wednesday, was offered the three-to-nine year prison deal on Wednesday after running over and killing a four-year-old girl in June 2013 in Manhattan . The hysterical mother was dragged from the courtroom by police officers as the parents of victim, Ariel Russo, looked on. She has now been barred from future hearings by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro who has had previous verbal attacks from Mrs Reyes. Sofia Russo spoke outside court to the New York Post, alongside her husband Alan. She said: 'That really upset me that she would say there’s no justice, that it’s not fair. 'Who knows better than us that it’s not fair? Our child is dead and hers is alive.' Reyes has 45 days to accept the deal. The judge said he could no longer treat Reyes as a youthful offender because he had been arrested twice on felony charges since four-year-old Ariel Russo was killed in June 2013. Authorities said Reyes was fleeing officers who were trying to stop him from driving erratically while on a joyride with his parents' SUV. The 17-year-old fled, jumped a curb and hit a building, pinning Ariel and seriously injuring her grandmother. Ariel Russo, aged four, died after she was pinned to a wall by an SUV being driven by a teenage boy without a license . In August, Reyes was charged with another crime behind the wheel - injuring a police officer while fleeing from a traffic stop. After he made an illegal turn, the teen was pulled over by a cop but sped off, dragging the officer for about a block, injuring his wrist and elbow. Police said Reyes was arrested after he ditched the car in a parking garage and hid in the office. He was held without bail after his arraignment on assault and other charges. Reyes has also been accused of taking jewelry, cash and wine from a dead woman's apartment in July. His attorney has said that Reyes denies taking anything and was helping his father, the building superintendent, with a plumbing leak. Reyes' father was charged with similar crimes. Ariel Russo's parents, Sofia and Alan Russo, (pictured in September) were in court today to watch the outburst from the mother of the teenager who ran over their little girl .","Franklin Reyes Jr, 18, was offered the three-to-nine year prison deal at Manhattan Supreme Court on Wednesday .

"It was a case of practice makes perfect for Tulisa Contostavlos as she wore her best courtroom outfit to date on Wednesday. The former X Factor judge was in court to appeal against a conviction for punching the celebrity blogger Savvas Morgan at the 2013 V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex, as he followed her to a Winnebago for a party. But Judge David Radford, sitting at the appeal hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and threw out the appeal. Scroll down for video . Practice makes perfect: Tulisa wore her best courtroom outfit to date of a cape and knee-length dress at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Wednesday . Although it was an afternoon of bad news for the star, she did finally managed to pull off a chic court outfit, after several attempts to turn the courtroom into a catwalk last year ended in failure. Tulisa, 26, made of string of appearances in court in 2014, when she was cleared of arranging a drugs deal and also found guilty of assaulting a celebrity blogger. But although the results of the two cases were remarkably different, there was one constant - Tulisa's mismatched sense of style. She finally transformed her look for her appearance at Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday though in a thick black cape with ladylike striped dress beneath. Tulisa wore a thick black cape with ladylike striped dress. The hemline and loose fit were more demure than her previous outfits for her court appearances last year . The knee-length hemline and loose fit were demure enough for court, and made a stark change to the tight, thigh-length ensembles of 2014. The singer also injected some glamour with red patent platform heels and her long black hair worn loose. On her arm, she carried a large leather tote with ruched detailing and she also wore a simple pendant necklace. In court, the pop star was found guilty of hitting Mr Morgan, who she suspected of putting her sex tape online, at the 2013 V Festival in Chelmsford as he followed her to a Winnebago for a party. Judge David Radford, sitting at the appeal hearing,  refused to accept that the singer had not punched him and said she 'lost control'. The singer injected some glamour with her long black hair worn down - and red patent platform heels . During her days in court in 2014,Tulisa attempted something of a style overhaul, smartening up her look with an array of trouser suits, high-collared silk blouses and formal frocks - often very different from her usual look. Previously the singer was often seen in revealing . bandage dresses and shorts skirts but . she meant business as she stood up in court in super-smart attire. She ditched her usual style of cleavage-baring outfits and chunky gold jewellery in favour of a demure, no-nonsense image. But the singer unfailingly messed up the look every time, whether the the dress was too short, the coat and dress mismatched or the suit was simply too cheap-looking. Tulisa has clearly learnt from her fashion mistakes though. Tulisa wore a navy trouser suit with a white lace blouse to hear court ruling on assault charges on July 25 . Tulisa departing court after facing drug charges at Southwark Crown Court in July, 2014 . Last year, when Tulisa faced drug charges in relation to a story that appeared in The Sun at Southwark Crown Court, she took the case very seriously, attending every single hearing regardless of whether she was required to or not. During this time, she experimented with hair colour, heel height and hem length. But each time, it terms of style, the outfits never quite worked. Often, she matched a light pastel with a harsh black, creating a half-finished look. Tulisa in a pale pink drop hem dress and a shoulder-padded jacket at her drugs trial on Thursday, July 17 . Tulisa sports a black and white look on July 16, 2014, during her cocaine supply trial, and in a more casual look of floral dress and . long side pony on July 15, 2014 . One of her strangest looks was on June 27, when Tulisa marched into court in a pistachio green trouser suit, teamed with nude stilettos and a button-down blouse featuring a chain-link print design. A few days later, the star relaxed her image and she wore her hair in a long side ponytail and dressed in a floaty short dress. The £150 Ted Baker Eponi style featured a watercolour tree print, contrast trim and belt, three quarter sleeves and button fastening.

But the pale blue blazer that she added at the last minute was too bright next to the black on both the dress and handbag. Her appearances in court in late 2013 and early 2014 were much better as the star stuck to a simpler wardrobe. Her all-black outfits, accompanied with a blonde hairstyle left little chance for faults. It was only when Tulisa branched out during the summer months that her outfits started to falter.

"Five men from Yemen were freed from the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after more than a dozen years of captivity. Four of the men went to Oman: Al Khadr Abdallah Muhammad Al Yafi, Fadel Hussein Saleh Hentif, Abd Al-Rahman Abdullah Au Shabati, and Mohammed Ahmed Salam. One, Akhmed Abdul Qadir, was sent to Estonia, according to a Pentagon statement. It was the first time either nation accepted Guantanamo prisoners for resettlement.

Pledge: President Barack Obama came into office pledging to close the detention center on the U.S. base . The release is the latest in a wave that have alarmed congressional opponents of closing the detention center. The men had been cleared for release since at least 2009 but the U.S. has balked at repatriating Guantanamo prisoners back to Yemen, where the government is battling an al-Qaeda insurgency. All five were captured in Pakistan and detained by the U.S. as suspected al-Qaeda fighters. None were ever charged with a crime, the Miami Herald reports. U.S. officials later determined it was no longer necessary to detain them but have struggled to find other countries willing to take them in. The men are all in their 30s and 40s, including one who was 17 when he was sent to Guantanamo. President Barack Obama came into office pledging to close the detention center on the U.S. base but was blocked by Congress, which barred transferring any prisoner to the U.S. for any reason and imposed restrictions on sending them elsewhere. Congress eased the restrictions on transfers abroad in December 2013 and the Obama administration has stepped up the releases in recent months. There are now 122 prisoners at Guantanamo, including 54 who have been approved for transfer. Of those cleared to leave, 47 are Yemeni and will likely have to be resettled in other countries, given the security situation in their homeland. 'We are committed to closing the detention facility. That's our goal and we are working toward that goal,' said Ian Moss, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department on Guantanamo issues. Prisoners: There are now 122 prisoners at Guantanamo, including 54 who have been approved for transfer . The recent releases have angered some members of Congress, who have argued that Guantanamo is necessary to detain terrorism suspects. Republican senators on Tuesday proposed restrictions that would bar transfers to Yemen for two years and suspend the transfer of men previously classified as high-risk or medium-risk. 'Now is not the time to be emptying Guantanamo,' Sen. Kelly Ayottee said at a news conference during which she warned of fresh terrorist threats.","Five men from Yemen were freed from the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after more than a dozen years of captivity .
Four of the men were transferred to Oman and one to Estonia, this is the first time either nation has accepted Guantanamo prisoners .
The releases take the Guantanamo population down to 122 .
The releases are alarming Congress, which has blocked Obama's attempts to close the detention center ."
"Secretary of State John Kerry says he has no intentions to apologize to France today for the absence of high-profile U.S. officials at last Sunday's unity rally. The Obama administration official said he does plan, however, to 'share a big hug with Paris.' Kerry tacked a visit to France onto an already scheduled trip to Europe after the executive branch was ridiculed for not having a visible representative at Sunday's march. The White House admitted on Monday that it erred in judgement, but Kerry and his staff have steadfastly argued that criticism is unwarranted. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No hard feelings: Speaking to reporters in Bulgaria, Secretary of State John Kerry said he plans to 'share a big hug with Paris' when he arrives there today . Kerry is pictured here sharing a laugh at a working breakfast Deputy Chief of Staff Jon Finer ,top  left,  Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, back left, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, center right, and two aides, Special Adviser Duncan McCourt and Private Secretary Lucy Ferguson. Both sets of diplomats were in Sofia, Bulgaria for their respective meetings with government leaders . At a news conference on Monday in India Kerry contended that U.S. officials had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities since the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack and characterized sideswiping at the Obama administration as 'sort of quibbling a little bit.' 'Our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched,' Kerry stated. Kerry said he 'very much wanted to have been there but couldn't do so because of the commitment that I had here and it is important to keep these kinds of commitments.' Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris on the day of event attending a terrorism summit, but he did participate in the march for reasons that are still unknown. Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett shed little additional light on the snafu during a Thursday appearance on CNN's New Day. 'Certainly we would have liked to have participated in the parade,' Jarrett said, according to the Washington Times. 'I’d remind you that Attorney General Holder was in Paris for a very important meeting together with his colleagues from around Europe and around the world to take a look at what we [can] do to make sure that we’re cooperating, and so I think we certainly got the substance right,' she said. 'But it would have been great to participate in the parade, and we’re delighted that Secretary Kerry is there now.' The White House confessed on Monday 'that somebody with a higher profile should have been asked to attend' but the president's spokesman would not say who at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue made the call or why Holder wasn't ordered to make an appearance. Across town, a spokeswoman for Kerry, Marie Harf, was telling reporters that she didn't think condemnation of the administration was 'fair' at all. 'There are more ways than just this march to show our solidarity,' she said. The people of France 'know we have stood by them.' France's ambassador to the U.S. Gerard Araud indicated on Monday that his country was not offended by U.S. cabinet officials nonattendance at the Paris rally. 'I am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support France has received from everybody here, from the President to the ordinary American,' he tweeted. Kerry said this morning that he would 'share a big hug with Paris and express the affection of the American people for France and for our friends there who have been through a terrible time' during his afternoon drop-in. 'I don't feel any other exigencies, other than continuation of our friendship and our responsibilities as good friends and the longest ally in our history, and that's why I am going,' Kerry said during a news conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, per the Associated Press.","Kerry tacked a visit to France onto a trip to Europe after the Obama administration was ridiculed for the Sunday snafu .

"Foria claims to be the first sexual lubricant designed specifically to improve sex for women . A marijuana-based spray which claims to be the first sexual lubricant designed specifically to improve sex for women goes on sale in Colorado next week. Foria contains marijuana extract and the makers claim the relaxing properties of cannabis can help women have better and more satisfying sex. An edible coconut oil-based spray, users are advised to spritz Floria on their genitals about 30 minutes before sex to 'create the relaxation needed for sensual experience' and possibly multiple orgasms. Aphrodite Group – the California-based medical marijuana collective that sells the potion – said the majority of women who use it won't get high, but will  feel more relaxed. The product was launched several months ago in California, but will go on sale  in Colorado next week at an Aspen marijuana boutique just in time for the X Games, which begin on January 22. 'We definitely have patients coming in for it, requesting it specifically. ... A-list celebrities that come in specifically for it. You'd be surprised who comes in for it,' Matthew Rosen of the CannaSutra co-op in Studio City, California told USA Today. 'Most people have been giving positive feedback on it.' Scroll down for video . An edible coconut oil-based spray, users are advised to spritz Floria to 'create the relaxation needed for sensual experience' and possibly multiple orgasms . A video on the company's website features women speaking openly about how they use it and its effects. The formula was inspired by the historical use of cannabis as an aphrodisiac in traditional cultures around the world. 'For some women, it may awaken arousal and heighten sensation making orgasms more intense, fuller, or easier to access,' Foria's makers claim. 'For others, it can help promote natural lubrication, reduce pain and tension and create the relaxation necessary for sensual experience, or restorative rest.' The mixture is not designed to be used like a standard lubricant, but is designed to be applied at least half an hour before sex. This time allows for the active compounds of the drug to be fully activated and absorbed, the collective said. The product was launched several months ago in California, but will go on sale to the general public in Colorado next week at an Aspen marijuana boutique just in time for the X Games, which begin January 22 . While men can also use it, the lubricant is intended for women because the membrane of the vagina is more sensitive and absorbent. 'Introducing medicines, compounds and different drugs through the vagina is something that both modern doctors and doctors throughout history have done,' Matthew Gerson, creator of Foria told Nerve. 'Women report a sense of embodiment, a sense of dropping into a more full relationship to sexual sensations and sensations around the body. 'As you can imagine, as that builds up to orgasm - if orgasm is a part of your experience - then that can lead to intensification and a more full body experience,' he continued. Some women who have used the product reported tingling as well as increased warmth and relaxation. Others had multiple orgasms, but some found the lubricant helped them fall asleep. The potion costs $44 for 10ml or $88 for 30ml, but it is currently only available to residents of California who have a letter from their doctor, or a medical marijuana card. .","Foria claims to be the first sexual lubricant designed specifically to improve sex for women .

"Whether you're a wine connoisseur or malt whisky lover, the state you live in could reveal far more about your drinking habits than you might expect. Those living in Delaware, Washington and Massachusetts, for instance, are the nation's biggest boozers, according to a survey of their tweets. Overall, Washington D.C. had the most tweets per capita about wine and beer, and they also had the second most tweets about liquor. In terms of alcohol related tweets, Delaware tops the list, following by D.C, Massachusetts, Nevada and Rhode Island. As a nation, the US enjoyed talking about beer and malt liquor far more than they do about wine . However, when it came to announcing abusive behaviours – such as getting drunk or 'crunk' – Washington didn't even get into the top five. That unfavourable distinction went to New Jersey. Meanwhile, the South – often portrayed in media as the beer-drinking capital of America – had only three states that ranked in the top 10 for beer tweets. In fact, it's the only region in the U.S. that prefers hard liquor to beer and malt liquor, according to the survey.

Age is a factor as well, with 40 per cent of college students reporting they drink to get drunk - or 'crunk' To find out more about drinking habits around the country, the team surveyed more than 1,000 people and analysed 450,000 tweets about beer, liquor, wine, and drinking. [While regional preferences for alcohol type may vary widely, the phenomenon of alcohol abuse is a nationwide issue . As well as the types of alcohol consumers, the research also shows 31 per cent of men drink to get drunk compared to only 21 per cent of women. Age is a factor as well, with 40 per cent of college students reporting they drink to get drunk. Hard liquor is the strongly preferred choice of college students (66 per cent), but beer is the overall preferred drink of Americans. The survey also found that 25 per cent of men have taken 'shower beers', and 13 per cent of women admit to doing the same. A 'shower beer' is better you take into the shower when you're in a hurry to go out or want to relax from a long day. According to the American Council for Drug Education (ACDE) around 10 to 15 million people in the United States can be classified as alcoholics. The statistics show that alcohol dependence will affect 17 per cent of men and eight per cent of women at some point in their lives.

"Last night's episode attracts 8.2million viewers - Channel 4's highest ratings since Big Brother in 2008 . It's become the hit TV show that everyone is talking about as viewers marvel at the lavish and elaborate weddings and their traditional and old-fashioned culture. But one woman has slammed My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and said it has tarnished the traveller community. Caroline - not her real name - said the popular documentary show doesn't portray traveller culture and has been an embarrassment for them. In order to speak out, she has insisted on being anonymous for fear of revenge attacks by families featured in the show. Exaggerated: A traveller woman has spoken about My Big Fay Gypsy Wedding and said it didn't portray real traveller life . ‘It’s mad, but just saying these things could get me killed. If I was . identified I would have to go into hiding with my children. 'Disrespecting people in the community ends in big fistfights'. ‘You’re not allowed to criticise another family. They would say, “Who are you to contradict me and my family?”’ Speaking to Reveal magazine, Caroline said when she heard about the programme, she was excited about a show about her community. But she now thinks the show has tainted their lives and she first . noticed it was proving to be a problem when she tried to arrange her . son's first Holy Communion and was turned away by the priest. Insulting: 'Caroline' said Christine Bleakley should not have worn that dress as it made travellers a laughing stock . 'I thought it was good that people would be made aware of travellers. We suffer a lot of discrimination. 'You're . always scared that the neighbours will find out who you are and the . kids will get bullied. We can't even book wedding receptions under our . real names. If the venue finds out, they cancel.' She said: 'Millions have watched it, but all anyone is talking about are the dresses. We're a laughing stock. 'When Christine Bleakley wore a big pink wedding dress on Daybreak, it was very insulting. You wouldn't dare laugh at an Indian woman in a sari.' Forced: In last night's episode, Paddy and Roseanne Doherty go shopping for furniture for their house - but Caroline said gypsies can no longer get pitches for their caravans . Caroline said she is not alone in thinking the show doesn't portray the real travelling community. Firstly, she said that no traveller chooses to live in a house - they are forced to. She . said: 'Travellers can't get onto the sites anymore and are forced to . live in houses. There aren't enough pitches and councils refuse to make . new ones.' And she said their dresses are nothing like the elaborate and expensive ones featured on the show. She said: 'You didn't get a big dress for First Communion, it was a . hand-me-down or borrowed. My wedding dress was big and white but not as . big as the ones in the show.' ‘Lots of travellers phoned up the programme to say we aren’t like that. But it’s too late. 'They haven’t shown the weddings and communions where travellers wear normal dresses. Naive: Caroline believes that the parents of the young children who dressed and danced provocatively, didn't realise how it would come across . Exploited: Caroline said they boys who exaggerated that they can drink from the age of 11 were probably exploited by the cameras . ‘Even the show’s name is wrong. Most of the families on the show are Irish Travellers, not gypsies. Gypsies are English.’ The full interview is in this week's issue of Reveal, out now . She also said she thought a lot of the families featured on the show had been exploited, especially the parents of the young girls who dressed and danced provocatively. Caroline added: 'Those little girls have watched their older sisters dancing to Beyonce. A lot of the party clothes have been copied from shows like Strictly Come Dancing. 'I don't think the families realised how it would come across. And I think some of the travellers exaggerated things, like the boy who claimed you can drink from the age of 11. 'I bet he feels silly now. Really, they've all been exploited by the cameras.' Caroline felt that she had to speak out about the show but protected her name for fear of reprisals from other traveller communities for speaking out. She said: 'It's mad, but just saying these things could get me killed. If I were identified I would have to go into hiding with my children.' Tuesday night's episode of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding attracted 8.2million viewers - the highest rated Channel 4 show since the 2008 series of Big Brother. • The full interview is in this week's issue of Reveal, out now.

"The distinctive style of cooking used to create the rich flavours in Mediterranean food may have been first developed by ancient Greek doctors trying to find ways of treating patients. A new study of texts written by ancient Hippocratic doctors and philosophers has shown that they believed flavour was a key marker of the nutritional and health giving potency of foods. Experts behind the research say the ancient Greeks saw food as a key to balancing the health of the human body and some physicians even wrote cookery books. Foods with strong flavours like garlic (left) and truffles (right) were often prescribed by ancient doctors . They claim that rather than purely thinking about flavour as pleasurable, they also saw it as important for improving foods medicinal qualities. Ancient doctors such as Galen of Pergamon put particular emphasis on cooking simple ingredients to improve their flavour, a practice that continues in the region today. Among the texts on food written by the Hippocratic physician Galen of Pergamon, was a recipe for pancakes. Ingredients: . Wheat flower, water, olive oil . Directions: . 'The oil is placed in a frying pan that is put on a smokeless fire and when it has become hot the wheat flour, soaked in a large amount of water, is poured in. 'When cooked in the oil, it rapidly sets and thickens ... At this point those making it turn it to bring the upper surface underneath, in contact with the pan , bringing what was previously underneath, which has been sufficiently cooked, to the top. 'When the under part is now set, they turn it again, perhaps two or three times.' He commonly prescribed his patients foods rich in garlic and onions to readjust their 'humours' - the four bodily fluids that they believed influenced health. Other ancient physicians focused on the the need to use high quality ingredients in cooking at the right time of year. Plato is also known to have written about the importance of food on health and Hippocrates said: 'Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.' Professor John Wilkins, an expert on Greek Culture at the University of Exeter, said this early work may help to explain why the Mediterranean diet is now considered to be among the healthiest in the world. He said that although many of the ingredients associated with modern Mediterranean food such as lemons, oranges and tomatoes had yet to be imported into the region from China and South America, the basic principals of how ingredients were used appeared to be laid down by these early doctors. Professor Wilkins said: 'They take flavour as a measure of nutritional potency because that property of astringency in unripe apples or pungency in onions reflects the effect that the food will have on the digested material and ultimately the impact on the humours of the body. 'Galen sees nutrition as a third of the medical art, along with pharmacology and surgery. 'If people had too much thick humour, phlegm in particular, then they needed onions and garlic to thin it. That is a sort of early idea of dealing with too much cholesterol.' The ancient Greek physician Galen of Pergamon, seen above, believed nutrition was essential for good health . Professor Wilkins said that among Galen's extensive writings on food, he includes recipes for pancakes and discussess the types of bread and cakes that should be eaten. A Mediterranean diet increases life expectancy by protecting the DNA from damage, research shows. Harvard academics studied 4,676 middle-aged women comparing their typical eating habits with the make-up of their cells. Importantly, they looked at their telomeres – biological caps which are found at the ends of chromosomes that protect the DNA inside. As we get older, our telomeres get progressively shorter, causing the DNA to become damaged and raising the odds of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer' s, diabetes and heart disease. The research – published in the BMJ – found that women whose diets were generally low in fat and high in fruit and veg had longer telomeres. He also tackles the dangers of milk, which he believed the whey and solids it contains may block the narrow channels in the liver in susceptible individuals. Many of the recipes he writes about use simple cooking techniques designed to bring to bring out the flavour of basic ingredients. Galen, who was born in 129AD, is considered to be among the most influential Greek Hippocratic physicians and his texts were widely used. He primarily believed in humorism, which is based on the idea that an excess or deficiency of four distinct bodily fluids, or humours, influences a person's temperament and health . Among the foods Galen considered at length are lentils, which he recommended boiling only once and seasoning them with fish sauces and olive oil. This he says would give them a laxative effect while if they are boiled twice they would have a 'drying effect' on the stomach and bowel. In one text Galen also described how snails, now a popular dish associated with French food, need to be boiled twice in water to reduce their laxative properties. Many of the herbs, like those above, recommended by ancient Greek doctors are still used in cooking today . He also emphasised the need to season food such as snails properly and believed that cooking shellfish simply could enhance their properties. Professor Wilkins, whose study is published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, said that Galen often recommended tropical spices like pepper, ginger and cinnamon to his wealthier clients. Other doctors emphasised the importance of fruits and vegetables while only eating sweet foods in moderation. A Hippocratic text dating to 400BC called Regimen II warns that 'many sweet foods are laxative, but some are constipating, some dry the body, others moisten it'. The author then classifies foods such as barley, cereals, pulses, fruits, vegetables, meats and fish as being particularly powerful for treating human health. Wild carrots, mushrooms, radishes and truffles are also seen as being important by doctors at the time. Galen believed shellfish should be cooked simply, a technique still seen today in dishes like the one above . In some cases ingredients that are no longer used, like silphium, a wild fennel that is now extinct, and flowers like asphodel and muscari are also used in cooking. Compared to these Hippocratic texts, Professor Wilkins found that authors at the same time who were writing about cooking for pleasure rather than health, like the author Archestratus, a poet from Sicily in the 4th century BC, tended to focus on levels of fat, salt and sugar. Professor Wilkins said: 'The ancient diet resembled the modern Mediterranean diet but without oranges and lemons from China and tomatoes from S America of course. 'The diet is based largely on the plants of the region, which the doctors generally preferred over imported luxuries. 'Also the ancient Mediterranean area did not sustain huge numbers of animals, so meat was limited, as it is in the modern Mediterranean. 'The soil produced the flavour-rich foods, to make the cereals palatable.' Ian Marber, an independent nutritionist, said that many of the approaches to cooking outlined by ancient doctors were still used by Mediterranean chefs today. He said: 'People at that time did not have access to the processed foods we eat today so using simple ingredients like olive oil and fish sauce to flavour food makes perfect sense. 'We see this continuing today in Mediterranean food and the nutritional benefits of this kind of diet is well established.'","Experts at the University of Exeter studied texts by ancient Greek doctors .
Many believed rich flavours could improve the nutritional potency of food .

"Ellen DeGeners has hit back at a Christian pastor who accused her of 'promoting a gay agenda' via her immensely popular talk show. In an article for the Christian Post, contributor Larry Tomczak called out programmes he believes are causing a 'tidal wave of unprecedented evil' to sweep America, including Ellen's show. But now she has responded in true comedic style, saying she is 'not trying to brainwash anyone', before adding that Mr Tomczak is obviously 'watching a lot of gay TV'. Ellen DeGeneres' show was singled out by pastor Larry Tomczak who accused her of 'celebrating her lesbianism and ""marriage"" in between appearances of guests like Taylor Swift to attract young girls' Mr Tomczak singled out Ellen for criticism in an opinion piece he posted online called  'Are You Aware of the Avalanche of Gay Programming Assaulting Your Home?'. As well as targeting her show, he also accused new movie Foxcatcher, talent show American Idol, and sitcom Two And A Half Men of being part of Hollywood's gay agenda. He attacks Dallas Cowboys defensive end Michael Sam for coming out as gay, calling him a 'castaway', and bashes gay advocacy groups for trying to push the gay agenda on children. But the comedian, 56 (pictured with wife Portia de Rossi), hit back saying she wasn't ""married"" with inverted commas, but was simply 'married, that's it' Speaking about Ellen specifically, he writes that she 'celebrates her lesbianism and ""marriage"" in between appearances of guests like Taylor Swift to attract young girls.' As a remedy he suggests parents need to monitor what their children are watching, point out 'unseemly characters' to kids, and show them 'wholesome' shows instead, such as 'Gunsmoke, Little House on the Prairie and I Love Lucy'. After being pointed to the article, 56-year-old comedian Ellen took five minutes at the end of her last show to address his claims directly. Ellen, who wed Australian Portia de Rossi in 2008, said: 'In the article, the pastor criticises a lot of TV shows for promoting gay agendas. 'He says that Glee has over five [gay] characters. Modern Family had a gay wedding. Anderson Cooper boasts about his homosexuality. If you ask me, Larry is watching a lot of gay TV.' Moving on to his specific allegations about her show, she added: 'First of all, I’m not ""married""' she said, using finger-quotes 'I’m married, that's it.' 'And, Larry, I don’t even know what it means to celebrate my lesbianism. Well, I guess I do,' she added, pulling a party-popper. 'Yay! I'm gay.' On a more serious note, she said: 'The only way I’m trying to influence people is to be more kind and compassionate with one another. 'That is the message I’m sending out. I don’t have an agenda. I’m not here to brainwash anyone.' From the wings an assistant then handed her a black and white hypnosis wheel which she began twirling at the camera, before launching in to one last joke. 'Attention youth of the world: I want you to live your lives being exactly who you are. Be true to yourself — the most important thing is to be true to yourself. 'The second most important thing is that you wear Ellen underwear and only Ellen underwear.' After Mr Tomczak also criticised a host of other shows for featuring gay people or characters, Ellen (pictured centre at the Oscars last year) accused him of 'watching a lot of gay TV'","Pastor Larry Tomczak attacked Hollywood for having a 'gay agenda'

"After only two years operating in the Canadian market, Target has announced that it is shutting up shop after enduring financial losses of almost a billion dollars a year. More than 17,600 employees will eventually lose their jobs when the U.S. discount retailer closes its 133 Canadian stores. Target Corp. Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said on Thursday that the company didn't see a realistic way for the chain to become profitable before at least 2021. Cornell said on Target's corporate blog that its Canadian arm was losing money every day. Scroll down for video . After only two years operating in the Canadian market, Target has announced that it is shutting up shop after enduring financial losses that went as high as a billion dollars a year . The closing is Cornell's first major move since becoming CEO in August. Target will concentrate instead on improving its U.S. business. Cornell said Target Canada did not see the improvements it was looking for over the holiday period. Target entered Canada in 2013. While operations there improved before the holiday season due to changes in pricing and product assortment, Target still wasn't satisfied with its performance. Target faced problems from the get go when it entered Canada. There were costly regulations, a slow economy and increasing competition. Cornell said on the blog that when Target Canada first opened the company knew that many Canadian consumers already shopped at its U.S. stores and liked the brand. 'But, we missed the mark from the beginning by taking on too much too fast,' he said. Target Corp. Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said on Thursday that the company didn't see a realistic way for the chain to become profitable before at least 2021 . Cornell said Canadian stores struggled with inventory and pricing problems and 'delivered an experience that didn't meet our guests' expectations, or our own.' Target's experience in Canada hasn't been unique, though. Big Lots Inc. and Best Buy Co. have shuttered stores there and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has seen its sales in Canada weaken. Target said on Thursday that it expects about $5.4 billion in fourth-quarter losses from discontinued operations in Canada. It foresees about $275 million of losses on discontinued operations in fiscal 2015. Target expects cash costs for the exit to be between $500 million and $600 million, with most of those costs taking place in fiscal 2015 or later. The retailer said that it has sufficient resources to fund the expected costs. Target Corp. currently has 17,600 employees at its 133 Canadian stores. It has 1,801 stores in the U.S. Other U.S. retailers to have struggled in the Canadian market include Best Buy and Walmart . The company said it received court approval to voluntarily make about $59 million in cash contributions into an employee trust. Once approved by the court, the proposed trust would give almost all of Target's Canada workers a minimum of 16 weeks of compensation, including wages and benefits coverage for employees not needed for the entire winding down of the business. Target Canada stores will stay open during liquidation. Target Corp. expects the exit will increase its earnings in fiscal 2015 and beyond and boost its cash flow in fiscal 2016 and beyond. Target also announced that it now foresees fourth-quarter sales at U.S. stores open at least a year up about 3 percent. Its previous outlook was for an approximately 2 percent increase. The chain said its raised forecast was due to its performance for the holiday period including November and December. The Minneapolis company said that it had higher traffic and better-than-expected online sales. Sales at stores open at least a year is a key gauge of a retailer's health because it excludes results from stores recently opened or closed. Target expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.43 to $1.47 per share. The company's stock gained $2.66, or 3.6 percent, to $76.99 before the market open.","Just two years after launching north of the border the retailer has announced that it is exiting the Canadian marketplace .

"An ultra-rare classic Jaguar E-Type designed for the race track has been sold for a price believed to be more than £5million. Just 12 of the Lightweight E-Types were ever made, and of those only 11 are still in existence - meaning they are almost never up for sale on the open market. They were designed as stripped-down racing versions of the popular sports car, and were used on well-known tracks against competitors such as the Ferrari 250 GTO. Scroll down for video . Sold: This Lightweight E-Type Jaguar, one of just 11 still in existence, has been bought for millions of pounds . The model sold this week, known as YVH210, was built in 1963 owned by racing driver Peter Sutcliffe, who drove it in competition at Goodwood, the Nurburgring and Spa. Classic car dealership Fiskens, based in Kensington, west London, has now sold two of the rare vehicles within the past year. Dealer Gregor Fisken refused to reveal exactly how much the buyer paid, but it is believed to be between £4-7million. That price tag, prompted by the extreme rarity and historical importance of the car, is 100 times more expensive than a brand new Jaguar F-Type would cost today. Speedy: The car, pictured being driven on a circuit, had a top speed of 150mph in its heyday . Classic: Because of the rarity of the car, it almost never comes up for sale on the open market . Year of construction: 1963 . Top speed: 150mph . Engine size: 3.8 litres . Engine power: 360 bhp . Weight: 1,009kg (2,224lbs) 'This model was raced by Peter Sutcliffe in period and is highly original,' Mr Fisken said after the sale. 'Peter was one of the great privateers. 'He bought the car from Jaguar and ran it himself, racing in Europe, England and South Africa. This car probably did more racing in period than any other E-Type. 'When it was raced at Goodwood, you would expect it to be getting up to more than 150mph. It was a very quick car, using cutting edge technology in the 1960s.' The Lightweight E-Type had recently been restored by Gary Pearson, the son of Peter Sutcliffe's own mechanic. Heyday: The Lightweight E-Type being driven on the racing track at Goodwood in 1964 . New generation: This is one of the rebuilt Lightweight E-Types being built by Jaguar in Coventry . Mr Fisken added: 'I am very familiar with Lightweight E-Types and this is a car I have been after for a number of years. 'It is the second one we have sold in the past year. To sell one in a decade is good, but to sell two in a year is quite something.' The sale comes as Jaguar continues to work on a new generation of Lightweight E-Types, using modern technology to replicate the original cars exactly. The carmaker, which is owned by India's Tata Motors but headquartered in Coventry, is set to produce six of the throwback models. They are being built by Jaguar Heritage, part of the company's new Special Operations division, at Browns Lane plant - the original home of the E-Type. The vehicles will cost £1million each, but because they are made for racing they will not be road legal.","Only 12 of the Lightweight E-Types were ever made and just 11 survive .

"Today's butlers go to great lengths to ensure their guests are looked after. From running the perfect bath - complete with exact water temperature, scattered rose petals and reading materials, to serving silver service meals, attention to detail is paramount. A new infographic gives an insight into the life of a Savoy butler, revealing some of the most off-the-wall requests received from guests. Infographic reveals bizarre requests and top tips from butlers at Fairmont hotels . The London hotel has its own Butler Academy, which aims to train a new generation of butlers to combine the discretion of a traditional butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant. As part of the research, by Fairmont hotels, Head Butler Sean Davoren, 56, revealed some of his strangest requests from guests. He explained that he was once asked to source wild goat's milk for a guest's bath. The milk itself cost £50 but the taxi ride to Wales and back cost £600, finally 30 bottles of heated Evian water were required to rinse the milk off. The infographic also gives travellers tips on how to stay smart, such as keeping 1cm of space between all clothes to ensure air can circulate, which can help to reduce odours and wrinkles; wrapping best outfits in tissue paper; and keeping necklaces from tangling by running one side of each through a plastic straw. Butlers at Fairmont hotels around the world have been given with some peculiar tasks. One guest  wanted to be supplied with 20 pounds of ice for his penguins; a couple staying at a luxury hotel in New York requested a life-sized chocolate statue of themselves for their wedding; and a film crew asked for a professionally trained, camera ready monkey after theirs failed to show up.","Savoy's Head Butler Sean Davoren gives an insight into life as a butler .

"An Afghan villager who risked everything to save the life of a Navy SEAL is seeking asylum in the U.S. after his life came under threat in his home country. Mohammed Gulab could have left heavily injured Marcus Luttrell to die in the mountains, but instead took him to his village and protected him from the Taliban. In the extraordinary story depicted in the movie 'Lone Survivor', Luttrell was the only one of four Navy SEALs to survive a nightmarish firefight in northeastern Afghanistan in June 2005. Scroll down for video . Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell (left) was the lone survivor of a firefight with the Taliban in northeastern Afghanistan in June 2005. Gravely wounded, he was protected by Mohammad Gulab until his rescue by U.S. forces . When Gulab found Luttrell he had been shot twice, suffered several cracked vertebrae and had shrapnel wounds to his leg. Speaking through a translator to CBS's '60 Minutes' in 2013, Gulab said: 'I knew I had to help him; to do the right thing, because he was in a lot of danger.' 'He very well could have just left me laying there on the side of that waterfall and let me die,' Luttrell said. 'But he didn't.' Marcus Luttrell, pictured third from right, was operating in Afghanistan supporting Operation Red Wings, when the rest of his team (pictured with him) were killed in a firefight with the Taliban in June 2005 . Luttrell was rescued by American forces and came home to the US, back to his native Texas. Now Gulab needs help from the U.S. After his crucial role in Luttrell's survival, Gulab and his family had to go into hiding as they received death threats from the Taliban, their house was burned down, and his cousin was killed. These threats had worsened after the release of the movie 'Lone Survivor' depicting the events surrounding Gulab's heroism and Luttrell's dramatic survival. Once audiences in Afghanistan had seen the movie and understood the role Gulab had played, it became dangerous for him to stay in the same place for longer than a night. Mark Wahlberg (second from left) played Luttrell in the 2013 movie 'Lone Survivor'. Once it had been seen in Afghanistan, threats against Gulab's life intensified as his role in Luttrell's survival became more widely known . Last Saturday, with the help of the U.S., he managed to escape Afghanistan with family members to a neutral, undisclosed, third country. He is now working with New York immigration attorney Michael Wildes to gain refugee status to enter the U.S. – the first step towards being granted asylum, CBS reports. Wildes is working on the exceptionally complicated case on a pro bono basis. Mohammad Gulab (left) attended the 'Lone Survivor' New York premiere in December 2013. Immigration lawyer Michael Wildes (right) has said that if he had applied for asylum then he probably could have stayed in the U.S. Much of the complexity comes from the number of agencies involved, from the United Nations to the Department of Homeland Security – and ultimately it is the latter that will make the decision. Ironically, the process could have been made much simpler. Gulab has been to the U.S. before, occasionally visiting Luttrell on his ranch in Texas, and attending the movie's premiere in New York in December 2013. Wildes said Gulab probably could have stayed had he applied for asylum on one of those visits. Despite a language barrier between the two of them, Luttrell and Gulab have become friends and have even gone shooting together on the Texas ranch. Gulab (left) pictured on a December 2013 visit to Luttrell's (right) Texas ranch where the two have enjoyed going shooting together .","An Afghan villager who saved a Navy SEAL, as depicted in the movie 'Lone Survivor', is seeking asylum in U.S. according to his lawyer .

"A conman who wore a Royal Marines uniform to trick people into donating cash for Help for Heroes has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. Liam O'Brien, 32, stood outside train stations and other public places with a red Help for Heroes bucket. He claimed he was a serving sergeant in the special forces who had been given authorisation by the charity to collect the much-needed money. Liam O'Brien (pictured right posing in a Royal Marines uniform) was sentenced to prison for the heartless scam . But a court heard that O'Brien was a convicted fraudster with no military links who pocketed the money himself - including more than £500 in a single day. He was caught when he tried to board a train, again in full uniform, using a fake military free travel pass and a suspicious inspector noted his details. When police searched his home they found five military ID cards in bogus names. A CV claiming to list military experience and a letter of recommendation from Brigadier General John Quintas of the Air Force were also found. They also discovered a folder of credit card details belonging to guests at a hotel where O'Brien had worked. He was jailed for three and a half years yesterday after admitting 12 counts of fraud. Swindon Crown Court heard he had a lengthy list of previous convictions beginning when he was 17, which included numerous charges of fraud using the military. Judge Peter Blair QC told him: 'The public standing of a charity and the trust of a public in a charity is a very high and important standard that needs to be maintained. 'By behaving in this fashion you have risked a very serious goodwill damage to that charity and I regard that as extremely heinous.' He added: 'These sentences will get longer and longer if you keep offending in this way. 'I hope in time you reflect on this behaviour and you will find better things to do with your time when you are released.' The court heard that O'Brien, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, started his scam just days after being released from prison in December 2013 following an 18 month sentence for fraud. He applied to collect for Help for Heroes with the intention of conning the public again. O'Brien was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison when he appeared at Swindon Crown Court (pictured) today . In April last year he tried to board a train in Chippenham wearing a military uniform, including the coveted green Royal Marines beret, and showed a ticket collector a letter from the Department of Transport giving him free travel. Before police were able to arrest him he turned up at the same station a month later, again in uniform, and approached a different inspector. The inspector followed him on board where he noticed O'Brien quickly changed out of his clothes. Unaware of the ongoing investigation into his background, O'Brien appeared outside London's Victoria Station in October purporting to collect for Help for Heroes. Tessa Hingston, prosecuting, told the court: 'The defendant was wearing a full military sergeant's uniform and was using a red Help for Heroes bucket. 'He was challenged and a witness took a picture of his ID. 'The charity said O'Brien had applied to be a collector in December 2013 but had the authorisation rescinded in Februrary because he made no donations and didn't return any merchandise, including a so-called 'shop in a box' worth £250. 'On November 4, the defendant was seen boarding a train at Bath Spa where a police officer recognised him. 'He was in possession of two Help for Heroes buckets, one of which he had collected £513 in small change. 'Again he was wearing the uniform of a Royal Marine Sergeant and had two fake ID cards and a letter purporting to be from Help for Heroes authorising him to collect.' Tony Bignall, defending, said: 'A large extent of why he was detected is because he went back to the scene of the original crime. 'You would have thought having had his details photographed he would have got away from there, but there seemed to be - if not a death wish - then no great attempt to conceal his actions. 'There is no hint of self pity and he doesn't ask anyone to give him any either.'","Liam O'Brien stood outside stations collecting money for Help for Heroes .

"Imran Khan and his new wife faced angry protests from parents during a visit to the Pakistan school where 132 pupils were massacred by the Taliban. The newlyweds attended the Army Public School in Peshawar yesterday to express their condolences a month after the country's worst ever terrorist attack. But the trip quickly descended into a public relations nightmare when they were met by a crowds of grieving relatives chanting: 'Go Imran go!' Some tried to blockade the road to prevent his convoy from entering the school grounds. They were furious that Mr Khan had chosen to marry BBC weather girl Reham Khan three weeks after the massacre instead of spending his time remembering victims of the atrocity. Scroll down for video . Relatives and parents of victims of the Pakistan school massacre shout slogans against Imran Khan during a protest outside the army public school in Peshawar as the ex-cricketer visited to express his condolences . Mr Khan's trip, with his new bride, quickly descended into a public relations nightmare when they were met by a crowds of grieving relatives chanting 'Go Imran go!' who tried to blockade his convoy . The parents are furious that Mr Khan had chosen to marry BBC weather girl Reham Khan three weeks after the massacre instead of spending his time remembering victims of the atrocity . One mother told The Times: 'For one whole day, the [media] showed [Imran Khan's] wedding and valima [wedding banquet]. 'They were not showing anything about the children anymore. Nobody cares and he came to visit after a month.' Some also accused him of staging a media stunt 'to show fake prayers and condolences.' The school re-opened on Monday for the first time since the attack to offer chldren and teachers a week of counselling before lessons start again. Mr Khan told parents that he respected their demonstrations, adding: 'I fully understand their grief. They have lost children.' The marriage has already caused huge controversy in Pakistan where Mr Khan is chairman of opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. The party controls the government of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital. The formal wedding announcement came after a turbulent few weeks for the couple, who have incited the wrath of Mr Khan's family and the wider public in Pakistan. Imran Khan addresses a press conference during his visit to the Army Public School in Peshawar . Mr Khan told parents that he respected their demonstrations, adding: 'I fully understand their grief. They have lost children' Many conservative Pakistanis believe his marriage to a British-Pakistani divorcee is an unsuitable union for right-winger who has made great play of his Islamic faith. Mr Khan tied the knot with Mrs Khan at his home in Islamabad last week - but not single member of his family was invited. His sisters did not attend the 'nikkah' - Islamic marriage ceremony - amid reports they do not approve of the match. Aleema Khan said: 'We were neither aware nor informed of the nikkah prior to this.' Some protesters accused Mr Khan of staging a media stunt 'to show fake prayers and condolences' Parents of children murdered in the Peshawar attack hold placards and chant slogans against Imran Khan . Police stand guard for any unrest during demonstrations outside the school where 132 children were killed . A head boy has told how he survived the Pakistan school massacre by hiding in a bathroom for five hours after watching his best friends die in the attack. Muneeb Ullah Shah (pictured right) said was attending a first aid class in the school auditorium when Taliban militants burst into the room in a hail of gunfire. He said: 'The back doors of the auditorium were locked, but the terrorists just opened the door very forcefully and then they just started firing. 'Everyone was rushing out of the auditorium. 'They started firing at two doors - one on the left hand side of the room and the other on the right side. 'I went to the left door and as I was going out, they started firing.' A single bullet grazed his upper left arm, ripping his white school shirt and breaking the skin - staining a patch of his white school shirt in blood. Muneeb added: 'My mind was not working. I ran to the staff room, one of the teachers was there and told me to hide in the washroom. Five to ten minutes later, there was some firing. 'I was very scared because I knew that meant the terrorists were nearby. 'They broke the door of the staff room, then they started firing, bombs were blasting, we were just praying to Allah. 'I thought ""this is my last moment"". I was praying. Every door and window was broken, there was nothing left but one door, which was the washroom door which was closed. 'The terrorists were shouting and giving instructions. We were there for five hours. 'When the Pakistani army started their search operation, we thought we had a chance of surviving, but there was still a lot of blasts, so my ears weren't working.' The teenager, who is planning to train as an engineer, was eventually rescued by the Pakistani Army after the last of the terrorists were killed. He was eventually able to relay word to his father, who fell to the floor with joy. Finally: Imran Khan married his fiance, Reham, at an intimate wedding ceremony in Islamabad . Intimate: Close friends and family attended the ceremony but it's thought that Imran Khan's sisters did not . However the bride's mother, sister and two close friends were all present for the intimate ceremony, according to her nephew Yusuf Khan. He said: 'The majority of our family lives in UK and USA and that is the reason only my mother, grandmother and I attended it from close family.' Mr Khan's spokesman said the wedding was kept small to honour the 145 victims of the terrorist attack on the school in Peshawar. Formalities: A close friend of Imran Khan's confirmed that a dowry of 82,000 rupees - around £850 - was agreed for the bride . Honour: Mr Khan's spokesperson says the wedding was kept small in respect for the 132 children who died in the Peshawar school massacre . Spokesman Naeemul Haq said:  'We did not want to celebrate it in big way due to the Peshawar school massacre. 'They look very elegant together. It is the biggest news of the new year for the people of Pakistan.' Imran Khan's sister, Aleema, confirmed that none of his family were present and said they were never asked to attend. Aleema Khan said: 'We, all the sisters, were never informed or contacted by Imran so there was no question to attend it. All of us are in Lahore.' Zakir Khan, a close friend of Mr Khan's who witnessed the marriage, confirmed the dowry, a ceremonial fee paid for the bride, was 82,000 rupees - around £850. A friend of Mrs Khan, 41, told how she was suffering emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician. Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . Some social media users have accused the divorced mother-of-three of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop. A producer at Dawn TV told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'. The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed. 'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.' Mr Khan previously spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime. Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend.","Crowds try to blockade politician's convoy amid chants of: 'Go, Imran, go!'

"A police chief who accidentally shot his wife as she slept in their Atlanta home early on New Year's Day has been married four previous times, an investigation has revealed. William McCollom, the chief of police in Peachtree City, told authorities that his gun accidentally went off as he moved it in the night and now agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and a local prosecutor are conducting a criminal probe and examining his career. His wife, Margaret McCollom, whom he had previously divorced, is paralyzed from the waist down following the incident, WSBTV reported. She was released from Atlanta Medical Center earlier this week. She told investigators she cannot shed light on the incident because she was sleeping but that she believes it was an accident. Investigation: Peachtree City Chief of Police William McCollom, pictured left, dialed 911 to report accidentally shooting his wife Margaret, right, as she slept in their suburban Atlanta home early New Year's Day . Records show that her husband waited nearly two minutes into the 911 call to mention where he worked. 'You're the chief of police in Peachtree City?' the dispatcher repeated. 'Yeah, unfortunately, yes,' he responded. As soon as the bullet struck his wife, McCollom's personal life and three-decade history in law enforcement were bound for intense scrutiny. As the investigation into his past commences, he also faces an internal inquiry that could result in discipline. McCollom has gone through four divorces, including one from Margaret McCollom. It's unclear whether William and Margaret McCollom ever remarried, though investigators refer to them as husband and wife. None of McCollom's divorce filings indicate he had ever been violent. He married two of the women in Wyoming, where they remain, and had three children with one. Ex-wife: His fourth wife, Suzanne Carter, divorced McCollom last year, claiming he'd cheated on her . His fourth wife, previously named by DailyMail.com as Suzanne Carter, is a rabbi who was the police department chaplain in Delray Beach, Florida when McCollo, was chief there. They married in 2002 and divorced in 2014 after she claims he cheated on her, which he denied. On the professional front, hundreds of pages of records from his personnel files contain no evidence of criminality, major misconduct or recklessness for the former firearms instructor who once trained a SWAT team on combat shooting. 'Everybody's scratching their head,' said Michael Couzzo Jr., the village manager who hired McCollom as the police chief in Tequesta, Florida, in 2006. 'They're scratching their heads saying, ""How could this have happened?""' Investigators have not publicly speculated on what led up to the shooting. Only a few details are known. McCollom called 911 around 4:17 a.m. and told a dispatcher his handgun fired as he moved it. McCollom also said he and his wife were sleeping. He told the 911 dispatcher that he had shot his wife, a former emergency-room nurse, twice with his police-issued Glock 9 mm handgun. But it was later determined that she had only been hit once. Mrs McCollom told investigators she was sleeping when shot and couldn't offer more information. The wife said she thought the shooting was an accident, GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said. If investigators deem the shooting an accident, a police officer might avoid criminal charges and could potentially keep his job, said Robert Verry, a longtime internal affairs investigator in New Jersey and policing instructor. He is not involved in the probe. Scene: He told the 911 dispatcher he had shot his wife as she slept while he moved his gun just after 4am on January 1. His wife told investigators that she believes it was accidental . Recovering: His wife Margaret, pictured right, is said to now be paralyzed from the waist down . 'It's so premature it's tough to tell,' Verry said. 'The devil's in the details.' Born in northeast Wyoming, McCollom, 57, briefly served as a reserve deputy in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in late 1982, according to his resume. County officials could not immediately determine whether employment records from that period still exist. McCollom twice married women in Wyoming, including his second wife, with whom he had three children. Both of those marriages ended in divorce. He found a job in 1983 as a police officer in Delray Beach, Florida, where he worked for 23 years. He rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the assistant chief. 'His tactics were safe,' said Delray Beach Police Lt. Vinnie Gray, a union representative who served on the SWAT team with McCollom. 'It was a shock to see what happened' in Georgia. In 1988, as McCollom's career accelerated, he wed Margaret. They divorced 11 years later. The FBI investigated McCollom around 1993 over an allegation he knocked out the front teeth of a suspect arrested for battery on a police officer, McCollom said in a job application. Old booking photos showed the accuser did not have teeth prior to the arrest. McCollom said the booking photo from the arrest in question did not show any injuries. 'The facts and independent witness testimony proved the subject was lying and the investigation exonerated me after my initial interview,' McCollom wrote. Good record: McCollom ,who has been married four times, first worked for the Delray Beach, Florida police force, where he worked for 23 years and eventually became the assistant chief . McCollom was disciplined once in 2005 after being accused of ordering a subordinate to request free hotel rooms for deputy sheriffs, according to his internal affairs file. Delray Beach Police Chief Larry Schroeder, who counseled McCollom over it, did not return messages seeking comment. McCollom got hired as chief of the small department in Tequesta in 2006, but life drew him back to Wyoming. In early 2010, McCollom sought unpaid leave, telling colleagues he needed to care for an ailing sister and help a family construction business. 'I have an opportunity to enter the private sector as an independent contractor and have decided it is now or never,' McCollom wrote in a resignation letter. His fourth wife filed for divorce in March 2011. Around that time, his former wife, Margaret, rejoined him in Wyoming, said the chief's sister, Barbara Sutherland. Sutherland said she believed the couple remarried after he took the police chief's job in Georgia. 'The second time around, they grew up, they figured it out,' she said.","William McCollom, the chief of police in Peachtree City, Georgia, called 911 on January 1 to say he had accidentally shot his wife, Margaret .

"Two small endangered monkeys died because a caretaker 'overlooked' them and left them out in the cold at a zoo in central Louisiana. The cotton-top tamarins, which weigh less than a pound, were left out in the cold last week at the Alexandria Zoological Park. A third monkey survived the exposure. Cotton-top tamarins are native to Colombia's northern tropical forests and there are only around 6,000 left in the world (stock image) The monkeys weigh less than one pound each and need temperatures of 76 to 85 degrees. The high last Wednesday in Alexandria was in the 50s. Thursday morning's low was in the teens. It's not clear exactly how the monkeys were overlooked or whether they had an outdoor 'nest box' with a heating unit. Public Works director, David Gill, told the Washington Post: 'The employee who was initially on administration leave and had been removed from any animal care, has resigned. 'This appears to have happened as a result of human error and not a system problem.' City spokeswoman Cynthia Jardon wrote in an email Tuesday that she couldn't provide details because of an ongoing investigation. The caretaker resigned Monday and there have been calls for a federal investigation into the deaths. The monkeys' natural habitat is in Colombia's northern tropical forests and there are only around 6,000 of the cotton-top tamarins left.","The cotton-top tamarins, which weigh less than a pound, need temperatures of 76 to 85 degrees to survive .

"Identified: Lindsay Groce Garder, 27, and her 13-month-old daughter Hailey Gardner were identified as the two bodies found in a Fort Worth, Texas field on Tuesday . The bodies of a naked woman found lying on top of a 1-year-old girl in a field not far from a crashed car have been identified but questions about how the mother and daughter died remain a mystery. On Wednesday, the Tarrant County medical examiner's office named 27-year-old Lindsay Groce Gardner and her 13-month-old daughter Hailey Gardner as the victims discovered in the Fort Worth, Texas field. Ms Gardner lived in an apartment building about five miles away from where her lifeless body was found Tuesday morning by a fence repairman. The fence repairman discovered the body just 200 yards away from the scene where police investigated a mysteriously empty crashed car earlier that morning. Gardner's clothes were strewn in the field between the car and her body, indicating she undressed as she walked with her baby away from the car. Investigators now believe that the two incidents are related, but they're still uncertain whether the crash was the cause of death for the mother and daughter since they did not appear to be injured other than a few scratches. It also doesn't explain why they were found so far from the vehicle. 'There were no injuries that looked like they would cause a person’s death,' Sgt Joe Loughman said. The medical examiner's office is still working to determine the cause of death, while police try to pinpoint when the crash happened. According to excerpts from a personal blog, published in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Gardner was a married freelance artist who previously lived in California. Scroll down for video . Tragic scene: Gardner and her daughter were found about 200 yards away from this crashed car. Investigators believe the two incidents were related, but are still uncertain how the mother and daughter died . In a post from August 2013, she wrote about stress concerning a move to Lancaster, California. 'Why can’t things just go the way you plan them? Why does God constantly have another path? These are things I get to thinking. You’ve probably thought them before too. Why do we even bother thinking that? He already had a path. 'It’s our scared insecure brains that try to tie all the knots of false insecurity together into believing that we are going to be ok because of our ‘plan'. Even though, constantly, again and again, our plan fails, falls apart, crumbles, vanishes. But God’s plans are always solid. He always follows through and takes care of us. 'Please pray for me and my family. My husband and I are going back to no home, no job, and pregnant,'  she wrote. On Wednesday, friends began posting memorials to Gardner on her Facebook page. One friend wrote: 'She was such a sweet spirit, so genuine, and an incredible artist. She was so in love with her baby and we both shared a passion for gentle parenting. She wanted to be the best mother she could be for her.' Family: According to a personal blog, Gardner was married and worked as a freelance artist. In her last post from April 2013, she wrote about being pregnant and organizing a move to Lancaster, California with her husband Anthony Gardner (pictured above with their daughter) Married: Gardner's Facebook profile says she has been married to Anthony Gardner since June 29, 2012 . Mystery: The medical examiner's office is still trying to determine the cause of death for Gardner and her small child . The crashed Toyota sedan was first reported Tuesday morning around 8:30am by resident Amber Bentley, who spotted the car after dropping her kids off at school. 'There's always deer in that field,' Bentley told reporters when she returned to the scene off Dirks Road later that day. 'I was looking for the deer and I saw the car … It was against a tree and the hood was smashed in and the driver's side door was open. 'I was hollering asking if everybody was OK, hoping if somebody was in there that they could at least respond.' Since Bentley had a child in the car at the time, she couldn't get out to approach the car, but called police and stayed until they showed up. While the airbags were deployed, police found the vehicle empty. It wasn't until a man came to repair a fence at 11am that the bodies were found, about 200 yards away. The fence repairman came upon the bodies in a field and found the woman naked, lying on top of the child, who was in a car seat, according to sources who spoke with WFAA. What happened? Investigators gather at the scene where the bodies were found on Tuesday in Fort Worth . Undressing: The crashed car was found empty and the bodies 200 yards away. Gardner was found naked, with a trail of clothes from the car suggesting she disrobed as she walked away from the vehicle . 'I cannot comment on why there was a delay between the call that was made and the bodies being found,' Natosha Tucker of the Fort Worth police said Tuesday. The mysterious case has rocked the local community, with residents desperate for answers to the seemingly senseless deaths of the mother and child. Caroline McLendon, who lives next door to the mother's parents, said she was 'just horrified' to hear about Gardner's death. 'I wanted to tell her how sorry I was that this has happened to that lovely family,' McLendon told NBC DFW. Resident Linda Fuqua is confused, like many in the community. 'It’s perplexing, the fact the bodies were away from the car, you think they would have been in the car,' she said. 'But now I’m wondering, what happened. Was she trying to get away or help herself from the accident with her child?'","The victims have been identified as 27-year-old Lindsay Groce Gardner and her daughter Hailey Gardner, 13 months .

"A woman who had three liver transplants and was given just hours to live has celebrated her good health by getting married. Kate Jakes, 22, from Birmingham, never thought she would find love due to her health problems, which saw her go undergo three gruelling operations in just three years after her body repeatedly rejected her new livers. But, after years of hospital appointments and surgeries, the blogger met her future husband, Gareth, 25, on a rare day away from hospital - and the pair married last month. In March last year Gareth proposed to Kate and they were married last month . Kate, pictured in hospital before her second liver transplant, never thought she would find love . Kate said: 'With all my health issues, I come with a lot of baggage, so I never thought I'd find love. 'The first time I met Gareth my skin was still yellow and I had a big tube in my nose, but he saw through it and treated me like a normal person. 'It was so refreshing because everyone was used to constantly tiptoe-ing around me and wrapping me in cotton wool because I'd been unwell for so long. 'I'd lost a lot of my younger years on hospital wards so I was shocked he was interested in me, normally as soon as people heard I was a transplant patient they were too scared. Kate was given had two unsuccessful liver transplants before the third and final one was a success. Pictured - the 22-year-old's stomach showing the scars from transplants one and two . Kate Jakes, 22, spent three years battling life-threatening liver failure, but has now celebrated returning to good health by marrying her husband Gareth . Kate, pictured in hospital, was told that she would be lucky to survive a week if doctors failed to find a donor . 'I had to warn him that I would be ill a lot of the time and might have a shorter life expectancy because of being a transplant patient. 'It wasn't the most romantic way to get to know someone but we had to be honest with each other.' After experiencing health issues for much of her life, Kate wondered if she would ever find love. She said: 'I used to get really upset, talking to my mum about how I'd never have a relationship with anyone. 'I wondered if anyone would ever want to deal with the hassle, but it didn't faze Gareth at all. Kate, pictured left before transplant number three and before her date with Gareth, and, right, after the operation, says Gareth met her when she still had tubes in her nose and was not phased at all . 'In the beginning of our relationship, whenever I used to talk about my health problems, he'd change the subject. 'It was strange to get used to, but refreshing, he wanted to know me but in a different way to everybody else - he didn't care about my health issues.' Kate began experiencing symptoms of liver failure when she was just 16 years old. Her worried parents, Tracey Tolley and Mike Trevener, put her lack of energy down to her being a teenager, but soon her exhaustion began to take over her life. She said: 'At school I would find that I couldn't concentrate and would bring a lot of my work home, I just lacked energy to think clearly. 'It got to the point where I planned days out with friends, was looking forward to them, but had to cancel because I couldn't pull myself out of bed.' Kate says it was amazing to find someone who didn't tiptoe around her illness . But it wasn't until Kate passed out at a supermarket that her parents realised something wasn't right. Kate said: 'I came round and couldn't stand up on my own, my Dad had to support me even when taking a few steps. Kate is now back to normal health but says that she has to take things a bit slower . 'I went to the doctor's surgery and the nurse took two looks and pulled a very worried face. 'A GP rushed in and noticed how jaundiced I looked - he called an ambulance straight away.' Kate spent three weeks at Heartlands Hospital, while doctors tried to determine the cause of her symptoms. She was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital where she was diagnosed with end stage liver failure caused by auto immune hepatitis - a condition that is caused by an unknown virus that causes the body to attack itself, thinking your organs are foreign objects. Kate said: 'I was diagnosed two days before my 18th birthday. 'My family and I were told the news, and then the doctors then introduced us to two transplant coordinators - they told me I'd be lucky to survive until the end of the week without a liver transplant. 'After I heard that everything turned to white noise. 'I couldn't concentrate or take in anything the doctors said. 'In my hospital bed, it didn't feel like my last week to live. I had to remain positive. 'It felt so dreadful and feared what would happen if they couldn't get me a liver in time. 'But I kept thinking that if I died I didn't want my family to remember me in pain and a misery, I wanted to leave them with happy memories.' Kate's case was urgent and she was bumped to the top of the transplant list. Time ticked away and with less than 48 hours to live, doctors raced to tell Kate that they'd found a liver, which was being flown over from Ireland. Little did they know, the plane carrying Kate's new liver had crashed on the runway at Birmingham Airport, after heavy fog and bad weather conditions made it difficult for the pilot to land. Surgeons worried the organ may have been damaged in the crash that hospitalised two people, but fortunately it was found by the fire services who plucked it from the burning plane and rushed it to the hospital. The transplant was complete, but eight days later the family's joy was dashed, when Kate's body rejected the new liver. Kate was put back on the transplant list, and was placed in a medically induced coma to prolong her life. Remarkably, a second liver was soon found and a second transplant took place. But six months later Katie's skin returned to a jaundiced glow, a clear sign that her body was rejecting this liver too. Kate said: 'A lot of people die waiting on the transplant list so I felt so lucky to have had the two livers but equally shocked they had failed. 'The first two kept me alive long enough to try again and gave me that chance to fight my rare condition, it spurred me on to keep fighting.' Kate met Gareth just three weeks after her final transplant and the pair instantly clicked . Kate's health continued to get worse - she suffered from fluid retention around her heart and lungs as well as severe kidney failure, almost heading into a coma. Three months later, Kate was overjoyed once more to discover that a third liver was found. Remarkably, her body accepted the liver and her health started to pick up. Three weeks later Kate was discharged from hospital for the weekend where she met Gareth, an airman in the RAP, at a party. Quickly the couple grew close and in March last year, Gareth popped the question. Kate said: 'He came home one day and asked me to marry him. 'It wasn't a big fancy engagement, but it was perfect for us. ' The couple finally married in July last year and are now planning their honeymoon. Kate said: 'I should have died at 18 before I had my first transplant, so to find love and to have married Gareth has made me happier than I could have imagined. 'I never thought anyone would be able to overlook everything I've been through. 'My health is now fine, although I still have to take things a bit slower than other people, a day's shopping will tire me out, which Gareth's probably grateful for.'

"Burned, in pain, and close to death: that is how  Cinder the black bear was discovered in the aftermath of the largest forest fire ever to rip through Washington state last year. Trapped among the flames she had somehow managed to survive, but had suffered third degree burns to all four of her paws that meant she was reduced to crawling along on her elbows. But now thanks to the efforts of staff at Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care she is getting ready to be released back into the wild after making a full recovery. Scroll down for video . Burned: Cinder was found crawling on her elbows after her feet were badly burned during the largest forest fire to ever hit Washington state last year . Suffering: If left on her own she would have suffered a slow an inevitable death, but was instead flown to Lake Tahoe to a rescue centre where they went about nursing her back to health . Wounded: When Cinder arrived at the centre she was under weight, badly burned and close to death. But now she is almost ready to be released back into the wild . In July 2014 three separate forest fires all caused by lightening strikes converged in the Carlton Complex area of Washington, reducing more than 250,000 acres of forest to ashes. The flames burned for more than a week, creating the biggest forest fire the state had ever seen, taking more than 3,000 fire fighters to bring it under control. Care: Staff at the centre are specialists in treating bears less than one year old. Cinder was aged just nine months when she was brought in . An estimated 300 houses were burned to the ground around Pateros and Malott, and it was here that a homeowner discovered Cinder after returning to inspect the ruins of their property. The 18-month-old cub was severely injured, badly underweight, and in so much pain she couldn't stand up. Left on her own, she would have died a slow, painful and inevitable death. But instead rescue workers used a sedative to knock her out, before flying her more than more than 800 miles to Lake Tahoe in neighbouring California. Once there specialist staff at the LTWC began working on nursing her back to full health. Tom Millham, the secretary of LTWC, said: 'Fortunately, when Cinder came to us in August everything came together. 'Dr Kevin Willetts – our voluntary veterinarian – took over as he has over 30 years' experience of dealing with our major medical emergencies. 'Cinder was already a wild bear which meant we didn't have to do too much rehabilitation. It was all about the medical care for her. 'From the day she came in we had her set up on an every other day treatment where we changed the dressings on her wounds. 'For over six weeks we changed the dressings every other day and then we increased the time between them. 'From September 30 we stopped putting dressings on her feet to let them heal on their own.' After her wounds had healed she was transferred to the Idaho Black Bear Centre in Idaho, where she is now going through the last phase of her healing process before going back to nature. She has been placed next to another one year old cub to get her used to other bears and is spending time outside to get her paws used to the cold weather. On the mend: Cinder has now put on weight, regrown her scorched fur, and had almost all of the bandages removed from her feet, and is getting ready to be returned to the wild . Alone: It is believed that Cinders' mother died in the forest fire, so she has been placed with other bears at a rescue centre to get her used to their company before she is released . Mr Millham added: 'Our normal procedure means we knock out the bear to make it easier for her to move them. She was out within a few minutes and then we put her on a stretcher to weigh her. 'Her weight tripled in the time we looked after her from 39lbs - which is really light for a second year cub. We weighed her the other day she was 97lbs with a really fat stomach which is good for her. 'We're really pleased with the progress she has made. She was a perfect lady on the trip – she barely made a sound on the drive. 'Bears will normally sleep for that long, but she kept herself busy with a toy and she had her favourite grapes to feed on. Treatment: Staff at Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care dress Cinders' wounds as they nurse her back to health . Recovery: After being treated in Tahoe, Cinders was moved to the Idaho Black Bear Centre where she is currently waiting to be released back into the Washington wild . 'Once we got to Idaho it took her a matter of seconds to pop her head out and explore her new surrounds. We're so happy with the way she's healed.' Tom and his wife Cheryl set up LTWC in 1978 after attending a wildlife seminar and have helped heal more than 20,000 animals in their 36 year history. The animal charity is the only certified wildlife centre to rehabilitate bear cubs under one year in the state of California.","Cinder was discovered after largest forest fire in Washington's history .

"Parents in Alabama have cause for concern, after the release of a new report which shows more teachers are arrested in their state for having sex with students than anywhere else in the nation. The report was compiled by Terry Abbott, a former chief of staff of the U.S. Department of Education, who spent all of 2014 recording each news report of teacher sex cases in every state - finding 25 in Alabama. He says that while his report is not scientific, since it draws only on media reports, it shows trends in what is becoming an alarmingly wide-spread issue. 1. Alabama . 2. Kentucky . 3. Louisiana . 4. Vermont . 5. Mississippi . 6. District of Columbia . 7. Texas . 8. Utah . 9. Alaska . 10. New Mexico . 1. Texas - 116 cases . 2. Pennsylvania - 45 cases . 3. California - 43 cases . 4. Florida - 40 cases . 5. Ohio - 37 cases . 6. North Carolina - 31 cases . 7. New Jersey - 28 cases . 8. New York - 27 cases . 9. Alabama - 25 cases . 10. Illinois - 25 cases . Another factor that influences the data is the difference in states laws. In some states, like Michigan, it's illegal  for a teacher to engage in sexual relations with a student, no matter what the student's age. In other states the legislation is more lax, with relationships not being a crime if the student is over 16, as is the law in Wyoming. Therefore, there are likely to be more reported cases of teacher-student sex cases in Michigan than Wyoming. Six of the Alabama teachers DailyMail.com has covered in 2014: . LaTangela Williams (left) and Jennifer McNeill (right) were both sentenced to prison terms in 2014 for their inappropriate relationships with students. Williams worked as a health teacher at Selma High School where she had sexual contact with a two students. McNeill was a high school teacher and cheerleading coach who had a sexual relationship with 14-year-old boy who was not her student . Substitute teacher Karen Dylan Holt (left) was arrested in July over claims she had sex with a 15-year-old student. Married math teacher Crystal Clowdus (right) pleaded guilty last March for a light six-month prison sentence after she was caught sending nude pictures to a boy at Susan Moore High School . Ashley Parkins Pruitt (left), a married teacher and mother-of-one, was arrested in November on charges she had sex with three different students. Kristina McMillian Kelly (right), a substitute middle school teacher, was arrested last March for charges of raping a student . Abbott and his PR team at Drive West Communications in Houston, Texas counted a total of 781 cases, which included teachers or school employees who were arrested, charged, convicted or sentenced for such crimes in 2014. While Alabama didn't have the largest percentage of cases (Texas took that prize with 116), it had the most for it's population size, making it the state with the highest rate of teacher-student sex. Abbot, who was born and spent nearly four decades of his life in the state, hopes his report will help bring chance to Alabama. 'I want my grandchildren, one of these days, to be safe in Alabama's classrooms,' Abbott told AL.com. 'I think we have to be aware that, as many great teachers as there are in Alabama, we've seen that there are still sexual predators in our classrooms, preying on our children.' He thinks that one way to combat this issue is by pushing for more uniform laws against teacher-student sex across the nation. 'Teachers have authority over children every day, so it's very important to protect that relationship, and any teacher who abuses that authority and takes advantage of a child in the classroom, that should be considered a serious crime,' Abbott said.","Kentucky, Louisiana, Vermont and Mississippi round out the top five .

"Two wealthy couples who spent £500,000 on a venomous legal battle over ‘a few feet’ of muddy ditch between their homes have been slammed by judges for their 'absurd' waste of money. The couples each lavished six-figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in Cheshire. Today judges ruled on an appeal launched by one of the couple's, giving sole ownership of the lane while allowing the other couple limited usage. But they criticised the toxic legal battle, calling it 'Dickensian' and pointing out that it had lasted longer than some murder trials. Bitter: The couples each lavished six-figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in Cheshire. Far right, the Hodgsons' property and left, the Gilkses' Richard Gilks and his wife Heidi won a ruling in 2013 that stated they owned the ditch and and half of the adjoining track that runs next to their five-acre property in Mobberley. The couple use the route as a shortcut to Wilmslow – home to Sir Alex Ferguson and a host of other celebrities. Their neighbours, Adrian Hodgson, 75, and his wife Joanne, 63 – who breed alpacas and wallabies – appealed the decision, fearing their animals were being disturbed by passing traffic. Judges ruled today that the disputed track falls entirely within the boundary of their home. But the court also stated that the Gilkses still hold the right to drive vehicles along the path in one direction, but  only  for agricultural purposes. And the couples were today criticised by judges who expressed 'dismay' at the trial, which had lasted longer than some murder trials. Dispute: Richard Gilks (left) won a ruling in their favour in 2013 but his rival Adrian Hodgson, right, who said the Gilkses' cars disturb the animals they breed, won his appeal today . Describing the dispute as 'depressingly unfortunate', Sir Stanley Burnton said: 'The costs so far approach half a million pounds, far more that the value of the rights involved'. While Lord Justice Christopher Clarke described the couples' 'wasteful endeavours' in court as an 'absurd waste of effort'. Lord Justice Bean added: 'I only add how dismayed I have been by this Dickensian litigation'. He pointed out that the toxic legal battle has taken up 13 days of court time, 'more than some murder trials'. Shared: Judges ruled that the track, pictured above, belongs solely to the Hodgsons, but stated the Gilkses could still use it - in one direction, and only for agricultural purposes . The area surrounding Mobberley and Wilmslow is home to football stars including Wayne Rooney, Louis van Gaal and Joe Hart. The Hodgsons' counsel, Caroline Hutton, said that the couples initially got on well after the Gilkses moved into their property in 2004. However, they fell out bitterly over a planning dispute and then went to war over the ditch and the track. The Gilkses won a ruling at Manchester County Court in December 2013, when Judge Ernest Armitage QC drew their boundary in the middle of Clay Lane. 'Absurd': Heidi Gilks (left) and her husband Richard, and Joanne Hodgson (right) and her husband Adrian were slammed by judges after spending nearly £500,000 on their 'toxic' legal battle . Overturning that decision today, Sir Stanley Burnton ruled that the whole of the track belongs to Mr and Mrs Hodgson. However, through long useage, Mr and Mrs Gilks had acquired a right to drive agricultural vehicles along the lane, he said. Lord Justice Bean today expressed his dismay at the toxic legal battle, describing it as an example of 'Dickensian litigation'. The statement references Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House, which was published in instalments between 1852 and 1853. The novel dramatises the flaws in the Court of Chancery, which handled cases such as property disputes at the time, and was seen as an ineffective, expensive and technically difficult system. The plot is centered around the Jarndyce vs Jarndyce suit, which spans a number of years. Over the course of the litigation, the happiness and lives of those involved is destroyed as the family become obsessed with pursuing their claims and waiting for the long-expected judgement. In the end, the costs of the case are found to have consumed the property in dispute. The right of way only runs east, and not south, from the property's gate and is for agricultural purposes only. Lamenting the couples' decision to take the issue to the courts, Sir Stanley said: 'This is a dispute which could and should have been compromised on terms that both parties could live with'. Lord Justice Bean added: 'The disputed strip of land and right of way do not constitute the sole means of access to anyone's home'. 'At a time when the courts are under great pressure, the battle between these two couples took up 10 days of court time - more than some murder trials - before Judge Armitage and three days in the Court of Appeal. 'About half a million has been spent in costs - it is as though...civil procedured reformers over the years have laboured in vain'. Lord Justice Clarke said: 'The enmity of the parties has caused them to incur costs and to use up the time of the courts, to the detriment of other litigants, to an extent grossly disproportionate to what was at stake. 'If parties, or one of them, insist on litigating in this way, it is difficult for the court to cut short their wasteful endeavours, however much it may try to do so. 'I hope that the example of this litigation may encourage others who are concerned in like disputes...to take every step that they can to avoid the absurd waste of effort, time and cost, for both parties, which this case has  involved'.","Legal dispute centred on drainage ditch and path between two properties .

"It is the rolling countryside that inspired John Constable's most celebrated works, including his masterpiece - The Hay Wain. But residents fear that 'Constable country' is under threat because of a proposed development which could bring 160 houses to the small Suffolk village where the landscape painter was born. Developers have put forward plans for a mix of 50 affordable homes, 94 town houses and several apartments on the outskirts of East Bergholt. The homes would be built just over a mile from Flatford, where Constable painted The Hay Wain in 1821 as well as The Leaping Horse and The Lock. Developers hope to build near Flatford, where John Constable painted The Hay Wain (pictured) in 1821 . Constable recognised that his primary inspiration was the landscape surrounding Dedham Vale and once said: 'I should paint my own places best'. Residents are determined to protect the artist's legacy and have raised concerns that the great artist may have sketched the fields where the homes could be built. Patricia Wright, secretary of the East Bergholt Society, told The Times: 'We don't want a big development dumped down on a corner of the village. We would like a modest number of small developments.' 'Constable wrote, 'Those scenes made me a painter and I am grateful.' So are we, and we are determined that his legacy will not be lost on our watch.' Up to 160 homes could be built at the site in  East Bergholt (shaded red area) - just over a mile from Flatford Mill, where Constable painted the Hay Wain . This is the spot from which Constable set up his easel to make preliminary sketches for The Hay Wain (pictured today) She conceded that the fields were on the opposite side of the village to Flatford Mill but said that they still deserved to be protected. The village sits within the Dedham Vale and Stour Valley - an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is 20 minutes from Ipswich. Developers Bidwells and Knight Developments have not yet submitted a planning application, as they are waiting for the results of a survey. Constable recognised that his primary inspiration was the landscape surrounding Dedham Vale and once said: 'I should paint my own places best' 'Once all the views are taken into account we will submit the application to Babergh District Council,' said the developers. Peter Dent, of the campaign group Action East Bergholt, said: 'We are not against development totally but 144 homes in one hit is absurd.' Constable completed The Hay Wain in 1821 and nearly 200 years on, you can still stand at the exact spot where he set up his easel beside the River Stour at Flatford. The painting was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821, but failed to find a buyer. But when it was exhibited in France, with other paintings by Constable, the artist was awarded a Gold Medal by Charles X. For many years the Flatford site has been in the hands of the National Trust, which organises 'Constable Country' tours of Flatford and the surrounding countryside. The Mill was once owned by John Constable's father and the artist made the surrounding  area the subject of many of his works. Constable was largely self-taught, but became a student at the Royal Academy schools at the age of 24. He exhibited from 1802 at the Royal Academy in London and later at the Paris Salon and influenced the Barbizon School and the French Romantic movement. Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, Constable was never financially successful. He did not become a member of the establishment until he was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 52. Constable's View on the Stour near Dedham which was completed in 1822. An x-ray of the original sketch of the painting shows two boys fishing - something which did not appear on the final painting .

Kordale Lewis and his fiance Kaleb, from Atlanta, Georgia, star alongside their three adorable children in the video, offering further insight into their 'normal' day-to-day life - and insisting that nobody outside of their family should pass judgement on how they choose to live. 'We just want people to know that, hey, we're normal, and you can't judge people on their normal, you really can't,' one of the fathers says at the start of the clip. Family photo: Kaleb and Kordale star in a new Nikon campaign with their three children, Desmiray, Malia, and Kordale Jr. Where it all began: The fathers first hit the headlines back in January last year when they posted this picture of their morning routine on Instagram . The adoptive fathers, whose children Desmiray, 8, Malia, 7, and Kordale Jr., 6, admit that they were stunned at the response to their original Instagram image, particularly as they felt it captured nothing out of the ordinary for them. 'It was a simple, innocent picture and then the next thing you know, it went viral,' the couple explain. 'The comments were a trip. It didn’t make me feel any way, because I know they don’t know what we go through, I know they don’t know our children, I know they don’t know our lifestyle, they don’t know how we live.' When they uploaded the now-infamous picture to their Instagram account, the couple simply wanted to share with others the dedication and devotion that they show towards their children as parents. At the time, they captioned the image: 'Being fathers is getting our daughters up at 5.30am making breakfast getting them dressed for school and putting them on the bus by 6.30. Older sister: Desmiray, 8, is the eldest of Kaleb and Kordale's three children . Middle child: Malia, 7, often features in her father's Instagram pictures . Baby of the bunch: Kordale Jr., 6, is the youngest of the three children and Kordale and Kaleb's only son . 'This is a typical day in our household. It's not easy but we enjoy every moment and every minute of fatherhood.' At the time, the couple admitted that they were hurt by the fact that some people suggested they were unable to raise their children properly, because of their sexuality, their gender or their race. While Kordale and Kaleb were quick to delete any and all negative comments posted on their account, they admitted that the bitter words of some critics had a profound and lasting effect on them. 'We may be gay but this does not mean we are incapable of what a heterosexual couple is capable of!' they wrote in a post for HuffPost Gay Voices. 'Our main objective as parents is to provide, love, educate, support, encourage, and love some more.' In the video, they reiterate the fact that their roles as fathers to their three children come before anything else in their lives. 'We as parents bring kids into the world and we have to guide them to be better people than we are,' they explain. Everyday routine: The fathers haven't allowed the negative online criticism to stop them from living their lives, and enjoying every minute that they get to spend with their children . Doting dad: Both parents insist they are 100 per cent dedicated to their roles as fathers to the three children . True love: The couple continue to share snippets from their life on their Instagram account . 'And we want them to be better people than we are. And we want them to succeed and do things that we weren't able to do. 'And those kids have our hearts and I can't sit here and explain to you in words why we feel the way that we feel for our children. But those are our kids and nobody else can tell me anything different.' Despite the negative reactions of some people, Kordale and Kaleb have also received an overwhelming amount of support from a number of people, who have been quick to praise the pair for setting such a brilliant example of what fatherhood is. 'I absolutely support you both 100 per cent!' one Instagram user wrote. 'Don't listen to the haters and don't let them discourage you guys! You're wonderful parents! Remember that and look toward the future! My father was a dead beat. I never remember him even touching my hair. 'I wish I had a father like you guys! The bond you both are creating with your daughters will live on in their memories & hearts forever! I salute you both!'","Kordale and Kaleb first hit headlines when they published a picture of themselves doing their daughters' hair on Instagram .

"A 22-year-old man accused of keeping an IED-style explosive device packed with ball bearings under his bed in Sydney's west was today denied bail. Harley Roy Turnbull, 22, was arrested on Wednesday after his mother allegedly found a homemade bomb in his bedroom at their home in Werrington County on Tuesday night. Bomb squad specialists examined the device before detonating it at a nearby football field. Turnbull was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing an explosive for unlawful purpose. On Thursday, Turnbull appeared via audio visual link in Penrith Local Court where he was refused bail after an application by his lawyer, Brad Mallinson. Harley Turnbull, pictured bearded and tattooed, was today denied bail by a magistrate . Explosion: Police detonated the bomb in a field earlier this week after it was discovered under the young man's bed by his mother . Police are pictured clearing a Werrington home after searching the property . Turnbull was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing an explosive for unlawful purpose. In refusing bail, Magistrate Dorelle Pinch took into account previous failures by Turnbull to appear in court, his lengthy criminal record and the serious nature of the offence. ""There are no bail conditions that can mitigate these unacceptable risks and bail is refused,"" Ms Pinch told the court. After the decision, Turnbull, sporting a shaved head and facial tattoos, swore at the magistrate before his audio visual link was turned off. The court heard Turnbull obtained the ""improvised explosive device"", allegedly containing 50 ball bearings, in a bag from a silver car outside his house, took the bag into his bedroom, and later left in the car. The court was told Turnbull's mother later entered the bedroom, opened the bag, and called police. Investigators carried boxes and bags out of the property in Sydney's greater west . Police rescue officers were in attendance at the home in Werrington, located in the city's greater west . Investigation: The 22-year-old man was today denied bail . The court heard that when shown a picture of the homemade bomb in an interview with police after his arrest, Turnbull said the device ""looked cool"" and ""could be a bunger"". In arguing for bail, Mr Mallinson said his client didn't know ""what he was in possession of"" and that there would be ""huge delays"" before the case next came to court because forensic evidence needed to be collected. Police prosecutor Ben Seabury said he held ""grave concerns"" for the community if Turnbull was released, describing the possible injuries sustained if the device had exploded as ""catastrophic"". He said the device had the potential to ""kill or maim"", adding that ""50 ball bearings would have caused major damage"". The matter returns to Parramatta Local Court on February 27.

"Felicity Jones, Rosamund Pike and Keira Knightley are among the British actors to have been nominated for this year's Oscar Awards, along with Eddie Redmayne and Benedict Cumberbatch. It has been one of the most successful years in history for homegrown actors and actresses, with more than a handful being nominated in the top categories for the most prestigious movie awards of them all. Leading the way are Best Actress nominees Felicity  and Rosamund, who will go head-to-head in the hotly-contested category. Scroll down for video . Britain's brightest: Felicity Jones (left) and Rosamund Pike (right)  have both received their first Oscar nominations, and will compete against each other in the Best Actress category .

Expect weeks and weeks of gowns, glamour and glitz as Hollywood goes crazy for little statues and long acceptance speeches. The Golden Globes proved to be a great start to proceedings with stars upping the ante in the style stakes wearing every designer label known to man. Versace, Zac Posen, Erdem, Dolce & Gabbana, Vera Wang, Michael Kors, Christian Dior, Miu Miu, Marchesa and of course Chanel. Keira Knightley had the added issue of dressing her bump for the red carpet but she passed the test with flying colours in this beautiful embroidered maxi from the iconic French fashion house.

It is the first Oscar nominations for both Felicity and Rosamund, who have impressed in their movies The Theory Of Everything and Gone Girl respectively. They'll also be up against Marion Cotillard for Two Days, One Night, Reese Witherspoon for Wild and Julianne Moore for Still Alice. Both of them missed out on the Golden Globe prize to American actress Julianne, who could be a tough one to beat at the Academy Awards ceremony on 22 February. Felicity  she is 'delighted' to be in the first timers Oscar club, along with her fellow nominees Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch and rival Rosamund. A great theory: Felicity impressed with her portrayal of Jane Wilde Hawking in The Theory Of Everything opposite Eddie Redmayne . She joked that Keira Knightley- who has been nominated for Best Supporting Actress - is a 'veteran' because she was nominated for the first time ten years ago. 'It's really exciting to be nominated with this group of British actors,' she gushed, before adding that she spent the morning sitting on her bed in an hotel room. 'I'm sitting in my pyjamas calling family and friends. I've spoken to my mother, my father and my brother,' she revealed. The kind star also revealed to BBC Radio 5 Live that she will be sharing her nomination with Jane Wilde Hawking, the woman she portrayed in the hit film. 'It was such a phenomenal story... [Stephen and Jane] really graciously let us into their lives so it was a very special story to be telling,' she explained. 'I got to know Jane so well that I had such affection for her. I feel like I'm absolutely sharing this nomination with her.' Also up for an Oscar this year is awards season favourite Eddie Redmayne, who has impressed audiences and critics across the world for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. Go on, girl: Rosamund managed to perfect the ultimate thriller anti-heroine in David Fincher's Gone Girl . He's up for Best Actor, and will face-off with his best friend Benedict Cumberbatch, who has earned himself the chance to win an Oscar for The Imitation Game, in which he plays Alan Turing. Although Eddie is the hot favourite to win, especially after taking a Golden Globe on Sunday - his first big prize of the season - he will also go up against the hugely talented Michael Keaton for Birdman, Bradley Cooper for American Sniper and Steve Carrell for Foxcatcher. The humble star was notably stunned upon hearing the news of his Oscar nomination. He gashed his leg as he leapt naked from his hotel bed to answer door from his very excited manager who woke him up to tell him of his coup on Thursday morning. 'I was trying to grab a towel to protect my modesty,' he joked. Friendly rivalry? Best friends Benedict Cumberbatch (left) and Eddie Redmayne (right) are to go against each other for Best Actor . 'I have to say though that I feel pretty damn good,' Redmayne added to The Mail. He said that he had been in a deep sleep when he heard a noise: 'It was someone banging on the door and screaming. My manager was brandishing a phone and at the end of that phone someone was telling me I had been nominated. I went from sleepy eyed to pretty wide awake very fast.' 'It was like going from nought to a hundred in a racing car,' the actor continued. He thanked his colleagues on the film but had special praise for his leading lady Felicity  who was nominated for best actress. Both The Theory Of Everything and The Imitation Game are also potential winners in the Best Picture category. Great imitation: Benedict portrayed Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, and has received his first Academy Award nomination . Hotly-tipped: Eddie seriously impressed as Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything and has already won the Golden Globe for Leading Actor . Another major player is Keira Knightley, Benedict's Imitation Game co-star, who has a Best Supporting Actress nod. This is her second ever chance for an Oscar: in 2005 she received a Best Actress nomination for Pride & Prejudice. She'll face Patricia Arquette for Boyhood, Emma Stone for Birdman, Laura Dern for Wild and Oscar veteran Meryl Streep for Into The Woods. Not all British talent was recognised in this year's Oscar nominations, however, with the likes of Timothy Spall missing out on a Best Actor nod, despite wowing in his career-defining role in Mr. Turner. Also missing out at the Oscars is Ralph Fiennes, who is currently in the running for a BAFTA for his role in The Grand Budapest Hotel. On Sunday, he missed out on a Golden Globe to Michael Keaton.

"Twenty-five years ago, Yiscah Smith was a man who ran a Jerusalem educational center for Chabad — a religious group that helps bring unaffiliated Jews closer to their faith. These days, she is doing a different sort of outreach — as a transgender activist and educator who preaches a message of truth and tolerance. The 63-year-old Smith lives an active life in Jerusalem, giving lectures on Judaism, teaching part-time at a local seminary and discussing her book, Forty Years in the Wilderness: My Journey to Authentic Living. Her personal journey stands out, even in a country filled with people with stories of spirituality and self-discovery. Journey: Yiscah Smith was raised as Jeffrey Smith in Long Island, NY, and was married with six children. In 2001, at the age of 50, she started a process culminating in surgery that transitioned her into a woman . 'God wants all of us to be honest. And that's really my message of the book, to give inspiration and strength to help people to move past their own inner demons,' she said in an interview with The Associated Press. Raised as Jeffrey Smith in Long Island, she became religious as an adult, joining Chabad in 1975. She married, had six children with her then-wife, and spent time in Israel and the United States before she said she helped run a Chabad visitor center in Jerusalem's Old City from 1985 to 1991. But all along, she kept a deep secret. Going back to her childhood, she always knew she was a girl. Smith recalled that as a five-year-old boy, she was entranced watching her mother put on make-up. Her mother once suggested she instead watch her father shave 'because you are a boy.' 'It was like, 'I'm a boy? Wait. No. No.' But I didn't say that to her. It was what I felt,' she explained. During her years as a Chabad activist, she said she hated herself. Happier: Yiscah, pictured in 2012, now gives lectures on Judaism, teaching part-time at a local seminary and discussing her book, Forty Years in the Wilderness: My Journey to Authentic Living . 'Yet I so wanted to live a spiritual life. So I was always making deals. I was making deals with God ... ""I will put on the costume, but please work with me. Help me,""' she said. Eventually, she parted ways with the movement, divorced, and in 2001, at the age of 50, started a four-year process culminating with surgery that transitioned her into a woman. She chose the biblical name Yiscah, which she said means to 'behold' and to 'see into the present more deeply.' During the interview in her small Jerusalem apartment, Smith wore lipstick, a purple dress, encrusted glasses, a large blue necklace and a smaller one with a Star of David. She showed old passport pictures of her bearded former self, before her transition. She declined to discuss her relationship with her children and grandchildren. Smith still leads a lifestyle of a devout Orthodox Jew, eating only kosher food, refraining from travel on the Jewish Sabbath and praying at the Western Wall — albeit in the section reserved for women. In the conservative Middle East, Israel is famously tolerant of gays and transgenders. Gays have openly served in Israel's military and parliament. The Supreme Court grants a variety of family rights to gay couples, and gays, lesbians and a transsexual are among the country's most popular musicians and actors. Last year, the country opened a memorial to gays who died in the Nazi Holocaust. The challenges of living a transgender life have gained awareness through the popularity of Amazon Prime's series Transparent. The show, which focuses on a man in the process of transitioning to a woman who comes out to his adult children, won two Golden Globes earlier this month. Despite this tolerance, the conservative world of Orthodox Judaism is not always so accepting, making Smith's openness about her story even more striking. New life: Yiscah (pictured in June 2014, left, and July 2012, right) has no regrets about her sex change . Shmuel Pappenhym, an ultra-Orthodox educator and commentator, said there is no mention in Jewish texts of the issue of gender changes 'because it's a modern thing.' He said that many ultra-Orthodox consider it an 'abomination' and prefer not to think about it because it is difficult for them to fathom. But Rabbi Dalia Marx, an expert of liturgy and biblical literature at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which is affiliated with the liberal Reform movement, said gender stereotypes are not always clear in the Bible. 'The liberal streams (of Judaism) acknowledge the fact that maybe some people are born in the wrong skin, and they have the right and maybe the duty to search for their own identity,' she said. 'Then the Jewish religion and Jewish leaders have to help them find their way into this new reality that they created for themselves.' Chabad did not immediately return a message from the AP seeking comment. Smith said she has no regrets about her decision. 'I couldn't change my soul ... There is no surgery for your soul like a heart transplant,' she said. 'But you can get a different body, and thank God today. One-hundred years ago, I don't know what I would have done.'","Yiscah Smith, now 63, was born Jeffrey and became religious as an adult .

"Since stepping down as foreign secretary, he has lost the use of his grace and favour mansion. But now William Hague has bought his own £2.5million country pad with a striking resemblance to his former official residence, Chevening. The ex-Tory leader and his wife Ffion have purchased the 10-bedroom Welsh property ahead of his retirement from Parliament at the general election. William Hague and his wife Ffion have bought £2.5million Cyfronydd Hall, a 10-bedroom house in Wales . The Hague's new house a striking resemblance to his former official residence, Chevening . The 10-bedroom stately home in Powys, Wales, is set in nearly 13 acres of grounds. It has 10 bathrooms and three reception rooms, along with a 'leisure suite' featuring a heated indoor pool, spa pool and fitness suite. The property, built in 1865, also has a library, cellars, an orangery and six one-bed and two-bed holiday cottages. 'We have had our eyes on Cyfronydd Hall for some time,' Mr Hague told the local County Times newspaper. 'Ffion and I are looking forward to having a home in Wales for the first time and to living in such a beautiful part of the country.' The sprawling property sits in 12 acres of rolling green hills and boasts an indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi for the couple to enjoy in retirement . The Cabinet minister, who has previously penned biographies of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce, said it was 'an ideal place to write books'. Mr Hague already has a £1million apartment in a stately home in his Richmond, North Yorkshire, constituency. He said he and his wife would still keep a home in Yorkshire 'to keep in touch with old friends' but they were looking forward to moving to Mid Wales very soon. Mr Hague sand he and Ffion are 'looking forward to having a home in Wales for the first time' Mr Hague, who is currently First Secretary of State and Leader of the House of Commons, stepped down after five years as foreign secretary in July and announced his intention to retire from politics. The 53-year-old met his wife while he was Welsh Secretary in the 1990s and she worked in his private office. Mrs Hague currently makes television programmes for Welsh-language broadcaster S4C. In his role as foreign secretary, he had access to Chevening, a £15million mansion in Kent. The 115-room property set in 3,500 acres of land had been the official country retreat of the foreign secretary for decades, but Mr Hague had to share it with Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Hague also lived in a grace and favour luxury apartment at One Carlton Garden in London near Pall Mall. Cyfronydd Hall was profiled by Country Life when it went on the market with a guide price of £2.5million in 2013. The magazine said the former girls' school has 'spectacular panoramic views over the rolling countryside of the majestic Banwy valley' from its large sash windows. It continued: 'An intimate study overlooks the rear garden, with its towering beeches, oaks and cedars. 'The first floor houses the splendid master suite and five further bedrooms, which all have luxurious bathrooms. 'Four more bedrooms and bathrooms, each with its own quirky, individual character, are located on the floor above.' The home in Wentworth near Rotherham in south Yorkshire where Mr Hague grew up . Glyn Davies, the Tory MP for Montgomeryshire, said he was 'really pleased' the Hagues had decided to move to his constituency. 'Ffion's father was a Montgomeryshire man so she has family roots here, and William is hugely popular throughout Wales. I believe they will feel very much at home.' He was expected to complete the purchase of Cyfronydd Hall today. William Hague, a former Conservative leader, is thought to have amassed more than £4.8million from public speaking, two books, a newspaper column for the Daily Telegraph and various business advisory roles. His after-dinner circuits provide him with £25,000 a speech. His book contacts - he has previously penned biographies of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce - along with his other assets are valued at £1.5million. He also has a £1million apartment in a stately home in his Richmond, North Yorkshire, constituency. Mr Hague holds various business advisory roles. He is a Patron of the European Youth Parliament UK and Vice President of the Friends of the British Library.","Hagues' new 10-bedroom stately home in Powys set in nearly 13 acres .

"Children as young as five are being taught to massage each other at school in a new initiative designed to help them learn how to relax. The global scheme, which has now spread to the UK, has been introduced in response to fears that pupils are suffering from elevated stress levels. It involves instructors visiting schools and teaching children how to perform massages, before the youngsters are allowed to practice their skills on each other. Massage: Children at Ardingly College in Sussex are being taught how to give each other massages . Programme: The initiative is supposed to reduce pupils' stress levels and help them relax . The Massage In Schools Programme was first launched 15 years ago Mia Elmsäter in Sweden and Sylvie Hétu in Canada. As well as reducing stress, it is intended to help children concentrate at school and sleep better at night. One of the British schools to have introduced the scheme is Ardingly College, a public school for boys and girls aged between two and 18 near Haywards Heath in Sussex. Drama teacher Mary Spink, who is running the programme at the school, said: 'The children really enjoy it and are fully relaxed and calm afterwards.' Friendly: The pupils must ask permission from each other before performing a massage . Teaching: Ardingly runs sessions every two weeks in which pupils take part in the 'Chill-out Club' She said that parents had been supportive of the scheme - which sees pupils ask permission before they perform a massage on anyone else. Eight-year-old pupil Dylan said he practises his massage techniques at home on his parents. He said: 'As a class, it is peaceful, relaxing and calm and everyone is quiet, which we don't really get anywhere else.' The massages are part of a school initiative called the 'Chill-Out Club', which teaches children to relax and to respect each other. Hands: One pupil gives another a hand massage as part of the school's relaxation sessions . They are taught on a fortnightly basis to children aged between five and 13. In the lessons, the children are encouraged to give each other feedback on their massage techniques, and taught 'mindfulness' as well. Organisers of the scheme say that children who are taught how to perform massages often boost their self-esteem and are less likely to bully others.","Swedish/Canadian scheme teaches schoolchildren to perform massages .

"A police investigation into the disappearance and presumed murder of two girls in South Australia 41 years ago has focused on a home owned by the grandfather of an accused paedophile. The abduction of Joanne Ratcliffe, 11, and Kirste Gordon, 4, from Adelaide Oval in South Australia shocked the country and became one of the nation's most infamous murder mysteries. The girls had gone to the toilets together while watching an Australian Rules football game with their parents on the 24th August 1973. They never returned and their bodies were never found despite a nation-wide search. Police have chased more than 2000 leads of inquiry since the girls disappeared 41 years ago. Intensive investigations by police recommenced in 2012 after members of the public reported new information to Crime Stoppers. Joanne Ratcliffe,11, (left) and Kirste Gordon, 4, (right) were last seen at Adelaide Oval in 1973 . This week, the focus of the search turned to a farm house in Yatina in South Australia's mid-north, 250km from Adelaide, whose previous owner died in 1999 and was  a suspect in the case before his death. Stanley Arthur Hart was named by his grandson, convicted paedophile Mark Trevor Marshall, in a 2007 confession provided to the Mullighan Inquiry into abuse of children in state care. A letter penned by Marshall, which was sent to the Adelaide Advertiser before being handed over the police, claimed that his grandfather had abducted the girls and that Marshall had been present as a young boy. While police have previously labelled the confession 'fantasy', Hunt's house has been visited several times since 2012 in relation to the girls' disappearance. Detective Inspector Greg Hutchins, who is leading the investigation, said this morning that police 'couldn't rule out that he was involved'. The girls disappeared from the iconic Adelaide oval more than 40 years ago, during an SANFL game which they were attending with their families. Joanne, aged 11, and Kirste, aged 4, went to the bathroom during the game and were never seen again. Since that date, police investigators have followed more than 2000 lines of inquiry, and the South Australian government has offered a million dollar reward for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible for their disappearance and likely murder. Suzie Ratcliffe, who was born a year after her sister Joanne disappeared, made an impassioned plea for information via a social media campaign in 2012. 'While people are talking about the case, there is always hope,' Ms Ratcliffe said. 'It's time Joanne came home. We are over wanting to know who did it, how they did it and why they did it.' 'We want to be able to lay (Joanne) to rest and lay my dad's soul to rest also.' Police detectives have returned to a property in Yatina, in South Australia's mid-north . The detectives have examined two wells on the property, whose previous owner died in 1999 and was a suspect in the disappearance of the two girls . Police are again appealing for anyone with information about the case to come forward. Detective Inspector Greg Hutchins said that the searches are the result of a call to Crime Stoppers and the culmination of information police have gathered over time. 'The previous occupant of the Yatina property is one of a number of people who have been linked to the girls' disappearance over the years, but to date police have been unable to substantiate his involvement,' he said. 'The man has previously been interviewed by Detectives, but died in 1999.' Major Crime Detectives, aided by STAR Group officers and forensic investigators have inspected several sites, including two wells. Forensic Sciences of SA (FSSA), the South Australian Ambulance Service and the State Emergency Service (SES) assisted with the searches. 'Considerable time and resources have been committed to these searches as police have undertaken to never give up the hunt for the girls' remains and their abductor.' Detective Inspector Hutchins said. Police are again appealing for anyone with information about the case to come forward.

In a video shot by his father, Justin, the toddler, from Canton, Ohio, rocks out on an electric drum kit, and shows a genuine talent, surprising in one so young. The youngster starts by lightly tapping the drums. But as soon as the song - Foo Fighters' hit The Pretender - reaches full pelt, he lets rip, bashing the drum kit with all his mite. 'Jaxon has been playing drums since he was 18 months old,' says his proud father. 'We have a nabi that the kids play games and watch youtube videos on, and he started watching videos I posted of drummers like Luke Holland, Cobus, and Chris Adler. 'Now, anything that looks like a drum stick IS a drum stick.' Jaxon, two, and his father, Justin, share a love of rock music, which led to the toddler's love for drumming . In action: The toddler has even perfected the head-nodding action of a rock drummer . During the video, the younger can be seen enthusiastically nodding his head to the beat and even yells along to the lyrics of the well-known rock anthem. 'I see him playing drums everyday so its nothing special to me, but I took a video just too show everyone how he could keep a beat,' said Mr Brown.","Jaxon Brown, from Canton, Ohio, loves to rock out on his dad's drum kit .

"Uber driver Adnan Nafasat has been charged with kidnap and sexual assault in Chicago . A driver for the ride-sharing service Uber has been charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting a male passenger in Chicago. Cook County prosecutors said that 46-year-old Adnan Nafasat, a married father-of-three from suburban Villa Park, overpowered and choked a 21-year-old passenger during a July 31 attack. Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Cooper said at a bond hearing on Wednesday that Nafasat refused the man's pleas to take him home. According to the Sun-Times, Nafasat had managed to get the young man to sit in the front of the car by telling him that the back seat was dirty and broken after picking him up in the early hours in the Boystown area. The 46-year-old allegedly groped and choked his passenger to the point of unconsciousness before driving to a neighborhood he did not know. He then allegedly became violent, kissing the man, exposing himself and trying to force him into a sex act. The attack only stopped when the victim begged the driver to take him home. The driver's attorney, Carey Crimmins, said in court that Nafasat owns a business and drives to supplement his income. Nafasat was ordered held in lieu of $150,000 bail. Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin says the company has removed Nafasat from its platform and is assisting investigators. It was the second time in two weeks that a driver was charged with sexually assaulting an Uber passenger in Chicago. Maxime Fohounhedo was not authorized to drive for the ride-sharing company and used an account created in his wife's name to pick up customers, the company last month. San Francisco-based Uber has come under scrutiny over its driver screening process, including from prosecutors in California who filed a lawsuit in December accusing Uber of exaggerating how comprehensive its background checks are. Uber said Fohounhedo was driving under an account created in his wife's name in violation of Uber's rules prohibiting account sharing. Prosecutors said he used his own photo and phone number on the account. Uber driver Maxime Fohounhedo was also charged with sexually assaulting a female passenger in Chicago in the last month . Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin couldn't immediately explain how that discrepancy could have been missed during the application process or despite what she said were Uber's 'regular re-checks' of driver photos. 'We do our best to send drivers though our background check process, which far exceeds what's expected of taxis,' she said. 'But there is also a responsibility for the rider to make sure that when they get into an Uber that they're checking the license plate and they're checking the driver's face and making sure all that matches up.' In this case, though, such scrutiny by the rider might not have helped because Fohounhedo's own photo would have showed up on the user's smartphone, Mullin acknowledged. The Uber app allows smartphone users to search for rides from regular taxis, limos and private individuals such as Fohounhedo who use their own vehicles in an arrangement known as ride-sharing. Fohounhedo was arrested on December 28 and has been charged with sexual assault in an alleged attack in November. A judge ordered him held Tuesday in lieu of $500,000 bail. The 22-year-old victim told police she was attacked between 3am and 4am after being picked up from a bar. Assistant State's Attorney Robert Mack said the woman was intoxicated and woke up on a couch at the driver's apartment with the man sexually assaulting her. Afterward, he told the victim, 'I made you happy,' Mack said. Public defender Sandra Bennewitz told reporters Fohounhedo 'has evidence that will support his claim that he did not do this and that whatever happened was consensual'. Fohounhedo would not have been eligible to drive for Uber in Chicago, where regulations require ride-share applicants to have held a license for at least a year. Fohounhedo has only held a temporary Illinois visitor driver's license since August, according to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. His wife, however, has had a regular Illinois license since 2009. Uber says its background checks screen would-be drivers against county, federal and multi-state records going back seven years. It also cites records showing several hundred physical violence complaints against traditional taxi drivers in recent years in Chicago.","Adnan Nafasat, 46, a married father-of-three, 'overpowered and choked a 21-year-old passenger during a July 31 attack'

"Nasa is one step closer to launching the spacecraft which could one day take humans to Mars. Workers at Kennedy Space Center gathered to watch as the Orion capsule emerged from its assembly hangar, less than three months from its first test flight. It came as a second capsule was completing drop tests off the California coast. Scroll down for video . NASA's Orion spacecraft  departs the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building on its way to the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center. Orion is scheduled for a test flight in early December. U.S. Navy divers adjust a tow line on a test version of the capsule as it is towed towards the USS Anchorage during a recovery drill off the coast of California . During its Dec. 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. The entire mission will last 4½ hours. At Kennedy, the capsule — sealed for protection — slowly made its way to its fueling depot atop a 36-wheel platform. The capsule and its attached service module and adapter ring stretched 40 feet high. 'Isn't this awesome?' said Kennedy's director, Robert Cabana, a former space shuttle commander. 'This is our step to the future, the exploration of establishing a presence in the solar system.' Space center employees lined up along the rope barricade to snap pictures of Orion, Nasa's lofty follow-on to the now-retired space shuttle program. During its Dec. 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space and take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. The entire mission will last 4½ hours. The second Orion flight won't occur until around 2018 when another unmanned capsule soars atop NASA's new megarocket, still under development, called SLS for Space Launch System. NASA intends to put astronauts aboard Orion in 2021 for deep space exploration; each capsule can accommodate up to four. The plan is to use Orion for getting humans to asteroids and Mars — no space station ferry trips for Orion. While Orion may resemble an oversize Apollo capsule on the outside, everything inside and out is modern and top-of-the-line, officials noted Thursday. 'I'm as excited as can be,' said Nasa's Orion production operations manager, Scott Wilson. The SLS rocket that will blast the capsule into orbit will be the largest ever built . For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. A Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting. It will eventually be launced by Nasa's new Space Launch System 'megarocket'. For its first flight test, SLS will be configured for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit. In its most powerful configuration, SLS will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons), which will enable missions even farther into our solar system, including such destinations as an asteroid and Mars. NASA's Orion spacecraft, preparing for it's first flight, arrives at the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center . When asked by a reporter, Cabana said he wishes Orion's flight pace was quicker. 'But it is what it is,' he said. 'Given the budget that we have, I think we've got the best program that you could imagine.' Orion has its roots in the post-Columbia shuttle era; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the Constellation moon project.

"Architects have revealed designs for a 190,000-home town that would be built if Heathrow Airport closes. Three architectural firms have been commissioned by Transport for London to come up with proposals for 'Heathrow City', which include new park land, a scientific research centre and a factory for self-made property to make it easier for people to build their own homes. One of the three designs could be put in place if Heathrow is replaced by a new Thames Estuary airport, a plan supported by London Mayor Boris Johnson that is currently under consideration by the Whitehall-appointed Airports Commission. Architects have come up with plans for 'Heathrow City' which could be built if the airport is replaced by a Thames Estuary airport. In these design, created by Rick Mather Architects, 190,000 homes would be spread among ten centres, connected by the former runways . According to supporters, the redevelopment of the airport could create 90,000 new jobs and add £7.5 billion to the UK economy. In designs created by Rick Mather . Architects, the Heathrow site would evolve to become a city of ten districts, connected by the existing runways and airport buildings. Under that plan, developers . would also create a research, technology and manufacturing hub, . while homes would be made up individual houses, . terraces, mansion blocks and communal squares. In a second set of plans created by firm Hawkins\Brown, there would be a 'self-build' factory-for-homes plan. It would mean Londoners could go online to order homes to their own specifications, something which is already common in several European countries. In a final plan submitted by Maccreanor . Lavington, Heathrow City would be developed also using existing buildings. In plans by firm Hawkins Brown, which were commissioned by Transport for London, the city would include a factory to allow people to build their own homes, something which is already common in several European countries .

A technology campus would be built on the east side of the site while the former Terminal 2 building would be . renovated to become a civic centre and retail hub that would form the . heart of the new community. New housing would be made up of self-build homes, community-led development, temporary housing, a development corporation and houses created by developers. As the plans were released, Mr Johnson said: 'The demand for new . homes and jobs in the capital is such that we must be ready to start . redeveloping Heathrow the moment it moves to its new site. And the . sooner we start planning the better. The Whitehall-appointed Airports Commission is considering plans for the . Thames Estuary airport, which would lead to the closure of Heathrow . airport, west London, pictured . 'We asked our architects to be as creative as possible and these designs illustrate strikingly different visions of a Heathrow of the future.' He went on: 'However the key point is that all these scenarios would potentially create some of the many thousands of new jobs and homes this city will require given London is expected to increase in size by a fifth within the next 15 years. 'How we deal with that is something we need to be planning for and debating right now. Those discussions must not be delayed.' Recent reports being prepared for the Airports Commission have cast doubt on the feasibility of the Thames Estuary airport plan, which has been dubbed 'Boris Island'. The commission is due to make a decision this autumn on whether the estuary plan joins Heathrow and Gatwick runway schemes on the commission's shortlist. A final decision on just where runway capacity should be increased will be made by the commission in summer 2015.","Designs include park land, a scientific research centre and self-build homes .

"Miguel Cotto became the first Puerto Rican fighter to win world championships in four weight divisions, stopping Sergio Martinez in their WBC world middleweight title fight on Saturday. 'It was a reflection of my hard work (for) 10, 11 weeks,' Cotto said. Martinez didn't get off the stool when the bell rang for the 10th round. He did not speak to the media after the fight, as he was taken to a hospital as a precaution. Victory: Miguel Cotto dons his WBC middleweight title belt after defeating Sergio Martinez on Saturday night . 'Miguel beat him from pillar to post,' said Martinez's promoter, Lou DiBella. 'Miguel Cotto is a great champion.' Cotto improved to 39-4. Martinez fell to 51-3-2. In the week leading up to the fight, Cotto's trainer Freddie Roach said his pupil would be able to use his footwork to control the fight, and still possessed power even though he moved up in weight class. Cotto proved Roach right from the opening bell, knocking down Martinez twice in the first round with a flurry of body shots. As the fight progressed, Cotto pressured Martinez around the ring, and attacked when openings were presented. Cotto won every round, including a 10-6 first. 'Miguel fought a really great fight,' Roach said. 'Thank you, Miguel, for making me look so good. Floored: Cotto looks on after hitting Martinez to the ground during the first round . 'He really gave the guy a boxing lesson.' Martinez forced Cotto to fight in the middle of the ring instead of on the ropes or in the corners. But Cotto was able to land a variety of jabs and hooks. By the end of the eighth round, Martinez had swelling around his right eye. He also had a cut on his forehead due to a head-butt. Cotto landed 54 percent of his punches, and 54 percent of his power punches. By comparison, Martinez connected on 31 percent of his punches, and landed 60 of 157 power punches.

"Michelle Obama on Saturday criticized the kidnapping of scores of Nigerian schoolgirls as an 'unconscionable act' carried out by a terrorist group she said is determined to keep them from getting an education - 'or grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls.' Taking over the president's weekly radio and Internet address on the eve of the American holiday for honoring mothers, the first lady said that, like millions of people around the world, she and President Barack Obama are 'outraged and heartbroken' over the April 15 abduction of the girls from their dormitory. 'In these girls, Barack and I see our own daughters,' Mrs. Obama said, referring to Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12. 'We see their hopes, their dreams and we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now.' Scroll down for video . Symbolism: Mrs. Obama will vent her outrage at the Nigerian kidnappings during the president's radio address on Saturday . Global protests: Demonstrators yelled Friday in London, showing a play on words that reverses the meaning of Boko Haram -- 'Western education is permitted; Terror is sinful,' it reads . What happened in Nigeria is not an isolated incident, the first lady said, but is 'a story we see every day as girls around the world risk their lives to pursue their ambitions.' Mrs. Obama mentioned the case of Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who survived being shot in the head as she traveled to school in 2012. Malala has become an outspoken advocate for the rights of all girls to get an education, the same message Mrs. Obama delivered in her first solo address to the nation. Mrs. Obama noted that more than 65 million girls worldwide do not attend school even though educated women earn more money and have healthier families. 'When more girls attend secondary school, that boosts their country's entire economy,' she said. 'So education is truly a girl's best chance for a bright future, not just for herself, but for her family and her nation.' Mrs. Obama recently launched a domestic initiative called ""Reach Higher"" to encourage young people to pursue education beyond high school, whether they enroll in a professional training program or attend a community college or a four-year institution. In Saturday's address, the first lady asked the nation to pray for the Nigerian girls' safe return. 'This unconscionable act was committed by a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education - grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls,' she said. 'Let us hold their families in our hearts during this very difficult time, and let us show just a fraction of their courage in fighting to give every girl on this planet the education that is her birthright.' The first lady will make her first solo radio address, an unusual move that presidents have made before: Laura Bush talked about the treatment of women in Afghanistan during one 2001 address . The . Nigerian government's inability to rescue the girls nearly a month after . they were abducted by the Boko Haram organization has sparked worldwide . outrage, including protests and a social media campaign. The U.S. and . other countries have sent teams of technical experts to assist the . Nigerian government's search effort. Authorities . have said more than 300 girls were abducted from their school in the . country's remote northeast. Fifty-three escaped and 276 remain captive. President Obama said this week that the U.S. will do everything to help Nigeria find them. Boko . Haram means 'Western education is sinful.' The group's leader, Abubakar . Shekau, has claimed responsibility for the abduction and has threatened . to sell the girls. President . Barack Obama made the rare move of giving his wife the responsibility . of delivering the White House's weekly radio address on Saturday. The . move is an unusual one but not unprecedented: Laura Bush gave a similar . address in 2001 when she was first lady, denouncing the treatment of . women in Afghanistan. Mrs. Obama has also joined the president in a few radio addresses, but . Saturday marked her first solo appearance. Conservative radio talkers Rush Limbaugh (L) and John Gibson (R) said hashtag activism will be ineffective and show the world that the U.S. is powerless to intervene in Nigeria . Bringing it home: Nigerians protested in Washington, D.C. on Friday, denouncing the terror group for kidnapping hundreds of young girls in order to prevent them from receiving a Western education . In a photo seen around the world, the first lady posed Thursday with a hand-written sign reading #BringBackOurGirls. 'Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families,' she wrote in a message that accompanied the picture. The . president said Wednesday night at a Los Angeles fundraiser for . Democratic candidates that he was anguished over 'the murders and . kidnappings in Nigeria.' 'Every . day when I wake up, and I think about young girls in Nigeria or . children caught up in the conflict in Syria . . . there are times in . which I want to reach out and save those kids,' he told an audience of . donors who paid tens of thousands of dollars to her him and late-night . comic Conan O'Brien speak. The . leader of Boko Haram has threatened to sell the kidnapped girls into . slavery, and is reportedly holding them prisoner in a giant Nigerian . forest the size of West Virginia. Nigerian . military forces have refused to enter what locals call the 'evil . forest' because of the high levels of terrorist activity there. Not everyone has heaped praise on the first lady's push on Twitter to raise awareness about the girls. 'I would love to see the girls freed. I would love to see Boko Haram wiped out,' Fox News Radio's John Gibson said Friday. 'But for the life of me I cannot figure out how hashtagging helps,' he added.' Except. To. Make. The. Hashtagger. Feel. Good. About. Himself.' And conservative radio flamethrower Rush Limbaugh said Thursday that a Twitter campaign shows that the U.S. is too impotent to intervene. 'It's unbelievable ... what message does this send?' he asked on his daily broadcast. 'Is the United States really this powerless? And then if you answer yes, we are really this powerless, then isn't Obama to blame?'","Michelle Obama took over the president's weekly radio address .

"A drug that may reverse autism is to be tested on children with the condition for the first time, scientists have revealed. Preliminary results show that the drug called suramin, which is already used to treat sleeping sickness in Africa, corrects autism-like symptoms in mice. At the molecular level, it normalises faulty brain connections, cell-to-cell signalling, and metabolic effects thought to underlie the disorder. Groundbreaking: Testing of the drug suramin on mice in America has found it can help to correct autism-like symptoms (stock image) The drug targets a cell messaging system that produces a metabolic response to stress. According to a new theory, autism is strongly linked to this pathway, known as purinergic signalling. Scientists in the U.S. found that the drug corrected 17 types of abnormality linked to autism in genetically modified mice, including social behaviour problems. Autism is a wide ranging condition, mostly seen in boys, that affects a person's ability to socialise and communicate and can have a devastating lifelong impact. Around 600,000 children and adults in the UK are thought to have the disorder. Professor Robert Naviaux, co-director of the Mitochondrial and Metabolic Disease Centre at the University of California in San Diego, said: 'Our theory suggests that autism happens because cells get stuck in a defensive metabolic mode and fail to talk to each other normally, which can interfere with brain development and function. 'We used a class of drugs that has been around for almost a century to treat other diseases to block the 'danger' signal in a mouse model, allowing cells to return to normal metabolism and restore cell communication.' New hope: A small clinical trial on children could be carried out within the year at the Mitochondrial and Metabolic Disease Centre at the University of California in San Diego, pictured . He added: 'Of course, correcting abnormalities in a mouse is a long way from a cure for humans. But we are encouraged enough to test this approach in a small clinical trial of children with autism spectrum disorder in the coming year. 'This trial is still in the early stages of development. We think this approach, called antipurinergic therapy or APT, offers a fresh and exciting new path that could lead to development of a new class of drugs to treat autism.' The findings are published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE. Professor Naviaux and his team believe both genetic and environmental causes of autism can be traced to a sustained cell danger response linked to immunity and inflammation. 'When cells are exposed to classical forms of dangers such as a virus, infection or toxic environmental substance, a defence mechanism is activated,' said the professor. 'This results in changes to metabolism and gene expression (activity) and reduces the communication between neighbouring cells. Simply put, when cells stop talking to each other, children stop talking.' Suramin is an inhibitor of purinergic signalling that has been used to treat African sleeping sickness since shortly after it was first synthesised in 1916. The 'striking effectiveness' of the drug in mice could pave the way to a 'completely new class of anti-inflammatory drugs to treat autism and other disorders', said Professor Naviaux.","Drug called suramin is already used to treat sleeping sickness in Africa .

"Professor Lennart Bengtsson, 79, a leading climate scientist, received emails from around the world condemning his decision to move to a sceptical think-tank . A globally-renowned climate scientist has been forced to step down from a think-tank after he was subjected to 'Mc-Carthy'-style pressure from scientists around the world. Professor Lennart Bengtsson, 79, a leading academic from the University of Reading, left the high-profile Global Warming Policy Foundation as a result of the threats, which he described as 'virtually unbearable'. The group was set up by former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson and are sceptical about radical policy changes aimed at combating global warming. The Swedish climatologist, who has published more than 200 papers, said he received hundreds of emails from colleagues criticising his decision to switch to the organisation. His 'defection' was described as the biggest switch from the pro-climate change lobby to the sceptic camp to date. He was also abused on science blogs, with one describing the people who condemned him as 'respectable' and that his actions amounted to 'silliness'. Another described him as a 'crybaby'. However, the main pressure came from the US, where a government employee refused to be a co-author on a paper because of his links to the controversial group. Prof Bengtsson, who had only been in the position for three weeks, told Mail Online: 'There were quite a lot of people who were upset when I joined GWPF. 'I received emails from colleagues all over the world telling me it was a ""questionable"" group. 'But what made me the most upset was when a colleague from the US resigned as co-author of a paper, simply because I was involved. 'I thought joining the organisation would provide a platform for me to bring more common sense into the global climate change debate. 'I have been very concerned about tensions in the climate change community between activists and people who have questions. 'It has led to a bad atmosphere and a declining level in the quality of science has decreased. He believes one of the reasons for this is the US Government's expanding role on climate change. 'The public are concerned that recent weather phenomenon have been as a result of climate change. But it is a natural occurrence,' he said. 'Some people like my views, other people don't, that is the way when it comes to science.' The Global Warming Policy Foundation was set up by former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson and is regarded as being part of the 'sceptic camp' when it comes to climate change . In his resignation letter, published on the think-tank's website, he wrote: 'If this is going to continue I will be unable to conduct my normal work and will even start to worry about my health and safety. 'I see therefore no other way out therefore than resigning from GWPF. I had not expecting such an enormous world-wide pressure put at me from a community that I have been close to all my active life. 'Colleagues are withdrawing their support, other colleagues are withdrawing from joint authorship etc. 'I see no limit and end to what will happen. It is a situation that reminds me about the time of McCarthy. Lord Lawson, the former Tory Chancellor condemned the behaviour as 'appalling' and said the reference to 'McCarthyism' was 'fully warranted'. Professor Bengtsson currently works for the Meteorology department at the University of Reading . In a letter to Prof Bengtsson, he wrote: 'I fully understand your reason; but it is an appalling state of affairs and your reference to McCarthyism is fully warranted.' According to the council's chairman, Professor Henderson it was the 'climate science community in the US' which reacted negatively to the appointment. The Global Warming Policy Foundation has been critical of policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change. A report published by the group earlier this year, by Andrew Montford and John Shade, described the teaching of climate science in British schools as ‘disturbing’. Dr Benny Peiser, the director of GWPF told Mail Online: There has been a complete outpouring of disbelief and anger about this development. 'It's clearly a growing concern among interested observers how the intolerance within the climate science community is undermining what scientists are saying. 'This is a major scandal and will backfire if the science community don't come out in support of him.' The Global Warming Policy Foundation was started by Lord Lawson and Dr Benny Peiser  in the House of Lords in November 2009. It was launched with the Copenhagen Climate Conference in mind to create a new dialogue on climatology. The think-tank describe themselves as 'open-minded on the contested science of global warming', but say they are 'deeply concerned' with how policies put in place by governments may impact wider society. In a joint interview with Ed Miliband in 2009, when the Labour leader was energy secretary, Lord Lawson said there had been ‘no further warming’ since the late 20th Century and dissent should be tolerated. Miliband said Lord Lawson was ‘spreading doubt’ despite a scientific consensus. The GWPF is funded by voluntary donations from a number of private individuals and charitable trusts. They do not accept gifts from either energy companies or anyone with a significant interest in the energy industry.","Professor Lennart Bengtsson received intense pressure 'all over the world'

"Tour de France champion Chris Froome has become the first person ever to cycle under the sea from England to France. The cycling star, 29, pedalled 32 miles from Folkestone to Calais in the Eurotunnel. It is the first time in history anyone has cycled through the tunnel, with Froome completing the task in 55 minutes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Incredible: Chris Froome has become the first person to scale the length of the Eurotunnel on a bicycle. The Tour de France champion did it in 55 minutes . He was cycling at 'training pace', which still saw the super-fit sports star reaching speeds of 40mph. A train, in comparison, takes 35 minutes to carry out the trip and hits 100mph as it travels 150ft beneath the English channel. Froome, who is currently competing in this year’s Tour de France, today described the experience as 'incredible'. He said: 'Cycling under the sea was an incredible experience. On your marks: He started at the industrial yellow iron gate in Folkestone, England, which leads all the way to Calais under the sea . Eerie: In a video released of the cycle ride last month, the 29-year-old is seen pacing through the concrete walls lit by harsh white lights . Speed: It takes a train 35 minutes to make the journey, driving at 100mph. Froome, who took the yellow jersey last year, achieved it in 55 minutes at 40mph . 'Opportunities to become the first . person in the world to achieve these kind of feats are extremely rare . nowadays, especially as a pro-cyclist. 'To . become the first person ever to cycle through the Eurotunnel was right . up there with some of the most iconic rides I’ve ever done - this must . have been one of very few ‘world first’ rides left.' The service tunnel which Froome cycled through is one of the highest security sites in the UK and France. Training: In the run up to this year's Tour de France, which started in Yorkshire, Froome was 'only cycling at training pace' Race is on: A Jaguar boarded the train decked with Team Sky's bikes to meet him at the other end. They were only waiting 20 minutes for him to arrive . Chilled: As Team Sky greeted the champion cyclist, he looked relaxed, gliding out the 'shuttle' with a smile on his face and an arm in the air . It was organised last month by Jaguar, which provides Team Sky, who Froome cycles for, with a fleet of XF Sportbrakes. Jaguar will be releasing a film, 'Team Sky - Cycling Under The Sea', to celebrate the event. John Keefe, head of public affairs at Eurotunnel, added: 'The Eurotunnel is an incredible, unique piece of engineering on par with the Golden Gate Bridge or Sydney Opera House. 'The problem of course, is that no one gets to see it, so we were delighted when Jaguar Land Rover came to us with this ground-breaking request'.","Chris Froome cycled the 32-mile route in 55 minutes at 40mph, it takes a train 35 minutes travelling at 100mph .

"After weeks of speculation, Sir Elton John and David Furnish have finally revealed how their son Zachary was conceived. While the pair had previously remained silent on which of them was the biological father, Furnish has now confirmed that he and Elton 'both contributed' to the conception of Zachary, who was born to a surrogate mother on Christmas Day last year. As the pair undertook a surrogacy program in America, the mixing of their semen specimens was allowed - a process which is currently banned in the UK - before being used to fertilise a previously chosen egg. Proud parents: Sir Elton John and David Furnish have spoken of their love for new baby son Zachary in US Weekly magazine . When asked which of them is Zachary's biological father, Furnish explained: 'We both . contributed. For the time being we don't have a clue. We look at him . every day and at the moment he has Elton's nose and my hands. 'Neither of us care. He's our child. The important thing is that he's healthy and happy and loved.' On . Zachary's birth certificate, Elton was registered as the boy's father . while Furnish was named under the mother category in computer documents. Initially - normally on computer documentation - a ‘father’ and ‘mother’ are listed. However, . in ‘gay dad’ surrogacy cases, when the actual certificate is produced, . the couple can apply to have it re-issued as Parent 1 and Parent 2. During their interview and photoshoot in OK! magazine, both Elton and Furnish beam with happiness as they introduce little Zachary Jackson . Levon Furnish-John to the world. Happy and content: The pair looked excited about the new addition to their family as they went for lunch in Los Angeles last week . The 63-year-old singer and 48-year-old Furnish are seen beaming as . they hold Zachary, dressed in a white top and denim dungarees, on the . cover of OK! publication. And Elton has revealed he is thoroughly enjoying fatherhood, and can't wait to 'lavish his love' on his new son. He said: 'There just aren't proper words to describe that feeling. It's indescribable. It was just...We have a son.' 'I'm . ready to have a child and lavish my love on our son and not spoil him . but be there for him and advise him. 'We don't want to spoil him . materially, although he's already been spoiled rotten by people buying . him stuff! We just want to give him some wisdom.' Elton also said he and Furnish are both determined to be as 'hands on' as possible with Zachary. He added: 'I feed him. David feeds him. We change his nappies. I mean, it's hands on! We are on nappy patrol.' Elton and Furnish revealed in the accompanying interview in OK! magazine that they were present for the Zachary's birth. Recalling the happy day, Elton said: 'Suddenly, at 2.15am on . Christmas Day, we were woken up. They said, ""Quickly! The baby's . coming!' We went in and stood behind the bed. Then the top of the head . came out and David said, ""My God, there's the head!"" 'Then he shot . out like a rocket basically - so much so that the obstetrician sort of . caught him! It was so dramatic and exciting, we didn't have time to get . emotional. Like there he was, talk about fast!' Furnish also said the couple haven't ruled out having more children in the future, adding: 'This is a big change in our life. We have to see how we cope and adapt with one child before we even consider a second.' The Rocket Man singer added that while the couple now have their own son, they will never give up on  Ukrainian orphans Lev, two, and his . brother Artyom, four, who they met when they visited an orphanage in 2009. While their plans to adopt the children were thwarted by the country not recognising same sex marriages, Elton insists he will continue providing emotional and financial support for Lev and Artyom. Elton and Furnish are donating all fees received from the interview and pictures of Zachary to charity.",They contributed equally to 'mixing process' banned in Britain .
"Most foods come with use-by dates, but the majority of the time this is simply a guide, making it difficult to know when food is safe to eat. This is a particular problem with poultry and other meats, but could soon be a thing of the past. Scientists have developed a gadget that 'sniffs' meat to test its freshness, and warns you if its gone off, or needs to be put back in the fridge. Scroll down for video . The PERES device, pictured, works by scanning the air around meat for volatile compounds and gases released by rotting meat. The device takes a reading of the air and sends it a phone or tablet app via Bluetooth . To take a reading, open the app and press the Get button on the top of the PERES device. The device is fitted with gas, temperature and humidity sensors. It works by taking a sample of the air around the meat and scans for potentially volatile compounds that rotting meat produces. PERES works with pork, poultry, beef and fish. This data is transmitted from PERES to the app via Bluetooth and the results can be shared to Facebook, Twitter and Google+. It can detect whether the product is fresh, whether it may have been left unrefrigerated, and warn if there is a risk of food poisoning. It will track changes in freshness to give users an idea how long the food will last, and sends these readings to a smartphone app. To take a reading, users open the app and press the 'Get' button on the top of the device. The PERES is fitted with gas, temperature and humidity sensors that take a sample of the air around the meat. It scans this sample for potentially volatile compounds that rotting meat produce, and the device works with pork, poultry, beef and fish. User then get a reading on the app, and the device can detect whether the product is fresh, if it may have been left unrefrigerated, and will warn them if there is a risk of food poisoning. This data is transmitted from PERES to the app via Bluetooth and the results can be shared to Facebook, Twitter and Google+ - if you particularly like discussing mouldy food with your friends. PERES . was developed by Lithuania-based ARS Lab with scientists from the . Kaunas University of Technology. The prototype took a year to develop. ARS Lab‘s CEO Augustas Alesiunas said the idea for the device came about after he suffered from a serious bout of food poisoning. The app, pictured, detects whether the product is fresh, if it may have been left unrefrigerated, and warns users if there is a risk of food poisoning. PERES works with pork, poultry, beef and fish. The readings can be shared to Facebook, Twitter and Google+ - if you really want to discuss mouldy food with your friends . The device will retail for $150 (£90) with free shipping to the U.S and Europe. Shipping to the rest of the world will cost an extra $15 (£9). Final samples are expected to be shipped by November this year and the device will be sold in black, blue, green, pink, white, pictured . The PERES device, pictured top, is fitted with gas, temperature and humidity sensors, pictured bottom . ‘We had prepared and eaten food in our home just like any other day, but when my family and I all suffered food poisoning we realised there must have been something wrong with the food that hadn’t been obvious at the time.' The World Health Organisation claims more . than 200 diseases are spread through food, and more than 5,000 deaths . in the U.S last year were linked to food borne illnesses. ‘That was when I first envisioned a tool that could check whether the food I was preparing was as fresh as it seemed, so I could be sure I was making healthy meals for my family,' continued Alesiunas. Alesiunas has now set up an Indiegogo campaign to raise money to further develop the device and fund its production. He is looking to raise $100,000 (£60,000) and his current total stands at $14,890 (£8,980). The campaign ends on May 11. If it achieves funding, Alesiunas said the device will retail for $150 (£90) with free shipping to the U.S and Europe. Shipping to the rest of the world will cost an extra $15 (£9).

"Russia has said it is outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine and blamed a far-right paramilitary movement for 'conniving' with the new government in Kiev. In . its latest salvo in a propaganda war over Ukraine, in which the U.S. has issued a list of what it calls 10 false claims by President Vladimir . Putin, Russia accused the West of being silent over violence and . detentions taking place there against Russian compatriots. The foreign ministry said in a statement masked men from the Right Sector had opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the eastern city of Kharkiv on March 8, wounding some. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrive at the White House on Sunday following a trip to Florida. On Wednesday the President will hold discussions with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk about how to peacefully resolve Russia's military intervention in Crimea . Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will travel to get support from the U.S. concerning his country's growing conflict . It . also said seven Russian journalists had been detained in the eastern . city of Dnipropetrovsk, suggesting the new leaders and their Western . allies were not committed to media freedoms. 'The . shamefaced silence of our Western partners, human rights organisations . and foreign media is surprising. It raises the question - where is the . notorious objectivity and commitment to democracy?' it said. Kharkiv . police are treating the Kharkiv incident as a minor one and say the . only link to Right Sector came from an anonymous phone caller. Ukraine's . government and Western leaders have accused Russian officials and media . of distorting the facts to portray the protesters who ended . Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich's rule as violent extremists. Witnesses . in eastern Ukraine say tensions have been stoked by pro-Russian . activists stirring violence to provide Putin with a justification for . invading Ukraine to protect Russians there. An . official who monitors media freedom for The Organisation for Security . and Cooperation in Europe said after visiting Crimea last week that her . more pressing concern was about media freedoms in the southern Ukrainian . region. Armed men, believed to be Russian servicemen, march outside an Ukrainian military base in the village of Perevalnoye near the Crimean city of Simferopol . Unmarked soldiers, believed to be Russian, stand guard near the Crimean city of Simferopol . Obama held two lengthy phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past week. Putin told Obama that ethnic Russians in Crimea needed protection from attacks by Ukrainian nationalists. The government in Kiev, he said, was illegal, and Russia¿s actions to defend them were completely legitimate . Crimea's pro-Russian prime minister will give people living there the choice of taking Russian or Ukrainian passports if the Ukrainian territory becomes part of Russia in a March 16 referendum, it was reported today . Sergei Aksyonov, who declared himself provincial leader almost two weeks ago after Russians seized the parliament building, told the Russian news agency that Crimea would also encourage the use of two languages - Russian and Crimean Tatar. Crimea's two million population, the focus of an increasingly bitter struggle for influence in Ukraine between East and West, has a narrow ethnic Russian majority but also includes more than 250,000 indigenous Tatars, who have returned since the 1980s after being deported by Stalin. They oppose Russian annexation. 'We will not insist on the necessity of returning Ukrainian passports,' Aksyonov said. 'Everyone will have the opportunity to develop their own language. We do not want to limit the Crimean Tatars.' She said . pro-Russian authorities who have seized power in Crimea were clamping . down on media that did not support them and were intimidating reporters. Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama began a new week of diplomatic consultations on the Ukraine crisis with a phone call to Chinese President Xi Jinping that focused on a peaceful solution to Russia's military intervention. Obama, who is to meet Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk at the White House on Wednesday, is seeking ways to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to loosen Russia's grip on the Crimea region of southern Ukraine. Mr Yatseniuk will address the United Nations Security Council about the situation in Crimea on Thursday. He was also quoted as saying he believed Russia, whose forces are in control of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, sought to 'undermine the foundations of global security and revise the outcome of World War Two.' Obama spoke to Xi on Sunday night. China is a key ally of Russia and has heightened tensions with Japan by declaring an air defense zone over remote islands claimed by both countries in the East China Sea. A White House statement released on Monday gave little detail as to what was discussed between Obama and Xi, saying the two leaders agreed on the 'importance of upholding principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, both in the context of Ukraine and also for the broader functioning of the international system.' 'The president noted his overriding objective of restoring Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensuring the Ukrainian people are able to determine their own future without foreign interference,' the White House said. Obama engaged in various diplomatic conversations over the weekend in the search for a solution to the crisis. Last week Crimea's pro-Moscow parliament voted to stage a March 16 referendum to determine whether the region should be annexed by Russia. The White House on Sunday said more international pressure on Russia would result if the Crimea vote proceeded. 'If there is an annexation of Crimea, a referendum that moves Crimea from Ukraine to Russia, we won't recognize it, nor will most of the world,' deputy White House national security adviser Tony Blinken told CNN. Supporters of Ukraine yell at pro- Russian protesters during a rally in Simferopol, capital of Crimea . As the standoff between the Russian military and Ukrainian forces continues in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, world leaders are pushing for a diplomatic solution to the escalating situation . Participants hold placards and shout slogans during an anti-war rally in the Crimean village of Eskisaray, outside Simferopol . Vice . President Joe Biden cut short his trip to Latin America, nixing a . planned stop in the Dominican Republic so he can attend Wednesday's . meeting, an aide to Biden said. Biden . had been the White House's prime point of contact with Ukraine's . president, Viktor Yanukovich, before he fled to Russia last month . following violent clashes in Kiev. Obama's . White House meeting with Yatsenyuk will focus on options to peacefully . resolve Russia's military intervention in the Ukrainian region of . Crimea, the White House said, adding that the resolution must respect . Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. By inviting Yatsenyuk, whose government . Russian President Vladimir Putin alleged took power by way of an . unconstitutional coup, the U.S. is also sending a clear signal to Moscow . that the U.S. considers Yatsenyuk to be Ukraine's legitimate leader — . at least for the time being. 'What . we've seen is the president mobilizing the international community in . support of Ukraine to isolate Russia for its actions in Ukraine, and to . reassure our allies and partners,' said Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy . national security adviser, as he announced the meeting Sunday on NBC's . Meet the Press. The . announcement came as the Kremlin was beefing up its military presence in . Crimea ahead of a planned March 16 referendum on whether Crimea should . break way from Ukraine and join Russia. Putin defended the separatist drive . as in keeping with international law, but Yatsenyuk vowed not to . relinquish 'a single centimeter' of his country's territory. Obama has warned that the vote would violate international law. Biden, . who was traveling on Sunday to Chile to attend the swearing-in of the . country's new president, had been expected to travel later in the week . to the Dominican Republican to meet with President Danilo Medina. But . Biden has canceled that stop and will return to Washington on Tuesday, . in time for Obama's meeting with Yatsenyuk on Wednesday, the vice . president's office said. The White House said Biden planned to reschedule his trip to the Dominican Republic. Vacationing with his family over the weekend in Key Largo, Fla., Obama on Saturday spoke individually with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and French President Francois Hollande, and collectively with the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.","Russian foreign ministry blames far right for 'conniving' with Kiev .

"At first glance, these pictures look like they depict a network of fields stretching to the horizon. But in fact, the extraordinary images show an area of Spain as large as the Isle of Wight, totally covered in greenhouses. The fruit and vegetables grown in the futuristic-looking structures end up on tables in Britain and elsewhere. Breathtaking: These greenhouses in southern Spain cover an area of 100,000 acres, which is as large as the Isle of Wight . Transformation: The light-coloured tents reflect the sun, meaning that the average temperature in the area has fallen . The greenhouses have had such an impact on the area of Almeria in the south of the country that they have lowered the average temperature by reflecting away light. However, for workers inside there is no such respite - they must struggle to labour through 45-degree heat for just £30 a day. The area photographed covers nearly 100,000 acres, and the facilities are continuing to spread along the Mediterranean coast. Lethal: Immigrants working in the facilities must contend with temperatures of up to 45C . Swamped: Some towns have been almost entirely overtaken by the ever-growing sea of greenhouses . Fifty years ago, the land was so barren that it was used to film 'spaghetti westerns' wanting to replicate the look of American deserts. But with imported soil and hydroponic systems that drip-feed chemical fertilisers into grow-bags, the area now has the largest collection of greenhouses in the world. Many Spanish workers find it too hot to work there, so most of the staff are immigrants from Africa and Eastern Europe - either legal or illegal. Garden of England: The majority of the fruit and vegetables grown in Almeria are exported to the UK and elsewhere in Europe . Barren: The landscape was once used to film spaghetti westerns because it was so desert-like . Around 100,000 immigrants are believed to work in the facilities, and their low wages and lack of rights are thought to help the businesses remain profitable. Many of the 'farms' have no toilets, and workers are believed to be paid between €33 and €36 a day - no more than around £30. A few small towns in the area have been completely swamped by the white plastic farms. Lucrative: The exports of food from the region were worth 1.4billion euros in the first quarter of last year alone . Plastic manufacturers and recycling companies have also set up in the region, where discarded plastic sheeting and rubbish is blown around by the wind. Last month the death of a sperm whale that washed up on Spain's south coast was linked to the Almeria greenhouses after it was found to have swallowed 37lb (17kg) of plastic waste dumped into the sea. In the first quarter of 2012 food exports from Almeria, including lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and peppers, were valued at €1.4billion.","Land around Almeria is so covered with white tents it has lowered the average temperature of the area .

"Carl Froch's hopes of fighting Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in a $50million Las Vegas send-off have suffered a potential setback. The Mexican's promoter, Bob Arum, is currently negotiating a new deal with his fighter and expects him to return in September or October. But he wants Chavez to face the hard-hitting Kazakh Gennady Golovkin, rather than Froch, as reported by Boxing Scene. Out cold: Carl Froch stopped George Groves in the eighth round of their rematch at Wembley . 'Gennady Golovkin will continue to be the first choice assuming he beats [Daniel] Geale, and if Chavez says no to Golovkin, then we'll look to Froch,' Arum told Boxing Scene. Froch retained his super-middleweight world titles last weekend with a stunning eighth-round knockout of George Groves in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley. The Nottingham Cobra has admitted he could hang up his gloves but dreams of finishing his career in the fight capital of the world. But he might have to wait until next year if Chavez agrees to fight Golovkin, a fight that had been mooted for this summer before negotiations stalled. Option: Froch has targetted a Las Vegas send-off against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Golovkin instead defends his WBA Super and IBO middleweight titles against former world champion Geale in New York's Madison Square Garden on July 26. And Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez is confident his charge would beat Froch if the two were to meet. 'Froch is a gallant warrior, but makes too mistakes and if the fight can be made, I see Golovkin capitalising on them to stop him in the last part of the fight,' he told World Boxing News. Another option for Froch is another domestic dust-up with mandatory challenger James DeGale. The IBF has ruled that Froch must face the Londoner within the nine months or be stripped of the belt.

"Newly published top-secret documents show that the United States government has reimbursed tech companies like Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Microsoft millions of dollars each year for their participation in the National Security Agency's clandestine Prism surveillance program that was made public earlier this year by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden. Further, the documents - obtained by the Guardian newspaper from Snowden - show that the reimbursements were made even after a court ruled in 2011 that the agency's activities were unconstitutional. The companies that were reimbursed were getting paid taxpayer money as reimbursement for costs incurred when they were forced to meet new certification demands after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (Fisa) court ruled that the NSA's actions were unconstitutional. Prism: New documents reveal that the U.S. government spent millions to reimburse tech companies participating in its secret surveillance program . Whistle-blower: The new documents are just the latest in a series of leaks by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden . President Barack Obama declassified Fisa's October, 2011 judgement on Wednesday. The court found that the agency's inability to separate domestic from foreign communication violated the Fourth Amendment. The ruling created problems for the NSA, and the documents reveal the lengths to which the agency went to bring the operation into compliance. The material obtained by the Guardian is the 'first evidence of a financial relationship between the tech companies and the NSA.' According to the paper, the Fisa court is required to sign annual 'certifications' that 'provide the legal framework for surveillance operations.' After the court ruled the program was unconstitutional, it would only renew certain certifications on a temporary basis as the NSA found a solution that wouldn't violate the constitution. 'Last year's problems resulted in multiple extensions to the . certifications' expiration dates which cost millions of dollars for . Prism providers to implement each successive extension – costs covered . by Special Source Operations,' a top-secret memo from the NSA - dated December, 2012 - states. Case-by-case: Microsoft says it is only seeking reimbursements from the government on a case-by-case basis . Yahoo! declined to specifically answer the Guardian's questions but acknowledged that it has sought reimbursements from the government . Facebook claims it 'never received any compensation in connection with responding to a government data request' Snowden previously described Special Source Operations as the 'crown jewel' of the NSA. It oversees programs like Prism that require 'corporate partnerships' with the aforementioned tech companies. Since the Guardian and the Washington Post exposed the Prism on June 6, the tech companies have systematically denied that they were involved in any sort of 'corporate partnership' with the government - they claimed they only hand over data when presented with a specific legal request. According to the paper, a previous newsletter stated that all the companies particpating in Prism were given new certifications around the time of the Fisa ruling. 'All Prism providers, except Yahoo and Google, were successfully transitioned to the new certifications. We expect Yahoo and Google to complete transitioning by Friday 6 October,' the letter states. Google said that its involvement in Prism 'falls far short of the wild claims still being made in the press today' President Obama has repeatedly denied that the NSA was involved in any unauthorised surveillance of Americans . Reimbursements: new documents reveal that the NSA has spent millions paying companies to participate in Prism . The Guardian gave each of the companies an opportunity to explain the new documents, asking each one specific questions about the payments they received from the government for their participation in the program. 'Federal law requires the US government to reimburse providers for costs . incurred to respond to compulsory legal process imposed by the . government. We have requested reimbursement consistent with this law,' a Yahoo! spokeswoman told the paper. Facebook said it had 'never received any compensation in connection with responding to a government data request.' Google provided a statement, but refused to answer any specific questions. 'We await the US government's response to our petition to publish more . national security request data, which will show that our compliance with . American national security laws falls far short of the wild claims . still being made in the press today,' the statement said. Microsoft - which seeks reimbursements from the government on a case-by-case basis - initially declined an on-the-record comment, but later provided a statement. 'Microsoft only complies with court orders because it is legally ordered . to, not because it is reimbursed for the work. We could have a more . informed discussion of these issues if providers could share additional . information, including aggregate statistics on the number of any . national security orders they may receive,' the statement read.","New documents that the federal government reimbursed the tech companies for compliance costs for their involvement in the Prism program .

"It's slogan may be 'Every Little Helps' but one customer got more than he bargained for when he when he found a dead lizard in a loaf of Tesco's freshly-baked bread. Primary school pupil William Evans, 10, was slicing the multi-grain brown loaf to make toast for his breakfast when he spotted the lizard embedded in the bottom. William, from Hawkchurch, near Axminster, Devon, said: 'I was making some toast and cut off a slice when I saw something that looked like a leaf. Stunned: Primary school pupil William Evans, 10, found a lizard imbedded in the bottom of a Tesco loaf of bread . 'So I took the wrapping off and found the lizard inside. It was about two to three inches long. It certainly put me off my toast.' William quickly called his parents Marcus and Clare who reported the discovery to their local Tesco store in Axminster. Mr Evans said the store customer service department said it would be impossible for a lizard to get in one of their loaves because of the company's high hygiene standards. Mr Evans, a volunteer church worker, said: 'I am surprised they didn't tell me 'every little helps'. 'They have asked me to take it into the manager but I am thinking of contacting environmental health officers. 'We are keeping the lizard and loaf in the fridge for evidence.' No risk: A spokesman for the Tesco store in Axminster where the bread was baked said they were confident 'robust procedures' meant there was no food safety risk to the product while in the store . He added that he was relieved William spotted the lizard before cutting into it. Mr Evans continued: 'It was one of Axminster Tesco's baked in-store, multi-grain brown loaves. 'The lizard had not been cooked so it must have got into the packaging and died there. 'You could see the impression of its body in the bread so it must have been warm when he got in. 'The poor little lad was absolutely traumatised by it. 'He went to take a slice off for some toast, turned the loaf over and found the lizard stuck on the bottom.' A Tesco spokesman said: 'We have conducted a thorough inspection of the bakery area as well as the rest of the store. 'We are confident that our robust procedures mean that there was no food safety risk to the product whilst it was within the store. 'If the customer would like to return the product, packaging and proof of purchase to us, we will be able to investigate further.'","William Evans, 10, was slicing a loaf of bread when he spotted the lizard .

"If last night's season première of Dancing With The Stars is anything to go by, audiences are in for a rollercoaster ride. Kirstie Alley was the surprise star as the 12th season kicked off, stunning audiences with a spectacular performance that placed her in second position. Scroll down to see the video... Shake it: The Cheers star impressed the judges with their up-beat Cha Cha which saw Kirstie swing her was around the ballroom . Wow factor: Kirstie Alley stunned the crowd with her performance which scored her a 23 with the judges, putting her in second place . The 60-year-old Cheers actress had previously tweeted about how tough she was finding the rehearsal process. She admitted she agreed to do the show to help lose an extra 30 to 40 pounds having struggled with her weight for years. Surprised: Even Kirstie and Maskim appeared stunned as their scores were read out . Before the show: Kirstie was spotted looking nervous just before the show but luckily her dance partner Maskim was on hand to comfort her . So it came as a shock when the curvaceous actress (and eldest competitor this season) and her partner Maskim Chmerkovskiy nailed the exciting and seductive routine. Kirstie kicked off the fast paced dance by winking and pushing up her ample bosom before sashaying her way around the floor in a tight fitting sequin gown. The judges loved her and were all visibly stunned by her performance. 'Your foot placement was the best of the night,' Bruno told her excitedly. 'Unbelievable - it had sizzle,' Carrie Ann Inaba told her with Len Wiseman saying, 'It was fun it was cheeky and it made me feel good.' Taking it seriously: Kirstie has previously voiced her ambition to win the competition . Superbowl winning Pittsburg Steeler Hines Ward received a standing ovation for his flamboyant Cha Cha with Australian dance partner Kym Johnson with Carrie Ann Inaba saying the performance was the: 'sparkliest cha cha.' 'You lit up the stage,' she told them. 'I couldn't take my eyes off your bum,' judge Len Wiseman told him to a cheer. What a hit: American football star Hines Ward has won a superbowl and now wants to win a mirror ball trophy . Show stopper: Supermodel Petra Nemcova tugged at heart strings as she dedicated her dance to the people of Japan . Judge favourite: Carrie Ann tells the model she has natural grace . Supermodel Petra Nemcova is proving to be the season's princess who tugged on the heart strings of audience members as she recounted her experiences from the 2004 Indonesian tsunami in which she was badly injured. Upon hearing of the Japanese Tsunami during rehearsals Petra was overcome with emotion and had to be comforted by her dance partner. Robe girls: Ahead of the show model Petra Nemcova and Kendra Wilkinson were spotted in named beige dressing gowns and Kendra was seen clutching a concentrated energy drink . Her waltz, which she dedicated to the people of Japan, impressed the judges with Len Wiseman calling it a 'charming dance,' and Bruno Tolioni saying it was 'a dance of extreme beauty and sophistication.' Rapper Romeo managed to overcome his fears and put forward an impressive performance with partner Chelsea Hightower. Romeo said at the beginning of his segment that all he wanted to do was get further than his father, Master P, who competed in the second season of the show and was known for getting the lowest scores ever. Loosening up: Rapper Romeo earned a modest 19 points from the judges for his Cha Cha with Chelsea Hightower . Swinger: Kendra swished her was around the dancefloor with partner Louis Von Amstel . Former Playboy Playmate and reality star Kendra WIlkinson seemed excited to be taking part and ready to shake her bootie when she met up with partner Louis Van Amstel to begin rehearsals. Dressed in a short sequinned blue dress the 25-year-old model rocked the dance floor with her performance  and had a huge smile on her face the entire time. The judges liked it too with Bruno telling her 'you can definitely strut your stuff my darling,' and Carrie telling her, 'I don't think you missed a step.' She also had some very special support in the audience in the form of her ex-boyfriend and Playboy legend Hugh Hefner accompanied by his fiancé Crystal Harris who both clapped and cheered for the star. Her husband, American football star Hank Baskett was also in the audience looking proud and impressed with his pint sized wife. In great spirits: Kendra was her usually bubbly self and the judges loved her giving her 18 points . Famous fans: Kendra's former flame Hugh Hefner and his fiancé Crystal Harris came out to support her . Fun: Former wrestler Chris Jerico and partner Cheryl Burke appeared to be enjoying himself on the dancefloor . Karate Kid star Ralph Macchio was the winner of the night along with his partner Karina Smirnoff who danced the foxtrot. The 49-year-old actor, who still looks identical to when he shot the famous film 29 years ago,floated his way round the ballroom and even managed to nail a high kick during the routine. Ready for action: Before the show Wendy Williams and Hines Ward take a moment to prepare backstage . The audience was bowled over by the elegant performance, as were the judges who had great things to say. 'You are a great stonking hit,' screamed Bruno as he leapt to his feet in excitement. 'That was a great surprise,' Carrie Ann told them before awarding the pair 24 points putting them at the top of the leader board for the first week. The night's winner: Karate Kid star Ralph Macchio was the favourite of the evening with his foxtrot . High score: With parter Karina Smirnoff he took home 24 points putting him at the top of the leader board . So dashing: Judges love former boxer Sugar Ray Leonard's charming and poised performance . Other stars with notable performances included boxer Sugar Ray Leonard who at 54-years-old is the oldest male competitor of the season. His foxtrot impressed the judges who called him 'so dashing.' The most underwhelming performance of the night came from radio host Mike Catherwood who failed to wow the judges with partner Lacey Schwimmer. The pair received the night's lowest score of 13 for their foxtrot but luckily everyone is free from elimination this week meaning Mike will return to dance another week. Chat show host Wendy Williams, Disney princess Chelsea Kane and wrestler Chris Jericho all brought in average scores which will put them up for the possibility of elimination next week. Next week on the show there will also be a performance by Chris Brown. Nervous: Chat show host Wendy Williams appeared to be holding back her big personality during her cha cha . Graceful: Disney star Chelsea Kane and partner Mark Ballas floated their way through their foxtrot . Funny man can't dance: Radio show host Mike Catherwood was the lowest score of the night with only 13 points .","Alley, 60, took second spot on the leaderboard on premiere show .

"Cover-up: Former head of news Helen Boaden said the 2006 seminar affected a 'broad range of output', but that its attendees should be kept from the public . The BBC has spent tens of thousands of pounds over six years trying to keep secret an extraordinary ‘eco’ conference which has shaped its coverage of global warming,  The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The controversial seminar was run by a body set up by the BBC’s own environment analyst Roger Harrabin and funded via a £67,000 grant from the then Labour government, which hoped to see its ‘line’ on climate change and other Third World issues promoted in BBC reporting. At the event, in 2006, green activists and scientists – one of whom believes climate change is a bigger danger than global nuclear war  – lectured 28 of the Corporation’s most senior executives. Then director of television Jana Bennett opened the seminar by telling the executives to ask themselves: ‘How do you plan and run a city that is going to be submerged?’ And she asked them to consider if climate change laboratories might offer material for a thriller. A lobby group with close links to green campaigners, the International Broadcasting Trust (IBT), helped to arrange government funding for both the climate seminar  and other BBC seminars run by  Mr Harrabin – one of which was attended by then Labour Cabinet Minister Hilary Benn. Applying for money from Mr Benn’s Department for International Development (DFID), the IBT promised Ministers the seminars would influence programme content for years to come. The BBC began its long legal battle to keep details of the conference secret after an amateur climate blogger spotted a passing reference to it in an official report. Tony Newbery, 69, from North Wales, asked for further disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The BBC’s resistance to revealing anything about its funding and the names of those present led to a protracted struggle in the Information Tribunal. The BBC has admitted it has spent more than £20,000 on barristers’ fees. However, the full cost of their legal battle is understood to be much higher. In a written statement opposing disclosure in 2012, former BBC news chief and current director of BBC radio Helen Boaden, who attended the event, admitted: ‘In my view, the seminar had an impact on a broad range of BBC output.’ Plea: Part of Helen Boaden's statement opposing disclosure in 2012. She also said the seminar had sought to 'identify where the main areas of debate lie'. She is now the director of BBC radio . She said this included news reports by Mr Harrabin, and a three-part BBC  2 series presented by geologist Iain Stewart, who told viewers global warming was ‘truly scary’. According to Ms Boaden, ‘Editors and executives who attended were inspired to be more ambitious and creative in their editorial coverage of this slow-moving and complex issue.’ She claimed the seminar sought to  ‘identify where the main areas of debate lie’. However, there were no expert climate sceptics present. In an internal report, the IBT boasted that the seminars organised with Mr Harrabin had had ‘a significant impact on the BBC’s output’. Blogger: Tony Newbery, who went to an information tribunal, said the seminar was 'propaganda' Mr Newbery, who finally won his battle last month, said: ‘It is very disappointing that the BBC tried so hard to cover this up. It seems clear that this seminar was a means of exposing executives to green propaganda.’ The freshly disclosed documents show that a number of BBC attendees still occupy senior roles at the Corporation. All four scientists present were strong advocates of the dangers posed by global warming. They were led by Lord May, former president of the Royal Society, who, though not a climate expert, has argued that warming is a greater threat than nuclear war. Other non-BBC staff who attended included Blake Lee-Harwood, head of campaigns at Greenpeace, John Ashton from the powerful green lobby group E3G, Andrew Simms of the New Economics Foundation, who argued there were only 100 months left to save the planet through radical emissions cuts, and Ashok Sinha of Stop Climate Chaos. The BBC contingent included future director-general George Entwistle, Peter Horrocks, head of TV news, Stephen Mitchell, head  of radio news, Francesca Unsworth, head of newsgathering, and Peter Rippon, editor of Radio 4’s PM. Mr Harrabin was the seminar’s principal organiser. He ran it through the Cambridge Media Environment Programme, an outfit he set up with Open University lecturer Joe Smith. Mr Harrabin and Mr Smith did not derive personal financial benefit from the seminar. But by teaming up with the IBT,  an avowed lobby group trying to influence coverage, and accepting government funds when Labour was advocating radical policies to combat global warming, Mr Harrabin exposed himself to the charge he could be compromising the Corporation’s impartiality. During the legal battle, the BBC tried to airbrush both the IBT and its approach to the Government for funding from the record. Submissions and witness statements made no mention of it. Influence: The seminar was led by Lord May (left), the former president of the Royal Society who has said climate change is worse than nuclear war, and attendees included former chief George Entwistle (right) Mr Harrabin formed a partnership with the IBT in 2004. According to the newly-disclosed funding application to DFID, drawn up by IBT director Mark Galloway, it helped organise two BBC seminars on Third World themes with Mr Harrabin that year. These, Mr Galloway wrote, ‘had clearly influenced editorial staff and resulted in several new commissions’. DFID’s budget is supposed to be devoted to overseas aid projects. But Mr Galloway asked for £115,305 for the two years from March 2005, adding: ‘We have a firm commitment from the BBC to take part in seminars in 2005 and 2006 and to give all the support they can to this project.’ The DFID did not meet the IBT’s full bid. But the documents show it paid £67,404 over two years. A BBC spokesman said yesterday the seminar had ‘no agenda’, and that the organisers recognised  BBC rules on impartiality, while the IBT’s funding application was a ‘matter for them’. COMMENT by DAVID ROSE . Last week was a big one for weather news: the storms and floods in Britain, and the end of the bizarre saga which saw the Akademik Shokalskiy, the ship carrying climate scientists, tourists and a BBC reporter to inspect the ravages of global warming, trapped in Antarctic ice. In both cases, the BBC stuck closely to its skewed, climate alarmist agenda. David Cameron fuelled suggestions that the storms might be due to climate change by saying in the Commons he had ‘suspicions’ they were. The Met Office denied this was the case. Swamped: Flooding on the River Thames last week. David Rose said the BBC followed an agenda . But repeatedly, the BBC followed the PM’s line. Slots on the Radio 4 Today programme and Radio 5 repeated the bogus proposition on three separate days – and in none were sceptics allowed to present an alternative view. Yet the facts are clear. Met Office records show that December 2013 was only the 20th wettest since 1910. It had just two-thirds the rainfall of the wettest, 1914. For October to December, 2013 was only the 14th wettest year, and there has been no discernible trend in  UK or English rainfall for more than 100 years. But though the BBC was suggesting the storms were ‘climate’ rather than ‘weather’, it took a contradictory view over the icebound ship. Radio 4’s Inside Science told listeners that the ice was a freak, unpredictable event – driven by weather, not climate – and even added it had been falsely ‘used by climate deniers’ to advance their case. Rescue: The crew of the trapped Russian vessel MV Akademik Shokalskiy were airlifted from the Antarctic . Nevertheless, it allowed an interviewee to state without challenge that overall, Antarctic sea ice is only one per cent above average. In fact, it is at record levels, 15 per cent (3.5 million square miles) above normal, and has been increasing for years – a trend the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change admits it cannot explain.","Pensioner forces BBC to lift veil on 2006 eco-seminar to top executives .

"Jubilant scenes are being witnessed this morning at the Occupy Wall Street protest camp after a planned ‘eviction’ was postponed following a last-minute change of mind by the park’s owners. Brookfield Office Properties put off a clean-up and supporters of the protesters streamed into the New York park in the morning darkness today, forming a crowd of several hundred chanting people. Chanting 'Hell no! We won't go!', hundreds of demonstrators stormed a Wall Street restaurant last night to confront New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg over a planned clean-up of their camp. Defiant: On Thursday night, protesters confronted New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at a gala dinner at Cipriani's on Wall Street chanting 'Hell No! We won't go!' Divisive: Demonstrators had said they would not be going anywhere on Friday morning when Zuccotti Park is schedule to be cleaned, setting the stage for a showdown with police . Protesters last night surrounded Cipriani . restaurant in Manhattan as the Mayor was at dinner in an effort to hand . him a petition with 310,000 signatures supporting their right to remain . in Zuccotti Park. Their anger was triggered by the Mayor's endorsement of a planned clean-up of the 'unsanitary' Occupy . Wall Street encampment which was postponed at the last minute today. The city's deputy mayor made the announcement after protesters, who viewed the clean-up as an 'eviction notice', streamed into the plaza this morning. There was a strong police presence, and a showdown between protesters and authorities had been feared. Hours earlier, the mayor had refused to leave the restaurant, instead making his exit out of a back door. The city's deputy mayor  made the announcement after protesters, who viewed the clean-up as an 'eviction notice', streamed into the plaza this morning. No showdown tonight: New York Mayor City Michael Bloomberg did not come out of the restaurant to address protesters, instead leaving out of a back door . There was a strong police presence, and a showdown between protesters and authorities had been feared. Hours earlier, the mayor had refused to leave the restaurant, instead making his exit out of a back door. New York City officials have ordered Wall Street protesters to clear their sleeping bags and tarps . from the park where they started a movement that has spread around the . globe and forced CEOs and presidential candidates to take notice. But demonstrators said they wouldn't be going anywhere, setting the stage for a dawn showdown with police. The . owner of the private park where the demonstrators have camped out for . nearly a month said it has become trashed and 'unsanitary'. Brookfield . Office Properties had planned to begin a section-by-section power-washing of . Zuccotti Park at 7am. Rebellion: The march came one day after Bloomberg informed protesters that they would have to leave the park so that it could be 'cleaned' Support: The protesters attempted to deliver to Bloomberg a petition with 310,000 signatures supporting the Occupy Wall Street protest and their right to stay in the park . Occupy . Wall Street spokesman Patrick Bruner sent an email to supporters on . Thursday asking them to join the protesters at 6am Friday to 'defend the . occupation from eviction', wary that the clean-up effort is a dirty trick to end their demonstrations. He said Brookfield Properties, the . owner of the park, asked for police assistance to clear it of protesters . so that it could be cleaned. Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway said in a . statement Wednesday that the protest has 'created unsanitary conditions . and considerable wear and tear on' Zuccotti Park. The cleaning was to be done in stages, and protesters were permitted to return to the park after cleaners were finished. Call to action: The mayor refused to come out of the posh restaurant to meet them and, instead, slipped out the back door . Police presence: The NYPD came out in large numbers as hundreds of demonstrators stormed the streets . However, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly told the New . York Post on Thursday that returning protesters will be prohibited from . bringing tents, sleeping bags with them. He said the demonstrators were notified of the new policy through pamphlets that were passed out to them by police officers. The notice lists regulations including no tents, no tarps or sleeping bags on the ground, no lying on benches and no storage of personal property on the ground. All those practices have been common at the park, where protesters have lived, slept and eaten for nearly a month. Mayor Bloomberg visited the protesters Wednesday to offer assurances - but he didn’t stay long. Foul: Protesters are being told to vacate Ducotti Park on Friday because the demonstrators have caused 'unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear' Clean-up: Protesters at Zuccotti Park were given a letter that the park needs to be cleaned on Friday . Packing it in: Occupy Wall Street demonstrators started cleaning up their belongings today after Mayor Bloomberg told protestors that the park needs to be cleaned . Luke Richardson, a 25-year-old protester, told the New York Daily News: 'I think we did the right thing - we booed him out of here.' Tyler Combelic, a member of the press relations work group for Occupy Wall Street, told CNN: 'I'm glad that [Bloomberg] finally found what we were doing important enough to visit after dismissing it for several weeks.' Mr Combelic added: 'I'm hoping that the city will be willing to work with the Occupy Wall Street occupiers in arranging a way to get the cleaning done, which both does not disturb the encampment nor does it too greatly impede on the cleaning process.' But Allison Esso of Human Services Council, a group that supports the protesters, was wary. Clean-up: Brookfield Properties has asked for police assistance to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters so it can be cleaned . She said: 'I'm hoping that they're not trying to undermine their ability to protest.' The protest, known as Occupy Wall Street, has sympathetic groups in other cities which each stage their own local rallies and demonstrations: Occupy Boston, Occupy Cincinnati, Occupy Houston, Occupy Los Angeles, Occupy Philadelphia, Occupy Providence, Occupy Salt Lake, and Occupy Seattle, among them. The movement is even spreading across the pond. UK protesters inspired by Occupy Wall . Street in the U.S are planning to establish a tent city in London's . financial district this weekend. Anger at the capital: An Occupy DC protester is arrested after disrupting a Congressional hearing with Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta . Scuffle: Police arrest marchers from Occupy Wall Street, during a protest near JPMorgan Chase bank headquarters last night in New York . Taken down: A demonstrator with Occupy Wall Street is arrested during a march near the financial district in New York yesterday . A Facebook page titled 'Occupy London's Stock Exchange' has amassed more than 3,000 people agreeing to attend the event on October 15. The group, who were behind a protest that saw Westminster Bridge closed on Monday posted on the social networking site that they are 'part of a global popular movement.' A post under the name 'Occupy The London Stock Exchange' said: 'Hundreds attended the General Assembly and we are growing stronger every day! The movement has also drawn reaction from world leaders, including President Obama, former Polish President Lech Walesa and Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Walesa said Thursday that he supports the New York protest and is planning to either visit or write a letter to the protesters. He said the global economic crisis has made people aware that 'we need to change the capitalist system' because we need 'more justice, more people's interests, and less money for money's sake.' Khamenei said Wednesday that the wave of protests reflects a serious problem that will ultimately topple capitalism in America. Talking: A demonstrator with Occupy Wall Street protests scuffles with a police officer during the march yesterday . Suspicious: Some Wall Street protesters are hoping that the clean-up is not an attempt to undermine their efforts . He claimed the United States is in a full-blown crisis because its 'corrupt foundation has been exposed to the American people.' Khamenei's remarks came a day after U.S. officials said the Obama administration plans to leverage charges that Iran plotted to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador into a new global campaign to isolate the Islamic republic. Protesters busted: Eight people have been arrested in Portland, Oregon, as Occupy Wall Street protests spread to the Northwest . Protesters, who have been living, sleeping and eating in the park for the duration, say they are in it for the long haul, despite the onset of cold weather. On Wednesday, police arrested four people outside JP Morgan Chase offices where Wall Street protesters called in vain for a meeting with Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Protesters accused the police of rough handling. An Associated Press photographer witnessed police officers heading into the crowd of demonstrators to make the arrests. Meanwhile, . about 700 members of the Service Employees International Union marched . through the Financial District; the union, which represents 23,000 . office cleaners, is gearing up for contract negotiations with the Realty .

"Bebo may have hoped yesterday would be a change in fortunes for the struggling company. But if today’s announcement is anything to go by, their competitors are not going down easily without a fight. In direct response to Bebo revealing its ‘Blab’ video messaging service, Vine fought back with an announcement of its own. Vine Messages allows users to send videos directly to friends rather than posting them for all to see . Called ‘Vine Messages’, the new app will give Vine users the ability to send friends videos and text in private messages. This not only tackles Bebo, but could also send shivers down the spine of popular messaging services such as WhatsApp, Snapchat and Facebook. Using Vine Messages, available now on both iOS and Android, users can either start one-to-one conversations or select multiple recipients, much like on WhatsApp. In a nod to Snapchat, they can also choose to only receive private messages from friends. Vine Messages, like Blab, also allows users to send messages to people who don’t have the app. As Bebo enters the messaging war, this move should let them know how tough the battle will be with their rivals. Picture perfect? Vine Messages lets users take a video (left) and send it to selected people (right) To reply to a message (left) users hold the camera button and send their response (right) The free Blab app, pictured, lets users record and send videos to friends, even if the recipient doesn't have the iOS app . After almost a year of teasers, social network Bebo kickstarted it's revival with the release of a video messaging app yesterday . Called Blab, the free service lets users record and send videos to friends, even if the recipient doesn't have the iOS app. It is the first of three apps set to be released by the California-based social network this year, and signals that the once floundering firm is getting a reboot. The site itself is also going through a refresh and is set to relaunch 'soon'. Bebo was once the most popular social network in the UK. But following the launch of rival sites such as Facebook and Twitter, its numbers dwindled and the site, as its users knew it, eventually closed down. At the height of its popularity in 2008 - three years after it was created - the site was bought by AOL for $850 million (£510 million). Only five years later the site was trailing behind its rivals in terms of user numbers, and had developed a reputation for being supposedly rife with bullying. To save the company from going under in 2013, its founder Michael Birch bought his site back for a cut-price $1million (£600,000). Birch posted a video shortly after saying it was time to ‘wipe the slate clean’ and promised its users the service would come back fighting. Reports about the Blab app first appeared in February this year, and now the app is available on the Apple App Store. According to the app’s listing: ‘Blab is . the fun app that lets you send quick video messages to your friends and . family! It’s free to Blab anyone, anywhere in the world.' To send a Blab, users select a contact, hold the screen to record their video message, and release to send, pictured left.  If the recipient has the app, a notification appears on the app’s icon. If they don’t, the recipient receives the video in a text message with a link that opens the clip in a browser window . The app connects with the contacts in a user’s phone. To send a Blab, users select a contact, hold the screen to record their video message, and release to send. If . the recipient has the app, a notification appears on the app’s . icon. If they don’t, the recipient receives the video in a text message . with a link that opens in a browser window. Vine . and Video in Instagram work in a similar way, but the video clips can . only be sent to other Vine and Instagram users – although they can also . be shared on other social networks. Blab doesn’t set a time limit on its videos either, like Vine’s six-second and Instagram’s 15-second rules. Blab has also taken its privacy lead from . the likes of Snapchat and only lets users watch the last video they . were sent. As soon as a new Blab is received from that contact, the destroys the old one . and replaces it. The current Bebo website shows more than 780,000 people have signed up to be part of the ‘new Bebo’. In . a video, Birch promises users that all their posts and data is safe and . will be available once the new site goes live, although doesn't specify . when that will be. The . site still faces stiff competition from the likes of Facebook, and the . Blab app goes up against behemoths including WhatsApp, Snapchat and . Viber. The other Bebo apps . are expected later this year, but the company has not yet revealed more . information about what they will be. What's clear, though, is that they will be facing stiff competition.","New update allows Vine users to send private messages .

"The number of confirmed Ebola cases passed the 10,000 mark over the weekend, despite efforts to curb its spread. And while the disease typically dies on surfaces within hours, research has discovered it can survive for more than seven weeks under certain conditions. During tests, the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) found that the Zaire strain will live on samples stored on glass at low temperatures for as long as 50 days. The left-hand charts plot survival rates of Zaire strain of Ebola (Zebov) and Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv) on glass (a) and plastic (b) at 4° (39°F) over 14 days. The right-hand charts reveal the survival rate under the same conditions over 50 days. Both viruses survived for 26 days, and Ebola was extracted after 50 days . The tests were initially carried out by researchers from DSTL before the current outbreak, in 2010, but the strain investigated is one of five that is still infecting people globally. The findings are also quoted in advice from the Public Agency of Health in Canada. Ebola was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) - the most recent species, discovered in 2008. For their 2010 paper, ‘The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol’, the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL)  tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov). Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period. When stored at 4° (39°F), by day 26, viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted; Zebov on the glass sample, and Marv on both glass and plastic. By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. For their 2010 paper, ‘The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol’, Sophie Smither and her colleagues tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zebov. Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids, and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period. When stored at 4° (39°F), by day 26, viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted; Zebov on the glass sample, and Marv on both glass and plastic. By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. ‘This study has demonstrated that ﬁloviruses are able to survive and remain infectious, for extended periods when suspended within liquid and dried onto surfaces,’ explained the researchers. ‘Data from this study extend the knowledge on the survival of filoviruses under different conditions and provide a basis with which to inform risk assessments and manage exposure.’ The researchers do stress that these tests were carried out in a controlled lab environment, and not in the real world, but published their findings to highlight the survival rates. Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its Ebola guidelines following the rise in infections. Ebola (pictured) was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) The centre explained that Ebola is not spread through the air, water, or food and a person infected with Ebola can’t spread the disease until symptoms appear. The time from exposure to when signs or symptoms of the disease appear, known as the incubation period, is two to 21 days, but the average time is eight to 10 days. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises: . • DO wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. • Do NOT touch the blood or body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of people who are sick. • Do NOT handle items that may have come in contact with a sick person’s blood or body fluids, like clothes, bedding, needles,or medical equipment. • Do NOT touch the body of someone who has died of Ebola. Ebola is spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. Signs of Ebola include fever and symptoms like severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or unexplained bleeding or bruising. Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: ‘The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. 'They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.’ Officials have emphasised there is no risk of transmission from people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not yet showing symptoms. But, specialists at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta found that the virus is present on a patient’s skin after symptoms develop, underlining how contagious the disease is once symptoms set in. According to the CDC, the virus can survive for a few hours on dry surfaces like doorknobs and countertops and can survive for several days in puddles or other collections of body fluid. However, bleach solutions, including household bleach, can kill it. Ebola is only spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. It can be killed using bleach . There is no FDA-approved vaccine available for Ebola, but experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development. The CDC advises people wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser, to protect themselves. It warns to not touch the blood or body fluids, including urine, faeces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen of people who are sick. Ebola was once thought to originated in gorillas, because human outbreaks began after people ate gorilla meat. But scientists now believe that bats are the natural reservoir for the virus, and that apes and humans catch it from eating food that bats have drooled or defecated on, or by coming in contact with surfaces covered in infected bat droppings and then touching their eyes or mouths. The current outbreak seems to have started in a village near Guéckédou, Guinea, where bat hunting is common, according to Doctors Without Borders.

"Protesters spent a third day camped out in Wisconsin Capitol building as they readied themselves to hear Governor Scott Walker's full budget proposal later today. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, quickly becoming a darling of Republicans across the country for his plan to take away most collective bargaining rights from public workers, will get another chance to bolster his national conservative credentials when he unveils the rest of his plan for dealing with the state's budget woes. Walker's plan - set to be released Tuesday - will include deep cuts for schools and local governments to help close a projected $3.6 billion shortfall in the two-year budget. Scroll down for video . Thinned out: Protester numbers were down yesterday, despite vows from organisers that more would join the sit in . Protest: Law enforcement officers forcibly remove a protester who was on a ledge of the state Capitol building . Stalemate: Protesters were asked to leave the building last night but many refused. Police have refused to unlock the entrances today because they are trying to prevent protesters from sleeping overnight in the building. Protests in the Capitol building began on February 15, and by Sunday police had threatened to begin removing people after 4pm. But with so many demonstrators ignoring the deadline to leave, they . had no choice but to give in to the demands to stay. After two weeks of massive protests, officials say there will be only limited access to the Capitol for Walker's budget address. On Monday, police would not allow people to enter the building unless they were attending a public hearing or being escorted by lawmakers or their staff. Police said they were trying to resolve conflicts with a handful of protesters who had refused to move to the ground floor of the building where demonstrators were being told to stay. Hundreds marched outside the Capitol. President Barack Obama told U.S. state governors yesterday that everyone should be ready to sacrifice to help tackle the deficit. But in a nod to the conflict between public sector unions and the governor in Wisconsin, Obama said it did not do anyone any good to 'denigrate' public employees. Steadfast: Demonstrators have occupied building with a round-the-clock protest for the past 14 days protesting Governor Scott Walker's attempt to push through a bill that would restrict collective bargaining rights . Walker already has taken on President Barack Obama and Wisconsin's unions, a traditional Democratic stalwart. Before he even took office, Walker's opposition to high-speed rail resulted in the Obama administration taking back more than $800 million that had been awarded to the state. Walker's plan also calls on state workers to contribute 5.8 percent of their salaries toward pensions and double their health insurance contribution beginning April 1. Those changes would be expanded to nearly all other public workers, except those operating under existing union contracts, beginning July 1. The higher benefit contribution would equate to an 8 percent pay decrease for the average worker. The state would save $30 million this fiscal year and $300 million over the next two years. Walker said without those savings, 1,500 workers would have to be laid off between now and July and 12,000 state and local employees over the next two years. Unions for teachers and state workers have said they would agree to the benefit concessions as long as they retain collective bargaining rights. Staying put: Around 200 demonstrators, left, chant 'peaceful protest' and 'whose house is this? Our house'. While, right, others left peacefully after 14 days occupying the state Capitol building in Madison, Wisconsin . Labor leaders and Democratic lawmakers say Walker's proposal is intended to undermine unions and weaken a key Democratic voter base. 'He's not even conceding the fact that they've given them the money,' Democratic Senator Jon Erpenbach said in an interview in Chicago. 'He's threatening their livelihoods. He's treating them like poker chips.' Walker has threatened that if the state doesn't pass his proposal by Tuesday, deeper cuts and layoffs would be required. Missing that deadline means the state won't be able to save $165 million through debt refinancing, Walker says. Backing: The 'police officer' with what appears to be a Madison police badge on his breast and the words Cops For Labor' printed on the back of his sweat shirt, below, addresses the crowd at the Wisconsin Capitol state building in Madison . Puppet protest: Two demonstrators in masks demonstrate outside Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's office at the state capitol building . On Friday, Wisconsin's state Assembly approved Walker's proposal to . strip public sector unions of most collective bargaining rights. The plan now needs state Senate approval, but Senate Democrats have fled Wisconsin to prevent a vote. Over the weekend, there were solidarity rallies around the country . with several thousand protesters gathering in New York City and Los . Angeles. About 1,000 people turned out in Chicago, Denver and Columbus, Ohio. Several hundred rallied in Austin, Texas, and about 100 people joined a . demo in Miami. Other states considering similar proposals to Wisconsin include Ohio, Tennessee, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa and Kansas. The stakes are high for labour groups because more than a third of . U.S. public employees, including teachers, police and civil service . workers, belong to unions. Police officers must plan what to do with the hundreds of protesters who were allowed an extra night in the building . Sleeping: The weary protesters will spend one more night in the state building . Teacher Raymond Wohl at the Chicago protest said: 'We bailed out . Goldman Sachs, we bailed out Wall Street, we bailed out GM, but the hell . with our teachers, our fire fighters, our nurses, our city workers, our . state workers! 'I'm here because that's unjust, unfair,' Doug Frank, 51, drove over three hours from his home in Crosby to attend the protest in Austin. He said: 'What they're trying to do (in Wisconsin) is very heavy-handed; it's un-American.' In New York, people waved signs reading 'Cut bonuses, not teachers,' 'Unions make us strong,' and 'Wall St is destroying America,' and wore . stickers that read 'We are all Wisconsin.' Meanwhile, Mr Walker has vowed he will not climb down over his bill . which would also require them to contribute more to health insurance and . pensions. He has warned that 10,000 state workers could lose their jobs if the bill is not passed. On NBC's Meet the Press today, he said stripping the workers of . collective bargaining rights was necessary to give the state the . flexibility to get its finances in order. He believed that some of the Democrat senators will return soon.","Protesters remain in Wisconsin Capitol for a third day .

"It was the reality TV show we loved to hate. Starring the likes of Calum Best, Paul Danan, Rebecca Loos, Bianca Gascoigne and Sophie Anderton, twelve single celebrities spent five weeks on an island in Fiji and the British public watched on tenterhooks to see if romance would blossom. And now, ITV2 is allegedly planning to relaunch the show, albeit with a slightly new format and new name: The Resort. Scroll down for video . Stars of the first Love Island series from left to right: Liz Mcclarnon, Lee Sharpe, Lady Isabella Hervey, Nikki Ziering, Winners Fran Cosgrave and Jayne Middlemiss, Calum Best, Paul Danan, Rebecca Loos and Abi Titmuss . According to reports, this time around, the series will see celebrities mingling with members of the public, as they holiday together in a luxury seaside resort. The saucy remit is the same: producers are hoping that contestants will find love, and viewers will be able to vote who stays and who goes. An anonymous ITV insider told the Daily Star: 'The programme is just in its development stage at the moment, but it is hoped filming will begin somewhere hot in Europe early this summer. From left to right: Alicia Douvall, Kelle Bryan, Lady Victoria Hervey, Sophie Anderton, Bianca Gascoigne and Colleen Shannon starred in the second series of Love Island, aired in 2006 . Rebecca Loos, most famous for her alleged affair with David Beckham, and TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss starred in the axed reality show . 'The idea is for single celebs to try to find romance with ordinary members of the public.' 'Instead of them being on an island, they're going to be sent away to a posh resort instead'. Love Island began in 2005 and was presented by Patrick Kielty and Kelly Brook, who was later replaced by Fearne Cotton. Viewers could vote for which two of the 13 celebrities would enter the 'love shack' together to get to know each other better. Former Hollyoaks actor Paul Danan made an appearance in the first series and became a household name . TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss, 44, and Fran Cosgrave, 38, won the first series, while Bianca Gascoigne and Calum Best won the second series. But the show made the most waves when a tropical storm hitting the island, resulting in the residents of the island being stranded and the live eviction being cancelled.

"The world's biggest uterine tumour, weighing 30lbs and measuring 21 inches in diameter, has been removed from an Indian woman. Doctors in the southern city of Chennai performed a complex operation on a 52-year-old woman identified as Latha. She had been suffering breathlessness and fatigue for several years but had no idea the giant tumour - similar to the size of a watermelon - was growing inside her. Warning graphic content . Surgeons in India have removed what is thought to be the world's biggest ever uterine tumour. The giant growth was removed from the womb of a 52-year-old woman identified only as Latha . When Latha arrived at Chennai Hospital bleeding heavily last month, doctors performed a series of tests. They discovered a huge mass growing outside her uterus. The patient had no idea she had a tumour growing inside her . A month ago, the 52-year-old arrivied at Chennai's Kumaran Hospital, bleeding heavily. Doctors ran tests and discovered she was severely anaemic, before detecting a 'large fibroid' growth attached to the outer surface of the uterus, which was putting pressure on her body and causing her symptoms. Dr Mani Mekalai, head of the hospital's department of obstetrics and gynaecology, said the team were 'shocked' to find the massive growth. She said: 'In medical parlance, this is . called a super giant uterine fibroid and the largest one removed before . this, in Africa weight 21lbs. The giant tumour weighed 30lbs (15 kg) and measured 21 inches diameter . 'From the sheer size of it, the tumour could have easily been there for more than 20 years.' She said symptoms of tumours are normally linked to the location of the fibroid, but since this was outside the uterus, the patient was unaware it was growing. Latha was taken into the operating theatre within two days of being admitted to hospital. A team of four doctors performed the surgery, to remove the tumour. Surgical gastroenterologist Dr Shiva Kumar said: 'The surgery which went on for . three-and-a-half hours by itself was challenging as the fibroid, which . takes blood supply to grow, had a lot of blood vessels attached to it. 'It . was also stuck to the small bowel and omentum and was also pressing on . the uterus. 'We had to carefully slice through and detach it.' The team removed the uterus along with the fibroid - which measured 21 inches in diameter - to prevent it from re-growing. Latha has recovered and been discharged from hospital. Dr Mekalai explained that though . uterine tumours were common in women, the fibroid that was removed . recently was unusually large. 'Nearly . 25 per cent of women in the reproductive group are susceptible to such . fibroids and they usually come in multiples. 'High amounts of oestrogen . can cause these tumours,' she added.

"16-year-old says she loves Rylan . Said she saw the hidden Tulisa and that they're still in touch . Has hopes of launching a vintage-inspired fashion line . 16-year-old singing sensation Ella Henderson captured the nation's heart when she sang for her late grandfather on this year's X Factor. And since she first appeared on the hit ITV show, the humble Grimsby girl's life has been turned upside down. From Adele lauding her as 'amazing on Twitter to record companies fighting to sign her, the young starlet's future is most certainly looking bright. Young starlet: Ella Henderson, who would love to launch her own fashion line, warmed up ahead of the UK's first Catwalk on Ice from Very.co.uk . 'Life has been amazing since X Factor. My schedule is so manic, I was even supposed to be working on Christmas day but I have managed to cancel it as I want to spend time with my family,' she told MailOnline. Although a shock singing showdown between her and James Arthur saw her leave the competition earlier than expected, the teenager maintains that the right man won. She said: 'The last two in the final, Jaheme and James, were the right two. They are both winners.' The down-to-earth singer became extremely close with her fellow contestants during her time on the show, particularly boy band Union J. Bright future: The 16-year-old has a bright future ahead and she is loving every minute of her new found fame . 'Seeing everyone on Sunday night was amazing. It was really fun to sing together and it was like reuniting a family. I love Rylan, he is so fun to be around,' she said. As for her mentor Tulisa, who was unsurprisingly gutted when Ella was voted out of the competition, the pair are still in touch. Speaking about their relationship, Ella said: 'We are still in contact and we text which is nice. I loved having her as a mentor, I saw the hidden Tulisa and her warm side. 'As much as we were chalk and cheese, we had lots in common.' Close: Although Ella was voted off X Factor earlier than expected, she still remains close to mentor Tulisa and says she saw her 'hidden side' Tulisa has spoken out in recent interviews saying the young pop star is destined for greatness, and that is exactly what's on Ella's agenda. Aside from her obvious singing career, Ella would love to bring out her own fashion line and got a foot through the fashion door last night at the Very.co.uk on ice fashion show. 'I love Very, their catwalk on ice is very exciting and I love what Fearne and Holly have done for the brand. 'I would love to do my own fashion line. It would be very vintage-inspired and represent my style which is very fifties with a modern twist. It would be classy and timeless.' Nervous: Ella wasn't as confident on the ice rink as she is on the stage . The budding fashionista, who has become somewhat of a style icon for her young fans, was lucky enough to have kept some of the outfits she wore on the show. 'I got to keep some clothes which is amazing. I got a big suitcase and threw it all in. 'I have loved dressing up and doing the glamorous shoots but usually I just love hopping in a onesie with my hair scraped back,' she said. Despite favouring the more casual look, Ella was of course looking glamorous last night when she skated onto Very.co.uk's first ever catwalk on ice.

"Here is Lindsay Lohan opening up about her latest spell in jail. Speaking to Jay Leno on the tonight show, the Mean Girls star admits: 'I've made a lot of poor decisions and I'm dealing with the consequences.' Lindsay made a previously unplanned visit to Leno's Tonight Show to talk about being jailed on, ironically, 'Good Friday'. Standing ovation: Newly convicted actress . Lindsay Lohan was given a standing ovation by Jay Leno's studio audience . in her first post-conviction TV appearance . 'I was kind of shocked, I didn't expect the outcome to be what it was. 'But I'm a big girl and I'm going to do what I'm told to do. I'm taking responsibility,' she said. Asked if she was treated unfairly, she - perhaps unexpectedly - . insisted: 'I think that I was treated the way I should have been . treated.' And as for jail, she said: 'It was an interesting . experience and it was definitely a wake up call. But everything happens . for a reason.' She added: 'I'm not a kid anymore. I'm 24, I've made a lot of mistakes and I recognise that. 'I feel like I've let a lot of my fans down by putting myself in situations when I was young and wasn't thinking clearly,' she said. 'I really just want to be the person that I aspire to be, and be the actress, and be in this industry and make movies and do what I love to do, and bring characters to life that people can relate to. And my fans have been really supportive of me doing that.' In shock: Lilo told Leno she found the sentence 'shocking' and said it her left her 'kind of numb' but said she was treated as she should have been . Leno told her that Jane Fonda, a recent guest on the show and Lohan's . costar in Georgia Rules, called her one of the best young actresses . she's worked with. 'That's amazing, coming from her,' Lohan said. 'I'm in the clear now, and as long as I stay focused, I can achieve what I want to achieve.' Lohan received a standing ovation from the audience after her candid interview. Lilo, a late addition to the show, bumping . scheduled guest, Broadway and Glee star Kristin Chenoweth, to another . date, also told Leno she found the sentence 'shocking' and said it her left her 'kind of numb.' Leno asked Lohan, 'At what point did you realise, 'Oh my God, I could lose this, this could slip away from me?'' Warm hug: Leno greets Lohan, who made a last-minute appearance on the show . 'I . think that when, you know, being young and being in the position I was . in, you don’t really take the time to appreciate what you have and it’s . all kind of a whirlwind, and people make decisions for you,' Lohan said. Leno also asked about her current support system, considering her 'odd childhood.' 'Interesting,' Lohan corrected him. 'My mom's amazing, she's really strong. My sister's here with me...I have good people in my life,' she insisted. What about dad Michael Lohan? Leno asked. 'Am I supposed to respond? Because I'm not going to. I plead the Fifth on that!' Moving on: The actress admits she made a lot of bad choices but is still confident she can achieve what she wants to in life . But in a roundly good-natured interview Leno also asked about Lohan's seemingly dormant love life. 'You always bring the love life question up!'she protested. 'I don't have one right now...I used to not like to be alone, but I really value my alone time now. That happens as you grow up, you cherish the time when you can just sit by yourself...I've learned to love myself.' And the optimistic starlet remains positive she can turn her life around. When Leno asked where she sees herself when she turns 30 -- six years from now. She replied: 'Hopefully, sitting here after winning an Oscar.' According to Radaronline.com, Lohan will be serving her 360-hour court-ordered community service at the Downtown Women's Center in Los Angeles. Off the the studio: Lindsay leaving her home in Venice, California, yesterday afternoon . The group's CEO, Lisa Watson said: 'The DWC is a life changing . experience for all who walk through our doors. DWC hopes that Miss Lohan . is inspired by her experience here.' The 24-year-old also talked about playing the wife of John Gotti Jr. in the crime family movie, Gotti: Three Generations. The Gotti film's production company, Fiore Films, has stood by its . decision to hire Lindsay, 24, who has been cast to play Kim Gotti, the . daughter-in-law of The Teflon Don the late John Gotti. 'She has been cast in this role. She still has the role and we're very excited about her being in the movie,' he said. Honig refused to discuss how long the movie producers were willing to wait for Lindsay to sort her legal woes. 'We're not going to speculate on ""What if this happens, what if that happens"",' he said. 'We're dealing with a few unknowns. Once we start understanding exactly what the situation is, that's when we can start making some decisions.' The film is meant to begin filming in September or October in New York and also stars John Travolta and Joe Pesci. The actress is currently on bail after spending five hours in the Lynwood Correctional Facility on Friday following the preliminary hearing into her alleged theft of a $2,500 necklace. Lohan will be appealing the sentence, although legal experts say it is unlikely she will win it. Producer Nathan Folks, a friend of Lindsay's, told People.com that she is 'upset' over the 120 days jail she has been sentenced to. 'She is angry because she has been working so hard on turning her life around,' Folks said, insisting Lohan is clean and sober. A Los Angeles judge sentenced Lindsay to 120 days for violating her . probation by taking a designer necklace, a charge the judge reduced from . felony grand theft to a misdemeanour. The actress's lawyers appealed the jail sentence, Lindsay's fourth, and she was freed on bond after a few hours behind bars. Lohan had another brush with the law today - after being slapped with a parking ticket. The actress was given a $64 fine after leaving her car parked outside her house in Venice, California, during street cleaning hours.

"If you feel like you spend more time at the airport each year, that is because you do. British air passengers suffered increased delays on flights last summer and families heading to Orlando in Florida endured the longest hold-ups. The number of charter flights into and out of major UK airports that were on time dipped from 79 per cent in summer 2013 to 71 per cent in summer 2014, according to new statistics from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

"Liu Fei loves devouring live snakes - especially through his nose. Born in the Jiangxi mountains in China, the serpent swallower learned the nausea-inducing skill following being accidentally bitten by a snake as a child. And today, he's a 'snake master,' worshiped by many community members. Liu Fei, a man born in the Jiangxi mountains in China, practices the art of serpent swallowing . In the video, which is only suitable for those with a strong stomach, the man begins by taking out a white rubbish bag filled to the top with slithering snakes. After removing two of them, Fei demonstrates how to insert the serpents into his nose - and pull them out through his mouth. For his second stunt, he swallowed a snake whole, before pulling it back out of his throat.

In the video, which is not for the faint of heart, Fei also demonstrates swallowing the snake whole . Fei's fascination with snakes began after being bitten by one as a child - and meeting a local snake expert . Fei has long been fascinated by snakes, after growing up in the mountains where spotting the animals was quite common. When he was 12-years-old, he was playing outside when he was accidentally bitten by a snake in the grass - without being aware of what it was! After going home and showing his parents, the young boy was invited to meet a local snake expert to learn more about how to treat such a bite - and thus inspired his lifelong interest.","Liu Fei, of Jiangxi, China, demonstrates how to swallow live snakes .

"Had he spoken aloud, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey could be forgiven for speaking before thinking, but when it comes to the written word mistakes are harder to excuse. Morey was asked over Twitter earlier this week about whether having a job in basketball made him sick of watching it. It was all part of a question and answer session, but he has since admitted his response was 'tasteless'. Mad Dash: Rockets General Manager equated his job to that of a gynecologist . The exchange: Rockets general manager Daryl Morey said that a tweet that he sent on Wednesday using a gynecologist joke was 'in bad taste' 'No, it is like being a gynecologist, you don't get sick of it', he tweeted. During an interview on Friday he addressed the backlash to his witless comment. 'I had a tweet that was in bad taste,' Morey said. 'I'm going to leave the comedy to the professionals. I think I'm going to stick with my GM job.' Until now, the Rockets GM was one of the few in the league who are active on Twitter at times. He may well be considering the sense in such a decision now. Sticking by his works? Although he has admitted the joke was in 'bad taste',  Morey has yet to delete the tweet . Morey did not comment when asked if he had been admonished in any way by the NBA for his joke. Brett Pollakoff from NBC Sports said it appeared that although Morey did not offer an apology, he seemed to realize that it was a stupid thing to say. 'I believed it was an unprofessional remark for someone at his level to make while acting as a representative of the organization, and also felt it was a comment that needlessly reinforced a negative stereotype of the existence of an overly-macho culture in men's pro sports,' Pollakoff said.","Although he has admitted the joke was in 'bad taste', Daryl Morey has yet to delete the offending tweet ."
"A woman who repeatedly punched a man in an unprovoked attack boasted about walking free from court – while posting photos on Facebook with her thumbs up. Sophie Sheldon was part of a group of drunk thugs who partially blinded a man in the brutal attack outside a nightclub in Birmingham. CCTV footage shows the 20-year-old leaning over the helpless victim as he lies in agony on the floor, punching him in the face. Her accomplices can also be seen lashing Ismail Bensalaman, 33, in the face with his belt, destroying his eye. Scroll down for video . Sophie Sheldon was spared jail over the 'savage' attack on an Algerian businessman. Within minutes, the 20-year-old posted this photograph of herself giving two thumbs up after walking free (left) Sheldon, 20, was told by a judge the violent attack was out of her character. After being spared jail, she posed in front of Birmingham Crown Court (above) She was handed a suspended sentence of two years and a six-month curfew by Judge Paul Farrer, who said the violent behaviour was not in her character. After she was spared jail this week, Sheldon caused outrage by posting celebratory pictures outside court on Facebook. The young woman also uploaded an image of herself grinning and giving the thumbs-up in a taxi after her sentencing hearing. She updated her Facebook status saying: ‘Guess who’s back again, Sophie’s back so tell your friends. ‘After a long old day glad to be home and put my feet up and have a well-deserved glass of wine.’ Mr Ismail was attacked by Simeon Evans, 30, and Jack Gargham, 26, after he left a nightclub at 6am on January 26 last year. The group began arguing with him over a taxi, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Footage shows Mr Bensalaman trying to run away. He was chased and took off his belt to protect himself, but Evans grabbed it and hit him with it. The tip of the belt caught him in his left eye, leaving it permanently blinded. Gargham also began raining down heavy blows. While the victim was on the ground Sheldon joined in. Savage: Simeon Evans and Jack Gargham were filmed whipping Mr Bensalaman with his belt, hitting him in the face with its buckle and leaving him blind in one eye . Evans, from Bromford, was jailed for four years and six months after pleading guilty to causing GBH with intent. Gargham, from Rubery, was sentenced to four years and five months after being found guilty of the same charge. Sheldon, who works in a beauty salon, was spared jail after the court heard that hours before the attack, her estranged mother had committed suicide after a row with her. The young woman from Gwent, South Wales, who delivered at least four punches and a kick to Mr Bensalaman while wearing high heels, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was given a two-year suspended sentence with a six-month curfew. Sentencing, Judge Paul Farrer said: ‘It is plain you acted out of character against a very particular background. Unwisely, you went to, in effect, drown your sorrows. The violence you used was minimal. ‘You did not intend to cause serious injury ... You are hardworking, have potential and are well thought of. It is very likely you will never offend in the future and that allows me to take an exceptional course.’ Sophie Sheldon (pictured in a black dress, above) was filmed running towards the group and punching Mr Ismal three times in the face . Algerian Ismail Bensalaman (pictured) has permanently lost sight in his left eye as a result of the attack . Her victim however said her Facebook posts suggested she felt no remorse, adding he did not understand the British justice system 'at all'. Yesterday, Mr Ismail, from Sparkbrook in Birmingham, said: ‘She is not even human. She has shown no remorse. 'How would she feel if this happened to her, or to somebody she cared about? 'I thought I was going to die. It was absolutely terrifying. These people showed no mercy. 'They were so aggressive. I am totally depressed. I can’t work and I can’t drive.’ The 33-year-old continued, 'She was the one who was causing all of the trouble in the first place and she has not even gone to jail. 'I do not understand this British justice system at all. 'I am pleased the men have been jailed, but I would have liked them to have been given more years in prison. 'No amount of time in prison or compensation could ever replace my eye. It has changed me forever.' 'No remorse': Mr Bensalaman said 20-year-old Sheldon was 'not human' after posting the celebratory messages . Simeon Evans (left) and Jack Gargham (right) were both convicted of grievous bodily harm and jailed . Mr Ismail, who has been in the UK for five years, has already had five operations and is due to undergo a sixth operation at the end of January. His brother Ahmani Adlane Bensalaman, 40, from Liverpool added: 'He is a completely different person now. 'My brother used to work with me at a shop in Liverpool and I am doing my best to support him, but it is very difficult for him. 'They attacked him from behind and continued to assault him as he lay on the floor trying to defend himself. 'They are brainless and they are cowards.' Following yesterday's sentencing, Detective Constable Chris Smith of West Midlands Police said the attack had been 'mindless' and 'savage'. 'The amount of mindless violence that was inflicted was totally over the top and was definitely fuelled by alcohol,' he said. 'The victim has had to go through an extensive amount of medical treatment including surgery. 'After an initial operation on his eye he needed further surgery and in March was told that he had lost the sight in his left eye permanently. 'He is still coming to terms with his injuries and has told me that he feels his life is over, and there’s no opportunity left to him. 'We accept yesterday’s decision and hope that the jail sentence brings some comfort to the victim.'","Sophie Sheldon was spared jail over 'savage' attack during night out .

"Dining out at the fanciest restaurants can be a costly affair but what if you could conjure up a restaurant worthy meal for your whole family in the comfort of your kitchen for under £10? Celebrity chef Jimmy Garcia is convinced you can - and his shared his top tips and recipe ideas for foodie fans. Cooking on This Morning today, Jimmy showed viewers how to prepare and cook his honey and mustard pork with winter vegetable salad and chocolate orange mousse for a family of four for under a tenner...and he'll even give you change. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Jimmy Garcia is convinced you can feed a family of four two courses for £9.58 - and he promises the meals are of restaurant quality . Jimmy explains that post-Christmas blues and long dark days can leave us all longing for a treat, such as his 'gorgeous pork'. 'Pork is such a cheap meat but it's really in vogue and you'll find it in all the cool gastro pubs.' According to Jimmy, the costings are specific to the measurements used in the recipe and have been calculated using prices taken from mysupermarket.co.uk (as of 16 January, 2015) or via the supermarkets direct (Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Morrisons). Where prices differ across supermarkets for the same ingredient an average cost was apparently used. Jimmy whizzes up a honey and mustard pork dish with winter vegetable salad, he says will feed four . Honey and mustard pork with winter vegetable salad (Serves 4) Ingredients . For the Pork Belly: . 2 tbsp honey . 1 tbsp Dijon mustard . 1 tbsp apricot jam . 800g pork belly . 3 onions, cut in half . 1 whole carrot, roughly chopped into large chunks . Jimmy explains that post-Christmas blues and long dark days can leave us all longing for a treat, such as his 'gorgeous pork' 1 celery stick, roughly chopped into large chunks . 3 dried apricots . 1 cup water . Salt and black pepper . Juice and zest of 1 orange, (reserve the zest for the chocolate mousse) 2 Pears, peeled and sliced . Splash of vinegar . 1 tsp cornflour (optional) For the winter vegetable salad . 2 pears . 1 bag of salad, whichever variety you prefer . 1 carrot, cut in to ribbons with a vegetable peeler . 1 cooked beetroot, cut into chunky cubes . 1 sweet potato peeled and cut into chunks . ½ bag radishes – approximately 7 cut in half . Method . Preheat the oven to 180C for 2 ½ hours . For the pork belly, take a bowl and mix the honey, mustard and apricot jam together and pour over the pork belly. Marinate the pork belly in the honey mix for as long as possible - two hours will do - then wrap in cling film and place in the fridge for better results. Put all the vegetables in the bottom of the roasting tray, place the pork belly on top of the vegetables and add water until it almost touches the bottom of the meat. Place in the oven at 180C for about 2 ½ hours. Place the sweet potato onto a tray and drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper and bake for about 20 minutes at 180C. Put to one side for the salad. After 2 ½ hours, remove the lid and place the pork onto a tray and back into the oven. Turn up the heat to 230C and cook for a further 30 minutes to get a lovely crispy crackling. Meanwhile make the sauce vinaigrette by removing all the juices from the roasting tray and skimming off the fat. A good way of doing this is by placing the liquid into a tupperware and then into the freezer for about 15-20 minutes – this will allow the fat to freeze and it will mean that you can scrape the fat easily from the top leaving you with the base for your sauce. Place the liquid into a saucepan and add the juice of the orange and a splash of vinegar if you have some. Add the sliced pears to the liquor and allow it to reduce over a medium heat for about 20 minutes. Once the pears are soft remove from the sauce and add a little corn flour to thicken if necessary. For the salad, place the leaves onto a serving plate and scatter over the carrot, beetroot, sweet potato, sliced pears and radish before drizzling over a little of the sauce. For pudding Jimmy whips up a chocolate orange mousse and says you can add chocloate you have lying around your cupboards to the top . Jimmy Garcia's chocolate orange mousse . Ingredients . 4 eggs . 1 bar dark chocolate (approx. 100g -112g) Zest of 1 orange . Method . Separate the eggs into two bowls. Take the egg whites and set the electric whisk to a slow speed and whisk until foamy - you are looking for soft peaks or until they have roughly reached twice their volume. Melt the chocolate over a Bain Marie – a bowl placed over a saucepan with boiling water. Make sure the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Once the chocolate has melted remove the bowl from the Bain Marie and add the egg yolks and combine. Gently fold the melted chocolate in to the egg whites and combine together. Stir through the orange zest and then place the mixture into a glass or ramekin to set for approximately 2 hours or overnight if you can.","Celebrity chef Jimmy Garcia is convinced you can feed family for £9.58 .

"President Barack Obama is preparing the crack the whip at Republicans in Congress, telling a gathering of Democratic lawmakers in Baltimore that 'I'm going to play offense' during his final years in office. With the GOP in control of both the House and Senate, the president could easily become a lame duck with little impact. But he now seems intent on not letting grass grow beneath his feet. In a closed-door session with Senate Democrats, he insisted that he won't go out quietly but will stand tough against his adversaries who are gearing up to cancel his ambitious immigration agenda – which they say is an unconstitutional power-grab – and to push a host of other legislation down his throat. He's not planning to swallow it: 'I'm not going to spend the next two years on defense; I'm going to play offense,' Obama said, according to two meeting attendees who spoke to Politico. COOL, CALM AND COLLECTED: President Barack Obama strolled last night with British Prime Minister David Cameron (left) outside the White House, caring little about GOP bills slated to hit his desk . LOYAL OPPOSITION: House Speaker John Boehner (left) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (center) will serve up a steady diet of crow to Obama and prepare themselves to have it shoved back across the table . An aide to a conservative Republican senator fired back on Friday, telling DailyMail.com that if Obama wants a fight he's come to the right place. 'These last two years are going to go down as a collection of historic moments when we stood up to a bully and he blinked,' the staffer said. 'Just you wait.' He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly. 'We're going to pass Keystone,' he said, referring to the controversial Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline. 'Then we're going to hammer Iran with new sanctions. We might even block him from closing Guantanamo.' 'At the end of the day, if the president wants to veto those and a half-dozen other things, he's welcome to go down in history as the worst president since Herbert Hoover.' Those half-dozen other things will likely include changes to a key section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul in a way that would help banks. Obama has been loathe to uncap his veto pen, but the White House has threatened to do it on five separate measures since Congress convened last week. The Iran legislation could prove politically costly for Obama to obstruct. It's being drafted by Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Democrat Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and will include tough new economic penalties against the Islamic state. The White House is concerned that provoking Tehran could upend delicate negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions, and jeopardize the lives of four Americans being held there. The latest of several deadlines for the nuclear deal to be inked is June 30. FIRST SHOWDOWN: Republicans think they could collect enough votes in the Senate to override a presidential veto of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project, which protesters on the left vehemently oppose . DELICATE: The White House is afraid new sanctions against Iran will upset nuclear talks between Secretary of State John Kerry (right) and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif . Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told an audience in Louisville, Kentucky this week that 'we in the administration believe that, at this time, increasing sanctions would dramatically undermine our efforts to reach this shared goal' – referring to the aim of trimming back Iran's nuclear capabilities. These measures, and another changing the definition of a full-time work week under the Obamacare law from 30 hours to 40, have enough support in both houses of Congress to pass, but likely lack the more robust supermajorities needed to override a veto from the president. The Keystone XL pipeline is thought to have the greatest potential to reach that critical mass, however, which is why Republicans have teed it up first. Former Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, pushed hard for it in October and November as a way to curry favor and avoid electoral defeat in her energy-economy-rich state. That led several Democrats to side with her, declaring their allegiance to the project. 'When Landrieu pushed for Keystone, the game changed,' the Senate aide said Friday. 'Now it's easy to reach 60 votes in the Senate, so there's going to be a floor vote.' 'We're maybe three votes away from having enough to squash a veto. If that happens, it's going to be the mother of all brushback pitches and make Obama think twice about vetoing the next one. And the next. And the one after that.'","GOP plans to deliver a series of bills to the White House, starting with the Keystone XL pipeline and hoping to override an Obama veto .
They're 'three votes away' in the Senate from being able to override that veto, a move that a Senate aide called 'the mother of all brushback pitches'

"A 'high risk' convicted sex offender who has been accused of assaulting an 11-year-old boy at a synagogue has fled to Isarel. Former bar mitzvah tutor Yona Weinberg, 36, from Brooklyn, New York, who was convicted of molesting two 13-year-old boys in 2009, is said to have pushed the youngster against a shelf of prayer books in August. The alleged altercation came two months after the same boy reportedly told police he had been force to touch Weinberg's shirt and pants. Police arrived at the home of the licensed social worker to arrest him - but discovered he had skipped the country when his wife said he wasn't there, according to the New York Daily News. Fled: Former bar mitzvah tutor Yona Weinberg, 36, from Brooklyn, New York, who was convicted of molesting two 13-year-old boys in 2009, is said to have pushed the youngster against a shelf of prayer books in August. His two most recent mugshots are left (2014) and right (2013) The licensed social worker is believed to be residing in Har Nof, a hillside community in Jerusalem (file picture). Residents there have been warned of the 'high risk' sex offender's presence . However, as he has only been charged with a misdemeanor offence, prosecutors will not be able to have him extradited. Weinberg is a Level 3 sex offender and is required to check in with police every 90 days and verify his address. It is regarded as a felony if he fails to do so. In 2009 he was sentenced to 13 months in prison after he was convicted of molesting two 13-year-old boys. Child advocates in the Jewish Community are now furious he has managed to evade the charges and have accused District Attorney Kevin Thompson of taking too long to act. Chaim Levin told the Daily News: 'He’s making all of us who really campaigned hard for him look like fools. 'He seems to be playing politics. The outcome of this case is disgusting.' Lupe Todd, Thompson's spokesman, told the paper: 'In the event that he returns to New York, he will be charged. Weinberg has reportedly been telling his neighbors in the scenic hillside community of Har Nof in Jerusalem that the accusations are a big mistake. Child protection agency Magen, which is based in Israel, sent out a press release warning residents of his presence.

Weinberg is a registered sex offender under the New York State Sex Offender Registration Act. 'Weinberg is assessed by the NY Criminal Justice Services as Risk Level 3, which is the highest level and means: “high risk of repeat offense and a threat to public safety exists”. 'Weinberg is reliably reported to have left the USA in recent months after further similar complaints were filed against him with NYPD. 'Weinberg, to the best of our knowledge, currently resides with his wife and family in Har Nof, Jerusalem. The Israeli authorities are aware of the situation.' 'The public is urged to be vigilant and take appropriate measures to protect and educate their children, calmly and in a manner appropriate to their age.

"The new lead in the Broadway production of The Phantom Of The Opera has caused outrage after it emerged he has previously been convicted of child sex offenses. The show announced this week that 48-year-old James Barbour would take over the role of Phantom starting in February in New York. The announcement drew criticism that it was inappropriate for the long-running musical to hire someone whose past includes sex offenses involving a teenage girl 14 years ago. James Barbour enters Manhattan criminal court in December, 2006. The Phantom Of The Opera on Broadway announced this week that 48-year-old James Barbour would take over the Phantom role starting in February .

"Bill Cosby's attorney claims that the comedian was not at the Playboy Mansion on the night a model accused him of drugging and sexually abusing her. Cosby was in New York on the night that model Chloe Goins claims the comedian drugged and accosted her in a bedroom of the mansion, attorney Martin D. Singer wrote in a statement. Singer said he would present evidence to authorities detailing Cosby's whereabouts before, during and after the Playboy Mansion event. Chloe Goins (above) claims Bill Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 . Bill Cosby performs at the Stand Up for Heroes event at Madison Square Garden, in New York in 2013 . Goins met with Los Angeles police detectives on Wednesday and her attorney said the incident took place during an event in August 2008. While many of the abuse claims leveled against Cosby fall outside civil and criminal statutes of limitations, Goins' allegations may fall within the time period that Cosby could be charged. Goins' attorney Spencer Kuvin said Wednesday that the alleged abuse occurred during an event called Midsummer's Night Dream Party on Aug. 9, 2008, at the mansion. Goins does not know what happened while she was blacked out but Kuvin has said she awoke to find herself naked and Cosby over her. 'Mr. Cosby was in New York on that date,' Singer wrote. 'We will be providing documentary evidence to the appropriate authorities which conclusively establishes Mr. Cosby's whereabouts on August 9th and for the preceding and succeeding days.' In response to Singer's statement, Kuvin questioned whether Cosby was at the mansion that summer. 'We look forward to seeing this alleged proof,' Kuvin wrote in an email. Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer (right, with with Deena Singer and Priscilla Presley) says he has proof Cosby was in NYC . Los Angeles prosecutors will make the final determination on whether Cosby will face criminal charges based on Goins' allegations. Goins is at least the second woman to meet with Los Angeles police detectives to recount accusations against Cosby. Prosecutors rejected filing charges against Cosby based on allegations by Judy Huth, a Riverside County resident who is suing the comedian, alleging he abused her in the early 1970s when she was 15 years old. Huth's lawsuit states the abuse happened at the Playboy Mansion. More than 15 women have accused Cosby of drugging them and sexual abuse, which has led to the cancellation of the comedian's projects at NBC and Netflix. He continues to perform stand-up comedy shows and has two performances scheduled for Saturday in Denver. Singer has denied some but not all of the allegations against Cosby, and the comedian joked about the scandal at a recent show in Canada. On Friday, NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt closed the door on the network collaborating with Cosby on any future projects, noting the number of accusers who have come forward. Although none of the accusations against Cosby have been proven in court, Greenblatt said, ""when that many people come out and have such similar complaints, it became a tainted situation"" and the network didn't want to proceed with a new sitcom featuring the comedian. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby had done the same to them. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of Constand's 13 Jane Does. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby invited her to Lake Tahoe to talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Therese Serignese - Another of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he forced her into oral sex backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she complied. Linda Joy Traitz - She said she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims. Beth Ferrier - Ferrier claims she had a relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for a 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner. Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties. Michelle Hurd -The 47-year-old actress, known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. She says he asked her to go to his house to take a shower so he could blow dry her hair straight, but she decided not to go. P.J. Masten - The former Playboy bunny claims Cosby invited her out to dinner in Chicago. Before they left he gave her a drink and the next thing she remembers is waking up naked and bruised in his bed. Masten claims she knows of 12 other former bunnies who were attacked by Cosby but have not yet come forward. Joyce Emmons -The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her a Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault. Lachele Covington - The 20-year-old actress, who'd been an extra on the TV show Cosby, filed a police report in March 2000 against the star, accusing him of making an unwelcome sexual advance. According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed. Shawn Brown - The only woman that Cosby admits cheating with claims that after a two-month relationship, Cosby drugged a drink and urged her to down it. He then raped her while she was unconscious and got her pregnant, she says. Paige Young - Young shot herself dead in 1974 aged 30. She had had an affair with Cosby shortly before her death. In a suicide note she said that many Hollywood stars had used her and spat her out. Judy Huth - Huth claims Cosby raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974 when she was just 15 . Chelan Lasha - Lasha was an aspiring model in 1986 when she says Cosby gave her two shots of Amaretto and a pill and then attacked her as she lay on his bed in the Elvis Presley suite at the Hilton Las Vegas. Beverley Johnson - The first black woman to be on the cover of American Vogue said Cosby made a drugged cappuccino for her when she visited his New York brownstone to read through lines for a small part in the Cosby Show. As she felt her body go limp she shouted at Cosby: 'You are a motherf***** aren't you?' Angry, Cosby dragged her downstairs and dumped her in a taxi. Chloe Goins - This 24-year-old model claims Cosby spiked her drink with a sedative before luring her into a room and launching an attack on her in 2008.","Chloe Goins went to an LA police station to tell detectives how Bill Cosby attacked her in 2008 at the Playboy Mansion earlier this week .

"Lots of girls want to emulate their glamorous mothers but for Amy Hoskins, following in her parent's footsteps led to disaster. Amy, 22, from Dorking, wanted to look like her mother, Katie, after she had a boob job that boosted both her cleavage and her confidence. Care worker Amy said: 'I wanted to be more confident, my mum has hers done and they looked really good.' Scroll down for video . Amy's implants started to move and her breasts started becoming saggy and lopsided . Amy, 22, (right) from Dorking, wanted to look like her mother, Katie, after she had a boob job . With her mother's support, they sought a surgeon to increase Amy's cup size to a 32G. 'She did say the bigger, the better,' said Katie, speaking to Channel 5 show Botched Up Bodies who feature Amy's story in their fourth series. At first, Amy was happy with her new look but then the implants started to move. Amy's breasts started becoming saggy and lopsided while her areolas increased in size. She recalled: 'I noticed my aerolas started stretching, it got so big I started measuring it - it was as big as a digestive biscuit. 'Then the implant started flipping over, sticking out and moving.' Amy went back to the original surgeon who said he could correct the damage - but that it would cost her. As she couldn't afford it, Amy had to learn to live with her deformed breasts. She said this had a huge impact on her self-confidence and her relationship with both her boyfriend and her mother. But she recalls that her aerolas started stretching, and got to the size of a digestive biscuit . She couldn't afford to pay to correct the damage and had to learn to live with her deformed breasts . 'With my boyfriend, I don't like getting them out, we're not very intimate,' she said. 'I know they are disgusting, I can't wear anything, I'm embarrassed to get my body out to my boyfriend as he'll probably think I'm a freak.' She added: 'I get jealous of my mum all the time because she's got what I wanted. I feel embarrassed to bring my boyfriend round here because I know she will be there with hers.' Katie said the situation made her feel upset too. 'It is horrible for me looking at Amy knowing she wanted to be like her mum. She was never insecure before and now she is most insecure person you will ever meet,' she said. On Botched Up Bodies, Amy is sent to meet plastic surgery Patrick Mallucci in London who agrees to see if he can repair the damage done by her first boob job. After examining her, he said: 'I agree these have dropped, they are lying very low effectively taking part of your midriff when they should be higher.' On Botched Up Bodies, Amy meets a plastic surgeon who agrees to repair the damage . Her breasts were smaller and more pert after the surgery and her aerolas were back to normal . He told her that if she wanted to keep an implant, it would need to be much smaller and she could also be left with some scarring. He said: 'On Amy's petite frame, 32G breasts were fairly ridiculous and smaller neater ones will be much better for her.' Dr Mallucci operated on Amy at Weymouth Hospital and she was delighted by the end result. Her breasts were smaller and more pert after the surgery and her aerolas were back to normal size. 'They look amazing, I'm really gratetful for what Patrick's done,' she said. .Now I have a pair of boobs similar to my mums and that's what I always wanted.'

"A whisleblowing paramedic who spoke out about the chaos his local A&E departments has been banned from both hospitals. Stuart Gardner, of West Midlands Ambulance Service, was reprimanded after saying under-pressure emergency units were 'not safe'. He has since been told he is not welcome at hospitals in Worcester and Redditch. The comments were made by the paramedic of 26 years during an interview with the BBC. During it, he described how even before the winter pressures, patients were routinely treated in corridors at the Worcester Royal Hospital. Banned: Stuart Gardner, of West Midlands Ambulance Service, was reprimanded after saying under-pressure emergency units were 'not safe' In fact, the practice was so commonplace that 'there were labels along the corridor of the emergency department so staff could find the patients'. 'Last Friday, there were 18 trolleys with sick patients,' he said. 'There were ECGs being done, stitches, cannulas (a medical tube inserted into the body with a needle) - staff were doing everything in the corridor. 'I've never seen anything like it - and I do not believe it's safe. it's not good for the patients and their care is being jeapordised.' Since then, however, Mr Gardner claims he was told he was 'not welcome' at either the Worcester hospital or the Redditch Alexandra Hospital. The trust told the  BBC it is under extreme pressure - and patients are being treated on trolleys to prevent them from being treated in ambulances. It added the ban had been imposed as Mr Gardner's comments had upset staff. In a statement, Stewart Messer, Chief Operating Officer at Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We would like to make clear that our conversations with Mr Gardner and his representatives about his presence at our hospital are related to personal upset he has caused among some of our A&E staff in relation to the interpretation of some of his comments. 'Whistleblowing is positively encouraged and promoted within our organisation and we take any concerns about our quality of care very seriously from anyone who wishes to raise them. 'Our A&E staff are proud to have a very positive working relationship with the paramedics who visit our sites... it is critical to preserve relationships with the ambulance service – especially at this crucial time - in order to ensure the safety of patients in our care. He added: 'In response to this isolated incident, we have suggested it would be appropriate for Mr Gardner to address the upset he has caused among A&E staff who are working tirelessly under what has been – and continues to be - extreme pressure. 'We hope that Mr Gardner and his Unison colleagues will work with us on this to reach an amicable outcome.' But a spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Trust told MailOnline that Mr Gardner was working and being deployed as normal. Frantic: During the TV interview, he described how even before the winter pressures, patients were routinely treated in corridors at the Worcester Royal Hospital (pictured) 'This is an issue between the union and the hospital,' he said. A spokesman for the hospital trust admitted he was 'not fully aware' of what had been decided. Ravi Subramanian, UNISON's West Midlands Regional Secretary, said rather than dealing with the problems facing A&E departments the Trust had chosen to personally attack one of their members. 'Our rep Mr Gardner is clearly acting in the public interest in whistle blowing about serious concerns about A&E. The response from the Trust's Chief Operating Officer, Mr Messer is nothing short of an utter disgrace,' he said. 'By banning Mr Gardner from the Trust premises Mr Messer is putting patients' lives at risk. 'What happens if Mr Gardner is on a 999 call in the area and the best place to take patient is to Worcestershire Royal Hospital. 'Is the chief operating officer saying that Mr Gardner will be turned away, and will have to take the patient to a hospital further away, thus endangering patient safety? 'The public knows that front-line NHS workers are working flat out to deal excess workload in A&E.'","Stuart Gardner, West Midlands Ambulance Service, gave interview to BBC .

"The number of patients spending more than four hours at accident and emergency departments in Wales has risen to the highest level in five years. Nearly a fifth of all people arriving at A&E are facing waits in excess of the gold standard, four hours, as winter pressures continue their grip on the NHS. During the busiest December the health service has seen in five years, 81 per cent of patients were assessed, treated and then admitted or discharged within  within four hours of arriving at A&E. Ministers, who have pledged to spend an extra £40 million to help the NHS deal with the surge in demand, blamed an increase in admissions. Nearly a fifth of patients  at A&E are facing waits in excess of four hours as winter pressures grip the NHS in Wales with ambulances left queuing outside deparments, including that at University Hospital in Cardiff . Opposition parties have been fiercely critical of the new data - claiming it was further proof of the Welsh Labour administration in Cardiff Bay's poor record on health. The deputy minister for health, Vaughan Gething, praised the work of NHS staff during a period of immense pressure, with 76,889 people visiting emergency departments across the country. But the figures laid bare the challenges facing the health service, with 2,490 people waiting longer than 12 hours to be seen. The number of people attending A&Es in December was up 2.5 per cent on December 2013. And it marked the highest number of attendances per day in any December since 2009. Mr Gething said: 'These figures show eight out of 10 people who went to A&E were assessed, treated and then admitted or discharged in less than four hours during December. 'While different reporting mechanisms make it difficult to make direct comparisons with other parts of the UK, it is clear all health services are experiencing significant pressures. 'I would like to thank everyone within the Welsh NHS for their unrelenting commitment to patient care during this difficult period. 'We have announced an extra £40 million to help the NHS deal with winter pressures. 'This means we have invested a further quarter of a billion pounds in the Welsh NHS in 2014-15 to continue to deliver high-quality, sustainable health services.' The best-performing A&E department was Bronglais in Aberystwyth, with 90.7 per cent of people seen within the four hour target window. Wrexham's Maelor hospital had the lowest figure at 65.6 per cent. The news comes in the same week a senior Welsh nurse described the pressure on A&E staff as more stressful than treating soldiers on the front line in Iraq. Welsh ministers have pledged an extra £40 million to ease the pressures but Conservative politicians in opposition have said the move is 'too little too late' The Welsh Conservatives, the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly, said Labour ministers needed to set out swift and detailed plans to turn the situation around. Shadow health minister Darren Millar said: 'December's atrocious performance is among the worst since current records began and it confirms that patients and staff are paying a high price for Labour's record-breaking cuts to the NHS budget. A senior nurse working in A&E at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff gave a brutal account of life on the front line of the NHS. Having treated injured soldiers during the second Iraq war in 2003, the nurse, who was not named, claimed the pressure staff are facing in A&E at the moment is worse than that in a warzone. Extracts from her three-page account of one shift, which was pinned to a staff noticeboard in the hospital and leaked to the press, reads: . 'Arrived at 7pm to a department of 60 patients, 43 to be seen. Most areas of A&E are full and no beds allocated. 'There were five ambulances outside with 15 presented majors patients to be triaged. Throughout the night we had 125 patients through, on top of the 60 to begin with. 'Young pregnant woman was bleeding heavily. On walking into the triage room, she miscarried . on the floor and passed the foetus at the feet of the triage nurse. 'We had nowhere private to take her and had to pick up everything from the floor in front of her and scoop it into a pot.' 'Arrival of ambulance crews was relentless overnight and we had multiple offload delays. 'In order to avert long delays, I had to think about what patient I could offload and what . patient absolutely needed to stay on a truck and have continual monitoring.' 'The existing targets have not been met in well over five years and lie significantly behind performance in England. 'This week's announcement of £40 million to support winter pressures in Wales was too little and too late. 'Another NHS bailout at the 11th hour does not allow Health Boards to plan properly for effective spending and it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the frontline in the current bleak mid-winter.' Plaid Cymru AM Elin Jones countered Welsh Government suggestions the latest failure to meet A&E target times were because of an increase. She said: 'Demand for services has been within a consistent margin for many years. 'It is clear therefore the failure to meet these targets is not down to the number of people coming through the door, but indicative of a deeper problem that lies in the flow of patients through hospital.' Ms Jones added a major recruitment drive for more doctors was desperately needed. Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said: 'Anyone who read the letter from the A&E nurse, who compared working in a Welsh A&E to working in a war zone, would be moved by the dedication and commitment of our NHS staff. 'However, they are being held back by the Welsh Labour Government. 'What is clear to me is that the NHS is too big an issue to be left to one party. What we need is a cross-party and no-party commission, working with health professionals and patients, to look into the future of our NHS and how it can meet the severe challenges it faces in the future.' The NHS in England has the same 95 per cent target as Wales but its figures are published weekly during winter. Today the figures covering the week until January 11 revealed 89.8 per cent of people were seen within four hours across England.","81% of patients were seen within four hours at A&Es in Wales in December .

Speaking in the February issue of Good Housekeeping, on which she features as this month's cover star, the 35-year-old revealed that her beloved mom passed away on the same day as her sitcom, The Mindy Project, was officially picked up for broadcast on US TV network Fox. 'I'm not superstitious,' Mindy says of the bittersweet memory. 'But I think my mom had some part in it.' Mindy, whose real name is Vera Mindy Chokalingam, describes her mother as her 'soulmate' and admits she still can't speak about her without breaking down in tears. Scroll down for video . 'We're hungry and ambitious people': Sitcom star Mindy Kaling inherited her unwavering determination from her parents . But while she continues to miss her every single day, Mindy credits her mom with instilling in her an unwavering sense of determination and ambition, which she believes has helped her to carve out such a successful career for herself. 'She was very busy, and she did not suffer fools,' the sitcom star explains. 'Her no-nonsense attitude is the single best thing I got from her. We're hungry, ambitious people. It's a family trait.' Indeed, Mindy's eponymous title character in her hit series is, she reveals, loosely based on her mother, who was also an ob-gyn. Mindy admits that her self confidence and outspoken nature were not always so apparent however. As a child, she recalls being incredibly shy and quiet, 'worried all the time' about what other people would think of her. All of that changed when she watched her first episode of Late Night With Conan O'Brien, and became quickly 'obsessed' with the charismatic TV host, staying up late night after night in order to watch his show. Size matters: The 32-year-old is often held up as a role model for 'curvy' women but admits that she doesn't want her weight to be the most important thing in her life . 'Even then, I knew I wanted to be part of that world,' she adds. 'I always thought I was funny before anyone told me I was funny.' Mindy's first big break came just a few years after she graduated from Dartmouth College, when she was offered an opportunity to write for popular comedy series The Office. She was the only woman working on the team. But, while her natural flair for writing and unparalleled comedic timing helped to initially launch what is now an incredibly successful career, her rise to the top of the TV industry hasn't been at all easy - and regularly sees Mindy working an 80-hour week. Her rigorous working schedule was, at least initially, a welcome distraction from thinking about the loss of her mother however, and ensured that Mindy cemented her name as one of the industry's most successful stars. Life in the spotlight has brought with it a few hard lessons however; Mindy is often held up as a role model for 'curvy' women and, as a result, her size and weight are often subjected to a fierce amount of public scrutiny. Screen star: Mindy writes, directs and acts in her own sitcom, The Mindy Project . The size 8 star admits that she think it is important for women to talk openly about the issues surrounding body image, but is quick to assert that size and weight should be the most important thing in anyone's life - least of all hers. 'I don't think of myself as overweight,' she explains. 'I definitely get hurt when people say mean things about my body. But it's not the most important thing in my life.' Unsurprisingly, Mindy's love life has also been a topic of much interest and intrigue; there has been much speculation recently that the screenwriter had reunited with her ex-boyfriend - and former Office co-writer - BJ Novak, but Mindy insists that the reports are nothing more than rumors and insists that she doesn't really have the time to focus on relationships and marriage. For now, her focus remains on her career. 'I'd love to direct a romantic comedy someday,' she says. 'There's still so much I want to do. I feel lucky. I keep expanding my dreams.'","The 35-year-old sitcom star's mom died in January 2012, eight months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .

"The man who completed the world’s most difficult climb this week, came up with the idea for the feat to move on from the ‘deep pain’ of divorcing his first wife. Dailymail.com can reveal that Tommy Caldwell decided to scale the 3,000ft El Capitan in Yosemite National Park to ‘escape’ from the agony of splitting with Beth Rodden, a fellow climber and his teenage sweetheart. Caldwell did not think he could do it but after meeting the woman who would become his second wife he fell in love again and decided that it ‘just might be possible.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Celebration: Tommy Caldwell at the top of El Capitan's Dawn Wall with his second wife, Rebecca Pietsch. She revealed that the split from his first wife had inspired his climb . Tommy Caldwell and his ex-wife Beth Rodden pose for a photo during an interview  in 2002 about their harrowing experience as captives in Kyrgyzstan two years previously . New love: Tommy Caldwell and his second wife Rebecca, and their son Fitz. Rebecca says he was inspired to climb El Capitan to get over the pain of his first marriage ending . This week, eight years after he initially had the idea, Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson became the first people ever to climb El Capitan’s Dawn Wall using just their hands and feet. The pair endured split fingertips, holes in their hands and had the skin ripped off their digits so many times they had to get up every four hours in the night to apply balm. In interviews afterwards Caldwell, 36, said that he wanted to ‘explore the limits of what was possible’ and that it drove him for several years. But in reality the driving force was the pain of breaking up with his teenage sweetheart, according to his second wife, photographer Rebecca Pietsch, 29. On their shared blog she wrote: ‘I can't even begin to understand and explain what has all led up to this moment. ‘The Dawn Wall started out as a little bit of an escape from a deep pain Tommy felt from the sadness of splitting up with his former wife. ‘He deemed the wall impossible to free climb. ‘He came back to it a year later, and with the excitement of a budding relationship between us decided that The Dawn Wall just might be possible. ‘Our relationship began with this route, and The Dawn Wall has weaved its way through our lives together over the past 6 years.’ Caldwell and Rodden, 34, were seen as the perfect All-American climbing couple while they were together. They met at a junior climbing competition in 1995 when they were in their teens and their careers were only just beginning. Their lives revolved around climbing 24 hours a day and they once spent Valentine’s Day scaling Meltdown, an extremely difficult 70-foot crack at Upper Cascade Falls in Yosemite. Another time they spent 18 days rafting along the Grand Canyon in search of climbable rocks. They even had their own website, bethandtommy.com, but it is now inactive. Conquered: The rock formation El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, California. Its Dawn Wall had never been free climbed- until now . Together: Rebecca Pietsch was on hand to greet both climbers at the top of El Capitan when they completed 'the most difficult climb in the world' Rock on: Caldwell and Jorgeson set up camp as they begin their epic climb . Determined: Tommy Caldwell, top, climbs Pitch 17 with Kevin Jorgeson handling the line . In 2000, while he was attempting to scale a sheer face in the Pamir mountains in Kyrgyzstan with Beth and three other climbers, four terrorists from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a group linked to Al Qaeda, began spraying them with bullets. Fearing that they were just seconds from being killed, they abseiled down to the ground. Six days of hell followed as the gunmen moved them from place to place, with little food or water. That ordeal also helped inspire to to accomplish the recent feat. Caldwell and Rodden got married in 2003 by which time she had become the second woman to make a free ascent of El Capitan. She was also part of the first all-female ascent of Madagascar's Tsaranoro Massif in 1999 and soon became established as one of the world’s most successful female climbers. Around the time she and Caldwell split, she suffered debilitating injuries to her shoulder and finger while bouldering in Yosemite. It put her out of climbing for a year and forced her to refocus her life. In an interview with climbing blog Crux Crush she later said: ‘After going through a divorce and almost 4 solid years of injuries during that time, I’ve come to appreciate just being able to go climbing at all. ‘Not being able to use climbing as an outlet and escape was quite difficult and in the end made me appreciate going climbing in any capacity so much more.’ In the same piece she described Caldwell as ‘by far the most influential person in my climbing, hands down’. Caldwell, 36, from Estes Park, Colorado, had started climbing at three and became a national climbing champion at 16. He accidentally sawed off his left index finger and when doctors reattached it and told him he could never climb again, he asked that they remove it once more so he could go back to what he loved doing. Happily remarried: Beth Rodden, Tommy Caldwell's first wife, has married and had a son. She climbed until she was nine months pregnangt . Mountain to climb: Rebecca Pietsch revealed that his determination to climb El Capitan came from Tommy Caldwell dealing with the 'deep pain' of the split from his first wife . National Geographic recently called Caldwell ‘arguably the best all-around rock climber on the planet’. In 2000 while on a trip to Kyrgyzstan's Kara Su Valley Caldwell, Rodden and the group they were with were kidnapped by Islamic militants who held them hostage for six nights. They escaped when Caldwell shoved their guard off a ledge to his death and they climbed 18 miles to freedom. Rodden is now remarried to Randy Puro, 42, also a climber, and lives in Yosemite National Park and Berkeley, California. Last July they had a son, Theo, and Rodden wrote on her blog how she climbed right up until she gave birth. She wrote: ‘If there’s anything I’ve learned over the last year, it’s that all forms are always changing, evolving and growing. ‘It’s the nature of life. Instead of fighting this reality, it’s much better to accept it, even appreciate it. I try to remind myself of this, but it's hard, I can be quite stubborn.’ Caldwell and Pietsch have a son, Fitz, two, and on his Facebook page writes how he is happier than ever. Kevin Jorgeson grips the surface of a razor-sharp edge as he makes his way up the 3000ft El Capitan . People watch as the two climbers ascend the 'Dawn Wall' Last July next to a picture of his wife and baby he wrote: ‘4 years ago today my life was forever changed in the best way possible. Thanks for making every moment feel like magic.’ In one interview he added that his son’s birth ‘has made me much more responsible and intentional because I want to set a good example’. Caldwell and Jorgeson’s ascent of the Dawn Wall, which lasted 19 days and began on December 27, is already being hailed as one of the greatest climbs ever by mankind. The granite rock is smooth as a bedroom wall and the only ledges the men could grab were as sharp as razors and the size of a matchstick. Then there was the sheer height of the rock: El Capitan is the height of three Empire State Buildings stacked on top one another, or 17 Nelson’s Columns. After they reached the summit President Obama Tweeted a picture of El Capitan with the caption that he was ‘so proud’ of the two men as they ‘remind us that anything is possible’. A woman who answered the phone at Rodden’s home in Yosemite National Park told DailyMail.com: ‘Maybe you could try back in a bit,' and hung up.

"By the end of World War One the army had identified 80,000 cases of a new condition they termed as 'shell shock'. Scientists have been perplexed by the symptoms - that include anxiety, facial tics as well as terrible nightmares - ever since but, after more than a century of research, the mystery may have been solved. Experts now believe that a honeycomb pattern of broken nerve fibres in the brains of veterans that survived improvised explosive devices (IED) attacks, is responsible for the condition officially termed as blast neurotrauma. By the end of World War One, the army had identified 80,000 soldiers suffering from shell shock and after 100 years, scientists have now discovered a honeycomb pattern of broken nerve fibres in the brains of veterans that seem to show the brain injury caused by war. British soldiers in the trenches are pictured . Researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, conducted autopsies on US combat veterans who survived blasts in Afghanistan and Iraq, but later died of other causes. They discovered that they had the same kind of brain injury – a distinctive honeycomb pattern of broken and swollen nerve fibres throughout critical brain regions, including those that control decision making, memory and reasoning. The pattern is different from brain damage caused by car crashes, drug overdoses or collision sports. Vassilis Koliatsos, a professor of pathology, neurology, and psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the university, explained that survivable blasts may cause hidden brain injuries that play a role in the psychological and social problems some veterans face after coming home. The scientists explained  that survivable blasts may cause hidden brain injuries that play a role in the psychological and social problems some veterans face after coming home. Here, a soldier breaks down in Iraq after learning his friend was killed, and another (centre) suffers from burns caused by a blast . Millions of soldiers suffered psychological trauma as a result of their war experiences. Symptoms ranged from anxiety and facial tics, to stomach cramps, as well as terrible nightmares and insomnia, as they relived scenes of slaughter. By the end of World War One, the army had dealt with 80,000 cases of shell shock, which was first recognised in 1917. War neuroses accounted for one in seven men discharged from the British Army. At the beginning of the war, scientists believed that the condition was caused by physical injuries to the nerves, but the man who coined the phrase, medical officer Charles Myers, realised that some soldiers suffered from shell shock who had not been in the front lines. He, and others, began to think that psychological factors were responsible for breakdowns. If doctors thought shell shock was caused by nerve damage, they treated soldiers with massage, rest, exercise regimes and electric shock treatments, but if they thought it was psychological, hypnosis and rest was prescribed. ‘This is the first time the tools of modern pathology have been used to look at a 100-year-old problem: the lingering effect of blasts on the brain,’ he said. Molecular probes were used to reveal details in the brains that they examined, according to the study, published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications. Senior author, Professor Koliatsos, said: ‘We identified a pattern of tiny wounds, or lesions, that we think may be the signature of blast injury.’ ‘The location and extent of these lesions may help explain why some veterans who survive IED attacks have problems putting their lives back together.’ Soldiers have struggled with bomb-induced brain damage, which was dubbed shell shock, since 1914, when German and Allied forces bombarded each other for months on end. The condition is now known as blast neurotrauma and still  affects some soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the use of IEDs were widespread. Doctors treating IED survivors ‘often see depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and substance abuse or adjustment disorders,’ said Professor Koliatsos . ‘Life is very difficult for some of these veterans and it’s important to understand that at least a portion of these difficulties may have a neurological foundation.’ In the study, the scientists used a molecular marker to track a protein called APP that normally travels from one nerve cell to another via a long nerve fibre, or axon. When axons are broken by an injury, APP and other proteins accumulate at the breaks, causing swelling. The study revealed that bulbs on the nerve fibres of the soldiers were medium-sized, unlike those of people who died in car crashes or drug overdoes. Near the damaged axons, specialised cells, called microglia, that are involved in brain inflammation, were revealed. A stock image of a mammal microglia cell is shown . Shell shock, now known as blast neurotrauma, affects many soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the use of IEDs were widespread. War poets Siegfried Sassoon (left) and Wilfred Owen (right) both suffered from the condition, which Owen described as 'minds the Dead have ravished' In the brains of people killed in car accidents, the swellings were large and bulb-shaped, while in cases of methadone overdose, these axonal swellings were small. In the brains of four of the five veterans who survived wartime blast injuries, the axonal bulbs were medium-sized and usually arrayed in a honeycomb pattern near blood vessels. ‘We did not see that pattern in other types of brain injury,’ Professor Koliatsos said. The veterans’ brains did not show signs of the neurodegenerative disease known as punch-drunk syndrome, which is caused by multiple concussions. But near the damaged axons, specialised cells, called microglia, that are involved in brain inflammation, were revealed. Dr Koliatsos explained: ‘In brains that had been exposed to blasts, we see microglial cells right next to these unusual axonal abnormalities. The presence of these cells suggests the veterans who overdosed had pre-existing brain injuries. Lesions may be fragments of nerve fibres that broke at the time of the blast and slowly deteriorated, or may have been weakened by the blast and broken by some later accident like a concussion or drug overdose, the study says. Soldiers have struggled with bomb-induced brain damage, which was dubbed shell shock, since 1914, when German and Allied forces bombarded each other for months on end, here a soldier writes a letter home . Researchers examined the brains of five male United States military veterans who survived IED attacks but later died. The bodies were donated to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Three of the men died of methadone overdoses, one of a gunshot wound to the head and one of multiple organ failure. The researchers compared the veterans’ brains to those of 24 people who died of a range of causes, including motor vehicle crashes, opiate overdoses and heart attacks. They used a molecular marker to track a protein called APP that normally travels from one nerve cell to another via a long nerve fibre, or axon and found that the axonal bulbs of the veterans were medium-sized and usually arrayed in a honeycomb pattern near blood vessels.

"Security: The Duchess with a protection officer . Security around the Duchess of Cambridge appeared to have been stepped up as she was guarded by Taser-wielding personal protection officers. Her Scotland Yard bodyguards, including those in plain clothes, were seen wearing the controversial stun guns for the first time in addition to the conventional firearms they usually carry. The officers were also thought to be wearing stab vests. Onlookers noted that there appeared to be more back-up officers and police outriders accompanying Kate than normal. With the level of threat from international terrorism in the UK classed as severe, it is clear that the Metropolitan Police are taking no chances with the six-month pregnant duchess and other senior members of the Royal Family. There had already been high-level talks about issuing members of the Royalty and Diplomatic Protection Squad with Tasers following a series of security alerts. These included an attack by a mob on a car carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall during the London riots in 2010, which saw the window of the Rolls Royce smashed and Camilla poked with a stick. Until recently Tasers had only been used by officers guarding royal premises or on ‘mobile patrol’. But a new directive recommended that firearms officers should also be given ‘less lethal weapons’. Armed: A bodyguard, in plain clothes, was armed with a Taser as he guarded the Duchess in north London . Precaution: The £750 X26 Taser, pictured left, was being carried by officers as well as pistols, pictured right . The stun guns were first introduced in a very limited way to police forces in 2003. Guidelines say the weapon can be used only when officers face violence or a threat of violence so severe that they need to use force to protect themselves. Tasers fire a dart which can deliver an electric charge of 50,000 volts, rendering a suspect helpless for at least 20 seconds. They have a range of 21ft. Under the 1968 Firearms Act, the stun guns are considered dangerous enough to be classed as ‘prohibited weapons’. Civilians caught in possession of one can be punished by up to ten years in prison. The use of Tasers by police has been condemned by human rights groups who argue that the devices cause intolerable suffering and even death. Police wearing the £750 X26 Tasers were spotted in the run-up to the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. But yesterday was the first time officers guarding the Duchess of Cambridge have been seen wearing them clipped on their belts in ‘quick-draw’ holsters. Kate, who is expecting her second child in April, was visiting an event held by the Fostering Network in Islington, North London. Working mother: The Duchess of Cambridge, who is six months pregnant, seemed unfazed by the increased security . She sported a £169 brown silk dress by high street store Hobbs, which is not designed for maternity use. It is the third time she has worn the outfit in public. At a tea party to meet children who have benefited from fostering, the duchess seemed taken by a rosy-cheeked six-month-old called Naya whom she called ‘sweetie pie’ and compared to her own 18-month-old son, saying: ‘She’s chubbier than George.’ Royal welcome: Kate happily shock hands and chatted with the crowds as she met foster carers in Islington, north London . ‘It’s really so fantastic what you are all doing, supporting all these kids and giving them these opportunities. Well done,’ she added. Kate said she was keen to learn more about the work of foster parents who provide homes for vulnerable children and young people. She has no official link with the organisation but it is hoped that she might forge one in future. High alert: Issuing members of the Royalty and Diplomatic Squad, who already carry conventional firearms, pictured left,  with Tasers, pictured right, followed a series of security alerts . Watchful eye: The Duchess of Cambridge's plain clothed bodyguard kept a close eye on her during her visit . The duchess met carers and social workers before a more informal reception yesterday to hear more about what fostering involves. More than 63,000 children are currently being fostered in Britain, many of whom have experienced neglect and abuse, or have witnessed domestic violence or substance misuse. But at least 8,600 new foster families are desperately needed, particularly those who can offer a home to teenagers, disabled children and groups of brothers and sisters.","Duchess's bodyguards seen wearing controversial Tasers for the first time .

"His assignment had been to encourage youngsters to take up skiing. But while Prince Daniel’s his prowess on the slopes would have impressed his young audience, the view might not have proved quite so inspirational. The prince, whose title is the Duke of Västergötland, is the husband of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden. Sweden's Prince Daniel visited the Hammarbybacken ski resort in Stockholm for the annual All on the Snow day which aims to inspire children to take up the sport . He has been invited to take part in the annual ‘Alla på Snö’ day or ‘All on the Snow’ day together with a group of children aged between nine and ten at Hammarbybacken, a ski resort in Stockholm. However, the resort is a man-made hill constructed on the site of a former rubbish dump. Rather than offering visitors picturesque views of towering mountain ranges, guests are given sweeping views of high-rise apartment buildings and a sprawling car park. Built in 1983, the resort opened in 1990. In the past it has encountered problems with stopping the snow from melting because of the heat generated by the large highway running along the base of the slopes. However, the resort is a man-made hill constructed on the site of a former rubbish dump . Rather than offering visitors picturesque views of towering mountain ranges, guests are given sweeping views of high-rise apartment buildings and a sprawling car park . The resort was renovated in 2006 and snowmaking machines installed to make sure the visitors are able to ski. Reviews of the resort have been mixed, with one describing it ‘as basic as can be’. However, it is popular with local swedes who don’t have the time to travel further away to the ski in the country’s mountain ranges. The ‘All on the Snow event attended by Prince Daniel is arranged by the Swedish Ski Council, and allows children a chance to ski on the slopes for free. Prince Daniel is normally seen in more formal attire as here with Crown Princess Victoria at the Royal Palace . They are offered the chance to go sledging and cross-country skiing, all for free with the point of the day being to promote ski sport. Prince Daniel appeared quite at home on the piste as he glided expertly down the hill wearing a crash helmet and goggles.

"Amazon could be forced to hand over billions in unpaid taxes after the deal it struck with Luxembourg in 2003 was deemed illegal. The European Commission has ruled the company paid tiny rates of tax in comparison to other organisations in the country, in a way that technically 'constitutes state aid'. It's particularly embarrassing for the Commission's president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was Prime Minister of Luxembourg when the  deal was agreed. The country entered into a number of highly controversial tax deals with multinational firms during his premiership of the Grand Duchy between 1995 and 2013. Up to 340 multi-national companies were given help to avoid tax during his 18 years in office, it has been alleged. The deal between Amazon and Luxembourg regarding how much tax the online retailer should pay was reached after just 11 days - which the Commission deems a 'very short period of time'. Illegal: The European Commission says Amazon - who's headquarters are based in Luxembourg (pictured) - paid less corporation tax than other companies in the country . Embarrassed: The Commission's current president, Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured), was the Prime Minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck . It has previously been accused of minimising tax payments in Britain by diverting revenues through its holding company in Luxembourg, which MPs have branded 'immoral'. Now it's emerged the company could also be passing money between companies registered inside Luxembourg to bring down its own tax bill within the country. The commission said that Amazon had been allowed to funnel profits between holding companies, resulting in a tax bill of almost nothing. Amazon has several weeks to reply to the ruling and an eventual fine could be more than a year away because of the lengthy process and discussions between the company, EU regulators and the Luxembourg government. Juncker has been further weakened by claims that he acted like a 'business partner' to the US company. Amazon's former head of tax, Bob Comfort, has reportedly said  the Luxembourg government 'helped solve problems' for the company, to smooth its passage when originally setting up its operation in the country. In order to minimise its tax payments in the UK and across Europe, Amazon has based its headquarters in the Grand Duchy where it operates a skeleton crew of around 1,000 staff. It deems this as the 'beating heart' of its operation, even though it has warehouses and employs more than 15,000 workers in Britain alone. Avoidance: Amazon has been accused of minimising its tax payments in Britain by diverting money through its headquarters in Luxembourg . Outsourced: Despite employing 15,000 people in UK, Amazon maintains 'the beating heart' of its operation is in Luxembourg . Tax accountant Richard Murphy at Tax Research UK said: ‘Amazon is at a significant financial risk and it is possible that the eventual bill could run into billions.’ He added: ‘There’s a real prospect that Amazon will end up paying more tax in the UK if international law changes come in.’ Amazon paid just £42million in corporation tax in UK last year,despite sales of around £4.3billion. Tax accountant Richard Murphy at Tax Research UK said: 'Amazon is at a significant financial risk and it is possible that the eventual bill could run into billions. 'There's a real prospect that Amazon will end up paying more tax in the UK if international law changes come in.' The investigation is part of a multi-pronged clampdown on international tax-dodging by the commission. It is investigating similarly 'sweetheart' deals done by Google in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat in Luxembourg. The OCED is investigating ways to update international tax rules to take account of internet companies, which have been accused of using loopholes in existing legislation to avoid taxes by basing themselves in offshore havens. A spokesman for Amazon has said: 'Amazon has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg - we are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here.' According to the Financial Times, Luxembourg said it was 'confident that the allegations of state aid in this case are unsubstantiated'.","Amazon could have to pay back billions after European Commission ruling .

Emergency departments in England saw 89.8 per cent of patients within four hours in the week ending January 11 - short of the 95 per cent target. The gold standard was last achieved the week ending September 28, 2014. But the figures, released today by NHS England, do show a step in the right direction. The previous week just 86.7 per cent of those patients attending A&E were seen within four hours. Experts say it is a further sign of the 'unprecedented' pressures facing the health service this winter. Scroll down for video . Ambulances queuing outside A&Es has become an all to familiar sight as 'unprecedented' pressures grip the NHS with the latest figures showing the four-hour waiting time was missed again for the week ending January 11, with just 89.8 per cent of patients seen within that time - short of the 95 per cent target . On January 6, NHS England revealed from October to December last year waiting times reached their worst levels since the 95 per cent target was introduced in 2004. In that time just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within the four-hour target window. Dame Barbara Hakin, NHS England's national director of commissioning operations, said: 'We continue to see and treat the vast majority of patients in England within four hours, and performance improved this past week. 'Although we have seen a slight easing in the number of attendances and emergency admissions to A&E, the NHS continues to face unprecedented pressures on its front line services - particularly A&E, NHS 111 and ambulance services. 'In light of the latest weather warnings across the country, we would urge people - particularly the elderly - to stay in the warm, ensure they have proper medication, get their flu jab if they have not yet done so, and seek advice from their pharmacist or their GPs for colds, coughs and minor ailments.' In the week ending January 11, 389,377 people attended emergency departments in England, down from 407,239 patients the previous week. But an increase of around 6,000 patients from the same week 12 months ago. Of those, 39, 705 people had to wait longer than four hours to be seen, down from 53,681. There were also high levels of emergency admissions, with a total of 105,200 - up 3,400 on the same week last year. The number of patients waiting more than four hours for admission after attending an A&E unit was 11,980, down from 16,324 in the previous week. The latest figures show that on average more than 4,000 hospital beds a day were occupied by patients whose discharge was delayed, the highest point this year and worse than at any point last winter. The NHS 111 service took 255,000 calls for the week ending January 11, down from 323,000 the previous week and a dramatic reduction from the peak of 439,000 for the week ending December 28. Figures released on January 6 revealed from October to December 2014 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target and the longest waits since the target was introduced . The latest weekly figures comes as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published draft guidance for the number of nurses that should be on duty in A&E units. The organisation said there should be enough nursing staff on duty to have one nurse for every four cubicles but two registered nurses to one patient in cases of major trauma or cardiac arrest, . There should also be a registered children's nurse on each shift, or at least one A&E nurse with education and training in children's nursing. Because demand in A&E can change rapidly, the guidelines recommend that departments, in planning, should allow for enough nursing staff to care for higher than the average number of patients who attend the department on a daily basis. By increasing weekly nursing staff hours to cover above-average attendance numbers, staff can deal with unexpected peaks in the demand for services and be moved around the department flexibly to respond to changing situations. The chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said thousands more staff should be recruited for A&E departments. Dr Peter Carter told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The reality on the ground is even if these guidelines are implemented, which we hope they will be, we are a long way from having the requisite number of staff in many A&E departments. 'Not all, but there is certainly a significant number of A&E departments that are woefully short of the requisite number of nursing staff that they currently need.' He added that RCN analysis due to be published shortly will 'demonstrate that you will still need to recruit several thousand nurses across the country in A&E departments' to meet the guidelines, which would inevitably require staff to be brought in from overseas. Professor Mark Baker of Nice said the organisation was 'not absolutely sure at the moment' how many hospitals already complied with the draft guidance. 'The six experts who have been helping us and advising our committee on A&E staffing suggest that the recommendations we have got for the deployment of staff within the department are in common practice,' he told Today. He said that better planning and 'anticipatory' recruitment would reduce the dependency on agency staff, potentially balancing out any cost to the NHS. 'If you plan to staff your departments at average demand, you will be understaffed half of the time,' he said. 'What we are proposing is that managers should plan to staff their departments so that they are only short of staff, on the random variation of demands on A&E, one day a week and that will reduce the dependency on agency staff. 'So even though there will be more staff available, it won't cost the service more.' The target: The Government wants 95 per cent of patients to be transferred, admitted or discharged within four hours of arriving at accident and emergency departments . The challenge: There were 5,573,644 attendances at A&E departments across England in the October to December 2014 quarter, up from 5,294,269 during the corresponding period in 2013 . Record-long waits: The four-hour rule was met for 92.6 per cent of English A&E patients this quarter - the poorest showing in a decade - down from 95.6 per cent during the corresponding period in 2013 . Where people waited: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in East Anglia had 75.2 per cent of its A&E patients in and out of the department within four hours this quarter, compared with 79 per cent of emergency department patients at Medway NHS Foundation Trust hospitals in England's South East and 79.1 per cent of A&E attendees seen by Hull And East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust . The biggest blow-out: The University Hospitals Of North Midlands NHS Trust had 100 emergency patients who waited more than 12 hours to be admitted once the decision to admit them was made . The toughest week: Across England in the last week before Christmas - the week ending on January 4, 2015 - only 86 per cent of emergency patients were dealt with within the recommended four-hour window. An investigation has been launched after a cyclist died the morning after she was sent home from hospital, having suffered a head injury. The 52-year-old woman was taken to Cheltenham General Hospital on Tuesday, after being found on a street in the town. The hospital was facing its tenth day of special internal emergency measures, implemented amid rising pressures with surging demand and a lack of beds. The measures give hospital bosses extra powers to call in staff and decline to treat patients, cancel or postpone operations or transfer patients out of the hospital. The emergency plans also applied to Cheltenham's sister hospital, Gloucestershire Royal in Gloucester, and lasted from Sunday, January 4 until Wednesday. The woman was treated for a head injury in the hospital's emergency department, and discharged later the same day. Cheltenham General was placed intitiated special emergency measures on January 4 until Wednesday after seeing a surge in patients and increase in pressures . But paramedics were called to her home on Wednesday, and she later died. Two separate investigations are now underway, the first a police inquiry into what caused the woman to suffer the injuries on her bike. And the second is a formal inquest into her death, which is set to take place next week. A spokesman for the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust said it was too early to confirm whether a third internal inquiry into the woman's care on Tuesday within the hospital would also take place. The emergency measures the hospitals were under at the time may have made absolutely no difference to the care the woman received, the decision to discharge her the same day and the ultimate tragic outcome. He said it would be inappropriate to speculate on the cause of the woman's death, or comment on any aspect of her care or treatment, in advance of the post-mortem and any inquest process. 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to her family at what must be a terribly difficult time,' he added. Hospital bosses in Cheltenham and Gloucester said that they had not yet calculated exactly how many routine operations were cancelled over the ten-day emergency measures period, or how long it would take a backlog of what could be hundreds of postponed appointments. Dr Sean Elyan, the trust's medical director, said even though the emergency measures status had been ended, the two hospitals were still under 'significant pressure'. 'While the hospitals have been stood down and its status level reduced, they are still under significant pressure and this is likely to continue during the winter weeks ahead,' he said. 'Therefore we would advise the public to access A&E only if they have life threatening or serious injuries. 'Throughout this extremely challenging period we've continued to provide treatment to those patients who really needed acute, emergency or critical care. 'Ensuring that level of care was provided could only have been made possible through the commitment and dedication of our staff here at the hospitals and also from our partners across health and social care. Their response in extremely challenging circumstances has been really exceptional. 'Finally, I do want to apologise to patients who have had their planned surgery postponed. That's not a decision we take lightly and it is a last resort. We would like to reassure those patients that we will be doing everything that we possibly can to rearrange their appointments as soon as possible either with us or an alternative provider,' he added.","A&Es saw 89.8% of patients within four hours in week ending January 11 .

"The 11-year-old boy walked free from court today after pleading guilty to eight crimes . A one boy crime wave blamed for a fifth of all crime in is home town has walked free from court at the age of 11 after telling magistrates he wants to be a bank manager. The child, accused of exposing himself in a Carphone Warehouse and abusing customers with foul language in Costa Coffee, appeared before Yeovil Magistrates in Somerset today. After being told to pay attention and take his hands out of his pockets, the schoolboy said he wanted to work in a bank as he was good at maths. Having arrived with his grandfather, the court was adjourned for two hours while police officers looked for his mother. Upon his return he entered the court grinning to hear accusations of exposing himself to a girl in public and using profane language towards mothers and children in a coffee shop in Shepton Mallet. On his own, he caused a soar in the number of crimes reported in the sleepy rural village, said police. Describing the latest offences, Judith Morris, prosecuting, said: 'The offences took place on the 11 November last year at around 3.30 pm at the Townsend retail park in Shepton Mallet. '[He] was there, he walked into Costa Coffee and shouted various swear words when inside. 'In the store was mostly mums with children or elderly people. They were alarmed and distressed. 'After running out, a few minutes later he was outside a Carphone Warehouse. An 11-year-old girl was there. 'He called to get her attention and then he pulled down his trousers and pants exposing his genitals. She went home and told her mother.' But the court heard how the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had 'impressed' his solicitor as a 'nice, well behaved boy'. The trouble, his grandfather said, stemmed from the fact he had recently contacted his father to whom he had not spoken in the past. After pleading guilty to eight charges including threatening behaviour, violence against a person, and arson, the 11-year-old was told he could put his crimes 'behind him'. The child was accompanied in court by his grandfather, but proceedings were halted for two hours while officers searched for his mother . Yeovil Magistrates Court (pictured) heard how the child wanted to become a bank manager as an adult . Sentencing, Chair David Phillips said: 'I’m sure now it has all taken place you can appreciate how frightened people were. You realise that is wrong. 'We have heard consistently you are an intelligent boy. In terms of age, you are. You will now be given and opportunity to put this behind you.' Later, his mother said his bad behaviour was down to a lack of support at school. 'For me as a mother this stress is awful. There’s no anger management, no counselling. It has been awful. 'There’s limited school support. That’s why it’s taken so long - lack of funding.'","The 11-year-old boy pleaded guilty to eight charges including arson .

"Conservative MPs are under pressure to pretend to believe in God, a former minister claimed today. James Arbuthnot said he could only now confess to being an atheist because he was standing down at the election and likened to need to be religious to the pressure to 'keep quiet about being gay'. David Cameron has previously said he is 'evangelical' about his faith and said Britain should be more confident about its status as a Christian country. Speaking in the Commons, James Arbuthnot said he could only now confess to being an atheist because he was standing down at the election . The Church of England has long been viewed as the 'Tory party at prayer', and polls suggest Anglicans are still more like to vote Tory. Mr Arbuthnot, who served as a minister in John Major's government, suggested this long-held assumption meant non-believers had to keep a low profile. The MP for North East Hampshire revealed his atheism for the first time in 28 years in the House of Commons. He was christened and confirmed as a child, but has since 'lost those beliefs'. The former chairman of the defence select committee claimed the fact he is standing down at the general election made it easier to admit his view. He was speaking in a debate about whether prayers should be read at the start of council meetings. Mr Arbuthnot told MPs: 'First I shall disappoint people by saying I am not in the least religious. David Cameron has regularly spoken about his faith and why the Church 'really matters' to him. 'My father was once the second Church Estates Commissioner, I was christened and I was confirmed. 'But since then I have lost those beliefs and faith that I once had and I am perfectly comfortable with that. 'But this is the first time I have ever actually acknowledged that in public.' Elected as MP for Wanstead & Woodford in 1987, he has been MP for North East Hampshire since 1997. He was a junior minister in the social security and defence ministries in the last Tory government. After the 1997 general election Mr Arbuthnot became the Tory Chief Whip under William Hague and was on the frontbench of both Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard. In 2011 he announced he would stand down at the election, but has only admitted to being an atheist with four months left until he leaves the Commons. 'It may be true that the pressure on a Conservative politician particularly of keeping quiet about not being religious is very similar to the pressure that there has been about keeping quiet about being gay. 'For the avoidance of doubt I am not gay either but I just wanted to say that it is telling that it has taken me 28 years in this House, and frankly in the knowledge that I won't be standing in the next election, to make this point.' Unlike the United States, politician in Britain are often reluctant to discuss their faith. Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell famously said the New Labour government did not 'do God'. But Mr Cameron has regularly spoken about his faith and why the Church 'really matters' to him. In an interview last year, the Prime Minister said: 'People who advocate some sort of secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that neutrality, or the role that faith can play in helping people to have a moral code. 'I believe we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country, more ambitious about expanding the role of faith-based organisations, and, frankly, more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people's lives.' However, relations between the Church and the Conservatives have been strained in recent years after criticism of the impact of government policy on the poor. Intervention: The Archbishops of Canterbury (left) and York (right) said Britain is caught in a 'cycle of decline' The Church's two most senior figures came under fire yesterday after claiming the poor are being left behind and whole cities swallowed up in a 'cycle of decline'. In a highly political intervention – coinciding with the start of the General Election campaign – the Archbishops of Canterbury and York insisted that the Coalition was 'casting aside' the poor while chasing votes in Middle England. As a result, they said, Britain had become dominated by 'rampant' individualism, is 'ill at ease with itself' and was in many places 'trapped in apparently inevitable decline'. Last night Mr Cameron said he 'profoundly disagreed' with the two archbishops. And angry MPs said their comments were simply inaccurate and accused the primates of straying too far into the political arena.","North East Hampshire MP tells reveals he is an atheist after 28 years .

"Emotional notes written by British troops in Afghanistan reveal the true heartache they felt while serving on the front line. Artist Derek Eland, 53, formerly of the Parachute Regiment, was embedded with the military and travelled to remote checkpoints and patrol bases to collect stories. He asked soldiers and civilians to write down their innermost thoughts on cards he gave  - or materials they could find lying around. Scroll down for video .

Photographs of the soldiers writing the notes accompany 100 stories have been published in Eland's book Diary Rooms: Being Human on the Front Line in Afghanistan. Mr Eland, from Cumbria, said: 'I wasn't a slightly aloof, pretentious artist turning up with a paintbrush. 'Because I took the same risks that the soldiers took to get them, they were willing to give me their stories.' 'Some people were actively against it - they thought it would lead to mutinous comments and reduce morale. 'But the soldiers at the sharp end of the front line absolutely got it.

Many of the notes were written in dangerous forward operating bases on Helmand's front line. Ranger Curley, of the Royal Irish Regiment, used a green biro to describe how seeing a father and son working in an Afghan field reminded him of making a living with his dad. He wrote 'the only battle we had was the one my mother had to fight off cancer and the only soldier we had in our safe environment in the west of Ireland was my mam'. Doc Richards wrote: 'My abiding memory of Afghanistan?... 'It will be a humble local farmer who one day took me by surprise by asking after my family. ""You are far from home. You must miss your family. We are very grateful.' For the family of David Dalzell, the note represents some of the final words he ever wrote. He died just a few days after he met Mr Eland when his friend's rifle accidentally discharged and shot him. His message said that the tour - his first in Afghanistan - has been 'tough', and shares his thoughts about the 'long days and nights'. His mother, Susan, and father, Gordon, watched footage Eland had taken of the two friends together on patrol in Helmand. 'For that we are extremely grateful,' Mrs Dalzell wrote in the foreword to Diary Rooms. 'Reading the messages on the postcards, you get a snapshot into the lives of the soldiers on the frontline and we feel privileged to read their thoughts, some very funny and others so heartfelt, moving and so profoundly sad,' she wrote.

"John Stingemore, 72, was set to face a string of historic sex abuse charges relating to his time as manager of a children's home but he has been found dead . A suspected paedophile children's home boss has been found dead - just weeks before he was due to stand trial for allegedly abusing boys as young as nine. John Stingemore, 72, was set to face a string of historic sex abuse charges relating to his time as manager of Grafton Close children's home in West London in the 1970s and 1980s. Stingemore, who was charged in September 2013 with multiple counts of indecent assault, taking indecent images of a child and one count of conspiracy to commit buggery, was found dead by police. A spokeswoman from the coroner's office in Hastings, near where he lived in St Leonard's on Sea, East Sussex, said: 'He has passed away.' A source said that a post-mortem examination would be needed to find the exact cause of death. Stingemore was set to appear for trial at Southwark Crown Court on February 2 alongside Catholic priest Father Anthony McSweeney. His former children's home is at the centre of Operation Fernbridge, a Met probe launched last February looking into claims of a paedophile ring operating out of the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South West London. As part of the probe investigators are looking into claims that children were taken from the home to the Elm Guest House to be sexually abused. A police spokesman said: 'Police were called to Stonehouse Drive, St Leonards-on-Sea at 3.18pm on January 14 to concern for the health of a man. The man was found collapsed but was declared dead at the scene. 'He has been named as John Stingemore, 72. His death is not being treated as suspicious. A post mortem is yet to take place and the death has been passed to the coroner'. Allegations: Stingemore, 72, was manager of Grafton Close children's home in Richmond, now a block of flats, where victims were allegedly taken to the nearby Elm Gust House and abused . Detectives are examining allegations that several high profile figures including the late MP Cyril Smith, abused children from Grafton Close at the guest house. Victims were said to be between the ages of nine and 15-years-old. McSweeney, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex, was a trainee priest at the time of the alleged attacks, while Stingemore ran the home for vulnerable children. McSweeney is accused of taking an indecent photograph of a child and two counts of indecent assault on a male, as well as three counts of making indecent photographs of a child and a further count of possessing indecent images.

"Beaming broadly as a spiky haired Italian clown named Fumagali approached, Prince Albert of Monaco was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed an evening at the circus with sister Princess Stephanie. The International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974. But while Albert and Stephanie appeared to be enjoying the show, the newest additions to Monaco's royal family were nowhere to be seen. All smiles: Prince Albert and Princess Stephanie enjoy the antics of Italian clown Fumagalli . What a gentleman! Ringmaster Petit Gougou plants a kiss on Stephanie's outstretched hand . New mother Princess Charlene was also absent, having chosen to remain at home with month-old twins, Jacques Honoré Rainier and Gabriella Thérèse Marie. Their absence didn't prevent Prince Albert from enjoying himself, however, although the event briefly took a sombre turn at the beginning of the night. Part way through the opening ceremony, a minute's silence was held in memory of stunt rider Kevin Ferrari, a.k.a Flic Flac Moto X, 24, who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on Wednesday. Despite his death, the show continued after the minute's silence with elephants, acrobats and clowns all on the billing. At one point, Princess Stephanie, who is no stranger to circuses, was left smiling when ringmaster Petit Gougou approached and planted a kiss on her hand - much to Albert's amusement. Royal approval: The clown, real name Giovanni Huesca, raised smiles all round . Round of applause: Albert, who was taking a night off from daddy duties, claps at the end of the performance . Welcome: New father Albert also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively . Looking good: Despite having two tiny babies to care for, Albert looked surprisingly fresh . Royal wave: Albert waves to the Monte Carlo crowd from the comfort of the royal box . Tribute: Ahead of the performance, there was a minute's silence for a performer who died earlier this week . The prince himself certainly appeared to enjoy the show, gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared, throwing himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse. Stephanie, who is patron of the International Circus Festival, was making her second visit to the Big Top in a week, having already met clowns and elephant trainers on Tuesday. During that visit, the 49-year-old, who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000, was seen patting one of the circus' pachyderms, looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk. The royal, who also helps to oversee the Circus Festival and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography, first attended the event when she was just nine. Her father Prince Ranier was the brains behind the first festival, which now as then, specialises in traditional circus acts  from clowns to acrobats.

"All those tournament victories and great days at the majors, all those fabulous rounds he’s played over the years when he seemingly had the ball on the end of a string. Never once, though, since turning professional in 2007 had Rory McIlroy enjoyed the satisfaction of a hole in one. Until Friday. He threw his arms into the air, like a joyous footballer, after his nine-iron shot to the 177-yard, par-three 15th bounced twice before dropping gently into the hole for his first ace in competition. SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH VIDEO OF RORY MCILROY'S HOLE-IN-ONE . Rory McIlroy hits his tee shot on the 15th hole at Abu Dhabi Golf Club on Friday morning - and it would yield spectacular results .

Caddie J.P. Fitzgerald (third left) gets a handshake from McIlroy after helping him select the right club for the shot . 23 under par rounds . 96 under par in total . 19 rounds in the 60s . 104 birdies . 27 bogeys . 1 hole-in-one . After missing easy birdie putts at the previous two holes, McIlroy said: ‘It certainly made up for those misses. I knew it had a chance when I saw where it landed, and it took a nice hop to the right and dropped in. My first ace as a pro, so obviously the beers are on me tonight.’ McIlroy had his first hole in one aged nine, also with a nine iron, although back then it travelled 106 yards. He’d had eight since but only with his mates and, once, in a pro-am. Perhaps it is surprising he’s had to wait so long for an ace in competition, but McIlroy knows some great players never achieve one. The late Seve Ballesteros, for example. ‘Obviously there’s some skill involved but there’s also a lot of luck,’ said McIlroy. ‘When you look at some of the players who have never had one, it was nice to get one out here.’ The perfect shot formed part of a back-nine charge that has left the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship with the sort of leaderboard that reads like an answered prayer for the sponsor. Course specialist Martin Kaymer, three times a winner round here, is in pole position to win again after following his opening 64 with a 67. When he finished around lunchtime he was five clear and the tournament had the feel of a procession.

McIlroy and the crowd eye the flight of his ball as it flies towards the pin on the 15th green . The ball can be seen just before it lands on the green, directly in line with the flagstick . McIlroy's ball pitches just a few feet away from the flag as the excitement starts to build among the crowd .

McIlroy salutes the crowd as he makes his way to the green to pick his ball out of the hole . McIlroy changed all that, as did the gifted young Belgian Thomas Pieters. Indeed, but for a bogey on his final hole, the big-hitting 22-year-old from Antwerp would have finished on the same mark as Kaymer. His Yorkshire coach Pete Cowen reckons he will be among the world’s best in a couple of years and what an experience awaits him over the final two rounds. Not only Kaymer for company, but McIlroy is just two off the lead after a marvellous back nine completed in 31 shots. If his opening 67 was achieved with a little smoke and mirrors, this 66 was more like the real McIlroy. His ball-striking was back to its prodigious best and he bludgeoned poor Rickie Fowler into submission, for instance, as the American tumbled to a 75. ‘I’m not sure I could find any fault with my game from tee to green,’ said McIlroy. ‘I even hit a lot of good putts but they didn’t go in. But I’m in a great position and you could hardly ask for anything better for your first tournament of the year than chasing a two-time major champion on a course he loves. It will be hard to catch Martin round here, but I will be giving it my best.’ SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH VIDEO OF MIGUEL ANGEL JIMENEZ'S HOLE-IN-ONE... ON THE SAME HOLE!

It’s hard to beat that, isn’t it? Meanwhile, on the PGA Tour at the Sony Open in Hawaii, Paul Casey shot a first-round 62 and then revealed he has resigned from the European Tour after 17 years as a member, thus making him ineligible to play in the Ryder Cup. Casey, 37, who became a father last year, said: ‘For as long as I have been a professional I have been a member of the European Tour, so it was a very tough decision. But I live in Arizona and playing in America full-time will enable me to spend more time at home with Pollyanna (his wife) and Lex (his son).’","Rory McIlroy aced the 177-yard par-three 15th at Abu Dhabi Golf Club .

"Accountant Caroline Puddu accidentally killed herself with an overdose in a bid to avoid court after being accused of stealing from former employers . An accountant killed herself accidentally after pretending to be a drug addict to avoid facing fraud charges in court, an inquest heard. Caroline Puddu, 36, was accused of stealing £213,000 from her former employer. But days before she was due to appear before magistrates, she died after overdosing on her diabetic mother’s insulin. As part of her ruse, she had told doctors, social workers and psychiatrists repeatedly of attempts to kill herself by taking an overdose. She also claimed she had taken her mother’s insulin and drank a bottle of wine and 20 cans of cider a night because of stress at work. But her requests for rehabilitation were rejected by medics after tests found she was healthy. In fact, she did not take drugs and rarely drank, but went to the gym regularly and often did fun runs. In a last-ditch attempt to avoid court and jail, Miss Puddu, from Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire, took insulin to make it look like she was an addict, the inquest heard. But she took too much and on April 17, 2013, died from hypoglycaemic brain death, in which the brain is starved of glucose. Doctors told the hearing in Stoke the overdose caused severe brain damage that left Miss Puddu in a coma for ten days. Recording a verdict of accidental death, North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith said: ‘Her last employment led to problems and it all went very sour – it’s probable she committed criminal offences. ‘She made some very strange claims that she was taking significant amounts of alcohol and a huge amount of drugs that would have killed a horse, never mind her. She was trying to get into residential accommodation because that would have avoided some of the criminal proceedings. I think this was escapism to avoid reality.’ Ms Puddu on holiday in St Lucia in 2011 (left) and posing with her rescue dog Benji, when she was 29 (right) Ms Puddu's mother Sheila (pictured) arrived at the hospital to be told her daughter had brain damage . Miss Puddu died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured) from severe brain damage . Miss Puddu – who lived with her mother Sheila Puddu, 77 – earned £38,000 as accountant for Fletcher Moorland in Stoke-on-Trent for four years before her death. Bosses found large amounts of money had gone missing and accused her of stealing £212,750 between October 19, 2008, and August 9, 2012. But Mrs Puddu said her daughter was over-worked and bullied by the firm, adding: ‘Sometimes when she got home she would cry because she was so tired and then she would get calls through the night. She was owed that money for overtime and the extra hours she worked. She was terrified of going to jail. She just couldn’t see another way out.’ However, the firm’s managing director, Matt Fletcher, 41, insisted yesterday Miss Puddu had not been bullied, adding: ‘Money was stolen from us over four years. She was entrusted with the company’s money, she was the only person responsible for the accounts.’ North Staffordshire Coroner's court (pictured) heard Miss Puddu's death from an overdose was accidental .","Caroline Puddu, 36, had been charged with stealing from former employers .

"The distinct green glow of Comet Lovejoy has been closely watched as it came into view in the night's sky over the past month. One amateur astronomer has now compiled a series of 100 images he took of the comet, also called Comet C/2014 Q2, as it passed over Grayson, Georgia, in the United States. Using just a standard SLR camera and tripod, Steve Siedentop was able to create a time-lapse video of the tiny green dot as it moved across the night's sky. Scroll down for video . Amateur astronomer Nick Howes managed to capture this stunning image of Comet Lovejoy from Australia . Taken over two hours, the comet can be seen moving into the constellation of Taurus on 10 January. Another amateur astronomer, Nick Howes took another eeiry image that highlighted the trail of dust streaming off behind the comet as it passes through the solar system. He took the picture, using a series of filters to highlight the and bright green head, from the Siding Spring Observatory in Warrumbungle National Park near Coonabarabran, Australia. Comet Lovejoy is around 43 million miles from Earth and was thought to be travelling at around 15 miles a second. It was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy, who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers, and he named the comet. To date, Mr Lovejoy, from Queensland, has discovered five comets, all using relatively simple equipment compared to what's found at a professional observatory. It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world. The comet's distinctive green glow comes from molecules of diatomic carbon - two carbon atoms joined together - and cyanogen fluorescing in the ultraviolet light from the sun. Its tail takes on a more blue tinge due to the carbon monoxide it contains. This graph shows estimates of Comet Lovejoy's trajectory as it passed closest to the Earth on January 7 . Astrophotographer Justin Ng, from Singapore, took this striking photograph of Comet Lovejoy on 11 January . The comet is expected to remain visible for much of January and it will climb steadily higher in the night's sky . Lovejoy started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5, the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope. A comet's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale, lower numbers indicate more intense brightness. Scientists are now attempting to calculate the Comet Lovejoy's path round the solar system and believe that on its next encounter with the Earth it may come even closer. However, it is not expected to pass within the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Comets are essentially piles of rock, gravel, and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice. As the comet nears the sun, its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight. They also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the Earth's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers. Eerie diamond in the sky: Comet Lovejoy's striking green glow (pictured above, earlier this month) is caused by light being given off by flourescing carbon molecules . At its peak levels of brightness, Comet Lovejoy could be spotted with the naked eye on dark nights . First spotted on August 17, Comet Lovejoy was captured on camera above Mount Fuji in Japan (above) Comet Lovejoy should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-January, which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet 'from light-polluted city suburbs'. Some observers were able to spot Lovejoy in late December as it reached magnitude 5.3. Comet Lovejoy is due to remain visible for much of January. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine explains how to spot the comet in the night sky: . 'Comet Lovejoy (C/2014 Q2) is growing in brightness and will hit a magnitude of +4.1 in the first two weeks of the new year. 'A magnitude of +4.1 is just over 100 times dimmer than the brightest star in Earth's entire night time sky (Sirius). The more positive the number, the lower the magnitude and the dimmer an object is. 'The comet is currently at a magnitude of around +5.0, meaning that it is an ideal target for those who have received a telescope or pair of binoculars for Christmas. 'The comet is much more favourable for Northern Hemisphere observers. It was a Southern Hemisphere target, but it's leaving their skies now. To observe it, late evening is best, around 10.30pm GMT. 'It's climbing higher and higher in the sky as the nights go on, so by 5 January, you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark.' 'Even in a pair of 10x50 binoculars and under moderate suburban light pollution, comet Lovejoy appears as a faint, white smudge. If conditions are much more favourable however, you should be able to make out a bit of shape to the comet, particularly at the centre - albeit only just! 'Again, the darker the skies and the better your optical aid, the more you will see. You may even be able to pick out the stunning greenish tint of the comet, but astrophotography will make this much more apparent. 'Comet Lovejoy  is close to the southern section of the constellation Lupus (The Hare) and will begin to make its way through the constellation of Eridanus as we head into the new year.' Stargazers hoping to see the comet can use this graph to locate the comet's position in they sky .","Amateur astronomer Steve Siedentop took 100 images of Comet Lovejoy .

"Double whammy: Not only did Jen lose her first love to a deadly brain tumor in 2007, just six years earlier she also lost her best friend to the same fate. Just days after revealing Jennifer Aniston’s lost first love was actor Daniel McDonald, Daily Mail Online has learned the former Friend is harboring yet another heartbreak. Not only did Jen lose her first love to a deadly brain tumor in 2007, just six years earlier she also lost her best friend to the same fate. Jen and actress Kim Walker, who played nasty Heather Chandler in the classic 1988 cult film Heathers, were the best of friends. They met while attending the famous Fiorello La Guardia High School of the Performing Arts in New York City and traveled to LA together to try their luck at acting. Jen won a slot as the sister of Ferris Bueller in the 1990s TV series of the same name and starred in the freaky film, Leprechaun, before going on to star as Rachel Green in Friends. Kim booked roles on such popular TV series as Matlock, The Outsiders and Highway to Heaven before landing her big breakout role in Heathers, a dark comedy about a clique of girls, three of them named Heather, in a Ohio high school. ‘The girls were terribly close,’ says a mutual friend. ‘They shared an apartment and did everything together. And they both shared the same dream of becoming big Hollywood stars. ‘Although Kim was working regularly, her jobs tapered off in the late 1990s – just about the time she was diagnosed with a deadly brain tumor. ‘When Kim told Jennifer she was sick and doctors didn’t give her long to live, Jennifer was beside herself. Kim was just 32, one year older than Jen, and it didn’t seem right that her friend should have to face something as devastating and final as this. True love: Aniston with her current fiance Justin Theroux last night. She has previously said that she believes ex Daniel McDonald 'sent' Theroux to her as he looked out for her love life from beyond the grave . Gone too soon: Jen and Kim were terribly close, reveals a mutual friend. ‘They shared an apartment and did everything together. And they both shared the same dream of becoming big Hollywood stars' ‘Jennifer is the kind of person who can’t stand to see anyone suffer and it made her physically sick to think her friend was facing certain death from such a debilitating diagnosis and there was nothing she could do. ‘When Kim died, Jennifer was inconsolable,’ says the source. ‘She was so distraught she couldn’t even attend the memorial service for Kim. At the time there were some friends who didn’t understand how Jen could be a no-show at her best friend’s funeral, but you have to know Jen to know she just couldn’t handle it. ‘I remember she sent a huge bouquet of flowers, but couldn’t bring herself to face the reality of losing Kim by showing up at her memorial.’ Kim Walker (second from right) starred with, from left, Shannen Doherty, Lesanne Falk and Winona Ryder in Heathers. In an interview with the New York Times as part of her aggressive push to grab an Oscar nomination for her role in the film Cake, Aniston said of McDonald 'He would have been ""the one"". But I was 25 and I was stupid' The friend says how sadly ironic it was that just six years later, she got the news her first love, revealed by Daily Mail Online as Tony-nominated actor Daniel McDonald, passed away from the very same illness. In an interview with the New York Times as part of her aggressive push to grab an Oscar nomination for her role in the film Cake, Aniston said of McDonald 'He would have been ""the one"". But I was 25 and I was stupid.' McDonald's widow Mujah Maraini-Melehi has since lashed out at the actress.  'It pains me to read the headlines that allude to her losing him tragically when she was not present during his long and difficult illness.' When Dan also died of brain cancer, it was a horrible reminder for Jen of Kim’s death,’ says the source. ‘The very fact two such important people in her young life passed from the very same thing was uncanny. ‘To this day Jen still thinks about both Daniel and Kim and holds them close to her heart. It’s no wonder Jen is slow to commit to relationships; when you lose two of the most important people in your life to brain tumors, it has to take a toll on your willingness to allow yourself to love.’","Kim Walker, who played Heather Chandler in 1988 film Heathers, died of brain cancer in 2001 .

"State corrections officer Henry Blackwelder, pictured, is alleged to have allowed two Pasco County strippers to smuggle booze, to inmates at the Pasco County jail . A prison corrections officer is facing multiple charges for allegedly allowing a pair of  strippers to smuggle booze and drugs in to inmates at a Florida jail and brokering  conjugal visits 'in the woods.' Henry Blackwelder, a former corrections officer at the Pasco County jail, is currently under police investigation for his misconduct. It is alleged that he used strippers, Jessica Morgan, 24, and Stacy Petty, 46, to get  contraband into prison and would broker 'conjugal visits for inmates in the woods.' According to police, Blackwelder's operation was exposed after an inmate from the jail escaped from a work crew in suburban Pasco County, 30 miles north of downtown Tampa. Blackwelder did not tell his superiors of the escape until three hours later and when investigators responded to the prison break they got much more than they bargained for. Officers uncovered empty cans of Straw-Ber-Rita and Four Loko malt liquor, empty packets of synthetic marijuana known as 'spice,' and a blanket in the woods used for hook-ups. Sheriff Chris Nocco said: 'Prison is supposed to be tough. ... It was basically a party out there.' Meanwhile, Morgan told deputies she 'knew it was wrong' but did it because she had fallen in love with one of the inmates on the work crew. The petite brunette, along with her accomplice, told officials that they had met with the inmates at least once a week for about a year. High security: Blackwelder's operation only came to light after an inmate at Pasco County jail, pictured, escaped from a work crew in suburban Pasco County located about 30 miles north of downtown Tampa . The exotic dancers were aided by Blackwelder who was paid with cash and food for the contraband. Police said he would hide out and finish any leftovers from the food the two women brought for their inmate boyfriends. 'He was like Yogi bear out there eating their leftovers,' Nocco added. The Sheriff said the investigators were alerted to the misconduct  after inmate Jason Adams - who was serving a six-year sentence for burglary and grand theft - escaped. Adams managed to sneak away after asking to relieve himself in the woods. But he was caught a day later riding a bicycle. Police said Adams would regularly leave the work crew  to buy booze, smokes and spice after Blackwelder gave him permission. Breaking the law:  Stacey Ann Petty, left, and Jessica Morgan, right, are seen here under arrest  following an investigation that discovered a state corrections officer allowed them to  smuggle booze and smokes to inmates at the Pasco County jail . Blackwelder would then get his work crew to smuggle the goods into the prison. After the prison escape, the corrections officer immediately resigned. On Tuesday, he was charged with official misconduct, unlawful compensation for official behavior and smuggling contraband into a state correctional facility. He was released on bail a day later. It is not clear if he has an attorney. Meanwhile, Morgan and Petty have been charged with introducing contraband into a state correctional facility, giving alcohol to an inmate, and giving articles of food and clothing to an inmate. They are both being held on $20,000 bond at the Pasco County Jail, and records do not list an attorney for them. Yet, Nocco noted that the work crew trysts went on even after Blackwelder resigned, leading him to wonder if there are more corrections officers involved. The state Department of Corrections is currently 'reviewing all policies and procedures related to community work squads to ensure the safety, supervision and security of all inmates and staff.'","Henry Blackwelder, a former corrections officer at the Pasco County jail in Florida is currently under investigation .

"Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said this week she is 'very seriously considering' a presidential run. A source familiar with the 60-year-old plans told DailyMail.com that Fiorina - the only GOP woman to give the race a strong look, so far - is still undecided and would make a decision between March or April. Fiorina has never held public office and would rely heavily on her background in business in bid to become the nation's chief executive. 'I think we need different experience, different perspective and a different voice,' she told Neil Cavuto in an interview that Thursday night on Fox Business Network. Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina says she's 'very seriously considering' a bid for the presidency; she'll make a decision in March or April . IN THE RED: Fiorina's unsuccessful 2010 US Senate campaign is still a half-million dollars in debt . Fiorina unsuccessfully challenged California Sen. Barbara Boxer in 2010, losing to the incumbent lawmaker by 10 points. This June she launched her own political action committee, Unlocking Potential, which supports Republican women running for political office. The probable 2016 candidate has made several trips to Iowa and New Hampshire in the last year and has reportedly been talking to donors and activists in the all-important presidential primary states about her interest in running. Last week Fiorina brought a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, onto Unlocking Potential's payroll. The PAC said Flores would serve as Fiorina's deputy campaign manager if she does enter the 2016 contest. A Virginia native, Fiorina moved to California in the 90s, joining HP in 1999. She went on to become CEO of the company before being forced to resign in 2005 after it merged with Compaq. She was the first woman to head a Fortune 50 business. She served as a surrogate for Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008 before running for the U.S. Senate against Boxer in 2010. As of late September, Fiorina's Senate campaign, Carly for California, was still $500,000 in debt, owing sums as high as $80,000 to former vendors and staff. But as of this month all of those bills has been paid off, a Fiorina insider told DailyMail.com. After the 2010 Senate race Fiorina and her husband, Frank, a former AT&T exec, moved back to northern Virginia, allowing her to be closer to her daughter and grandchildren while making it easier for her to embark on increasingly frequent trips to Washington, D.C. On Tuesday she will headline a March for Life event at the Washington headquarters of leading conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Next month she'll be a featured speaker at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, being held this year just outside of the nation's capital city in National Harbor, Maryland. CPAC is hosted by the American Conservative Union, whose foundation Fiorina is on the board of. An an entrepreneurship event in Washington on Wednesday, Fiorina gave a preview of her possible campaign stump speech. Without talking directly about politics, the former businesswoman hammered on quintessential conservative themes, knocking 'big government' and advocating for less red tape. Fiorina is making the rounds and keeping her name in the news as she decides whether to pull the presidential trigger . 'When was the last time that we actually did an inventory of all the regulations that are on the books? Answer: not in my lifetime, not in anybody’s lifetime,' she said, per a report from Time. 'It’s like geologic sediment. We have eons, millennia of rules and regulations at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level, and it has become a primordial soup. And if you’re a big company you can handle it, but if you’re a startup or small company you really can’t. The point is, we have to start undoing some of this stuff.' In the interview with Cavuto that aired on Thursday evening, Fiorina argued, 'It’s not the entrepreneurial spirit in this nation that is dying' it's just that 'we have a leviathan called the government that’s crushing that spirit. 'And if you ask those small business owners ... 70 percent of them consider government hostile to them,' she said, according to the Hill. Fiorina said the government has become 'so big, so complex, so unaccountable, so inefficient, so corrupt in so many cases that it is becoming harder and harder for people with guts, and brains, and ambitions and gifts to put them to work.' Should she run for president, Fiorina said this week that her experience in business, that allows her to 'make complex decisions,' would be a major boon to the country. 'I think we are crushing the potential of this nation, and this should be the American century. But so much of what policies and politicians are doing are making it too hard for Americans to fulfill their potential,' she told Fox News' Greta Van Susteran. Referencing the lack of a visible U.S. presence at a Sunday unity rally in Paris after the recent terrorist attack on satirical news publication Charlie Hebdo, Fioria said, 'The world is a sadder and more dangerous place without American leadership, and America is not leading today in the world.' Fiorina said it's 'inconceivable' that President Barack Obama 'wasn't even aware' that the march was taking place 'and that he had a decision to make.' 'I just find his apparent ignorace of what's going on around him quite stunning, and obviously he is failing as a chief executive,' she said.","Former Hewlett-Packard CEO could add female flair to a male-dominated GOP field that will likely take on Hillary Clinton .
