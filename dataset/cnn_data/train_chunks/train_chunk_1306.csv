"A fire stoked by strong winds swept through a three-story house early Sunday, killing five people along with a 6-week-old baby. The Essex County prosecutor's office said the fire started about 6 am in the single-family home a few blocks north of Route 280. The cause is under investigation.

One person living in a house next door escaped safely. He told 1010 WINS of the female resident that had been rescued from the roof of the house 'She had heavy smoke and fire starting to come from the windows in her area, but fortunately we were able to get to her.' 'I lost my mother-in-law; I lost my niece; I lost my cousin. This ain’t right,' a woman said to the radio station. The New York Post reported that a man who was allegedly the father of the infant said yelled 'My baby, my baby! I lost my baby!'

"A Qantas passenger has documented his terrifying emergency landing experience after the huge double-deck airbus plane he was travelling on was forced to abandon its path when its cabin lost air pressure. The QF2 flight reportedly dropped from 39,000 feet to 9,000 feet in just minutes on its way from Dubai to Sydney and was forced to land at Perth airport instead. Flyer Nigel Richardson, from Melbourne, documented the dramatic landing on Twitter, and reported those on board were told: ‘Cabin crew this is an emergency descent. The aircraft is in full control’. Scroll down for video . A Qantas A380 plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Perth airport . Passengers appeared calm as they waited on the tarmac in Perth after the incident . He commented it was 'sort of a good news / bad news thing.’ ‘Fastest descent I've ever experienced in a plane. Always interesting when you see cabin crew running too,’ he added. ‘Air conditioning problem. Aircraft not in danger. Crew very calm and professional,’ he said, before later being told by staff that the air con was not the problem and they would need to leave the plane at Perth. Courtney Atkinson tweeted a picture of the flight path and called it an 'interesting start to the day' after the plane dropped in just 'four minutes' Frequent flyer Nigel Richardson was woken up by the plane's quick descent . He kept his Twitter followers updated with the situation and said there was 'full show down of air conditioning system' Mr Richardson joked he had never been to Perth before . Live tweeting the terrifying experience, the frequent flyer joked: ‘Look on the bright side. I've never been to Perth before. Unplanned stopover. How long we are here for – TBD.’ ‘Full shut down of air conditioning system that keeps plane pressurised at altitude was the problem,’ he clarified. He said despite the oxygen masks not dropping the incident ‘seemed to scare the crews as much as us’. The passenger said the Qantas crew were 'very calm and professional' Another passenger said the pilot was keeping them informed . Mr Richardson was later told the air con was not at fault . As the giant plane waited on the tarmac at Perth airport for a decision to be made on what to do next, Mr Richardson tweeted a photo from inside the cabin of people calmly reaching into the overhead lockers, talking and reading on their Kindles and laptops. After first being told an air conditioning problem was at fault, he then said: ‘Air con fault not identified. Expect that ground crew need to talk to Airbus to resolve.

"Ronnie O’Sullivan claimed a memorable fifth Coral UK Championship title last night – having played the tournament with a broken ankle. The Rocket saw off natural heir apparent Judd Trump 10-9 in a thriller at York’ s Barbican Centre to pocket the £150,000 first prize. He shrugged off a brilliant late fightback from his opponent, who made breaks of 120, 127 and 86 to close to force a tense decider from 9-4 adrift. VIDEO Scroll down to see O'Sullivan talk about his career targets in 2013 . Ronnie O'Sullivan has followed up his four previous UK Championship titles with another victory . The 39-year-old kept his cool to see out the deciding game having led 9-4 at one stage . Judd Trump congratulates Ronnie after his victory at the Barbican Centre on Sunday night . O'Sullivan holds his title aloft in front of an appreciative crowd . O'Sullivan battled back after struggling in the early rounds with an ankle injury . And there was even late anxiety for O’Sullivan over forgetting to pack enough pants – dashing into the city to stock up on underwear before the showpiece. O’Sullivan had fractured his ankle bone on the eve of the event while out running in Epping Forest near his Essex home. But the 39-year-old raced into a 5-1 lead at the tournament where it all started for him as a 17-year-old, setting for his first major trophy. And despite a superb rally from the 25-year-old world No7 Trump, the 2011 UK winner, O’Sullivan closed out the match. At one stage it had looked like Trump was about to pull off one of the most famous snooker comebacks, up there with Dennis Taylor against Steve Davis at the Crucible final in 1985. Trump keeps an eye on O'Sullivan's progress after going 3-1 down early on in the contest . Ronnie O'Sullivan (left) and Judd Trump shake hands before the final of the 2014 Coral UK Championship . VIDEO Ronnie takes UK Gold . O’Sullivan said: “I have had to dig really deep in this tournament, especially with the foot over these last 12 days. It has been very hard, so these are great moments. “I don’t know how I won after seeing him come back from 9-4 down. He hardly missed a ball and I was gone. “If I had lost with that big a lead I would have been severely disappointed, the pressure was mounting. “I just know after the other Champion of Champions final last month I don’t want to be playing Judd every time in these, he is such a tough opponent.” Trump said: “I wanted to get a good start, and you can’t afford to give Ronnie a five-frame lead – but I didn’t bottle it and played well. I just left it too late once again. Four-time champion O'Sullivan was not at his best but still manged to establish a 5-3 interval lead . O'Sullivan (left) watches on as Trump plays a shot at the at the Barbican Centre in York . “I felt very relaxed out there and am just a bit annoyed I didn’t get a good chance in the decider, because I knew I had that form in me.” Trump is often seen as the natural successor to O’Sullivan, a reputation helped along nicely when he became the youngest player to make a 147 maximum break in a competitive match at just 14. A natural showman who thrived on atmosphere and big crowds, his initial progress on tour was hindered by qualifying matches played with neither present. The breakthrough was inevitable though and came in 2011 with a first ranking title at the China Open, huge credit in defeat despite a world final loss to John Higgins in Sheffield, and success in the UK event with a 10-8 win over Mark Allen. Trump managed a break of 50 to level at 1-1 – but then lost the next four frames with some nerves taking hold. Trump had noted before the final that O’Sullivan had not been at his best last week despite a 13th career 147 break – but expected him to raise the bar for the showpiece. And he was right, with the Rocket knocking in breaks of 82 and 81 – only for Trump to keep the contest alive by pocketing the last two frames of the afternoon. The players emerged to a deafening reception in the evening, and O’Sullivan kept his foot on the gas by quickly extending his lead to 7-3. Trump clung on, but a magnificent break of 133, the 770th of O’Sullivan’s career, re-established his four-frame advantage. From 9-4 down Trump rallied, and back to back centuries of 120, 127 and 86 left him at just 9-8 adrift. He got to 9-9 – but O’Sullivan closed it out.","Ronnie O'Sullivan claims title with 10-9 victory .

"A trip that started with Gareth Southgate singing Saido Berahino’s praises ended with a similar theme as England’s Under-21s extended their winning spree. Before jetting out to Lithuania and Moldova last Thursday, Southgate had spoken about how impressed he had been to see Berahino knuckle down after a dip at the end of last season to recapture the sparkle he emerged 12 months ago. Those words were not misplaced. Berahino ensured England did what Southgate wanted, scoring twice in a 3-0 win over Moldova that secured an eighth consecutive win for their head coach and give him confidence ahead of Friday’s draw for the Euro 2015 play-offs. Control: Saido Berahino was the star of the show in Moldova for England U21 as he bagged a brace . Celebration: The West Brom striker receives the plaudits for bagging twice in the 3-0 win over Moldova U21 . Well done, Saido! Norwich's Nathan Redmond approaches his West Brom counterpart after the first goal . Congrats: Berahino put England en route to an important win with two goals during the U21 clash in Moldovo . Moldova U21: Koselev, Gheorghiu, Jardan, Focsa, Bogdan (Matei), Zasavitchi, Rata (Graur), Anton, Mirza, Milinceanu (Spataru), Dima . Subs: Buga, Paireli, Ursu . Bookings: Focsa, Matei, Jardan . Goals: NONE . England U21: Bond, Moore, Keane, Garbutt (Blackett), Lascelles, Forster-Caskey, Carroll, Redmond (Ings), Hughes, Berahino (Pritchard), Kane . Subs: Blackman, Gibson, Ince,  Woodrow . Bookings: NONE . Goals: Berahino (16, 52), Kane (85) Referee: Mete Kalkavan (Turkey) Attendance: 1,000 . Man of the match: Berahino . With Harry Kane completing the scoring, it was a satisfactory night and it was fitting Berahino was the key man. Southgate’s first match in charge of the Under-21s last September – against Moldova – was settled by a goal from the West Brom striker, so who better to bookend the campaign in Group One? Southgate, understandably, sported a content smile at the final whistle but there will be no standing back and admiring the job: dangers lurk in the play-offs and they will have to step up another level if they are to ensure this colourful journey ends in the Czech Republic next June. Games in this tournament often throw up unusual experiences but it going to be a while before Southgate’s squad sample another coach ride like the one that took them from Chisinau, where their base had been, into the heart of Transnistria, 43 bumpy miles away. Aside from the many goats and cows that were casually grazing on the grass verge of a three-lane highway, they then had to cross a border patrol – complete with armed soldiers standing guard – to get into one of Europe’s last communist outposts. The unusual journey had no effect on the way England began the contest. Southgate made five changes to the side that had been successful in Lithuania last Friday but those selected kept to the passing principles that their head coach is has been determined to implement. Chase: Harry Kane challenges for the ball during the U21 showdown between Moldova and the Young Lions . Looking on: Redmond collects a loose ball during the European U21 Championship qualifier in Moldova . With Swansea’s Tom Carroll, who was captain for the night in place of the rested Jack Butland, pulling the strings alongside Jake Forster-Caskey and Will Hughes, England were on the front foot from an early stage. Moldova had not conceded a goal at home in four games during this qualification campaign but, within 16 minutes, that record had been shattered as Berahino, who had a shot blocked moments before, rose to turn Nathan Redmond’s cross beyond Alexei Koselev’s reach. Given how briskly England had started, with Redmond and Berahino darting down the flanks and confusing the Moldovans by switching positions with one another, it was a surprise that they did not add to their lead before the interval. Sitting comfortably, Gareth? Southgate looks on during the clash between Moldova U21 and England U21 . Emerging: England took on Moldova and comfortably won in the U21 Championship qualifying match . If anything, there were guilty of a little complacency, as two moments of hesitation in defence allowed, first, Vadim Rata then Igor Dima to fire shots at Jonathon Bond’s goal that forced the England keeper to take action. But as was the case in Lithuania, England stepped things up in the second period and they got breathing space in the 51st minute when Harry Kane supplied an inch-perfect ball to Berahino, who confidently did the rest, rolling his effort into the far corner of Koselev’s goal. Two almost became three in the next attack but, this time, Berahino’s lob was too high after he had been sent scurrying away by Kane again. Berahino had another attempt shortly after but Koselev was equal to it, as he was when Kane unleashed a thumping effort from 18 yards. Kane, however, would not be denied and having scored the winner against Lithuania, he finally got in on the act in the 84th minute, thrashing an angled drive past Koselev. Job done, then. It will only be fully complete, though, if their winning run includes the play-offs. Well earned: England emerged 3-0 winners in the clash as Southgate's men ran riot in Moldova . Trained up: England's youngsters were put through their paces ahead of the match against Moldova U21 .","England's 3-0 hammering is Gareth Southgate's eighth consecutive win .

"Host commentator . Just as Barcelona looked in for a difficult afternoon thanks to a first half strike from Sergio Garcia, Lionel Messi sparked into action to steer his time to a brilliant 5-1 win. The diminutive Argentine scored a goal either side half-time before Pique headed Luis Enrique's side into a commanding 3-1 win. Substitute Pedro then got in on the act with a well-timed finished before Messi completed yet another La Liga hat-trick. 90mins: We're into stoppage time now at the Nou Camp where Messi has been at his sensational best. The home side, still in search of the sixth goal, will move two points behind Real Madrid. 86mins: Iniesta looks to play in Alves, but the Brazilian is offside as the ball runs out of play. The Barca players have certainly enjoyed this second half. Anything Cristiano can do, I can do better, says Messi as he bags a La Liga hat-trick of his own. Pedro, clear down the right, slides the ball across to Messi who strokes the ball home with the inside of his right boot. Looks like he really enjoyed that one. And it's four. Pedro gets in on the act to give the Catalan giants a 4-1 lead. Alba plays a long ball right onto Pedro's right boot, the Spaniard controls and lashes home to compound Espanyol's misery. 74mins: Messi has almost won the game on his own at the Nou Camp but still he tracks back, wins the ball and earns a huge cheer from the home fans. Pete Jenson: Suarez wont be happy about being taken off. Great chance to break the duck against a fading Espanyol side. Luis Enrique clearly not taking that into consideration. 70mins: Espanyol change as Caicedo makes way for Stuani. 69mins: Suarez is given a rest as Pedro enters the action. Messi sends the free-kick just over the bar. 68mins: Messi is scythed down by Alvaro, who rightfully receives a yellow card and gives Barca a free-kick from 20-yards out.  Can Messi bag his hat-trick? 64mins: Rakitic, who has impressed this evening, is replace by Andres Iniesta. Not a bad substitution... 62mins: Xavi looks for Alves with a delicate diagonal ball into the box but Casilla rushes out to stop the move in its tracks. 59mins: Change for Espanyol as Hector Moreno replaces Canas. 59mins: Barca have the ball in the back of the net again but Messi is flagged offside before giving the ball to Neymar to tap home. It's game over already! In eight second half minutes Barca have taken the game away from Espanyol as Pique heads the Catalan giants into a 3-1 lead. The attacking trio of Barca do indeed prove to strong for Espanyol. Neymar beats his man out on the left before feeding Suarez who sends a brilliant curling cross back to Messi. The Argentine nutmegs one defender with his left foot before curling the ball home with his right. Genius. 48mins: Neymar is barged off the ball by Eric inside the penalty area, but the referee waves play on. The Brazilian was almost through but just wasn't strong enough. We're back underway at the Nou Camp. Can Espanyol build on a strong first half or will Barca show their quality? Find out here... Pete Jenson: Messi's magic covering a multitude of sins. Barca slow, sideways, static and being held by mid-table Espanyol. Who else but Lionel Messi? Just when it looked as though Espanyol would take a deserved lead into the break, Messi picks up the ball outside the box, fakes to shoot before curling a delightful shot low past Casilla and into the net. 40mins: Espanyol come so close to doubling their lead following another bright counter-attack. Víctor Sanchez is played through by Garcia and finds himself one on one with Bravo, but a loose touch hands the advantage to the keeper who saves well. 36mins: The Catalan giants come close again. This time Suarez tries his luck from 18-yards out. However, the former Liverpool man snatches at his effort and the left-footed striker trickles past Casilla's left post. 33mins: Barca smell blood here. Messi looks like he's had enough of watching the game pass him by and jinks through tackles of two Espanyol defenders before just being crowded out inside the penalty area. 30mins: So close from Messi! He hits the crossbar with the free-kick he'd won just moments earlier.  Casilla was beaten all ends up. 29mins: Caicedo, who has been Espanyol's best player, wins the ball in his own half before bombing forward and feeding Garcia. Unfortunately for the travelling fans, Garcia's shot was tame and Bravo saved easily. At the other end, Messi is fouled on the edge of the area in a very dangerous position. The Argentine stands over the ball... 24mins: It's all a bit too predictable from Barca. Messi, out on the right, has done very little while Suarez is struggling to get into the game. Rakitic looks lively, but has just lost the ball on the edge of Espanyol's box after a loose touch. 18mins: Barca look to hit back through Messi, but the Argentine overhits his diagonal pass to Alba and out of play for an Espanyol corner. Pete Jenson: Busquets continues to be a shadow of the player he was under Pep Guardiola. And it's Espanyol with the opening goal! Sergio Garcia, who has started brightly capitalised on a mistake by Busquets before driving into the Barca box and finishing with his left foot. Pique backed off and backed off, allowing Garcia time and space for a shot. 7mins: The visitors enjoy their best moment of the game as good work down the left sees Sergio Garcia race to the byline before cutting the ball back across Barca's six yard box. Pique managers to clear with Caicedo lurking. 5mins: Rakitic swings in a deep cross from the right which looked to be gliding towards the head of Suarez at the far post. Alvaro is there to clear. The away side have started with two banks of four and have been leaving two men up, but are yet to see much of the ball. 2mins: Espanyol start brightly as Caicedo attacks down the left before Alba clear for Neymar to go off on his first sprint of the afternoon. The Brazilian beats two before passing to an offside Suarez. And we're underway at the Nou Camp as Espanyol start with the ball. So, Sergio Busquets will make his 300th Barce appearance this afternoon. His record so far isn't too shabby... Record so far in 299 games: 216W, 54D, 29L . Pete Jenson: Ahead of their warm-up Barcelona players pose for team photo with 'get well soon Thomas' messages on their shirts for the injured Vermaelen who was operated on last week. It's Pique and Mascherano in the centre of defence for Barcelona this afternoon. Cristiano Ronaldo scores his 23rd La Liga hat-trick to hand Carlo Ancelotti's side three points.

"Louis van Gaal has displayed a growing impatience with injured striker Radamel Falcao, saying he is not interested if the Colombia star has become frustrated over his slow return to fitness for Manchester United and telling him to just follow orders. Falcao has yet to complete 90 minutes since joining United on a one-season loan from Monaco in the summer, and is running out of time to convince the club to sign him permanently in a deal worth a total of £52million. The 28-year-old earns £280,000 a week at Old Trafford but has so far made just seven appearances — four of them as a substitute — and scored one goal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal lose his patience over Falcao questions . Louis van Gaal says Falcao must start buying into his philosophy if he wants to be a success at Old Trafford . Falcao's only goal for the club came against Everton at the beginning of October . Falcao (second right) is pictured holding his troublesome knee following the win against the Toffees . Falcao moved to United after recuperating from a serious knee injury that kept him out of last summer’s World Cup, and has recently spent six weeks on the sidelines with a calf problem. Van Gaal insists the former Porto and Atletico Madrid striker cannot currently play for more than 20 minutes and has used him off the bench in the last two games, preferring to put teenager James Wilson in the starting line-up against Stoke in midweek when Wayne Rooney was out with a knee injury. Rooney is expected to return alongside Robin van Persie in attack at Southampton on Monday night. Asked if Falcao is frustrated over his lack of progress, Van Gaal brushed aside the question saying: ‘I’m not interested. He has to follow my philosophy. Do you understand that? Yeah, I’m here because of that.’ The United boss indicated that he would rather have seen Falcao train more or play for the reserves than sit on the bench against Hull and Stoke, but his hand was forced by the injuries to Wilson and Rooney. ‘A bigger contribution is to play in the second team for 45 or 60 minutes or even 90 minutes,’ said Van Gaal. ‘But I couldn’t do that because I needed him when Rooney was injured (for Stoke) and Wilson was injured (for Hull). 'I selected him in spite of the fact he can only play 20 minutes at this level because the rhythm of the game in the Premier League is the highest.’ United can move above Southampton and West Ham into third place in the table if they extend their four-match winning run at St Mary’s. James Wilson was prefered to Falcao for United's home match against Stoke last week . Falcao was only used in the final 12 minutes by Van Gaal in the 2-1 win against Mark Hughes' side . Saints boss Ronald Koeman has offered a hand of friendship to Van Gaal by backing his fellow countryman to restore Manchester United to the glories their fans once took for granted. Koeman and Van Gaal have been at each other’s throats since a spectacular fall-out when the Dutchmen were manager and sporting director at Ajax in 2004. But this is the season of goodwill and Koeman appears ready to end the decade-long conflict. ‘He’s a great coach,’ said Koeman of his one-time mentor. ‘He needs time and he will get it at United. Van Gaal gives his then assistant Ronald Koeman instructions during their time together at Barcelona . While United have struggled, Southampton have exceeded expectations under Dutchman Koeman . 'The manager has a lot of experience and they have the money to buy the best players so of course they will be challengers.’ When pressed on their relationship, Koeman did admit: ‘I don’t say it is good; it’s correct and that’s the best word. What happened before was a working problem and I have to explain it like that. ‘It’s not an issue because it is eight or nine years ago.’ VIDEO 'Top four finish far from certain' - Van Gaal .","Radamel Falcao has featured in just seven games for Manchester United since joining from Monaco in the summer .

"Mesut Ozil owes Arsenal a big performance and what a place this would be to produce it. Back in his native Ruhr Valley, a world champion, making his 50th appearance in the Champions League. The stage seems perfectly set. Arsene Wenger accepts there will be intense scrutiny on his German trio, but the 80,000 fans who ignite Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalen-stadion with their high-visibility traditional yellow colours and an incessant din are unlikely to provide a generous homecoming for the World Cup heroes. Ozil is a product of fierce local rivals Schalke, 30 miles to the west, in Gelsenkirchen, although it is nearly seven years since he left for Werder Bremen and Real Madrid before Arsenal decided to invest a club record £42.5million in his talents. Arsenal star Mesut Ozil has struggled since the end of last season . Mesut Ozil will be hoping his campaign can take off for Arsenal in Germany . 0 . Ozil has yet to be involved in a goal for Arsenal this year —either scoring or assisting. In the Premier League and Champions League last season, he was directly involved in 17 goals at a rate of one every other game. 623 . He has not scored in 623 minutes of football for the north London club. 423 . In 136 La Liga and Champions League games for Real Madrid, Ozil created 423 chances, including 61 assists. In his 37 games in the same competitions for Arsenal, he has created 102 chances and set up 11 goals. Unhappy homecomings . Ozil began his career in Germany with Schalke and Werder Bremen but has not enjoyed playing back on home soil. In five matches away to German sides, he has won just once, drawing one and losing three, including Real Madrid’s 4-1 thrashing by Borussia Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League semi-final. Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp swerved the chance  to extol his qualities or to massage his confidence on the eve of such a vital fixture. ‘Even if he is a German player and a national, I don’t want to say anything about this,’ said Klopp. ‘That’s not an issue for me.’ Ozil is by some distance Arsenal’s most expensive signing and his flickering performances have been exposed by the instant impact of Alexis Sanchez, who arrived from Barcelona this summer for a mere £30m. As Sanchez proved when he ripped off his shirt after scoring against Manchester City on Saturday, he is more muscular and robust and in this regard better equipped to resist the rigours of the English game. Ozil’s more slender frame and subtle skills often seem in danger of being obliterated by the chaotic blur of the Premier League. Wenger, however, insists his contributions are too easily overlooked and he remains confident the 25-year-old will be successful in north London. Perhaps it will be in Europe, in Champions League football where he starts to show his true value. With defensive issues piling up, this is one of those games when the Arsenal boss could do with his many creative forces combining to seize the initiative. ‘They did the best job with the transfers this summer,’ said Klopp, when asked about Arsenal’s summer spree. Perhaps it will be in Europe, in Champions League football where he starts to show his true value. With defensive issues piling up, this is one of those games when the Arsenal boss could do with his many creative forces combining to seize the initiative. ‘They did the best job with the transfers this summer,’ said Klopp, when asked about Arsenal’s summer spree. Mesut Ozil celebrates scoring against Algeria in the World Cup, and his Arsenal anguish (above) ‘The squad has great stability and they are able to play the football Arsene Wenger wants to see, but they are even more serious because they have all options to close any spaces and are quick on the transition. 'They have players like Danny Welbeck and Ozil and Santi Cazorla, who has not played so much but shows great qualities when he plays.’ Last year, Wenger left Dortmund with three points after a stout defensive display and a goal from Aaron Ramsey, but this time it may have to be a different approach if they are to take the victory that would give them early control of Group D. Klopp’s team are familiar foes. It will be the third time these clubs have met in the last four years in the group stages. The Bundesliga runners-up are riddled with injuries which have ruled out important players such as Ilkay Gundogan, Marco Reus, Jakub Blaszczykowski and Mats Hummels. Mesut Ozil looked relaxed in training ahead of the clash with Borussia Dortmund . Per Mertesacker says Arsenal will look to put down a marker against Borussia Dortmund . Robert Lewandowski moved on to Bayern in the summer but Shinji Kagawa has lifted spirits since his return from Manchester United, scoring on his debut against Freiburg on Saturday. ‘It was sensational,’ said Klopp. ‘I was kind of surprised he was on the market once again. Maybe he didn’t fit in. We saw the chance and took it.’ It has been Arsenal’s failure to top the group which led them into the clutches of Bayern Munich and an exit at the first knockout stage in each of the last two years. ‘The first game will show where we’re at,’ said Gunners centre back Per Mertesacker. ‘The group is tough and we have to show from the start we are ready and focused.’ This Champions League will end in Germany, with a final in Berlin in June and, for three of the four English clubs involved, it starts against opposition from the Bundesliga. The nation is on a football high after their triumph in Brazil and Wenger will hope to enjoy some of the benefit with Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Mertesacker thriving on the added motivation of a home final. Arsene Wenger admits there's added pressure on his German players ahead of facing Borussia Dortmund . Arsenal’s Germans played more in Brazil’s than Dortmund’s, but an ankle injury ruled Ozil out of the homecoming games against Argentina and Scotland earlier this month, and Mertesacker quit international football after the World Cup. ‘It is always a pressure when you come back to your country,’ said Wenger. ‘The attention is a bit bigger, that’s for sure. Wojciech Szczesny would be under scrutiny in Poland. ‘It’s not such an advantage for us to have three German players because we know Dortmund anyway. We play them each year. ‘The World Cup final in Rio was on July 13 and they came back to training on August 11. That means I gave them one month of holiday. It was important for me that they would recover. They have been training for one month and haven’t reached 100 per cent physically yet. But they’re close.’","Gunners ace in line for his 50th Champions League appearance this week .

"No sooner had Sergio Aguero made a tearful exit from the Etihad Stadium than Manchester City were closing ranks to insist that they can prosper at home and abroad without their talismanic striker. Aguero limped off with damaged ligaments in his left knee just 75 seconds into the 1-0 victory over Everton after tangling with Toffees midfielder Muhamed Besic. City’s 19-goal top scorer is almost certainly out of Wednesday’s decisive Champions League showdown with Roma and, most likely, the majority of the busy festive programme after the Premier League champions won their fourth league game in a row to cut Chelsea’s lead at the top to three points. Sergio Aguero goes down holding his knee early in the game with Everton and was forced to go off . The Manchester City striker has suffered knee ligament damage and could miss the Roma clash . Aguero looked in pain as he hobbled off the field in the first five minutes of the 1-0 win over Everton . 53.1% - Scored or assisted 17 of City’s 32 Premier League goals this season (53.1 per cent). 7 - Aguero’s goals alone have won City seven points this season - more than any other player besides Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal), Christian Eriksen (Tottenham) and Charlie Austin (QPR). 2 - Without Aguero’s goals City would drop from second to fourth in the table on 26 points - 10 behind Chelsea. Their goal difference would also drop from +18 to +4. 4th - He also has the fourth-highest shot accuracy (60.71 per cent) and shot conversion rate (25 per cent) of all players with 20 shots or more. Those who have, in recent weeks, questioned whether City are becoming a one-man team are about to get their answer. With Stevan Jovetic injured and Edin Dzeko fit only to play the last half an hour from the bench, Manuel Pellegrini sent on Jose Angel Pozo in place of Aguero for only his second Premier League appearance. The decision to allow Alvaro Negredo to return to Spain on loan with Valencia last summer without signing a replacement now seems more curious than ever. James Milner, who won the penalty that enabled Yaya Toure to score the decisive goal, said: ‘People can say whatever they want if they think we’re a one-man team. Some people have been saying Chelsea had won the league 10 games in and here we are with a three-point gap. ‘Losing Aguero will be a big miss. He is a world-class player, one of the best on the planet, and has been absolutely outstanding so the injury has come at a bad time. Manchester City players gather around Aguero as he lies on the ground and receives treatment .

Manchester City's Yaya Toure gives his side the lead from the penalty spot as the champions go 1-0 up . Toure makes no mistake as he converts his penalty to give City the lead . Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard dives the right way but is unable to save Toure's penalty . Gareth Barry’s booking against Everton makes him joint top with Lee Bowyer and Kevin Davies on the all-time list of Premier League yellow cards with 99. James Milner was the fifth most-appreciated player in the Premier League on the new High5it app this weekend - voted for exclusively be fans. 'Sergio is very, very difficult to replace but we have a lot of firepower. With the players we do have up there I’m not too worried. ‘Edin coming back is a positive and he’s a fantastic goalscorer. Hopefully Stevan should be available (for Roma) as well. We have a fantastic squad of players.’ City’s task in Rome will not be easy. Toure is suspended and Vincent Kompany is a major doubt. David Silva is back in training and City are more optimistic that he can return after missing eight games with a knee injury. Fernando slides in for a crunching tackle on Samuel Eto'o during the match on Saturday . Jovetic and Fernandinho face late fitness tests. After Aguero’s hat-trick heroics against Bayern Munich last month revived their Champions League hopes, City must get at least a draw in the Stadio Olimpico to have a chance of reaching the last 16. Milner added: ‘We will go there to win. It won’t be easy - Roma are a good team and I’m sure it will be a great atmosphere. ‘I’ve played in Italy before with City and England and you get a hostile atmosphere. You look at the experience we have in this squad, and that sort of atmosphere won’t bother anybody. ‘Personally, I love it when you hear the boos and whistles. It makes you raise your game. In previous seasons we have proved that, when we know what we have to do to win - like we did with our two league titles - we can do it. It could be a great European tie.’ Everton boss Roberto Martinez was furious after Ross Barkley received his second caution for diving in two weeks. He felt that Frank Lampard’s tackle on the young midfielder was no different to Phil Jagielka’s clash with Milner which resulted in the penalty. ‘I couldn’t believe the yellow card,’ said the Everton manager. ‘The penalty was two bodies coming together and then you see the same action, but because Ross Barkley is involved he gets a yellow card. It’s so inconsistent and disappointing.’ Ross Barkley (centre) appears to be pushed to the ground by City's Frank Lampard .

"Ejected from a glass tube with great force, four shrimps fly through the air at breakneck speed, heading towards a drenching of flour, eggs and breadcrumbs before whizzing towards a flamethrower, where they are flash-grilled to perfection. The crazy cooking technique was developed by the Japanese, and according to the directions in the video, a plate of lightly battered shrimp is ready to eat in just three seconds. The Japanese-narrated video showcases a host of gadgets including air cannons, CO2 tanks and flame throwers. The shrimp have been stuffed into glass air cannons, which shoot the crustaceans out at great speed .

The film starts with two ladies displaying the ingredients needed to create the battered shrimp dish. They both don safety goggles before a step-by-step explanation of the devices involved begins. First, beaten eggs are poured into what seems to be a large silver canteen. Then we see four inverted triangular containers which are filled with flour. The camera then moves to the glass air cannon, which the shrimp have been stuffed into. A push of a button activates the individual devices in the four-step process and flames – which will quickly cook the shrimp - shoot out of the fourth apparatus.

"What was supposed to be a moment for Richard Cockerill to revel in Leicester’s famous victory descended into an incredible personal attack as Martin Castrogiovanni launched an expletive-laden outburst against his former boss. ‘Where is the English media? I want to speak to the English media,’ said the long-haired Italian prop as he stormed into the post-game press conference. He then lashed out at Cockerill and slammed the East Midlands club for the way they dealt with his move to Toulon in June 2013. Castrogiovanni, who made 149 appearances during seven seasons with Leicester, used the vilest epithet to describe the club’s director of rugby following suggestions that he left the club for a pay rise. He also claimed his former employers no longer treat staff with respect. VIDEO Scroll down for highlights of Leicester's win over Toulon . Martin Castrogiovanni launched an extraordinary personal attack on his former coach Richard Cockerill . ‘I thought f****** Leicester were f****** amateur,’ said Castrogiovanni. ‘He was saying that people go for the money but he has a lot of f****** squad players who get paid as well. I paid my own f****** money to leave this club. I don’t need the money to play rugby. I love this game and I used to love this club. ‘I still love this club but I never want to speak with Cockers any more. I am not fake. If I hate you, if you have been a ****, I will never speak to you again. I don’t hate anyone. Peace and love. I just don’t like ****s.’ The rise of England tighthead Dan Cole effectively ended Castrogiovanni’s tenure as the club’s premier prop. Cole got the better of his former team-mate in Sunday night’s Champions Cup tie and the hosts won an early scrum penalty to take the lead, with promising Welsh youngster Owen Williams kicking 20 points to go with Brad Thorn’s 20th-minute try. Cockerill (above) attempted to diffuse the situation after Castrogiovanni expletive-laden post-match outburst . Toulon’s points came through tries from Bryan Habana and Drew Mitchell, with Argentina fly-half Nicolas Sanchez kicking his side into losing bonus point territory. But the significance of the result was overshadowed by Castrogiovanni’s outburst. ‘I never had the opportunity to defend myself when I left,’ added the 33-year-old. ‘Cockers talks about the money, but the real reason I left this club is because you have Cole and you have me. Cole paid gets paid half the money from the RFU and I am foreign. 'You have a good f****** tighthead prop playing for England and a hairy, fat Italian. The thing is that they made it look like I went for the money but I paid £100,000 from my pocket to leave this club because I want to play rugby. That’s it. Former All Blacks lock Brad Thorn scored a crucial 20th minute try for Leicester against Toulon . ‘I always love this club and I wanted to clarify and talk face to face, which is something Cockers never does. I think in the last few years people are getting sacked and this club was not like that before. They used to respect people, now they act like nothing is going on. That is not from the club, that is from the guys in charge.’ Cockerill had already addressed the media before the outburst but returned and attempted to defuse the situation after Castrogiovanni returned to the changing rooms. ‘I’ve a lot of time for Castro — he’s a fantastic player and icon for this club and a great guy,’ said the Tigers coach. ‘I always said I would pick on merit and I did. Dan Cole was third choice behind Julian White and Castro and worked hard to become first choice. Castro was released a year early and we agreed a transfer fee with Toulon. I don’t want him to feel bitter towards us. One day we’ll have a beer together and smile about it.’ Leicester fans have complained about alleged abusive comments made by Toulon full-back Delon Armitage. Leicester are likely to investigate the claims this week. Toulon came roaring back into the contest, however, with winger Bryan Habana scorching over in the corner .

"They are the misfits and understudies who have emerged as Newcastle United’s leading men. For no matter the obstacles which are presented – injury, suspension or failure of form – the Magpies manage to put on a show. On Saturday, during their 2-1 victory over Chelsea, the team included; a 21-year-old goalkeeper making his professional debut, a local lad previously deemed a back-up option, another native of Tyneside seemingly headed for the exit door, a rookie Spaniard plucked from their second tier and a striker the manager suspects isn’t fit. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alan Pardew praise homegrown star Jak Alnwick . Jak Alnwick (left) celebrates with his Newcastle team-mates after making his professional debut . Alan Pardew and the Newcastle bench celebrate at the full-time whistle at St James' Park . Meet Jak Alnwick, Paul Dummett, Sammy Ameobi, Ayoze Perez and Papiss Cisse. Before them, unlikely heroes such as Gabriel Obertan, Mehdi Abeid and Rolando Aarons had all starred in a remarkable run which now reads seven wins from nine. But perhaps Alnwick best demonstrates the newfound resolve and depth of a squad which failed to win any of their first seven in the Premier League, leaving Alan Pardew on the brink of unemployment. It was just a few weeks ago that Alnwick banged on the boss’s door and told him he had been let down by the club after just one loan spell – at non-league Gateshead – in four years. But if the young custodian felt aggrieved with his hometown club and his manager, he certainly did not show it after being thrust into the action as a half-time replacement for the injured Rob Elliot, himself deputy to the sidelined Tim Krul. Sammy Ameobi (left) looked certain to be heading for the exit door, but now finds himself in the starting XI . Alan Pardew bemoaned the amount of injury time at the end of the match against Chelsea . Within 60 seconds he flattened Diego Costa and then pulled off a string of saves as the league leaders poured forward in search of parity late on. Alnwick, though, resisted. ‘Coming on was amazing, but this is what I’ve been working towards and I was ready for it,’ he said. ‘I was a bit nervous at half time, but that (clattering Costa) was a massive moment. That first touch, if you can make a good punch or anything really, will always give you confidence for the rest of the half.’ By chance, Alnwick’s mum was in the crowd at St James’ Park for the first time in four years. Alnwick's mum was in the crowd for the first time in four years to see her son's professional debut . Ayoze Perez has also been impressive in his first few months at St James' Park . ‘Most of my family were there, my mum and dad and my girlfriend. It was amazing because obviously they’ve supported me the whole way,’ he said. ‘They are all lifelong Newcastle supporters. I grew up supporting Newcastle and to play for them in front of 52,000 and beating Chelsea at home, that’s what dreams are made of. I’m looking forward to maybe having a run in the team now.’ Alnwick’s dream debut was made possible thanks to the match-winning double of substitute Papiss Cisse. Papiss Cisse has struggled with injury, but came off the bench to score twice for Newcastle . Cisse's goals condemned leaders Chelsea to their first Premier League loss of the season . Pardew still doesn’t have the confidence to start with the Senegal frontman – who returned from knee surgery in September – but three goals in two cameos from the bench in the past week could change that ahead of Saturday’s trip to Arsenal. And Cisse said: ‘I feel fit. I’m good. The gaffer just made the decision to put me on the bench. I don’t know why but I’m okay. I’m not angry, I just wait for my time and even if it’s just five minutes I will try to do well for those five minutes.’ Cisse and Alnwick may have the odd gripe with Pardew right now, but they, like the rest of their team-mates, haven’t let him down on the pitch. Rather, the Magpies misfits are coming together just nicely.","Newcastle's 'misfits' came together to beat Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday .

"A U.S. Air Force spy plane was forced to veer into Swedish airspace to avoid being intercepted by Russian fighter jets over the Baltic Sea - just one day after Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was blown out of the sky by Russian-backed rebels. The Top Gun-style pursuit on July 18 seems like a replay of Cold War maneuvers. It even involved a Cold War-era aircraft, the 1960s RC-135 Rivet Joint - which is designed to intercept and decode communications. The disaster that happened in the skies over eastern Ukraine just one day earlier raised tensions even more. On July 17, according to U.S. intelligence officials, a Russian BUK surface-to-air missile shot down a civilian airliner and killed all on 298 people aboard. Western authorities say Russian separatists fired the weapon, believing that the airliner was a Ukrainian transport plane. The RC-135 Rivet Joint was conducting a subservience mission in international airspace when Russia scrambled fighter jets to intercept it . The Air Force spy plane had been flying near Kaliningrad, a heavily-militarized Russian territory on the Baltic Sea that is geographically isolated from the rest of Russia, according to the New York Times. The U.S. Air Force said it was in international airspace over the Baltic when Russia launched fighter jets to intercept the RC-135. 'The aircraft commander, acting in a professional and safe manner, maneuvered the aircraft to avoid a possible encounter by Russian aircraft,' the U.S. military's European Command said in a statement. Swedish news media reported that the jet veered over Gotland Island, which is part of Sweden. The Daily Telegraph reports that the incident played out like a scene from the 1990s jetfighter thriller 'Top Gun.' The Swedes, who are not members of NATO, chastised the Americans for the maneuver when they realized the U.S. military plane was in their airspace without permission. The U.S. military has all-but apologized to Sweden, saying that the aircraft was sent over the country 'incorrectly by U.S. personnel.' The American jet was conducting a surveillance mission near Kalingingrad, Russia, when it was forced to veer into Swedish airspace . The U.S. military's European Command also said it would work with Sweden 'to prevent similar issues before they arise,' the Times reports. Tensions with Russia have escalated rapidly after President Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops to reclaim the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in February. The Russian military's troop buildup on the Ukrainian border, along with allegations of Russian support for separatist forces in eastern Ukraine has led NATO - Russia's Cold War adversary - to step up its military presence in eastern Europe.","The Swedes, who are not part of NATO,  informed crew of the RC-135 that they had crossed into their sovereign airspace without permission .

"Floyd Mayweather has his ex-lover calling him a monster and suing him for plenty of his hard-earned millions. He has a rapper who used to be his friend and business partner trying to humiliate him with false accusations that he is illiterate. He has the dangerous duo of Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan jostling at the head of the queue to be his opponents next year in what he insists will be the last two fill-your-bank-accounts fights of his career.

Mister Money also believes that whenever he enters the ring the opposite corner is occupied by not only the latest challenger to his status as the best-for-pound fighter in the universe but also a host of boxing fans and critics praying for him to lose his cherished unbeaten record. Then he has all those high-powered cars to keep polished, all the jewel-encrusted watches to wind, his kids to take out to Fatburger and his promotions company to expand into what he expects to become the biggest in the hardest game. Meanwhile he has a million or more pay-per-view subscriptions to sell for this Saturday’s Las Vegas rematch with Marcos Maidana, the macho Argentinian who dragged him into his most rugged brawl of recent years. At 37, there should be times when he feels like he’s going on 65. Yet he looks fresher than the daisies which spring up the Nevada desert the morning after it rains here. And he lasts a lot longer. Amir Khan is hoping to set up a fight with the American superstar next year . Floyd Mayweather is the main focus for the camera bulbs as he promoted his fight in Las Vegas . Those flowers wilt within hours under the sun but Mayweather keeps a spring in his step. Not only that but he does not appear to have a care in the world. This is not only the highest-paid but probably the most single-minded of athletes. Ms Shantel Jackson alleges – among other un-pleasantries endured between being showered with gifts like a $2.5million 17-carat diamond – that Mayweather held a gun to her head, imprisoned her in his bling-laden home and berated her with foul-mouthed insults in public. Mayweather shrugs off Ms Jackson’s law-suit and Mr 50 Cent’s ‘tragic’ slur on his education as ‘just circus stuff to which I pay no attention.’ As it happens there is always the smell of greasepaint around his fights, which intentional or otherwise keeps selling the tickets at a rate which earns him around $40m a time. This enterprise also demands that he focusses his mind away from all the hassle of his garish life. ‘Nothing ever distracts me from a fight,’ he says. ‘Nothing.’ Floyd Mayweather in one of his favourite poses - with a pile of dollar bundles . Floyd Mayweather leaves his private jet in Washington - the boxer owns one jet for him and one for his team . Not even the prospect of being jailed, which he was for a previous conviction for assault and battery of a previous lady partner. Certainly not now that he can see the giant safe at the end of the prize-ring’s tunnel of pain. One final year of submitting to his own constantly repeated mantra – ‘hard work, dedication’ - should bring in another $150m. At least double that if he agrees to meet Pacquiao in one – or even both – those climactic fights next May and September. For the moment, the Money Man is denying the assertion of the PacMan camp that they are in ‘serious negotiations’ to finally make the super-fight which the world has been waiting an eternity to see. ‘I can’t say what comes after Maidana,’ he reiterates. ‘I never allow any distractions from my next opponent.’ Since Maidana roughed him up in the MGM Grand for several rounds before becoming his 46th victim four months ago, that absolute concentration on the job at hand is probably advisable. Not that many here expect him to have as much trouble second-time around. Floyd Mayweather Jr has revealed that his rematch with Carlos Maidana could be one of his final fights . Floyd Mayweather Jnr (pictured) will take on Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas on Saturday . Khan, who may be at ringside as he keeps up his pursuit of a fight with Mayweather before the great man retires, expects Maidana to be ‘chasing shadows on Saturday night.’ Britain’s two-time world champion – who awaits confirmation of an opponent for an interim fight in the US on December 6 - holds firm to the belief that ‘my speed is the one element which can give Floyd more problems than he has had of late.’ The waiting game goes on for Khan and Pacquiao, who defends his version of the world welterweight title against Chris Algieri in Macau next month. The show goes on for Mayweather, circus or not.

"World Cycling will show FIFA the way when it comes to transparency around a major inquiry when their doping investigation reports in February. FIFA continue to prevaricate on how much of Michael Garcia’s probe into World Cup bid corruption will ever be made public because of confidentiality issues despite a global demand that it is seen in full. But Brian Cookson, British president of UCI — cycling’s ruling body — has promised their own investigation into cycling’s chronic drugs problem will be published in full. UCI President Brian Cookson (left) says his organisation, unlike Sepp Blatter's FIFA, will publish their report . The question of confidentiality will be solved by redacting any names or detail where there is an issue. FIFA, who have left it to compliance chief Domenico Scala to decide how much of Garcia’s findings to release, should follow Cookson’s lead.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter should be suitably embarrassed at the IOC Congress when age-limit proposals are rubber-stamped that will mean him stepping down when he reaches 80 in May 2016. By then he could be just a year into an unbelievable fifth term as FIFA overlord with three more years to go. Blatter made his most impassioned IOC speech during the Sochi Winter Olympics when he argued that any age limit was ‘discriminatory’. Sepp Blatter may be forced to step down from the IOC in 2016, although he is likely to still be running FIFA . McIlroy needs a push . Rory McIlroy‘s two majors and a Ryder Cup success makes him the strongest candidate to become Sports Personality of the Year. Nothing is certain, however, with golf always seeming reticent about promoting its cause — as seen when the St Helens’ rugby league side beat Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup squad to the 2006 team award. Despite his two major wins, Rory McIlroy might be hampered in the BBC poll by golf fans' refusal to vote .

Sport England chief Nick Bitel has defended his organisation’s use of the Active People Survey when it come to deciding funding. APS was due to be published last Thursday but flaws in an outside company’s data research means it has been delayed until the end of next month. This brought criticism from some sports that Sport England are far too influenced by APS findings when awarding funds. One leading figure calling the statistics ‘deeply flawed civil servant nonsense’. But Bitel said: ‘APS is a fantastic tool that we have trusted to deliver long-term trends in participation. But it is not the only research we use and sports tend to like or dislike APS depending on how the results affect them.’ The British Olympic Association have stayed in-house when choosing their director of communications. The job has gone to the loyal Miriam Wilkens after she showed great passion and enthusiasm for the role — despite there being a long list of outside candidates.","Brian Cookson confirms cycling governing body will push for transparency .

"Once he had dismissed defeat as an unfortunate ‘anomaly’ and, childishly, the fault of the ball boys, Jose Mourinho sought necessary to declare what his team had failed to prove on the pitch – ‘We are better than anybody else’. The Premier League table, of course, supports his assertion. But, for the second successive weekend in the North-East, the Chelsea boss was on the defensive. Five points have been surrendered at Sunderland and now Newcastle, the gap to Manchester City shrunk from eight to three. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mourinho blame the Newcastle ball boys . Jose Mourinho was unhappy with the ball boys during the latter stages of Chelsea's match at Newcastle . Chelsea were condemned to their first defeat of the season after two goals from Papiss Cisse . Mourinho, however, felt the need to serve a reminder amid the hyperbole of their first defeat of the season. ‘We are top of the league,’ he said. ‘Nobody has done better than us. Everyone would like to be in our position. So we are more than fine. We are better than anybody else.’ But they were not better than Newcastle, proof that resistance resides within a league which many expected them to waltz through undefeated. In the course of seven days, Gus Poyet - who stifled the league leaders in a goalless draw - and Alan Pardew have co-authored the manual on how to contain and expose the title favourites - it should be on the wish-list of every top-flight manager this Christmas. John Terry can only watch on as Cisse's strike hits the back of the Chelsea net at St James' Park . Cisse tucks away his second goal against Chelsea on Saturday - a huge three points for Newcastle United . Mourinho, though, will not be penning the foreword in support of the uprising. ‘We were unlucky. It is as simple as that. The best team lost. The team that tried to win, lost,’ he sounded. Jose Mourinho has never won in the Premier League at St James’ Park, losing three times and drawing once . ’For people like me who have been in football for so long you have to accept this anomaly. ‘Newcastle did what they always do. They defended. They fought hard. They tried to counter attack when it was possible. This is the way they play against us.’ Mourinho’s gripe was not merely confined to the grown men on the pitch, but also the young boys around its perimeter. Bizarrely, he criticised the speed at which they returned the ball – at one point, two appeared - as the visitors chased parity during what was a generous helping of six minutes added time, insisting that he himself would never encourage such tactics. Mourinho looked frustrated on the bench at St James' Park, but insisted his side are still the best . Rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick (left) celebrates with his Newcastle team-mates after they beat Chelsea . The excuse lacked substance and, indeed, class. ‘Things were happening that the referee cannot control,’ he said. ‘He cannot punish the ball boy that disappears. ‘You may as well put a cow in the middle of the pitch, walking. And then stop the game because there was a cow. You cannot do just anything in football. You have to defend. You have to defend with your 10 men, put the 10 in front of the goal line, bring the bus, but football needs a ball, not two or zero. Do what you can to win, but not everything.’ If the attack was designed to deflect attention from his players, it worked. But amid all of the bull about cows and ball boys, it should not be forgotten that Chelsea’s offensive threat has gone cold in the chill of Wearside and Tyneside. On Saturday they could not break down a team which included second-choice goalkeeper Rob Elliot and then his rookie understudy Jak Alnwick, and was also reduced to 10 men following Steven Taylor’s dismissal. Mourinho also praised the Newcastle supporters at St James' Park, labelling them a 'good, good crowd' The scorer of Newcastle’s goals, Papiss Cisse, has been troubled by injury problems of late but was still too sharp for John Terry and Gary Cahill in poaching his match-winning brace. Diego Costa, meanwhile, has scored just one in four since returning from a hamstring layoff and the Brazilian-born striker was shackled by Argentine Fabricio Coloccini at St James’ Park. The recent absence was designed to rid him of his lingering fitness issues but has instead stalled the momentum which saw him smash 10 goals in his first 12 games. Mourinho concedes his £32million marksman is not firing right now. ‘He has to improve his condition,’ he said. ‘He was injured, he had many doubts and he had a long time without training and that obviously must have an effect on a player – the way he runs, the way he moves, his coordination. He has to recover but I don't think there is any problem. For me, the problem is not the goals. The goals will come as a consequence of his condition.’ Mourinho looked disappointed during his interview with BT Sport after the game, bemoaning the ball boys . VIDEO Mourinho accepts 'unlucky' defeat . Last week, at Sunderland, Chelsea also failed to take all three points after a 0-0 draw at the Stadium of Light . Mourinho, it appears, will wait for Costa to come good, evidenced by his decision to restore him to the starting XI ahead of midweek scorers Loic Remy and Didier Drogba, who headed hope of a comeback following his second-half introduction. It was, though, in vain and Chelsea - who entertain Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday having already qualified for the Champions League knockout rounds - must now bid for a return to winning ways in the league at home to struggling Hull next weekend. Mourinho was critical of the atmosphere inside Stamford Bridge last month, likening it to an ‘empty stadium’. But that was one concession he was prepared to make about the passion and noise at St James’. ‘They are a good, good crowd,’ he said. ‘They are very enthusiastic. That is big. That is their way of living the game.’ At last there was a touch of humility to accompany defeat. At this point, however, he chose to cut short his post-match reflection - praise for anyone other than his players is not something which rests easy with Mourinho. For they, at least according to him, are still better than anybody else.","Chelsea lost their first game of the season against Newcastle on Saturday .

"Easy as one, two, three. Mark Hughes didn’t need to over-complicate this victory — the message was simple. Get the ball wide, put Arsenal’s fragile defence under pressure and reap the rewards. This was nothing to do about intensity or the Britannia Stadium resembling a cauldron — the Gunners simply weren’t good enough and couldn’t deal with what was thrown at them. They were outplayed — both in and out of possession. Hughes sounded as if the Potters had just routinely beaten a Burnley or Leicester, not a team boasting Alexis Sanchez and who have spent more than £100million on a revamped squad over the past year. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wenger heckled at Stoke-on-Trent train station . Bojan Krkic looked as though he wouldn't be out of place at Arsenal's London Colney training ground . Arsene Wenger has come under heavy criticism from some sections of Arsenal fans after a bad run of form . ‘We wanted a fast start, we talked about it beforehand and we felt that if we put the ball into good areas we’d have a chance against the back four we were facing,’ Hughes said. Saturday was the first time Arsenal have conceded three goals in the first half against a team other than Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United . He certainly got it. Nineteen seconds was all it took for Arsenal’s back four to part ways. ‘They’ll always try to be creative in the final third and rotate and circulate the ball so we talked about how when we did win it, we had to be progressive with our first pass and then drive the game the other way.’ Almost as predictable were the seven words in two telling sentences that will fill a large section of the Arsenal support with serious justification for demanding change at the top. On trying to front up after their season plunged to new depths, Arsene Wenger uttered the sort of reasons for defeat which may come back to haunt him. Peter Crouch scored after 19 seconds as Stoke raced to a 3-0 lead over Arsenal on Saturday afternoon . Firstly, that ‘anger doesn’t help’, even when three goals down at half-time. Then that ‘we have to learn’ from the mistakes leading up to each goal. The fans, unfortunately, are tired of hearing it. They want Wenger to lose his cool and address a flimsy backbone; instead he is trotting out the same excuses which now won’t wash with the majority. ‘Of course you’re angry when you’re 3-0 down at Stoke. But anger doesn’t help, you need to see what you can do to come back,’ Wenger said. ‘Honestly, I feel the spirit of the team is great and they want to do well. ‘Stoke were out of the blocks sharper than us and we have to learn from that. I think we were just too tender in the challenges, not decisive on corners and crosses.’ Wenger (left) reacts to a disappointing Arsenal performance on the Britannia Stadium bench . Arsenal struggled to deal with Bojan (right) for large periods - Chambers was sent off for this challenge . This is from a man who only last week said he expects the Gunners to win a Premier League title before his contract expires in three years. They are a long, long way off and he knows it. Arsenal were unlocked not by a player of Stoke’s ilk, but one who would look at home at London Colney. Mathieu Flamini was incapable of dealing with Bojan Krkic, signed from Barcelona in the summer, and the visitors never recovered from the early flurry. Wenger has seen his side fail at the Britannia for the last four years but never before have they been so obviously outplayed. But while it seemed clear where the problems lay, Arsenal, and their ailing manager, failed to address them. ‘You come out of the game and think...’ Wenger said, puffing out his cheeks. ‘It’s unbelievable you didn’t get anything out of this game just because we didn’t start well.’ Frankly, not even Arsene is believing that rationale any longer.","Arsenal were beaten 3-2 at Stoke, after being 3-0 down at half-time .

"A photographer has captured these poignant pictures showing the life of the outcast transgender people in Bangladesh. Shahria Sharmin decided to get to know the transsexual minority group, known as Hijras, who are shunned from society in most of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Her eye-opening portrait series, titled ‘Call me Heena’, highlights the struggles faced by males who choose to live as females – known as the ‘third’ or ‘unknown gender’. Scroll down for video .

Meeting Heena, 51 (pictured above) changed the Bangladeshi photographer's opinion of the transgender community she had been brought up to see as less human . The 42-year-old Bangladeshi photographer, who is currently studying in London, said: ‘In Bangladesh Hijras hardly get an opportunity to have a normal life. ‘They do not have any school to study, no temple to pray in, no government and private organisations would want to see them in their employee list. ‘They have no access to legal system nor do even health service providers welcome them.’ She added: ‘I, like almost everyone else in my society, was raised to see them as less than human. Their habits, way of life, and even their looks marked them as apart, different and deviant. 'Always desiring to be a mother I have adopted Boishakhi. But I wonder what if she calls me father someday,' said 27-year-old Salma, a newly transgender mother . In Bangladesh Hijras hardly get an opportunity to have a normal life.

Hijras have been part of South Asia’s culture for thousands of years but it was only when the British came to power in India in 1897 that outraged colonists introduced a law classing them as criminals. The word ‘hijra’ is an Urdu-Hindustani word derived from Semitic Arabic root meaning ‘leaving one’s tribe’. In 2013 the Bangladeshi Government formally recognised hijras as a third gender. This was followed by India in January of this year.

"We last knew her as a retired grandmother-of-eight, the surprise winner of The Great British Bake Off. But it seems Nancy Birtwhistle has undergone a remarkable transformation in the months since her victory. The 60-year-old – dubbed ‘Gadget Gran’ because of her ingenious home-made kitchen implements – showed off an unexpectedly glamorous side in a new glossy magazine photoshoot. Nancy Birtwhistle, 60, (pictured) is a retired grandmother-of-eight and the surprise winner of The Great British Bake Off  - she has recently undergone a glossy makeover for a women's magazine interview . Posing for Woman & Home magazine, she revealed she has started paying more attention to her grooming after winning the BBC1 show, treating herself to professional blow dries, wearing false eyelashes and even engaging the services of a professional beautician. And she said she ‘loves’ the attention her new-found fame has brought her so much she regularly stops in the street to have ‘selfies’ taken with her fans. Mrs Birtwhistle’s new found confidence and glamour is a far cry from the unassuming character who won Bake Off just two months ago. She said: ‘I don’t know what the definition of celebrity is, but I’ve loved life since winning Bake Off. I get to do glamorous photoshoots like this, talk at events, such as the Cake & Bake show, and I even get recognised in the street. Her new found confidence and glamour is far cry from unassuming character who won Bake Off (pictured) Mrs Birtwhistle revealed she has started paying more attention to her grooming after winning the BBC1 show, treating herself to professional blow dries, wearing false eyelashes and visiting a professional beautician . ‘Some people just do a double take, while others will come over and say, “I know you from somewhere, I can’t think where it is.” Then there’s the avid Bake Off fans who know straight away and take selfies with me. It’s bizarre but great fun.’ Mrs Birtwhistle is a retired GP practice manager and lives with her husband Tim, 63, in Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire. She admitted she has started paying more attention to her appearance since winning Bake Off, including wearing false eyelashes. She said: ‘When they first put false eyelashes on me on Bake Off, I felt ridiculous but now I love them. 'I’ve discovered you can get subtle individual lashes that are less obvious than the big things you wear on television, so now I have a beautician come round every three to four weeks and redo them. Mrs Birtwhistle (centre) pictured with Luis Troyano (left) and Richard Burr (right)  - she was crowned champion of this year's Great British Bake Off with a surprise win over Richard, who had been the hot favourite . ‘It’s great because I don’t have to worry about wearing eye make-up anymore.’ Mrs Birtwhistle said she ‘hates’ shopping for clothes but is ‘addicted’ to scarves, with a collection of around 50 in her wardrobe. Her husband – who made a kitchen implement out of a drainpipe that helped her construct her Bake Off showstopper – even made a special tie rack to hang them on. And she now prefers to get her hair washed and dried professionally rather than do it herself. She said: ‘I hate drying my hair so I rarely wash it myself. For the full interview see the January issue of Woman & Home (pictured) which is on sale now . 'I go down to the local salon and treat myself to a blow-dry once a week instead. 'That’s my one indulgence. Well, that and the false eyelashes.’ While she may be known for her skills in the kitchen, Mrs Birtwhistle said she has a surprising fondness for shop-bought, ready-made Chicken Kiev, which she eats with chips and salad. And perhaps surprisingly for a woman her age, she is now hooked on Twitter. She said: ‘I joined just before Bake off went on air and I went from zero to more than 21,000 followers in a matter of weeks. ‘I used to think people spent too much time on their phones, but I can understand it now. 'It’s highly addictive.’ Mrs Birtwhistle now hopes to bring out a cookery book and start a new career in baking. She said: ‘I used to be Tim’s PA, so I’m enjoying having him as my helper now. 'He’s been fielding all my phone calls, emails, letters and requests. ‘Women should have equal rights and equal pay, and I hate to see men trying to dominate women. 'However, I do still believe in old-fashioned chivalry so I’m not sure I can call myself a true feminist. 'I still want a man to give up his seat for me.’ For the full interview see the January issue of Woman & Home, on sale now.","Nancy Birtwhistle underwent a makeover for a magazine photoshoot .

"Champions League winner Paul Scholes believes Liverpool could be a good outside bet to win this season’s competition. Liverpool, the five-times European champions, are returning to the elite event this season after a five-year absence. The Merseysiders begin their campaign on Tuesday by hosting Bulgarian champions Ludogorets and will also play holders Real Madrid and Swiss side Basle in Group B. Brendan Rodgers talks tactics with his Liverpool squad ahead of their Group B clash . Scholes, a member of the Manchester United side that won the 2008 final, expects Anfield to be a tough place for visiting sides. The 39-year-old, speaking in his role as a pundit for ITV’s Champions League coverage, said: ‘Liverpool are the dark horse of the competition this year. ‘Brendan Rodgers has done a fantastic job. The style of play he’s adopted is exciting to watch and the players seem to have taken to him. I feel they will do well with the players they have. ‘The big advantage they have is a home crowd. Anfield is always a hostile place to go, which is something Manchester City lack.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be looking to use the Anfield crowd to his advantage . Liverpool qualified for the Champions League after a superb 2013-14 campaign in which they finished close runners-up to Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League. Since then they have lost their talisman Luis Suarez to Barcelona, but Scholes thinks Mario Balotelli could prove a good replacement. Speaking about Suarez, Scholes said: ‘He’s a great player, but don’t forget they’ve signed Balotelli who, on his day, can be a match winner too.’ City are hoping to make a greater impression in Europe this season after reclaiming the Premier League crown. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has been backed to fill Luis Suarez's shoes . They reached the knockout stages for the first time last term and Scholes believes going further will be manager Manuel Pellegrini’s top priority. City begin their campaign against 2013 winners Bayern Munich on Wednesday and also face CSKA Moscow and Roma. He said: ‘Champions League will be their main focus for the season. Their owners will want to see them push on in the Champions League. ‘They have a tough group this year, but with the players they have they need to go on to win it, and there’s really little excuse not to do well.’ Paul Scholes believes Liverpool are a good outside bet for the Champions League . Scholes doubts whether Arsenal, who face Borussia Dortmund, Anderlecht and Galatasaray, will have the fortitude to seriously challenge for the trophy. He said: ‘They always qualify and always seem to get through the group. The only problem with Arsenal is when they meet top teams, they don’t seem to have the consistent level of mental strength to get through it.’ Chelsea have made a strong start to the season in the Premier League and Scholes thinks the domestic title might be Jose Mourinho’s priority. He said: ‘Whilst The Champions League is the ultimate trophy for any club team, I believe Chelsea’s main objective is winning the Premier League this season. Paul Scholes says winning the Premier League title will be Jose Mourinho's priority . ‘If you ask Jose Mourinho what you’d rather win now, I think the answer would be the Premier League.’ United failed to qualify for the Champions League this season and, despite their stature, Scholes is not sure the competition will miss his former club. He said: ‘Maybe, but there’s still a lot of major clubs in it. ‘Let’s just hope it’s one year, you have to earn the right to be in it and they haven’t done that for this season.’","Former Manchester United midfielder reckons Reds are good outside bet .

The Argentina striker is out of the decisive Champions League clash at Roma on Wednesday and also fears he will miss the next five Premier League games plus an FA Cup third round tie. City will allow the swelling around Aguero’s knee to go down for up to 48 hours before he goes for a scan. Only then will they know exactly how long the striker will be out, but Aguero has privately expressed his fears after saying ‘he felt something strange happen inside’ the joint.

"In the run up to Christmas, it can be tempting to try anything to shift a few pounds. But wacky diets endorsed by celebrities don’t live up to the hype – and can be downright dangerous, experts have warned. The British Dietetic Association says that despite endorsements by the rich and famous, fad diets are not the best way to lose weight. Its annual list of the worst celebrity diets includes the popular Paleo or Caveman diet. Said to be followed by stars Matthew McConaughey and Megan Fox, it advises eating like our stone age ancestors and avoiding ‘modern foods’ such as bread, pasta, cereal and dairy products. Scroll down for video . Beyonce, Matthew McConaughey and Megan Fox are all rumoured to use the diets the British Dietetic Assocatiation describes as 'fads'. Experts there have warned these eating plans don’t live up to the hype and can be dangerous . But the BDA says this is little more than a ‘Jurassic fad’. It warns that refusing to eat any dairy products could leave people dangerously low in calcium and weaken their bones. The BDA also says that eating like a caveman is time-consuming and socially isolating. Perhaps the strangest-sounding trend on the list is people swallowing a spoonful of clay a day in the hope of detoxing the body and staying in shape. But the practice not only doesn’t help you slim, the BDA warns, but can cause serious problems, from constipation to arsenic poisoning. Also on the BDA’s hit list is the ‘Vegan Before Six’ diet – thought to be beloved of Beyonce – as eating only vegan food before 6pm is just more likely to make you binge on unhealthy foods in the evening. But the British Dietetic Association says ‘a vegan diet doesn't automatically translate into a healthy diet’. 'He's just started the Oliver Reed diet' It warns: ‘The danger is that post-6pm becomes a window of opportunity to hoover up a myriad of foods high in calories, saturated fat and packed with added salt and sugar, undoing your healthier choices. ‘The reality is, eating different food groups at different times of the day doesn’t matter. ‘In terms of your health, it’s the nutritional balance that’s important.' The association, which counts more than 7,500 dieticians as members, also advises against trying to cut out all sugar. Although some celebrities claim to have done this, it is almost impossible to do. Plus, it would mean avoiding vegetables, fruit and nuts. BDA spokesman and consultant dietician Sian Porter said: ‘It seems that as a nation we are constantly on the search for the magic bullet approach to losing weight, wanting a quick fix to give us the bodies we see so often on TV, in glossy magazines and adorning billboards up and down the UK. ‘The truth is that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.’","British Dietetic Association says fad diets are not best way to lose weight .

"Sir Elton John was thankfully still standing after a comical fall during the Mylan World Team Tennis Smash Hits charity event at the Royal Albert Hall on Sunday. There were audible gasps from the crowd as the 67-year-old singer fell backwards off his chair as he watched Team Elton John take on Team Billie Jean King in a tennis exhibition event held to raise funds for his AIDS Foundation. But Elton quickly brushed himself off and got back to his feet before watching his team suffer a 22-16 defeat as former British No 1 Tim Henman rolled back the years with a clinching victory against former US Open champion Andy Roddick. VIDEO:  Sir Elton John's fall at the Albert Hall . Sir Elton John topples backwards off his chair during the World Team Tennis event at the Albert Hall . The 67-year-old was unhurt after the embarrassing incident, and waved to the crowd with Billie Jean King . The team tennis concept has been well-received in Asia recently through the newly-launched International Tennis Premier League - and it also proved a hit in London with the crowd lapping up the entertaining tennis on show. The format featured one set of men’s and women’s singles, men’s and women’s doubles and mixed doubles with sets being played as the first to five games with a best-of-nine-point tiebreaker at 4-4. Every game counted towards the overall score and to make sure that play did not drag on too long, a number of rules variations were introduced with sudden death points at deuce and no let serves. And it did not take long for them to have an impact in the first match of the evening as Team Elton John’s Martina Hingis and Heather Watson took on Kim Clijsters and Sabine Lisicki. John McEnroe, playing for Team Elton John, chases a forehand during his defeat in the men's doubles . The stars pose for a selfie, taken by former World No 1 Andy Roddick, on the court . Former world No 1 Hingis could only smile as she forgot about the no let rule and stopped after her serve hit the net cord with Clijsters taking full advantage by stepping up and putting away a forehand return. But Hingis made up for her faux pas with some impressive volleying as she and Watson won the match 5-4 (5-2). Andy Roddick - who earlier in the day lost the final of the ATP Champions Tour event to Chilean former world No 5 Fernando Gonzalez - then teamed up with John McEnroe but the Team Elton John pairing were hammered 5-0 by the British combination of Henman and Jamie Murray. Heather Watson plays a forehand during the team competition as she and Martina Hingis won their match . McEnroe offers the 22-year-old British player some advice during her match at the Albert Hall . Former Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki was too strong for 22-year-old Brit Watson as the German won 5-3 in their singles clash to put Team Billie Jean King in control at 14-8. But Hingis, the 34-year-old who still plays on the professional doubles tour, and McEnroe gave Team Elton John a lifeline with a 5-3 victory against Murray and Clijsters. Any hopes of a comeback, though, were dashed by Henman, aged 40, who, despite facing booming serves of 130mph plus, beat 32-year-old Roddick 5-3 in their first meeting for ten years. Sir Elton is all smiles as he sits between Watson and Hingis during the women's doubles match . Former Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki hits a forehand during her defeat of Watson in the singles .

It’s my debut in World Team Tennis and Billie Jean and Elton just do such a fantastic job. ‘It’s brilliant. The matches are moving along quickly. It’s got a great history and hopefully the event can go from strength to strength and we can continue to raise some amazing funds for a great charity.’","The 67-year-old singer toppled backwards at Albert Hall event .

"Blackpool striker Nile Ranger has been questioned by police after he had a row in the middle of the motorway, it has been reported. The former Newcastle man is said to have been driving along the M55 near Preston on Friday night when he got into an argument with his girlfriend - who was in a separate car. It is believed police were called to the busy carriageway in Lancashire to speak with the couple, who had been shouting at each other with their windows down. Ranger appeared in court last year (left), after a fall from grace that saw him initially playing for Newcastle . A witness, who nearly crashed into them, told the Sunday People that Ranger, 23, was in his Mercedes in the middle lane and his girlfriend was in the first lane in an Audi. They claim they had stopped to argue for a couple of minutes before the cars started moving - only to stop minutes later where the dispute resumed. 'We nearly crashed into them and a taxi nearly went into them too,' the motorist said. 'At first we thought it was one of those bash-for-cash insurance scams. We thought they were trying to get people to crash into the back of them. The footballer is believed to have been driving along the M55 near Preston when the row erupted on Friday . 'We were shouting out of the window for them to get into the hard shoulder. That's when we rang the police.' Ranger, who now plays for Championship club Blackpool, and his girlfriend eventually pulled over where he told the witness they had split up and were arguing over her giving back his keys. The onlooker, who did not even recognise the footballer, told the paper the incident lasted about 20 minutes and she was going to London but had not given his key back. The controversial player, who was fired by Swindon Town earlier this year after he was caught on CCTV punching a woman, took to Twitter on Sunday. He tweeted: 'Media are bloody desperate lol...itching to mess me up...lol #desperado,' which was followed by a second post: 'Lol... Next thing I know I'm gonna spill some milk for my cornflakes. And be in the media for that.. 'NILE SPILLS MILK FOR HIS CORNFLAKES'. The player, who was once paid £5,000-a-week to play for Newcastle United, was arrested on suspicion of rape last year but was cleared of the charges in March. Ranger represented England at under-19 level on 11 occasions, scoring six goals . A formidable talent on the pitch has given Nile Ranger opportunities most youngsters can only dream of. But the striker, who represented England at under-19 level, has had his promising future hampered by a string of brushes with the law. Ranger previously has spoken of how he got embroiled in gang culture while growing up in London. He served an 11-week sentence in a young offenders' institution when he was 15 after he took part in an armed robbery. But despite saying 'I never want to go back', the striker found himself again facing charges in 2011, after a 33-year-old man was found outside a Newcastle pub with a broken jaw. In October 2012 he was finally cleared of two counts of actual bodily harm relating to the incident, after a court heard his actions were in self defence and he had been the victim of racist taunts. But he was also handed a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting assaulting two police officers who were trying to arrest him in connection with the fight. Before that case was even resolved, Ranger was given a six-month conditional discharge after admitting a charge of being drunk and disorderly, and sentenced to 120 hours community service after admitting pulling his then-girlfriend's hair during a row. In the meantime, he was also rapped by the FA and his then club, Newcastle United, for posing with a replica gun in a photograph that was subsequently published in The Sun and making homophobic remarks on Twitter. In January last year, Ranger was arrested on suspicion of rape. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in March this year. He refused to apologise to a woman after writing off her parked car while swerving to avoid a fox in May 2013. Ranger found himself in more car-related trouble this year when he was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay compensation to the driver of a taxi he broke the window of. He was again fined for criminal damage in July after repeatedly kicking a jammed door at his penthouse suite in Swindon, where he played in the 2013-14 season. CCTV showed him damaging 'a lift door, wall and glass panel', and also appeared to show him hitting his girlfriend in the face three times. In May, Ranger was cleared of being drunk in charge of his sports car after he was found asleep behind the wheel on the M4 in Wales.

"A U.S. Air Force spy plane avoided a run-in with the Russian military just one day after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a suspected missile allegedly fired by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. CNN reports that the RC-125 Five Joint evaded the Russians by flying into Swedish airspace without Sweden’s permission. The plane may have traveled into other countries' airspace as well and it's unclear as to whether the plane had permission to do so. Avoided danger: An RC-135 Rivet Joint Reconnaissance aircraft avoided a dangerous run in with a Russian jet on July 18 by by flying into Swedish air space . CNN reports that a U.S. plane was flying in international airspace to eavesdrop on the Russian military on July 18. This is just one day after the Malaysian Airlines flight 17 crashed down in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board the commercial flight. The Russians began tracking the U.S. spy plane with land-based radar and even sent a fighter jet to intercept the U.S. plane, said an official on Saturday. Once the crew on board the spy plane realized they were being tracked, they tried their best to get out of the area as soon as possible. The closest escape from the Russians was in Swedish airspace where they entered without gaining clearance with the country first. CNN reports that the United States is speaking with Sweden about the fact that they may need to enter Swedish territory in the event the U.S. needs to avoid the Russian military in the future. One day before: Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by an alleged missile just one day before the U.S. flew their spy plane into Sweden . The breach of territory was first reported by the Swedish Media outlet DN.se. But Russian officials have not yet replied with their reaction. 'We acknowledge a U.S. aircraft veered into Swedish airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with Swedish authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they arise,' said the U.S. State Department. This is the second potentially dangerous run in the U.S. has had with the Russians in two months. On April 23, a Russian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet nearly collided with a U.S. Air Force RC-135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan, . Even though Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter one another, the land radar activity by the Russians in this particular instance was 'unusual.' Pro-Russian rebels still deny that they shot down the Malaysian plane and say that Russia didn't supply them with equipment to shoot it down.","An RC-125 Five Joint evaded the Russians by flying into Swedish airspace without Sweden’s permission on July 18 .

"'We must play on' was Michael Clarke’s message to his team-mates when he spoke so movingly at Phillip Hughes’ funeral. And play on he will, having declared himself emotionally ready to lead Australia in the first Test since Hughes’ death. Clarke’s hamstring had been the physical concern leading up to the rearranged match, but the biggest worry was his torn heart, and emotions which will take much longer to heal. Clarke also talked at the funeral of feeling Hughes’ spirit around him; that spirit will be very much among the players at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday as they poignantly named him as 13th man in their side. A state memorial service meanwhile, which had been slated to take place at the Sydney Cricket Ground, has been cancelled in consultation with Cricket Australia and the Hughes family. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird explained the decision, saying, 'All parties felt that given the enormous outpouring of support at last Wednesday's funeral, a state memorial service would no longer need to be held.'

Clarke was excused the captain’s traditional pre-Test media conference, and so Mitchell Johnson was given the task of announcing the Test XI, with Clarke as skipper, and Josh Hazlewood and Shaun Marsh missing out. 'It’s a huge boost to have him (Clarke) back paying for us,' said Johnson. 'With his captaincy - and he’s shown how strong he’s been over the last couple of weeks with the tragedy that we’ve had – it’s really nice to have him back. He’s a tough captain. We just want him to score runs and be that aggressive captain.' Johnson, chief aggressor for Australia with the ball, was inevitably asked about the use of his bouncer, which had Kevin Pietersen admitting to feeling 'petrified' when England were turned over during the Ashes 12 months ago.

I know our boys will be going out there playing the best cricket we can, and if that’s bowling the short ball like we have been, that’s what we’ll do. We’re not going to change a thing.' The feeling was shared by Virat Kohli, who will captain India in a Test for the first time in place of the injured MS Dhoni. 'I don't think that's even a thing of debate,' said Kohli. 'The bouncer is a part of cricket and it is every bowler's right to utilise it.' 'If and when it is involved in our plans, we will use it. I don't think we will drift away from our plans. Kohli has been deeply affected by Hughes’ death, and was closer to the Australian than most in the India side. He said: 'After attending the funeral I was as emotional and as taken aback by the incident, because Phil was one of the guys I used to interact with when he used to come on tours and even in Australia. I did a camp with him in 2008 in Brisbane so I knew him from then. It was an equally saddening and emotional moment for me as well.

"Robbie Keane scored an extra-time winner to hand Landon Donovan the perfect retirement present as the Los Angeles Galaxy beat the New England Revolution 2-1 to claim the MLS Cup. The Irishman was named the MLS' most valuable player last week and lived up to that billing with a dramatic winner in a contest when he and side were not at their best. Gyasi Zardes had put the Galaxy ahead, but Chris Tierney grabbed the equaliser to take the final to extra-time where Keane netted his 20th goal of the season.

Gyasi Zardes wheels away in celebration after giving LA Galaxy the lead seven minutes after the break . As for Donovan, the 32-year-old brought down the curtain on a career which has seen him become the league's all-time top goalscorer with a sixth MLS Cup. Victory gave the Galaxy a record fifth Cup, beating the Revolution in the final for a third time. The Galaxy took the lead in the 52nd minute when Stefan Ishizaki whipped in a cross from the right and Zardes did brilliantly to take three touches on his right foot, keep two defenders at bay, and fire into the far corner with his left. Keane had a golden opportunity to add a second in the 70th minute when he burst forward and got one-on-one with Bobby Shuttleworth, but his toe-poke finish was saved by the goalkeeper. And the Galaxy were made to pay in the 79th minute as a long ball down the left was gathered by Patrick Mullins, who squared a pass for Tierney to apply a smart finish and level things up, thus sending the game to extra-time.

After the match Keane expressed his delight on the win when speaking to ESPN saying: 'It was a tough game.  think there was a lot of nerves there by both teams. 'We didn't play as well as we know we can at home but it doesn't really matter now. At the end of the day we won and we're the champions again.

"Daley Blind has warned his new Manchester United teammates that they will have to follow Louis van Gaal's directions 'exactly' to return success to the club. The £14million midfielder was unveiled alongside fellow deadline day signing Colombian striker Radamel Falcao as the dawn of a new era was raised at Old Trafford on Thursday. Blind  revealed how important it was for him to be reunited with his former national coach who guided Holland to the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup - while offering an insight into Van Gaal's well travelled methods. VIDEO Scroll down for Daley Blind: Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is strict . Get shirty! New signings Daley Blind (R) and Radamel Falcao are unveiled at Old Traffford .

'Van Gaal is really important for me. He gave me a lot of trust during the World Cup and I’m happy to work with him again,' he said. 'He is very strict and direct in what he wants. The players have to do exactly what is best to win the game and every game could be in a different style. 'He reads the game so well and his predictions about the game come true almost every game and that’s how we can prepare 100 per cent.' There have been question marks over where the former Ajax star would play in the team since he can perform a variety of positions, but the 24-year-old insists heis willing to play in any position Van Gaal asks of him. 'For me, it’s important I can play both as a defender and midfielder,' he said. 'If it’s a game on the left as a defender or as a midfielder it’s up to the coach and I’ll try to do my best.'

'We need the youth education, that is the policy of Manchester United also,' he said. 'When you don't let go of players to other clubs then you never allow to give youth players a chance. Because of this policy, we will give youth players a a chance. The question is if they take the chance. It's of course more risky but it's the only way to do it, and United have always grown players in the squad. 'More than eight positions are vacant. They are vacant for the youth. I have already used a lot of youngsters in pre-season and also in the season. I am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them. I can't do that for them. 'The possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that. Manchester United have come to me because of that.' he added.

"She is barely out of university, but a bright young inventor has come up with an idea that could spell the end of use-by dates on food. Solveiga Pakstaite, 22, has developed a label that changes texture as the food inside the packet goes off. The sticker, which contains gelatine, starts off smooth but over time develops bumps as the gelatine decays. How it works: The sticker, which contains gelatine, starts off smooth but over time develops bumps as the gelatine decays. A smooth label means the food is good to eat and a lumpy label shows it should go in the bin . A smooth label means the food is good to eat and a lumpy label shows it should go in the bin – meaning someone can tell simply with a swipe of a finger whether their food is out of date. Miss Pakstaite, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said: ‘I wanted to create a label that would change its texture over time to model the decay process of food and drink. ‘Why gelatine? Because it is a protein, so it decays at the same rate as protein-based foods like pork, milk and cheese. ‘And the gelatine can be adapted to match the expiry period of the food by altering the concentration. ‘So, the higher the concentration, the longer the gel will stay solid. The label simply copies what the food in the package is doing, so the expiry information is going to be far more accurate than a printed date.’ Inventor: University graduate Solveiga Pakstaite, 22, pictured, has developed a label that changes texture as the food inside the packet goes off . The graduate, whose Lithuanian parents are computer scientists, has applied for a patent for her idea and is talking to several firms about developing it commercially. If it is taken up, it could help to solve the vast waste problem created by inaccurate use-by dates. Seven million tons of food are thrown away every year in Britain, costing around £480 per family. Miss Pakstaite, who finished her degree in design and technology at Brunel University in London this summer, said her inspiration for the Bump Mark label came after working with blind people during her course. ‘I wanted to create a solution for enabling visually impaired consumers to gain expiry information about their food, as currently the only indication is a printed date,’ she said. ‘From the start, I knew that the solution must appeal to sighted people also, because the sad reality is that new solutions only get implemented by companies if the benefits are useful to the majority. ‘This is why I worked to create a cheap solution that could be applied to existing food packages and also provides information that even sighted people haven’t had access to before: information about the actual condition of food.’ Miss Pakstaite is today announced as the British winner of the James Dyson Award for product design, winning £2,000 in prize money. She will now be entered into Dyson’s international contest. The label’s design went through more than 20 versions before it was submitted to the Dyson judges. Answer? The Bump Mark label could help to solve the vast waste problem created by inaccurate use-by dates. Seven million tons of food are thrown away every year in Britain, costing around £480 per family . Last year a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers blamed use-by dates for the waste of edible food. It found up to half the food we buy in supermarkets goes in the bin despite much of it being perfectly edible. The report said: ‘There is confusion over labelling and sell-by dates, with many people opting to throw away perfectly good food.’","Solveiga Pakstaite's label changes texture as food inside packet goes off .

"Japan could be wiped off the face of the earth by a massive volcanic eruption some time in the next century killing almost all of its 127million inhabitants, according to a new study. Experts analysing the eruption patterns of volcanoes on the island nation say it is 'not an overstatement' to predict that a natural disaster could leave the country 'extinct'. Scientists at Kobe University looked at a massive volcanic crater on Kyushu Island, which has erupted seven times in the last 120,000 years. Scroll down for video . Scientist warn that Japan could be made extinct in the next century by eruption which would kill 95 per cent of the country's 127million inhabitants (pictured, Mount Ontake erupts in September killing 51 people) They predicted that another eruption on the southern island would bury 7million underneath lava flows, while westerly winds would carry a huge pall of ash and dust to Honshu. The toxic cloud would make the neighbouring island 'unliveable', they said, while saving the 120million living in major cities and towns would be 'hopeless'. Professors Yoshiyuki Tatsumi and Keiko Suzuki calculated that the risk of such an eruption occurring in the next 100 years  was around 1 per cent. However, they said that figure could not be ignored, as the chance of a major earthquake striking Kobe within 30 years was estimated at about one percent just a day before a 7.2-magnitude quake destroyed the Japanese port city in 1995, killing 6,400 people. 'Therefore, it would be no surprise if a colossal eruption occurs at any moment,' the study added. The news comes just weeks after Mount Ontake, in central Japan, erupted suddenly in September, killing 51 people, some of whom were children. Researchers predicted that another eruption on southern island of Kyushu would bury 7million underneath lava flows, while another 120million would die on the neighbouring island of Honshu from ash and dust . Most of those who died were hikers who were standing and taking pictures near the summit when the mountain erupted in the country's worst volcanic disaster for 90 years. It also comes amid warnings that a volcano in southern Japan located 40 miles from a nuclear plant was showing signs of increased activity that could possibly lead to an eruption. Ioyama, a mountain on the south western island of Kyushu, has also been shaken by small tremors and other signs of rising volcanic activity recently, indicating that it might also erupt. One tremor lasted as long as seven minutes, an official at the Japan Meteorological Agency's volcano division said.","Scientists say explosion could kill 95 per cent of country's 127million people .

"Lionel Messi needed just two goals to reach a career total of 400, but instead he provided two brilliant assists, with Neymar the beneficiary both times as Barcelona’s South American duo put Athletic Bilbao to the sword. The final member of what will become Barcelona’s fearsome attacking trio, Luis Suarez, watched on from the sidelines as he continues to serve his suspension, with breakthrough star Munir El Haddadi starting for the third consecutive game instead, putting in a lively display. Luis Enrique opted to leave centre-back Gerard Pique on the bench, instead pairing Javier Mascherano, back from suspension, with Jeremy Mathieu, back from injury. Neymar, meanwhile, also began among the substitutes after his midweek exertions for Brazil. VIDEO Scroll down to watchLuis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar star as FC Barcelona release slick new season promo . Brazilian forward Neymar, a second half substitute, scored a brace to hand Luis Enrique's side victory at the Nou Camp . Neymar scored two goals in five minutes for Barcelona, both goals were set up by Argentine team-mate Lionel Messi . Neymar has had an impressive couple of weeks - first captaining Brazil to a 1-0 win over Colombia (where he scored the winner) and now with a brace against Athletic . Barcelona: Bravo, Montoya, Mascherano (Pique 46), Mathieu, Alba, Busquets, Rakitic, Iniesta, Munir (Neymar 63), Messi, Pedro (Sandro 77). Subs: Ter Stegen, Xavi, Sergi Roberto, Adriano. Booked: Busquets. Goal: Neymar 80, 84. Athletic Bilbao: Iraizoz, De Marcos, Gurpegui, Laporte, Balenziaga, Susaeta (Ibai 64), Iturraspe, Benat (Unai Lopez 64), Mikel Rico (Viguera 83), Muniain, Aduriz. Subs: Iago Herrerin, San Jose, Iraola, Etxeita. Booked: Aduriz. Referee: David Fernandez Borbalan. Attendance: 80,081 . Enrique scored a hat-trick against Athletic in a 7-0 win at the Nou Camp back in the 2000-01 season, but Barcelona are still finding their rhythm under the Asturian and we may have wait a while to see a similar demolition. The match started at a high tempo, with Claudio Bravo being forced to swipe away a cross from the left after a smart Ander Iturraspe interception started the move. But Barcelona responded well, with Munir firing wide of the top left corner shortly afterwards, before Pedro had an effort from close range well saved by Gorka Iraizoz. Barcelona fans sang for independence after 17 minutes and 14 seconds, as they usually do. It had more meaning today, shortly after Catalonia’s national day, with a special canvas draped down one stand of Camp Nou as a nod to it. The teams were both wearing ‘nationalist’ kits, with Barcelona’s red and yellow striped ‘senyera’ shirt representing the Catalan flag, while Athletic sported green, white and red, the colours of the Basque Country’s Ikurrina flag. Munir had another great chance around 20 minutes in, lashing over the bar from the edge of the box, when he should have hit the target. And after 40 minutes he could have had a free run at goal, but his first touch was poor. Instead he rolled the ball to Messi, whose shot was blocked. In between the two Barcelona chances there were two strong penalty claims for Barcelona. The first saw Munir barged into from behind by the goalkeeper Iraizoz. The ball fell to Messi on the edge of the box, but instead of giving a penalty or waving play on, referee David Fernandez Borbalan gave Athletic a free kick. The second saw veteran defender Carlos Gurpegui shove Munir to the ground and then tumble over himself. Again, Borbalan saw no infringement. A couple of minutes before the interval a cross from the left came all the way though the box and Ivan Rakitic thumped it at goal, but Iraizoz was equal to it. He was on hand again to deny Munir smartly from almost underneath the crossbar, before the teams went in goalless. Barcelona's talisman Lionel Messi is challenged by Athletric Bilbao's French defender Aymeric Laporte during their league match at the Nou Camp . Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona players walk out on to the pitch as pro-independence supporters hold up letters which spell out 'We will be free' New Barcelona signing Ivan Rakitic slides in on Athletic Bilbao's Mikel Balenziaga at the Nou Camp . Mascherano was hooked at half-time after taking a boot to the head from Athletic striker Aritz Aduriz mid-way through the first half. The forward was deservedly booked for his high foot misdemeanour. Barca came out from the break like they meant business and within a few minutes had the ball in the back of the net. Jordi Alba cut the ball across from the left as Munir burst into the box and fired home, but it was ruled out for offside. Munir was behind Alba when he played the ball, so it was the wrong decision. The suspended Luis Suarez was watching on from the stands and would have relished some of the opportunities that Munir and Co passed up. Enrique decided enough was enough, and brought on Neymar for the youngster. La Masia's latest talent, Munir El Haddadi has made his debuts for Barcelona B, Barcelona and Spain Under 19 and 21, and Spain in 2014 . Athletic midfielder Ander Iturraspe dribbles with the ball as Barcelona pair Javier Mascherano and Martin Montoya close him down . Three-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi heads the bull under pressure from Athletic Bilbao defenders at the Nou Camp . The Brazilian almost had an instant impact, but was chopped down on the edge of the box. Then he lashed wide from 25 yards and would have been set for an easy tap-in, but for a rare misjudged ball by Andres Iniesta. Neymar recovered the loose ball and tried to find Messi, but the excellent Aymeric Laporte cut it out. Excellent that is, until his poor pass straight to Sergio Busquets, which the midfielder fed to Messi. The Argentine looked up and split Athletic’s defence, leaving Neymar just to stroke it past Iraizoz. Athletic hadn’t been able to muster much going forward, but Iker Muniain’s splendid dribble left Pique in a tangle, but the defender recovered his balance to deny the tricky forward. It was all they could offer, before Barcelona’s South Americans combined again to put the game out of reach. A typically brilliant solo dribble by Messi took him into the box, before the Argentine flicked the ball back to Neymar. The Brazilian took a touch to steady himself, then another to plant the ball in the bottom right corner and settle the game. While there is still more to come from Enrique’s Barcelona side, in terms of fluidity and attacking edge, he will be delighted with his 100 per cent record so far. And the clean sheet is their third from three La Liga games this season, matching a record they last achieved in 1993 – when their third game was also against Athletic Bilbao.

But if Tottenham go onto win the Europa League this season, this drab stalemate in Serbia will be lucky to make the commemorative DVD. As goalless draws go, this was pretty awful. But when Mauricio Pochettino arrives back in England in the early hours of the morning, he'll know it could have been so much worse. Tottenham striker Harry Kane rattled the crossbar from a tight angle with a thunderous shot but it was the closest that Spurs game to a goal in the first half . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino shakes hand with Partizan boss Marko Nikolic ahead of his first game as a manager in full European competition . Andros Townsend, who was booked in the first half for showing dissent to a linesman, is thrown off the ball by Partizan's Vladimir Volkov . Partizan Belgrade: Lukac, Vulicevic, Branko Ilic, Stankovic, Volkov, Grbic, Drincic, Cirkovic, Pantic, Sasa Ilic, Lazovic. Subs: Kljajic, Petrovic, Luka, Fofana, Ninkovic, Andrija Zivkovic, Markovic.

Subs not used: Vorm, Chiriches, Dier, Eriksen. Referee: Alon Yefet (Israel) But for a 10 minute spell at the start of the game, Partizan Belgrade dominated this encounter without finding the goal their performance probably deserved. Pochettino made 10 changes from the side that started against Sunderland on Saturday, Hugo Lloris the only survivor from the 2-2 draw. There were full debuts for summer signings Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli, while Harry Kane was handed another chance to impress ahead of Roberto Soldado whose Spurs career goes from bleak to virtually non-existent. Speaking on Wednesday night, Pochettino insisted the Europa League remained a priority for Spurs, despite his decision to leave behind a host of senior first-teamers for the trip to Belgrade. It's safe to say Spurs fans need convincing, however; just 150 making the trip to Serbia for the encounter. But Kane very nearly gave them something to shout about inside the first minute, hitting the cross bar with a sharp angled shot after Partizan failed to deal with Ben Davies' corner. It was a promising start for the visitors, who despite 10 changes, looked far from disjointed during the opening exchanges. Click here for your ultimate stats zone from the big game, including this pitch map from Harry Kane's disappointing first half . Left back Ben Davies was given a start in Tottenham's first Europa League game of the season and he did his best to get forward and boost his side's attacking threat . Andros Townsend reacted badly to a decision from the linesman and this dissent earned the Tottenham man a booking . After failing to convert Tottenham's most clear-cut chance in the first half Harry Kane became a peripheral figure, rarely getting the ball in front of goal . Slowly but surely though Partizan, who have won all five of their Super Liga games this season, broke into their stride with Miroslav Vulicevic and Petar Grbic, in particular, causing Spurs problems down the Serbians' right side. Danko Lazovic saw his shot blocked by Fazio in the 15th minute following excellent work from impressive right winger Grbic. Partizan continued to find Spurs' left side a fruitful outlet as Davies struggled to make the desired impression on Pochettino. The Argentine manager took the decision to leave regular left-back Danny Rose back in England; you wondered if he regretted that given Davies difficult start last night. Andros Townsend tried to shift the flow of the game towards, but his trademark runs down the right were too few and far between for Pochettino's liking. Davies' below-par display continued on 30 minutes when Grbic once more eluded the Welshman's attentions before picking out Sasa Ilic at the back post, only for the Partizan captain to blaze wildly over the bar. Townsend needlessly earned himself a yellow card in the 34th minute for angrily remonstrating with one of the assistant referees after he was adjudged to have fouled Vladimir Volkov. Benjamin Stambouli, making his full debut for Tottenham in the centre of midfield, challenges for the ball with Partizan's Lazar Cirkovic . Andros Townsend was constantly involved for Tottenham in their first Europa League tie of the season but unable to have much of an impact in the final third . At least someone in a Spurs shirt was showing a semblance of passion, though. Spurs did little to back up their manager's claim the Europa League would not be an after thought this season, centre-backs Fazio and Jan Vertonghen the only two to produce a decent 45 minute display. The only crumb of comfort for Pochettino came in the fact that they were still on level terms, Lloris making a good save from Danilo Pantic in the final minute of the first half after a rapid Partizan counter attack to ensure that was the case. It was all too slow from Spurs. No urgency, particularly in the attacking third. And it didn't get much better for the visitors after half-time as Partizan continued to dominate proceedings. Tottenham defender Federico Fazio, who won the Europa League last season with Sevilla, made his first start for Spurs at centre back in Belgrade . Brazilian midfielder Paulinho battles for the ball with Partizan's Vladimir Volkov as Tottenham attempted to stamp some authority on the game, without much success . Spanish striker Roberto Soldado came off the bench to try and give Tottenham some extra firepower but he shot wide with this acrobatic volley . Davies nightmare continued three minutes after the restart as he received a booking for hauling down his chief tormentor Grbic after the Montenegrin beat him yet again. Lloris was forced into another save in the 50th minute, comfortably holding Grbic's shot after Lazovic's pass. The France No. 1 denied Grbic yet again in then 60th minute, diving low down to his left to save the midfielder's curling effort. Spurs weren't improving, and their manager knew it. Aaron Lennon struggles to get away from Partizan Belgrade's Nikola Drincic as the Spurs wide-man was denied time and space to show his attacking abilities . Tottenham's Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen keeps Vojislav Stankovic off the ball but it was Partizan who had the better of the chances in Belgrade . Pochettino threw on Erik Lamela and Soldado, who played alongside Kane in double-pronged attack, in an bid to change the complexion of proceedings. His move didn't have the desired effect, though, as the home side continued to poor forward in search of a winner. Sasa Ilic sent a shot from outside the area over the bar before directing a diving header in the with 14 minutes left to play. Kane's 25 yard free-kick straight at Partizan's wall in the 83rd minute summed up Spurs' night in an attacking sense. Lacklustre.

"Brendan Rodgers bemoaned Liverpool’s lack of attacking threat as they stumbled to defeat at Newcastle – but he refused to blame Mario Balotelli. The Italian and his team-mates managed just three efforts on target as they failed to score for the third time in four matches. Rodgers concedes that the sale of Luis Suarez – and the injury to Daniel Sturridge – has left his side short of confidence in the final third, but says misfiring Balotelli was not the reason for their 1-0 loss at resurgent Newcastle. Brendan Rodgers shouts instructions to his players during the Premier League clash at St James' Park . Mario Balotelli endured yet another frustrating afternoon as his side lost 1-0 to Newcastle . ‘It wasn’t Mario’s fault we lost the game, we lost it collectively,’ he said when asked about the £16million frontman, who is yet to score in the Premier League for the Reds. ‘I don’t want to talk about Mario, it wasn’t his fault. ‘I didn’t think we deserved to lose but didn’t do enough to win it. We had enough of the ball but just lacked that bit of creativity and invention in the final third. ‘Over the last 18 months we have been a team with a real threat going forward but we have lost 80 per cent of our goals from the team, with Luis going and Dan (injured). We can’t keep going on about it but it is an item as to why we’re not getting so many goals. Newcastle's 21-year-old Spanish forward Ayoze Perez scored the only goal of the game at St James' Park . Newcastle celebrate after Ayoze's goal inflicted Liverpool's fourth Premier League defeat  in 10 games . ‘When you’re a team that can scores goals then it gives the team confidence. We’re finding the goals a little bit harder to come by right now.’ Newcastle’s Ayoze Perez nicked the only goal, seizing upon an error by Alberto Moreno, and Rodgers reflected: ‘We made a mistake and that has unfortunately cost us the game and that is the biggest disappointment. ‘If you can’t score goals to win it, then it’s important you don’t concede goals to lose it. Up until that point we were solid.’ Rodgers, though, felt the hosts should have been reduced in number when Moussa Sissoko landed his studs on the back of Joe Allen’s leg.

Ferdinand, who left United after 12 years this summer, returns for the first time as a QPR player on Sunday.

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini sees this weekend’s early-season clash with title rivals Chelsea as a ‘must-win’ encounter. Pellegrini’s men are just four games into their Barclays Premier League title defence, but already trail leaders Chelsea by five points. The thought of falling eight points behind by losing at the Etihad Stadium is one Pellegrini does not want to contemplate. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has warned his team they must pick up three points on Sunday . Pellegrini believes Manchester City were unlucky to lose to Bayern Munich in midweek . Recent results do not make good reading for City, who have not won in three in all competitions, but Pellegrini is focusing on turning statistics in his favour with a victory. The Chilean said: 'I always try to think of positives, so I hope we are not going to lose and we not going to go eight points behind Chelsea. 'I think we were unlucky in the last two games - against Bayern Munich in the way we lost with that goal and against Arsenal we deserved to win the three points. 'But things happen. We must win our next game at home and with that we will be two points behind the leader. 'That for me will be a very good start after playing Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea. That is why it is important to win on Sunday.' City will need to find a way to halt Chelsea’s in-form striker Diego Costa, who has hit the ground running at Stamford Bridge. The Chilean tactician is wary of the threat posed by Chelsea's in-form striker Diego Costa . The £32million Spain international has scored seven in his first four Premier League appearances, including a hat-trick against Swansea last weekend. Another summer signing, Cesc Fabregas, has also made a big impression and quickly built up a dangerous understanding with Costa. Pellegrini said: 'They have very good players and they are in a very good moment, so we have to play a very good game if we want to win. 'For me it is not a surprise. Last year it was a very strong squad with very good players and this year they have increased their squad, they have more and better players. 'But there is a long way to go, it is just four games and we play 38. We will see what happens in future. 'I think that we didn’t start badly. Maybe the game we lost here against Stoke that was an unusual game, but we hope we recover here, playing at home, and get three points on Sunday.' Pellegrini, as is usually the case, refused to be drawn into speaking about Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho when he spoke to media at his press conference to preview the match. Jose Mourinho will be hoping his side can extend their 100 per cent record in the Premier League . Pellegrini and Mourinho have a rivalry dating back to when the latter succeeded the former as Real Madrid boss in 2010. 'It is nothing important,' the Chilean said. 'Every time you ask me the same question when we play against Mourinho. 'I don’t have any problem with him. This profession - we manage in different ways and nothing more. Nothing important.' City are still without striker Stevan Jovetic and midfielder Fernando due to injury, but Pellegrini is planning to unleash Sergio Aguero. Sergio Aguero is expected to start against Chelsea after proving his fitness to his manager . The Argentina forward has been used only sparingly this term as he is eased back into action following a series of muscle injuries in the second half of last season, including the World Cup. Aguero has found the net three times this season, but played only 16 minutes in the Champions League loss at Bayern Munich in midweek. Pellegrini said: 'He is very important. Maybe Sergio in this moment is not ready to play three games in one week (of) 90 minutes. 'That is why I thought it was better for him and the squad not to play 90 minutes against Bayern. 'He is fresh for Sunday and I am sure he will make a difference.'","The Citizens host Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon .

"He has dedicated more than two decades of his life to the hunt for the elusive Loch Ness monster, spending 60 hours a week on the water. And now George Edwards believes he has finally fulfilled his ambition of spotting 'Nessie'; he even photographic evidence to prove it. Mr Edwards, who has spent 26 years on his quest, managed to capture this image of a dark hump slinking in and out of the lake's waters from the deck of his boat, Nessie Hunter, before it vanished back into the deep. He claims the picture is the best-ever taken of the Loch Ness Monster and proves once and for all that . the elusive leviathan exists - and is definitely not a sturgeon. Last October, the man who took a picture billed as 'the best ever taken of the Loch Ness monster' admitted it was a fake. George Edwards, 61, insisted the image, pictured, published worldwide in August 2012 had been 'just a bit of fun'. The alleged shots of the monster had, in fact, been a fibre glass hump . 'Unequivocal': George, left, says he has even had the picture independently verified by a team of US military monster experts as well as a Nessie sighting specialist . He says he has even had it . independently verified by a team of US military monster experts as well . as a Nessie sighting specialist. Mr Edwards spends his life on the loch - . around 60 hours a week - taking tourists out on his boat Nessie Hunter . IV, and has led numerous Nessie hunts over the years. 'I was just about to return to Temple . Pier (in Drumnadrochit) and I went to the back of the boat which was . facing the pier and that’s when I saw it,' said 60-year-old Mr Edwards, a . lifelong believer in the monster. The Loch Ness Monster has been the subject of many sightings in the Scottish Highlands. Some experts believe that  the beast . represents a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, a type of carnivorous . aquatic reptile from millions of years ago. Nessie . is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, . though its description varies from one account to the next. There have been hundreds of supposed sightings over the years. Most, however, have been dismissed as hoax or fantasy. One of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon (pictured), which can grow up to 12 feet long. Others include eels, bird wakes, seals, trees, logs, submarines, dogs with sticks - even an elephant. 'It was slowly moving up the loch towards Urquhart Castle and it was a dark grey colour. It was quite a fair way from the boat, probably about half a mile away but it’s difficult to tell in water.' After watching the object for five to ten minutes, Mr Edwards said it slowly sank below the surface and never resurfaced. 'I’m convinced I was seeing Nessie as I believe in these creatures. Far too many people have being seeing them for far too long,' he said. 'The first recorded sighting was in 565AD and there have been thousands of eye witness reports since then. 'All these people can’t be telling lies. And the fact the reports stretch over so many years mean there can’t just be one of them. I’m convinced there are several monsters.' Steve Feltham, who has dedicated the past 21 years to hunting for Nessie was unequivocval. 'It is the best photograph I think I have ever seen,' he said. From his base on Dores beach and has studied many Nessie sighting photographs. 'I think the images are fantastic - that’s the animal I have been looking for all this time,' he said yesterday. 'I would say it doesn’t prove what Nessie is, but it does prove what Nessie isn’t, a sturgeon which is a fish that has been put forward as one of the main explanations as to what Nessie could be but this hasn’t got a serrated spine like the sturgeon. Mr Edwards attempted to use his vessel’s sonar to make a contact but to no avail. Claim: At the time, Mr Edwards said he saw the monster slowly moving up the loch towards Urquhart Castle, pictured, before submerging under water after around 10 minutes . 'I hung around for a good half-an-hour and used the deep scanning sonar to try and pick it up, but I’m afraid I had no luck at all.' Mr Edwards took the photo at 9am on 2nd November last year on a compact Samsung digital camera that he always keeps on the boat. Before releasing it publicly he sent it to the USA for analysis, though he can’t reveal further details. 'I did not want to mention my sighting until I was sure that I had not photographed a log or something inanimate in the water,' he said. 'I have friends in the USA who have friends in the military. 'They had my photo analysed and they have no doubt that I photographed an animate object in the water. I was really excited as I am sure that some strange creatures are lurking in the depths of Loch Ness.' The Loch Ness Monster has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to . the world's attention in 1933. Scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern-day myth and continued sightings as set ups and wishful thinking. Yet it has remained a contested phenomenon for almost 80 years. Perhaps the most famous picture of . Nessie was taken by Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist (pictured left). It . was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934. The picture showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water. However, it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from Woolworths with a head and neck made of wood in an elabourate hoax by big-game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his hapless search for the beast. The earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of Loch Ness appears in the Life of St Columba by Adomnán, written in the 7th century. St Columba, an Irish monk, had sent a disciple into the loch to prove there was nothing there. But the monster rose and chased the man snapping at his heels. But it fled in terror 'as if pulled back by ropes' when St Columba made the sign of the cross and commanded: 'Go no further. Do not touch the man. Go back at once.' Marmaduke Wetherell, seated, is pictured studying a chart of the Loch Ness in a search for the Loch Ness Monster. He was said to have faked the most famous picture in revenge for bad publicity . In November 1933, Hugh Gray was the first to picture something splashing in the water. Four . stumpy-looking objects on the bottom of the creature's body appeared to . look like appendages, such as flippers. It was later suggested the . creature was a dog, possibly holding a stick. In 1938, G. E. Taylor, a South African tourist, filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16 mm colour film. His picture was declared 'positive evidence' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist. In 1960, aeronautical engineer Tim Dinsdale filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake. Dinsdale allegedly spotted the animal on . his last day hunting for it, and described the object as reddish with a . blotch on its side. In May 2007, Gordon Holmes, a . 55-year-old lab technician, captured video of what he said was 'this jet . black thing, about 45 feet long, moving fairly fast in the water'. The film, though, has been cast into . doubt.  Holmes has been criticised for claiming the existence of . fairies. Another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters . swimming in the loch. Questions: This is the sonar image that revived belief that there's something unexplained out there, taken by skipper Marcus Atkinson in February . In February 2012, a sonar image of a . large mystery object deep below the surface of Loch Ness netted boat . skipper Marcus Atkinson the Best Nessie Sighting of The Year Award - the . first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker William . Hill. The sonar picture, that shows a large . unidentified living object deep underwater, was recorded by Loch Ness . boat skipper Marcus Atkinson. Mr Atkinson’s . sonar fish-finder device records the width of objects in the depths . directly below his tourist boat every quarter of a second.","George Edwards has hunted Nessie for 26 years and holds tours of the Loch .

"Michigan State University students celebrated their football team’s first invite to the Rose Bowl in decades Saturday by rioting through East Lansing. Large groups of students swarmed neighborhoods near the university’s campus early Sunday morning chanting, lighting fires, setting off fireworks and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. The Michigan State Spartans pulled off a historic upset by beating the undefeated No. 3-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 34-24 in the Big 10 Conference championship game earlier in the day.

Widespread destruction: Revelers rip a tree out of the ground to add it to one of the many fires burning . Fired up: Revelers mill around one of the many fires set at Cedar Village . Several fires were set throughout the city by thousands of people, according to WOODTV. No injuries were reported, but the destruction was widespread. Multiple people were arrested, but the names of those taken into custody have not been released, nor has the number of people detained. The East Lansing Police Department announced it will make the names of those arrested public on Monday morning. Groups of students numbering into the several hundreds each terrorized neighborhoods near campus early while chanting ‘we smell roses,’ according to reports. Police responding around 4am in the Cedar Grove neighborhood of the city encountered a group of students too numerous to count crowded around a bonfire, officials said. The rowdy crowd was threatened with tear gas, but dispersed before any was used, cops noted. ‘I see it as a great thing,’ a rioter told Fox 47. ‘Things happen but we've gotta be optimistic that people are out here together, in spirit, enjoying themselves in celebration.

MSU student newspaper The State reported students ripping large trees out of the ground to add the raging blaze. Multiple media outlets reported flames shooting higher than 20 feet in the air as unruly students cheered them on. At least a dozen rioters were arrested in Cedar Hill, according to the Lansing State Journal. The unrest was finally put to bed about an hour before daybreak by police in riot gear, according to reports. ‘It’s more tradition than anything,’ Joe Sheena, an MSU senior, told the Journal. ‘We’re not a school of pyromaniacs.’ Hundreds of fireworks were also set off during the hours of lawlessness that threatened to take hold of the college town. Some students even decided jumping onto a police car was a good idea. ‘Students took the opportunity to mess with the car,’ sophomore Jeff Nemesi told The State. ‘The car backed out, which, of course, made them go even more crazy.’ Fuel for the fire: Students add wood to an already raging bonfire while rioting after the Spartans beat the Ohio State Buckeyes . An MSU football fan is detained after an unruly celebration at Cedar Village turned into a melee . Move along people: Members of the East Lansing Police Department and the Michigan State Police move in to disperse unruly celebrants . Daybreak showed the true extent of the damage. Broken televisions thrown onto the street, overturned cars, burned furniture left in the middle of the street, smashed pumpkins, broken windows –chaos. A nearby store saw an opportunity and jumped on it, according to the Journal. ‘Burn your mattress?? $50 off any mattress tomorrow for #MSU students! #EastLansing #Cedarfest,’ read a tweet from Mattress Factory Outlet. ‘We weren’t condoning in any way the events that were taking place, but we did want to let people know we were there,’ a store spokesperson told the paper. Not all students were happy with the mass celebrating, including the MSU senior who’s car was flipped over. ‘I was just shocked,’ the student told WOODTV. ‘I didn't think that would happen or someone would do that here, I guess. But I was pretty angry, too.’ ‘Why would you do that?’ Led away in hand cuffs: Members of the Michigan State Police Department arrest unruly celebrants . School officials also lashed out at the students. ‘The behavior last night on campus and in East Lansing by both students and non-students was disappointing,’ MSU President Lou Anna Simon said in a statement. ‘Unfortunately, the behavior of a small number casts doubt on many,’ the statement continued. 'These incidents will be reviewed within the appropriate legal and university processes and individuals will be held accountable.’ It was not immediately clear what punishment would be meted out to students found to have contributed to the destruction. Atheletic Director Mark Hollis echoed those comments. ‘People need to celebrate in a responsible way,’ he told the Detroit Free-Press. ‘I am proud of the performance of our football team. There is no place for destructive celebrations. I hope our fans and campus are safe.’ The school’s alumni association president also hit out at the revelers. ‘True Spartans do not burn things, break laws or mess with my Spartan Cops If you do, you're not one of us,’ Scott Westerman said via Twitter, according to WLNS. The Spartans' win gave them the Big 10 championship and their first trip to the prestigious Rose Bowl since 1988. They will face Pac-12 champ Stanford in the New Year's Day game. Officers from the East Lansing Police Department, the Ingham County Sheriff’s Office, the Michigan State Police, and Michigan State University Police responded to the anarchy. ELPD are reviewing videos posted online and are actively seeking to arrest those it deems responsible for the destruction. The department has also asked the public to help identify people shown in pictures and videos. Charges will be pressed against anyone identified.","The Michigan State Spartans beat the heavily-favored Ohio State Buckeyes 34-24 in Saturday's Big Ten Conference Championship .

"Islamic State fighters have  beheaded a group of soldiers captured during a night time offensive on a military airbase, while a new propaganda video purports to show the jihadis shooting down a fighter jet during a skirmish with Syrian forces. Islamic State (ISIS) fighters carried out a night time attack on an airbase near the Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor, capturing several Assad soldiers and beheading them while photographing the event and posting the images online. It comes amid the release of yet another ISIS propaganda video, purporting to show the militants shooting down a fighter jet using an anti-aircraft gun. Scroll down for video . This photo appears to show a captured fighter being forced to send a final message to retreating comrades . Following the attack on the military airport, ISIS militants rounded up a number of Syrian army prisoners. Photos have emerged showing one of the fighters begging for his life. Still wearing his camouflage fatigues, the fighter appears to be crying as several ISIS fighters surround him. One of the fighters wearing a pair of leather gloves can be seen holding the terrified prisoner down by the collar of his neck. A second photo shows a close-up shot of the captured soldier from the Assad regime. The shiny, curved blade of a knife can be seen in the hands of a fighter, standing behind the prisoner of war. It appears he might have been forced to radio a final message to his retreating comrades as one photo shows an ISIS fighter holding a small radio next to the prisoner's mouth. Another photo of the prisoner shows him being beheaded. An ISIS fighter, wearing a wedding ring and with an orange ribbon attached to his jumper, is pictured holding the prisoner by the hair and cutting his throat. A second image shows the teary-eyed soldier pleading for his life, while a nearby ISIS fighter clutches a knife . Local activists in the ISIS controlled city of Deir ez-Zor reported that a suicide bomber blew himself up in a rigged armoured tank near one of the airbase checkpoints, killing 19. It is thought to be the first time the militants have used a tank for a suicide bombing mission rather than a lorry and a car. A photo later emerged of the rusty vehicle with large yellow sacks of explosives packed on top and inside the tank. Its armoured structure also appears to have been reinforced with additional armour. The dead suicide bomber was later revealed to be a Libyan fighter, known as Abu Hathitha al-Libi. Photographs reveal bodies lying by tables and their beds. There is even a photo of an empty bottle on the ground, once possibly containing the strong aniseed drink, arak. ISIS also released photos show high grade military equipment (pictured) being looted from the airbase . The militants also showed off some of the military equipment which they found at the airbase. Anti-tank guided missiles can be seen along with other high value military items. Meanwhile, a new ISIS propaganda video was released last night, showcasing the militant group’s recapture of Syria’s most important gas fields and purporting to show them downing a fighter jet. The Sha’er gas fields, located in the eastern province of Homs, had been controlled by the Assad regime but the video suggests a surprise attack meant that the fighters easily overpowered the Syrian Arab Army (SAA). The fighter jet is filmed by the jihadis as it flies above them during a skirmish in Syria . The video cuts to ISIS militants firing at the jet using an anti-aircraft gun positioned on the back of a truck . Finally, it show ISIS fighters inspecting some smoking wreckage purported to be that of the jet . The video shows one of the jets, belonging to the Assad regime, opening fire on the militants. Anti-aircraft guns start to open fire on the jet and the fighters begin to panic. The alleged burnt out wreckage of the jet, still smouldering on the desert earth, is later found. The propaganda video begins with a convoy of pickup trucks, filled with ISIS militants, being driven down a single tarmacked road at dawn. Anti-aircraft gun placements are positioned on the back of each truck. A tank is shown slowly driving through the arid desert whilst heavy artillery pieces are being positioned behind mounts of earth. An ISIS fighter wearing a red and white chequered scarf, begins to crank up the cannon, taking aim at the unseen enemy. The video continues without any soundtrack, just the sound of militants gear clinking against their bodies. A dozen ground troops, carrying an array of rocket propelled grenades and AK 47s, begin to walk in a loose formation towards the hilltop. They crouch down flat in the desert scrubland. ISIS fighters advance during an assault on the Sha’er gas fields in Syria . The gas fields, located in the eastern province of Homs, are Syria's most important and were recently captured by ISIS militants. Pictured are jihadis advancing under fire . A jihadi fires from a heavy calibre gun attached to the back of a pickup truck . The attack is launched after a heavy artillery barrage, whilst the video accompanies the opening cannon shot with a boisterous soundtrack, calling for jihad and the formation of Islamic State. The ground troops are shown advancing, firing off a few rounds but appearing to take no casualties despite coming under fire. The footage cuts between footage of machine gun fire and troops advancing, followed by very graphic close up shots of several dead SAA soldiers. Thick smoke can be seen billowing from the stations at the gas fields as a fighter launches another RPG. Only the early stages of the fight are shown, as the film again cuts to the bodies and burnt out tanks which litter the gas station site. Some of the victims appear to be wearing civilian clothes, whilst other soldiers appear to have been burnt beyond recognition. The gas fields of al-Shaer have long the battleground on several occasions in the past 18 months, between the SAA and Islamic State. Its decision to attack the gas field comes just days after the group conceded the area to the Assad regime after a two week fight. The latest propaganda video would appear to be an attempt by ISIS to showcase its strength in the eastern countryside.

"Danny Welbeck is craving the minutes he was rarely awarded at Manchester United and the  Arsenal striker revealed he is itching for a show of faith from new manager Arsene Wenger. On Monday the 24-year-old was gifted 90 minutes by Roy Hodgson, and Welbeck returned the favour with two goals as England beat Switzerland 2-0 in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. Welbeck averaged just 48 minutes in the final Premier League season under Sir Alex Ferguson and 58 the following year under David Moyes, but the forward is confident he can prove more than worthy of his £16million price-tag with more time on the pitch. VIDEO Gary Neville isn't alone - his brother, Phil, agrees Danny Welbeck was a steal at £16m . Danny Welbeck was gifted 90 minutes for England against Switzerland on Monday in the Euro 2016 qualifier . New Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck is itching for more minutes on the pitch now under Arsene Wenger . Danny Welbeck suffered under Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes but hopes Arsene Wenger will trust him . Danny Welbeck reckons if the minutes come, then the goals will follow. The striker hopes Arsenal will show faith in his ability, but how has he averaged over the last four seasons? 2010:11: 68 minutes (6 goals, 1 assist) 2011/12: 67 minutes (9 goals, 5 assists) 2012/13: 48 minutes (1 goal, 4 assists) 2013:14: 58 minutes (9 goals, 4 assists) 'It is good for any footballer to get a run of games,' Welbeck said, as reported by The Guardian. 'You become more confident and play much more at ease, so to get a run would be absolutely perfect. 'The game against Switzerland was my first 90 minutes this season, so it is just the start of things and I'm really looking forward to it.' In the 2012/13 season, Welbeck averaged just 48 minutes per Premier League match as United won their final title under Sir Alex Ferguson. He did, however, score just one goal throughout with four assists. Life under David Moyes the year after was worse for those on the red half of Manchester, but ever-so-slightly better for Welbeck, who upped his average to 58 minutes a game. Again, the faith was repaid as Welbeck upped his goal tally to nine with four assists. Danny Welbeck grew frustrated at Manchester United and hopes for a fresh start at London club Arsenal . Danny Welbeck's minutes-per-game average has never been above 70 in the last four Premier League years . The forward's switch from Old Trafford to the Emirates defied belief, with Gary Neville among those saying he cannot comprehend how the deadline-day £16m move was agreed. The former United defender said: 'Of all the prices paid this summer, there are right backs and left-backs galore who have been bought for £14m, £15m, £16m? 'How have Arsenal got him for £16m? I can’t work it out. It has helped out a competitor because Arsenal are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly. ‘I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways.' Welbeck has been scrutinised for his Premier League record, having scored just 26 in 118 appearances, but time will only tell if the striker can take advantage of more opportunities on the pitch at the Emirates. Danny Welbeck was unveiled as an Arsenal player after his deadline-day move from Manchester United .","Danny Welbeck was rarely given 90 minutes at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson or David Moyes, but the striker is eager for a full shift .

"Marcos Maidana took dirty to a new level on Saturday night as he bit Floyd Mayweather during their WBA and WBC welterweight championship rematch. Mayweather regained his titles, and Maidana's excuse was peculiar. ‘No, no. [I didn't bite him],' he said.  ‘Perhaps he put his glove in my mouth. Maybe he thinks I’m a dog.’ We have been here before when it comes to biting and excuses, so Sportsmail looks at the other scandals and the 'reasons' behind them. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Marcos Maidana appeared to bite THROUGH Floyd Mayweather's glove during their fight on Saturday night . Mike Tyson (Evander Holyfield, 1997) Driven by his 'determination to win' Tyson brought biting scandals to a whole new level in his world heavyweight rematch against Evander Holyfield. The controversial star bit a chunk out of Holyfield's ear and was disqualified. Speaking to Oprah Winfrey in 2009, Tyson said Holyfield headbutted him a lot in both fights, and he was so angry that 'Holyfield was such a great fighter', he would do anything to beat him. Tyson apologised eventually and the bite-ee surprisingly accepted it despite his scar. Mike Tyson says he bit a chunk out of Evander Holyfield's ear in 1997 because of his determination to beat him . Luis Suarez (Ottman Bakkal, 2010, Branislav Ivanovic, '13, Giorgio Chiellini, '14) It would be a bite-size article if it wasn't for Luis Suarez. First, the Uruguayan attacked Bakkal in a game between Ajax and PSV, while his nibble on Ivanovic in the Premier League got the English press on his back. His latest bite on Giorgio Chiellini prompted his longest ban, and the oddest excuse. 'After the impact … I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent,' he said. 'At that moment I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.' Luis Suarez's first biting incident came against PSV with Ottman Bakkal in 2010 . Luis Suarez bites Branislav Ivanovic in a game between Liverpool and Chelsea in 2013 . Suarez was banned for several months after biting Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup game last summer . Francisco Gallardo (Jose Antonio Reyes, 2001) We can almost see the reasoning behind biting an opponent (almost), but doing it your team-mate? On his testicles? The incident happened after Reyes scored a wonderful goal for Sevilla against Valladolid, with Gallardo celebrating with the youngster in an extremely odd fashion. 'I don't think what I did was very noteworthy,' Gallardo told Spanish media. 'It was meant as a joke. A teammate gave the idea. If I had known what a fuss it would cause...' Reyes said he felt a 'slight pinch', and added: 'Gallardo hasn't heard the end of this. The worst thing now is the stick I'm getting from the other players.' Francisco Gallardo bites Jose Antonio Reyes' testicles as the forward celebrates a fine solo goal . Jermain Defoe (Javier Mascherano, 2006) During a Premier League game between Tottenham and West Ham, Defoe was upset of the treatment he was getting from the hosts' midfielders and took out his frustration on the Argentine, though Martin Jol said he did so in a 'comical' fashion and it was simply a nibble... Defoe protested: 'This has been blown out of all proportion,'  'The referee was standing right over me and if he felt I had done anything bad he would have sent me off.' He received no ban. Jermain Defoe was not banned for this 'comical' bite on West Ham midfielder Javier Mascherano in 2006 . Wayne Monte 'Tree' Rollins (Danny Ainge) Tree Bites Man was the headline in the Boston Herald, the public were shocked. That was after the NBA play-off between Boston and Atalanta, when Rollins bit Ainge's finger in a brawl. The latter required stitches. Rollins was nicknamed the intimidator as well as Tree because of his height, and was apparently irate after Ainge called him a 'sissy'. No excuse for the bite though. Wayne Monte 'Tree' Rollins was called a sissy by Danny Ainge in a NBA play-off game... so he bit him . Alex Burrows (Patrice Burgeron, 2011) During a Stanley Cup finals game between Vancouver Canucks and the Boston Bruins (what is it with Boston and biting?) Burrows appeared to bite down on Bergeron's finger in a customary ice hockey brawl. No action was taken because of a lack of evidence but the victim was irate. Burrows said: 'He had his finger in my mouth but I don't think I bit him. You saw it, he put his hand up and he put his hand in my face and his finger got in my mouth, so that's what happened.'

"Prince William will deliver an impassioned speech on the illegal wildlife trade . Prince William will risk a diplomatic row with China today by denouncing the illegal wildlife trade. The prince will tell a US conference on the sale of ivory, rhino horn and other endangered animal parts that ‘those who look the other way, or spend the illicit proceeds of these crimes, must be held to account’. He will add: ‘Together they loot our planet, to feed mankind’s ignorant craving for pets, trinkets, cures and ornaments derived from the world’s vanishing and irreplaceable species.’ William will say the price of ivory in China has soared from £3 to £1,346 a kilogram in 25 years – with a resultant surge in poaching. Half of the 40,000 elephants killed each year are believed to be exported to China, where the trade in ivory is legal. It is so sought after because it is thought to purge toxins from the body. The Duke of Cambridge’s outspoken speech – on a three-day visit to America – is likely to ruffle feathers – particularly in the Far East. He is due to undertake a week-long official tour of China and Japan early next year – the highest profile solo visit of his fledgling royal career. His father Prince Charles once raised hackles in China by describing Communist leaders as ‘appalling old waxworks’ and by publicly supporting Tibet’s exiled Dalai Lama. His grandfather Prince Philip caused a storm on a visit to China in 1986 when he told British students: ‘If you stay here much longer you will all be slitty-eyed.’ According to sources close to William, his passion for wildlife issues is such that he feels it is his duty to speak out – like Charles does on matters close to his heart. At the conference of the World Bank Group’s International Corruption Hunters Alliance, William will stress that ‘some endangered species are now literally worth more than their weight in gold’. He will say: ‘It is wrong that children growing up in countries vulnerable to wildlife crime are losing their birthright in order to fuel the greed of international criminals, and that those children will face greater hardship and insecurity as this crime traps them in poverty. ‘Wildlife crime goes to the heart of our security. It recognises neither national borders nor national interests. It distorts economic development, undermines the rule of law and exacerbates sources of conflict.’ Rhino horn is popular in the Far East and practitioners of Chinese medicine believe it can save lives threatened by fever or infection. William and his brother Prince Harry (pictured left in Botswana) have long been advocates for a global ban on the trade of ivory. The 32-year-old arrived in New York last night (right) with the Duchess of Cambridge . Tusks from around half the 40,000 elephants killed annually are thought to be exported to China where the sale of ivory is legal. Above, Hong Kong customs seize a shipment worth more than $26million HK dollars . The trade was banned by the Chinese government in 1993 but with the country’s growing capitalist economy, entrepreneurs and private businesses have created a shadowy illegal trade. Earlier this year William, 32, attracted public criticism when he went on a boar hunting trip on the eve of a major conservation conference he and his father were attending. He also attracted scorn for his subsequent comments to veteran primatologist Dame Jane Goodall that he wanted to see the priceless ivory antiques in the Royal Collection, held in trust on behalf of the nation, destroyed. William’s speech – which follows a meeting with Barack Obama – will strike the most serious note of his visit to the US. He and his five months pregnant wife, Kate, have left their 16-month-old son, Prince George, at home as they launch a charitable charm offensive on New York. They are staying at the Carlyle Hotel, where rooms can cost £9,000 a night.

"Radamel Falcao is about as a complete striker as you could wish to see. I remember watching him tear apart Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup two years ago, when he scored a hat-trick in Atletico Madrid’s 4-1 triumph days after a treble against Athletic Bilbao in La Liga, so when I saw him in the flesh it was easy to see why he causes defenders such problems. Radamel Falcao is 'about as complete a striker as you could wish to see', according to Glenn Hoddle . Falcao celebrates after scoring for Atletico Madrid against Chelsea in 2012 UEFA Super Cup . Intelligent movement . His movement off the ball is phenomenal, which means it’s just so hard to contain him. He reminds me of Hernan Crepso, the Argentina striker who, like Falcao, played for River Plate and it would not surprise me if Falcao had modelled his game on Crespo or been coached by the same people. The reason is that he has those little darting runs that can get in behind defenders and which Crespo was so good at. They are a nightmare to defend against because of the speed and intelligence of the runs. Falcao, though, probably has even more to his game that Crespo, in that he can start such runs from further out. In addition, he’s very strong and his muscular build will suit the Premier League. The Colombian poses for his unveiling with new boss Louis van Gaal and fellow team-mate Daley Blind . Falcao poses with club legend and assistant manager Ryan Giggs shortly after his arrival at Old Trafford . Ability to adapt . Importantly, he can adapt. If you want to play into feet, he’s perfectly comfortable with that and if you want to hit balls over he top, he can run on to them. He can hold the ball up with his back to goal, he’s good in the air and his strike rate is excellent. His finishing isn’t all about power, he has subtlety as well. You can see why I think he’s the complete package. It will be intriguing to see how Louis van Gaal fits him into the United side, though I suspect he will play up front with Robin van Persie, as Wayne Rooney could easily play in the position just behind them, the slot Juan Mata has been filling. Falcao in action for Monaco last season before his switch to Manchester United on deadline day . Falcao shares many similarities with former Inter, Chelsea and Argentina star Hernan Crespo . Fitness questions . The only question mark will be fitness, given that he has just recovered from cruciate knee ligament surgery. With the surgical advances for that type of injury, you would hope he hasn’t lost any speed or sharpness and can get back to his best. I hope I haven’t scared our QPR defenders who will face him on Sunday. You can’t make a plan for someone like Falcao. Our defenders need to be playing at nine or 10 to contain him. There’s no reason why they can’t do that and, from QPR’s perspective, let’s hope it will take him a game or two to adapt. Eventually, though, I’m confident we will see one of the best strikers in the world.","Glenn Hoddle runs the rule over new Manchester United striker Falcao .

"Gareth Southgate insists England’s young lions are ready for their biggest test yet after they avoided a nightmare Euro2015 play-off draw. England were paired with Croatia in Friday afternoon’s draw in Nyon and will play the first leg at Wolves’ Molineux home next month, most likely to be on Friday, October 10, before travelling to the Balkans the following week. There were worries that England would be handed a return to Serbia, two years after several young England players were racially abused, or given a trip to Ukraine but those concerns were to no avail. Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 team will play Croatia in the European Championship play-off round . Michael Keane opens the scoring for England in their qualifier with Finland at stadium:mk . Southgate, however, is adamant this will be a searching examination. Croatia finished top of Group Five, with 19 points from their eight games, whereas England topped Group One after taking 28 points from a possible 30 and winning eight matches in succession. ‘They were the winners of a tough group and they won all their away games, so we have no doubt that this is going to be another significant step up for us,’ Southgate told Sportsmail. ‘When I looked at the draw in its entirety, I could not see a fixture that looked “easy” and this is clearly going to be a challenge for us. ‘When I left (for Switzerland) this morning, people were saying to me “good luck” but I couldn’t understand whether they meant with a short trip or something like that – we were certainly not going to get a simple game, that’s for sure. ‘Only seven teams can get there (to the finals) so that is always going to make it a real jeopardy game. But it is crucial for their development to feel this pressure and this tension. ‘But we are going to go there with a lot of confidence and if we play with the style that we have done, and the lads keep making progress, we know we can travel with confidence.’ Saido Berahino scored the winner as England defeated Moldova at the Madejski Stadium in Reading . As for returning to the Balkans, Southgate has no concerns at all about the environment England will be heading in to. The venue for the second leg is yet to be selected – the Croatian FA are still in discussions with the FA – but Southgate is confident it will be safe and secure, as opposed to the conditions that were presented to England when they faced Serbia in Krusevac. ‘I have got absolutely no worries at all about taking the team out there,’ said Southgate. ‘It is a lovely part of the world and I know from working with players like Alen Boksic, Mark Viduka and Mark Bosnich that the people are friendly. ‘It will be a nice place to visit but it will be a difficult match against a side that is technically excellent. But this is a process that we are going to have to get through; they are the experiences we want these boys to have.’ Slovakia vs Italy . France vs Sweden . Denmark vs Iceland . England vs Croatia .

"Most of us have no idea a glass of seemingly healthy apple juice contains almost as much sugar as three Krispy Kreme donuts or a bar of Dairy Milk, a survey has found. With almost seven teaspoons of sugar in a single serving, apple juice contains more than the recommended daily amount for adults who want to stay healthy. According to the World Health Organisation, this should be six teaspoons of 'added' sugar - i.e. not that found naturally in products such as milk. Scroll down for video . A glass of apple juice (left) contains almost seven teaspoons of sugar, and the average fat-free yogurt (right) contains five. The World Health Organisation recommends no more than six teaspoons of sugar a day . Similarly, a fat-free yogurt - a food also often marketed as a natural, healthy choice - contains five teaspoons of sugar - the same as in three scoops of ice cream. The high levels of sugar found in everyday – often so-called ‘healthy items’ - were revealed as part of a survey by Bupa. This asked 2,000 mothers if they were aware of the amount of sugar found in foods they may be giving their children. In the poll, more than 90 per cent admitted they had no idea about the high levels of sugar in apple juice and fat-free yogurt. Bupa states the average glass of concentrated apple juice contains nearly seven teaspoons on sugar. One Krispy Kreme Original glazed donut, on the other hand, contains 10g of sugar - which equates to two teaspoons. Nearly half of mothers (46 per cent) admitted they were worried their child might be addicted to sugar. A survey by Bupa found that 90 per cent of mothers don't know about the high levels of sugar in so-called healthy products like apple juice and fat-free yogurt. A fifth confess their child doesn't eat a balanced diet . But despite their concerns, a fifth confessed their child does not eat a balanced diet. And 60 per cent admitted they do not regularly look at the nutritional information on food. Too much sugar in a child’s diet can cause permanent damage to their health, including increased risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. It can also cause tooth decay. Despite this, 40 per cent of mothers said their children have sweets, fizzy drinks or chocolate at least once a day. Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six. The guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco. The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year. The WHO said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies. However, low-fat foods have also come under fire from experts, after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full-fat alternative. WHO also said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven spoons. Instead five or six teaspoons is the ideal figure that people should aim for. Doctors say keeping to a maximum of six teaspoons of sugar a day is key to avoiding obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses because they fear sugar is as dangerous as tobacco. Chief medical officer Sally Davies has already said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity. Until recently, it was thought that ‘bad drinks’  were those such as Coke and Pepsi, and fruit juice was a healthy alternative helping us get our ‘five a day’. But increasingly experts are warning that fruit juices and are fuelling the obesity epidemic. Low-fat foods have also come under fire from experts, after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full-fat alternative. Earlier this year a study found manufacturers are making their ‘healthy’ options more palatable by replacing fat with sugar. While most low-fat supermarket products contain a third fewer calories than their regular fat version, 10 per cent actually have more or the same calories, mainly due to added sugars. Obesity specialist Dr Matthew Capehorn said weight-conscious shoppers should realise that choosing low-fat products made by brands including Weight Watchers could hamper their efforts to cut calories. Nearly a quarter of mothers said they like putting sugary treats in their child’s lunchbox, with the top culprits being cakes, chocolate and fruit juice. On top of this, nearly a third of mothers think that as they give their children healthy food, sugar isn’t an issue. The news comes as NICE announce that schools and nurseries should run tooth brushing schemes to improve children’s teeth. As many as one in eight children now suffer tooth decay by the age of three – although in some parts of England the rates are as high as a third. Sugar Puffs (pictured in their current form) will be being rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' and will contain less sugar and 20 per cent more honey . Sugar Puffs are being given a makeover in an attempt to address parents' concerns about the amount of sugar in the cereal - and revive plunging sales. Rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' after the yellow furry character featured in previous adverts, they will be made from a new recipe with less sugar and 20 per cent more honey. The cereal will also feature traffic light nutritional labelling on the front of the pack, in a move manufacturers Halo Foods said would allow customers to make 'informed decisions' about what they eat for breakfast. Overall, manufacturers say the sugar content has been reduced by a third in a decade. Honey Monster Puffs will contain 8.6g of sugar – a cube and a half – in a 30g portion, down from the previous recipe which contained almost two cubes per portion. However critics say the move is largely a marketing ploy - as once broken down, honey and added sugar become the same thing - glucose. Dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline: 'Added sugar and honey are grouped in the same category by the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. 'Although honey is seen as more ""natural"" than added sugar, it is still counted as a ""free sugar"" - i.e. one that has been added to a product rather than say lactose, a sugar found naturally in milk. 'Once broken down in the body, honey will do exactly the same thing as the added sugar would have.'","Glass of apple juice contains as much sugar as three Krispy Kreme donuts .

"Adrian Peterson's high school football coach has revealed how he used to beat the star player when he misbehaved - and claimed he was thanked by him afterwards. Booker Bowie said that the Minnesota Vikings running back would get up to three lashes with an 18 inch long wooden paddle he kept in his office as part of what he called 'tough love'. But afterwards rather than crying or complaining to his parents, Peterson would simply say: 'Coach, thank you', said Bowie. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Peterson (on Tuesday, left, and in mugshot, right) was indicted on child injury charges last week amid claims he whipped his four-year-old son during a visit to the star's Texas home in May . Bowie also said that Peterson had 'suffered enough' in the row over his alleged abuse of his children and that he should be allowed to just move on because he had learned his lesson. Peterson, 29, has been indicted on charges of causing injury to a child after allegedly beating his son, four, with a switch, when he was visiting the player in Spring, Texas, in May. The boy had wounds on his thighs, backside and even his genitals following the beating. Peterson was suspended for one game by the Vikings but was allowed back onto the team despite his actions plunging the NFL into a fresh crisis over domestic abuse, following the Ray Rice controversy. But in a U-turn late Tuesday, he was banned from all team activities until the outcome of the case. It followed an intervention from politicians and also some of the NFL's top corporate sponsors like Anheuser-Busch, Visa and McDonald's, who voiced disapproval over the league's treatment of its player scandals - including the decision to allow Peterson to continue to play . It also emerged on Tuesday that Peterson had also been accused of abusing another of his sons, also four, but no charges were filed. Bowie, 59, was Peterson's defensive coordinator and track coach at Palestine High School in Texas until his student left in 2004 on a football scholarship for the University of Oklahoma. Speaking from his home in Tyler, Texas, Bowie explained that he used to hit his students if they stepped out of line. He said that he talked to his students before he hit them and then explained afterwards why he did what he did. He told MailOnline: 'It wasn't my intention to abuse the kids, the kids loved me for it. I wanted them to do right. They said: ""Coach, thank you"". 'Tough love': Friends of Peterson told how his mother, Bonita, and father, Nelson, used corporal punishment to discipline the running back. Nelson once whipped Peterson with a belt in front of his school . Peterson (pictured with his mother and father distributing meals on Thanksgiving n his hometown of Palestine, Texas) was nicknamed AD, or All Day, because he had so much energy, but this meant he was more likely to get a 'whupping' from his father, relatives said . Coach: Booker Bowie told MailOnline that Peterson had 'suffered enough' 'Adrian understands corporal punishment...it's not intended to hurt anybody, it's to get them going in the right direction. I have never had a problem with parents calling anyone complaining. 'The way Adrian came up, his parents, his mother was disciplining him. He understands it, it helped his team mates, his classmates. I think that’s what he was doing (to his son).' Bowie said: 'His intention was not to abuse the kid. He understands corporal punishment and I don't think his intention was to abuse the kid. 'We all sometimes make mistakes, not intentionally. He just needs to move on from it. I think he's suffered enough. I think he's learned from this'. Corporal punishment is legal in Texas but it can result in a felony conviction if it is judged to be too severe. Peterson's indictment has intensified the scrutiny on the NFL and sparked a nationwide debate on the use of violence in raising children. It comes after the controversy with Rice, who was seen on video in February dragging his then fiance and now wife Janay out of a hotel elevator as she was unconscious. Rice was given a two game suspension by the NFL until a video emerged last week of a shocking video from inside the elevator where Rice is seen punching his wife out cold. Rice was then cut by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the league. In a statement Peterson has said that he is not an abuser and the tough way his parents disciplined him has 'a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man'. But his comments have divided his fans with some, including former NBA star Charles Barkley, saying that there is nothing wrong with it. Others however believe that corporal punishment is a cruel way of raising a child and results in a cycle of violence which Peterson has been playing out. A report in USA Today has also shed further light on his harsh upbringing at the hands of his father Nelson. Too far: Corporal punishment is legal in Texas but is a felony offense if it is too severe. Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said on Tuesday that 'whipping a child to the extent of visible wounds (above), as has been alleged, should not be tolerated in our state' Peterson’s childhood friend David Cummings, 29, said that one afternoon he beat his son with a belt in the car park in front of 20 students at Palestine Middle School because he had been disruptive in class. Cummings told USA Today: 'We still talk about it to this day. My dad was tough, but his dad was real tough.' He added that even though it may shock some people this kind of parenting was 'normal' in Palestine, Texas, where they all grew up. Peterson's uncles Larry and Greg Peterson said that their nephew's father used to beat his son with a tree branch. So keen was Nelson Peterson to discipline his son that when he was told he needed medication for attention deficit disorder he objected and said: 'It's not something that a little whipping can't take care of'. Peterson was nicknamed AD, or All Day, because he had so much energy, but this meant he was more likely to get a 'whupping' from his father, relatives said. His stepmother Phyllis Peterson told USA Today: 'I think every parent has the right to discipline their child. He (Nelson) wouldn't intentionally harm his child. He loves his children.' Peterson was suspended on Tuesday after a dramatic intervention from Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton. He said: 'It is an awful situation. Yes, Mr. Peterson is entitled to due process and should be ""innocent until proven guilty"". However, he is a public figure; and his actions, as described, are a public embarrassment to the Vikings organization and the State of Minnesota. 'Whipping a child to the extent of visible wounds, as has been alleged, should not be tolerated in our state. Therefore, I believe the team should suspend Mr. Peterson, until the accusations of child abuse have been resolved by the criminal justice system.' My attorney has asked me not to discuss the facts of my pending case. I hope you can respect that request and help me honor it. I very much want the public to hear from me but I understand that it is not appropriate to talk about the facts in detail at this time. Nevertheless, I want everyone to understand how sorry I feel about the hurt I have brought to my child. 'I never wanted to be a distraction to the Vikings organization, the Minnesota community or to my teammates. I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son. 'I voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had. Before my grand jury appearance, I was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney. In each of these interviews I have said the same thing, and that is that I never ever intended to harm my son. I will say the same thing once I have my day in court. 'I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen. I know that many people disagree with the way I disciplined my child. I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate. 'I have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward. But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives. I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man. I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make. 'I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser. I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury. No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day. 'I accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct. Regardless of what others think, however, I love my son very much and I will continue to try to become a better father and person.","Booker Bowie said Peterson would get three lashes with the paddle as part of his 'tough love' regime .

"Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal will not win the Premier League title and can’t see games out after losing their lead to Manchester City on Saturday. Martin Demichelis’ 83rd minute equaliser at the Emirates meant Arsenal have now drawn their last three Premier League games, already leaving them six points behind leaders Chelsea after only four matches. And the former Liverpool defender says the club have fallen further behind Chelsea this season after similar finishes last term. Jamie Carragher claimed on Monday Night Football that he believed Arsenal would not win the league title . Speaking on Sky Sports, Carragher said: ‘I said start of the season, I don’t think Arsenal will win the title. The way I think of Arsenal is similar to Chelsea, one finished third one finished fourth. They probably spent similar money in the summer. ‘Why didn’t Arsenal get [Diego] Costa. Danny Welbeck might be a good signing. They need a left back, Chelsea go to Atletico Madrid and get Filipe Luis. They just do what they need to do.’ Arsenal struggled against the top four last season, and for the second game in a row lost a lead. Carragher sees a trend with the Gunners and believes Arsene Wenger’s side struggle to hold on to three points. Martin Demichelis equalised for Manchester City late on to rescue a 2-2 draw at Arsenal on Saturday . Jack WIlshere's fabulous strike had put the Gunners 2-1 up at the Emirates Stadium . ‘They don’t look as if they know how to see a game out. As soon as it went 2-2 I don’t fancy Arsenal to get a winner, I fancied City to win the game and they almost did. ‘It’s not just a physical thing with Arsenal, it’s a mental thing and that even could be more important.’","Jamie Carragher claims Arsenal's failure to see out games will cost them chance to win the Premier League title .

"Artist Concetta Antico (pictured) can see 100 times more colours than an average person . When most of us look a buttercup, we simply see yellow. But one artist sees a whole host of extra colours around the flower's edge, because she is a tetrachromat and can see 100 times more hues than the average person. Concetta Antico, who lives in San Diego, California, has more receptors in in her eyes to absorb colourful light, enabling her to see – and paint – the world around her in a different way to most people. The average person can see approximately one million colours, whereas tetrachromats have an extra cone class in their eyes for colour vision that dramatically increases their range up to a potential 99 million. Cones are structures in the eye that are designed to absorb particular wavelengths of light and transmit them to the brain. Most people have three types of cones, but tetrachromats like Ms Antico have four types. While only a handful of human tetrachromats have been identified, it is thought that around two per cent of women may possess the genes to see extra colours. The average person has three types of cones, which are tuned to wavelengths of red, green and blue, and tetrachromats' fourth types can vary. It's thought that the condition is caused by mutations in the X chromosome, which make people to see more or less colour, PopSci reported. These mutations make men more likely to be colour blind and mean that women more likely to be tetrachromats if they have mutations on both X chromosomes. The artist, who lives in San Diego, California, has more receptors in in her eyes to absorb colour, enabling her to see – and paint – the world around her in a different way to most people. One of her paintings is shown . To make the most of her ability to see more colours, Ms Antico paints bright, impressionistic pictures of animals and landscapes and also tries to teach other people to see the colours around them in a new way. She said: ‘Everyone has the potential to expand their ability to see colours the way I do, but our urban lifestyles and focus on technology is shutting it off. I’m the one here waving the colour flag, teaching people to see the turquoise and greens in the grey rocks and even tap into their own interpretations of the colours that exist.’ The average person has three types of cones in their eyes, which are tuned to wavelengths of red, green and blue, but  tetrachromats have an extra type to enable them to see 100 times as many colours. This magnified image shows cones (green) and rods (yellow) in the eye, with the outer nuclear layer coloured purple . To make the most of her ability to see more colours, Ms Antico paints bright, impressionistic pictures of animals (such as this tiger) and landscapes and also tries to teach other people to see the colours around them in a new way . Tetrachromacy is the condition of possessing four independent channels for conveying colour information - which means four different types of cone cells in the eye. The average person has three types of cone cells. A tetrachromat’s retina contains four types of higher-intensity light receptors or cone cells with different absorption spectra. This means they can may see wavelengths beyond those of a typical human being's eyesight and may be able to distinguish colours that to a human appear to be identical. Lots of animals are tetrachromats, including birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and insects. For example, the humble goldfish has cone cells for red, green, blue and ultraviolet light. It is thought that it gives animals an advantage when spotting minute dust particles, food and the movements of prey or predators. It was only in 2012 that she was found to possess the genotype for tetrachromacy and she has been studied by the University of California Irvine. Experts said that differences in colour perception are hard to detect because they are small and tests are not designed for more than three pigments – blue, red and green. Based on Ms Antico’s genes, they think that her fourth cone absorbs wavelengths that are ‘reddish-orangey-yellow’ and are trying to explore whether this is how she sees things. They said that her art has allowed her express her unusual vision and show people what it means to be a tetrachromat. While scientists are studying the phenomenon to better understand how the brain works, Ms Antico has a more personal reason as to why she is involved in the research. She has a 12-year-old daughter who is colour blind, likely because of her own genetic mutation. Ms Antico hopes that the more experts understand about tetrachromacy, the more they will understand about visual processing, which could be used to help colour blind people. It was only in 2012 that Ms Antico was found to possess the genotype for tetrachromacy and she has been studied by the University of California Irvine since, while continuing to paint. Another one of her works is shown .","Concetta Antico, who lives in San Diego, California, has more receptors in in her eyes to absorb colour, enabling her to see more colours .

"Schoolchildren were forced to evacuate a playground after a rampant squirrel caused havoc during breaktime. A teacher at Chater Infants School in Watford, Hertfordshire, had to herd the youngsters back into the safety of the building after an 'unusually aggressive' grey squirrel disrupted their afternoon playtime. One member of staff was even scratched during the encounter but fortunately no children were hurt in the incident. The unusually aggressive squirrel caused havoc at the school which was forced to evacuate its playground (stock pic) Headteacher Amrit Bal-Richards said they were monitoring the situation and the caretaker is being extra vigilant, but the squirrel has not been sighted again. She said: 'We did have an incident where we had a squirrel. 'It is very uncommon for a squirrel to be a little aggressive. It was a little bit tempered. We will be monitoring the situation and the caretaker is being extra vigilant. 'We talked to the children at an assembly the following day to say some times animals can be aggressive and a bit tempered and what to do if that happens.' Mrs Bal-Richards said it was procedure to take pupils inside if there is an issue to make sure they were safe. Staff at Chater Infants School in Watford, Hertfordshire (pictured) are keeping vigilant for the return on the furry menace . She said: 'We would obviously make sure if there was an issue around the children and they were becoming frightened, we do advise teachers take children back into the school and make sure they are safe. 'The incident was a couple of weeks ago, since then we have not actually seen the squirrel. 'As is the case with cats, dogs, rabbits when they do come into contact with a human, they do have sharp claws.' Squirrels can become aggressive if they feel they are being threatened or if they feel someone is trying to steal a food source. They often warn a threat by chattering their teeth as a warning towards whoever, or whatever, is in the vicinity. Mrs Bal-Richards added: 'Safeguarding children is paramount. It is uncommon for a squirrel to actually demonstrate aggressive behaviour but we are aware of the situation.'","Rodent has been terrorising teachers and pupils at Chater Infants School .

"It is the kind of eagle-eyed observation of which even Sherlock Holmes would have been proud. Indeed, while the super-sleuth was busy solving his latest mystery on screen, armchair fans appeared more interested in deciphering some elementary errors in the New Year's Day episode of the hit BBC drama. Nearly ten million viewers – the show's biggest audience – tuned in to find out how Benedict Cumberbatch's character had survived his rooftop plunge at the end of the previous series. Scroll down for video . Riddle: The latest episode of Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes, had many viewers puzzled by a series of impossible journeys on the London Underground . It was one of the most eagerly . anticipated shows of the festive period and –according to social media . analyst  SecondSync – generated more than 300,000 tweets. In . the opening sequence, viewers  desperate to know how the detective had . faked his own death saw Holmes attached to a bungee rope and springing . back up the side of the building, while his assistant Dr Watson was . hypnotised by illusionist Derren Brown in the street below. A . latex mask of Sherlock was then placed over the body of villain . Moriarty, giving Holmes time to make his exit. However, this was . revealed to be only a conspiracy theory. A second version of events was then offered that showed Holmes pushing a lookalike dummy off the building. He is then shown giving Professor Moriarty a kiss. Finally, . Holmes seemingly confesses the real plot, suggesting he landed on a . giant airbag, which was swiftly removed while he was covered in fake . blood on the pavement by a team of helpers. Dr . Watson was deliberately knocked over by a bicycle, giving Holmes time . to place a squash ball under his arm and briefly stop his pulse when the . doctor felt his wrist for signs of life. Dr Watson aboard what appears to be a Jubilee Line tube which then . inexplicably passes through a succession of District and Circle Line . stations . Curious: Watson later emerges from Euston Square station, back in the direction he had presumably just travelled from . But as well as concentrating on the storyline, thousands of viewers gleefully pointed out continuity errors. At the start of the 90-minute show, viewers saw Martin Freeman as Dr Watson on the Tube, where he appeared to travel along three lines without switching trains. In another segment in which Holmes and Watson are investigating a train journey made by a suspect, Sherlock concludes that the 'five-minute' journey between Westminster and St James's Park must have lasted ten minutes. In reality the one-stop journey takes less than two minutes. The pair later investigate CCTV footage showing a man climbing aboard a Jubilee Line Train to travel one stop between Westminster to St James's Park which is on the District and Circle Lines . The man has vanished by the time the train arrives at 'St James's Park' - which commuters will recognise is NOT the District line platform at the real station... and what would a Jubilee Line train doing at a District Line station anyway? As the pair enter Westminster station, . which is served by the District, Circle and Jubilee lines, they are . inexplicably shown walking past a sign for the Northern line. Viewers . also pointed out that the carriage, which was shown carrying just one . passenger, would have been full of people travelling home because it was . the last train of the evening. One . fan, Wayne Moraghan, wrote: 'Might have enjoyed Sherlock more if there . weren't so many inaccurate facts about the Tube, wrong lines, wrong . stations, wrong times!' Lucy Burton added: 'More confused by Sherlock's . appalling knowledge of the Tube than how he fell.' All change: The sleuth and his companion arrive at Westminster Station which is on the . Jubilee and District lines in another shot from Wednesday night's episode . Brainteaser: But moments later the pair are then seen making their way to a platform on the Northern Line . The crime fighters walk along a section of the Picadilly to a stationary train that has been rigged with explosives which is supposedly underneath the Houses of Parliament . Episode two will be broadcast on Sunday, with the third and final episode next weekend. The . much-anticipated return of the programme, which was last shown two . years ago, drew a peak audience of 9.7million for its first five . minutes. It had the highest audience of the day and was way ahead of the . 7.5million viewers who saw the opening episode of the first series in . 2010. So will writers Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss reveal all in a later episode? A total of 9.2 million viewers tuned in to watch,  a 33.8 per cent share of the audience - Sherlock's highest ever launch. By comparison, the first ever episode had 7.1m viewers and a 28.6 per cent share. Steven Moffat said: 'Thrilling news on . overnight ratings for Sherlock. A tribute to the team who work so hard, . and with such pride, on the show, and of course to the genius of Sir . Arthur Conan Doyle. Reaction: Dozens of viewers took to Twitter to point out the inaccuracies . 'It's proof that audiences will show up if you give them what they want - though we can't throw Benedict off a roof every week.' It beat the TV premiere of the final Harry Potter film in the New Year ratings war. Just over five million watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. While the updated detective pulled in just over a third of all viewers, the wizard drew one in five. The apparently genuine explanation in Sherlock of how Holmes faked his own death did not convince a number of viewers. The detective claimed that after falling safely on to an airbag that is quickly removed, he sets about fooling his assistant Dr Watson that he has suffered fatal injuries. He has fake blood applied and then slips a squash ball under his arm to try to cut off the blood supply and stop the pulse in his wrist. If a ball is squeezed in the armpit, it compresses the brachial artery, stopping the blood flow to the radial artery. He managed to fool Watson, who checked Holmes's pulse by feeling his wrist. However, one critic suggested that the plan was flawed as doctors more commonly check the carotid pulse in the neck, rather than the radial pulse in the wrist, which would have rendering Holmes' plan useless. Medical professionals are also usually required to take several pulse readings from different areas when examining patients. In addition, the technique of using a ball to restrict blood flow stops the pulse in only one arm. Had Watson chosen to take Holmes's pulse in his other wrist, his plan would have been exposed.","Much anticipated season three opener brought in almost 10m viewers .

"Rory McIlroy will have a metaphorical target on his back at this week's Ryder Cup in the same way Tiger Woods did in his heyday, according to Europe legend Colin Montgomerie. Montgomerie, the triumphant captain at Celtic Manor in 2010 and a giant of the competition during his playing appearances, believes all 12 members of the United States team will relish the chance of claiming McIlroy's scalp if they are drawn against the Open and US PGA champion in the foursomes, fourballs or singles matches. The Northern Irishman was the first player spotted on the driving range at Gleneagles on Monday morning, clearly looking to get his game into the best shape well in advance of the start of the three-day competition on Friday. Europe team-mates Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter fist bump on the driving range on Monday morning . McIlroy was the only player spotted practising early on Monday morning on the driving range at Gleneagles . The world No 1 gets in the swing in Scotland ahead of golf's biennial showpiece . The Open and US PGA champion moved on to hitting his driver later in the practice session . McIlroy was soon joined by Ian Poulter, with whom he enjoyed a morale-boosting fist bump, and later Thomas Bjorn, who warmed up in the chilly Scottish air with a hot cup of coffee. McIlroy told BBC Radio 5live: 'I arrived here yesterday evening and hit some balls last night, I just wanted to get here a bit early and make sure I am prepared for Friday. It's been a long stretch (of golf) for me. ""I just wanted to try and take as much time as I could off and get away from the game a little bit but obviously excited about this week. It will be good to meet up with all the team later this evening and I think once that happens I think we will all get into the spirit of it and be really excited.' McIlroy was seen working hard on his swing, and the four-time major champion and world No 1 looks ready to prove his status as the game's brightest star this week. But Montgomerie had a warning for the 25-year-old Ulsterman. 'Rory is the one player that America wants to play because they've nothing to lose,' the 51-year-old Scot told the Daily Express. 'It was a bit like that for us against Tiger. When we did draw him we would say ""Game on, I've got a chance here. If he beats me he's supposed to beat me, if he doesn't, well, what a day for me and what a day for the team.""' Montgomerie, who featured in eight Ryder Cups as a player, said Europe captain Paul McGinley may be tempted to 'hide' McIlroy in the opening foursomes or fourballs on Friday and Saturday. The Open and US PGA champion tucks into a snack, while standing next to his Europe branded golf bag . Thomas Bjorn was the next Europe player to turn up and he seemed to enjoy a story McIlroy was telling . Danish star Bjorn hits a drive on the far left side of the range under the gaze of his caddie and coach . Vice-captain Jose Maria Olazabal (left) wrapped up warm (in September), while Bjorn (right) drank coffee . 'I think a lot of pressure is on Rory's shoulders,' explained the eight-times order of merit winner. 'If the rest of the team see Rory winning it gives them confidence. 'If the team see Rory losing in one of the first groups then it's difficult to think 'we've got to pick up the pieces' so it's a huge temptation to hide him away. 'You don't want to put your main star out at No 1 because the rookies in the American team can play and any one of them can score a 66 and win,' said Montgomerie who is Europe's third highest Ryder Cup points scorer of all time with 23 1/2. 'I would definitely be for hiding Rory the way Tiger was many times. We expected him at No 1 in the singles in 2006 for instance when America were well down at the K Club and he turned up at No 4.' McIlroy's last competitive outing saw him battling for a £7million payday in the Tour Championship, but he is equally fired up by the thought of playing for team glory at the Ryder Cup. He famously labelled the Ryder Cup as an 'exhibition' the year before his debut in 2010, but contributing to narrow victories at Celtic Manor and Medinah means he appreciates the special nature of the biennial contest. McIlroy works on hitting his irons in Perthshire ahead of the American team's arrival . 'It's a group of people that you know well and they all have one goal, one collective task which is to win the Ryder Cup and beat the US team,' McIlroy told BBC Radio Five Live. 'The money doesn't matter to us any more, it doesn't matter if we're playing for millions of pounds all over the world. This means as much to us or even more than any other thing that we play for. It's a big deal to us, we want to play as well as we can and try to win.

"Tasered teen: Bryce Masters isno longer in a medically induced coma and is speaking with family members . The Missouri police officer who used a stun gun on a 17-year-old during a traffic stop says he smelled marijuana in the vehicle and saw him recording the incident on an iPhone. Bryce Masters has been upgraded from critical to serious condition at a hospital where he was taken Sunday after the Independence police officer used a Taser on him. A spokesman for Masters' family says he went into cardiac arrest and was being treated for a lack of oxygen to his brain. According to a search warrant application, the officer smelled marijuana inside the car. Police said they later found drug paraphernalia. Police say Masters was pulled over because of a warrant attached to the license plate of the vehicle and was combative when ordered to get out. The Kansas City Star reports 17-year-old Bryce Masters of Independence began slowly recovering overnight and was able to answer questions from hospital staff on Wednesday. Family attorney Daniel Haus characterized the recovery as a miracle. Masters' family has said his heart stopped after he was shocked with the stun gun during a traffic stop on Sunday in Independence. Bryce suffered some memory loss and doctors do not yet know what the long term affects will be. Police say he was combative and wouldn't comply with the officer's demands. They say he was pulled over because of a warrant associated with the license plate on the car, which belonged to someone else. 'They are seeing some signals that their son may make a fairly remarkable recovery, basically coming back from the dead,' Haus told theKansas City Star.'It looks like whatever the doctors did with this medically induced coma, this new procedure where they lower the body temperature, was exactly what he needed,' Haus added. The FBI is investigating after a police officer used a stun gun to subdue Bryce Masters in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday afternoon after stopping a car he was driving because it had a warrant attached to it. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. Scroll down for video . An eyewitness filmed the incident on her cell phone. In the footage you can see the officer dragging the Bryce's body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen's back (ringed) Police said in the statement that Bryce became uncooperative and physically resisted getting out of the car, prompting Runnels to warn Bryce he would use a stun gun. Police said the stun gun was used on Bryce while he was still in the car but he was able to get out of the car on his own. The confrontation continued outside the car and both Bryce and Runnels fell to the ground. The teen then suffered a 'medical emergency' and needed resuscitation, prompting a call for an ambulance, police said. But eyewitnesses gave a different account to Fox4KC. Michelle Baker filmed the incident on her mobile phone when she heard screams outside and says she saw the Runnels Taser the teen when he was inside his car. In a cell phone video taken by Baker you can see the officer dragging the teen's body to the sidewalk, then standing with his foot on the teen's back. You could tell the kid was going into convulsions. 'He turned him over and his head was dangling like this and he had blood coming out,' said Baker. Curtis Martes, 17, says the teen was coming over to play XBox with him. 'I hear him say from my porch he's like 'I can't roll down my window it's broke,' said Martes. 'He was like 'what am I being arrested for?' The cop just grabbed him and said 'you're under arrest,' said Martes. The officer, identified by the police department as Tim Runnels, has been placed on administrative leave. The footage, shot on Sunday, shows him walking up to the Bryce's body (left) and stepping over it right) He is then (pictured) seen raising his foot as Master lies on the ground. 'He like threw him on the ground busted his face up. He kept like nudging him with his foot,' said Curtis Martes, 17, who watched the event unfold . He said the officer Tasered the teen then pulled him out of the car. 'He like threw him on the ground busted his face up. He kept like nudging him with his foot,' said Martes. 'Several times, the cop put his foot on the kid like he was stepping on his neck, but it was on his back,' said Robert Baker, who lives nearby told The Kansas City Star. 'I think (the officer) was wrong, because the kid tried to explain to him that his window won't roll down.' The FBI's Kansas City office will investigate whether Runnels used excessive force, which falls under the bureau's civil rights program, the FBI said in a statement. Independence police pledged to cooperate with the investigation. Masters is the son of a Kansas City police officer. Bryce Masters with his mother. The family issued a statement Monday asking that the U.S. Department of Justice investigate the confrontation . The FBI's Kansas City office will investigate whether Runnels used excessive force, which falls under the bureau's civil rights program, the FBI said in a statement . 'We would conduct a thorough investigation, regardless of who the parents are,' Independence police Maj. Paul Thurman said. Colin Masters, Bryce's brother, told 41 Action News the teen may have stopped breathing for more than five minutes. 'We've been getting a lot of support from friends and family,' Colin explained. 'He had probably 30-40 people at the hospital with him yesterday so everyone's banking on Bryce being the strong kid that he is and coming back to us.

"Sure, it's been a positive few days with England effectively securing their place at the 2016 European Championships thanks to that exciting win in Switzerland. But really the international breaks serve only to highlight how brilliant the Premier League is and how much we miss it when it isn't there. Here's 10 reasons why Sportsmail can't wait for top flight club football to return this weekend. 1. Saturday summit meeting . There will be no easing back into the Premier League action on Saturday as Arsenal and Manchester City meet in an early clash of the title contenders. These are the kind of mouth-watering, high-stakes encounters that a Euro 2016 qualifying campaign simply can't offer. Arsene Wenger will likely hand £16m signing Danny Welbeck his Gunners debut, no doubt encouraged by the two goals he scored for England out in Basel on Monday. Man City also have a point to prove after their surprise home defeat to Stoke City last time out and will have all guns blazing at the Emirates. You can like our Arsenal Facebook page here . Ready, Danny? Welbeck is set to be handed his Arsenal debut following his £16million move to the Emirates . A tasty clash: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (left) and Manchester City manager Mauricio Pochettino meet . 2. First glimpse of the Gaal-acticos . The international pause came at the wrong moment for Man United fans, who are drooling at the prospect of seeing expensive new boys Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao on the pitch. They'll get their chance at Old Trafford on Sunday and QPR must be fearing a drubbing despite United's lacklustre start to the campaign. In addition to  £6m loanee Falcao, we could see debuts for Daley Blind, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo on Sunday as Louis van Gaal tries to inject life into United's campaign. And trying to contain them all in the QPR defence will be Rio Ferdinand, who is sure to get a nice reception on his Old Trafford return. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . It's time: Angel di Maria (left) and Radamel Falcao (right) playing together has Manchester United drooling . Rather you than me, Rio... Ferdinand will be asked to try and contain the duo on his Old Trafford return . 3. Clash of the in-form sides . Everyone expected Chelsea to make a bright start to the season but few could have predicted their home match with Swansea would be a top-of-the-table affair. The Welsh side have started impressively, with the wins over Man United, Burnley and West Brom constituting their best winning run in the Premier League. Chelsea were at their free-scoring best in the 6-3 win at Everton and Diego Costa has adapted to life in England effortlessly. He is an injury doubt for the Swansea match, however, so we could see a Chelsea debut for deadline day signing Loic Remy. Predator: Diego Costa may be in the line to start up front for Chelsea but the striker remains an injury doubt . Be prepared: We could see a Chelsea debut for deadline day signing Loic Remy if Costa is on the sidelines . 4. Balotelli's Anfield bow . Liverpool fans have already taken Mario Balotelli to their hearts and he'll make his home debut against Aston Villa on Saturday evening. The madcap Italian has pledged to score a load of goals to carry Liverpool to a long-overdue Premier League title and the team showed their capabilities in a 3-0 win at Tottenham last time. Adam Lallana, who at £25m was Liverpool's most expensive summer acquisition, may also make his debut after recovering from a knee injury suffered in pre-season. But Villa, who have started the season unbeaten, will certainly not be cowed as they aim to push on. Together: Adam Lallana (left) and Mario Balotelli (right) could play against Aston Villa on Saturday evening . One of the gang: Liverpool fans have already taken Balotelli to their hearts and his Anfield debut beckons . 5. Spurs with a point to prove . They started the Mauricio Pochettino era in superb style, winning London derbies against West Ham and QPR. But Spurs were left questioning their top four credentials after Liverpool smashed them 3-0. Having stewed over that result for a fortnight, they finally have the chance to make amends up at Sunderland on Saturday, who are still searching for their first win. Bounce back: Brendan Rodgers (front) wins 3-0 while Tottenham's Maurico Pochettino (behind) looks glum . Thinking time: Having stewed over that 3-0 loss for a fortnight, Tottenham can make amends at Sunderland . SATURDAY . Arsenal vs Manchester City (12.45pm) Chelsea vs Swansea City (3pm) Crystal Palace vs Burnley (3pm) Southampton vs Newcastle United (3pm) Stoke City vs Leicester City (3pm) Sunderland vs Tottenham Hotspur (3pm) West Bromwich Albion vs Everton (3pm) Liverpool vs Aston Villa (5.30pm) SUNDAY . Manchester United vs Queens Park Rangers (4pm) MONDAY . Hull City vs West Ham United (8pm) 6. A legend at Leicester . Newly-promoted Leicester certainly raised a few eyebrows with their pursuit of Argentine legend Esteban Cambiasso over the summer. And the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan midfielder may make his debut in Saturday's match away to Stoke. Leicester were a match for Arsenal in their last fixture, while Stoke were shock winners away to Man City, so both enter in a good frame of mind. Surprising: Argentine legend Esteban Cambiasso may make his debut in Saturday's match away to Stoke . Fighters: Leicester proved a good match for Arsenal in their last fixture and will hope for more of the same . 7. Basement battle . It's a little too soon to be talking about six-pointers, but Saturday's meeting of the bottom two - Crystal Palace and Burnley - has that 'must-win' feel for both. Palace twice surrendered the lead against Newcastle before Wilfried Zaha earned a point in Neil Warnock's first game in charge and the new boss will return to the Selhurst Park touchline on Saturday. Burnley, who gained their first point against Man United last time out, were busy on deadline day and we could see debuts for £3m striker George Boyd as well as young loanees Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane. He's back! Wilfried Zaha earned a point in Neil Warnock's first game in charge against Newcastle United . Held: Burnley picked up their first point against Manchester United last time out as Wayne Rooney stumbled . VIDEO United won't win the title - Robson . 8. Life goes on for Saints . Many feared for them after the summer exodus of their best players but Southampton have started encouragingly and will be looking for more gains when they host Newcastle on Saturday. The Saints picked up their first Premier League win of the Ronald Koeman era when they beat West Ham 3-1, with new boy Graziano Pelle opening his account. Newcastle, who are still waiting for their first three points, are hopeful 'ginger Pirlo' Jack Colback will be back from the injury that denied him a senior England debut. They certainly will be aiming to do better than the 4-0 drubbing they were dealt in this fixture back in March. In: Southampton picked up their first win under Ronald Koeman against West Ham 3-1 Graziano Pelle scoring . Fit? Newcastle await their first three points and hope 'ginger Pirlo' Jack Colback will be back from the injury . 9. Toffees hoping to kick-start season . Watching Everton has certainly not been dull so far this season, with 17 goals scored in their three matches so far. Unfortunately, the majority have gone against them. But with Steven Naismith in brilliant form and Samuel Eto'o opening his account against former club Chelsea last time out, there have been some positives for Roberto Martinez. They will chase a first league win at West Brom on Saturday, who have an identical record so far. Alan Irvine is optimistic that some of his new signings will feature at The Hawthorns, including striker Georgios Samaras. Revenge: Samuel Eto'o's header caused Chelsea problems at Goodison Park and it opened his account . Deal: Everton boss Roberto Martinez is chasing his first  win and hopes Eto'o will help against West Brom . 10. Tigers' new boys set to roar . Steve Bruce proclaimed Hull's deadline day business as 'fantastic' and now fans will get the chance to see the new boys in action - albeit having waited until Monday night. The Tigers took Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa on loan and smashed their club record to sign £10m Abel Hernandez. Mohamed Diame, another newcomer, will see plenty of familiar faces when they welcome West Ham, while ex-Southampton man Gaston Ramirez could also feature. West Ham will likely include Barcelona loanee Alex Song in their line-up, likewise new signing from Marseille Morgan Amalfitano. Glad to escape: Hatem Ben Arfa could get his chance to pull on the Hull shirt against West Ham at home . Return to England: West Ham will likely include Barcelona loanee Alex Song in their line-up on Monday night .","Danny Welbeck set for Arsenal debut against Manchester City on Saturday .

"Manchester United risk losing another top talent, having failed to open talks with Brazil Under-20 star Andreas Pereira. It is another test of their commitment to young players after the loss of French star Paul Pogba to Juventus. Midfielder Pereira, who was named on the bench by Louis van Gaal against QPR last weekend, is able to talk to other clubs from January 1 as the clock runs down on his deal which expires next summer. Andreas Pereira in action for Manchester United during their Capital One Cup defeat against MK Dons . Andreas Pereira runs away from Liverpool's Cameron Brannagan during an Under 21 game last season . Still only 18, he is one of the development players promoted by Van Gaal to be part of the first-team squad this season in the belief he has the ability to make it at Old Trafford. He was picked by Brazil for an Under-20s tournament in China last summer — a rare accolade for a European-based player. The stand-off over his future has echoes of Pogba, who became a symbol for the lack of long-term planning at Old Trafford in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final years when he was allowed to leave for nothing after failing to agree a new deal. Embarrassingly, United later considered buying him back for £50million after he’d gone on to become the best young midfield player in Europe. Pereira could be involved against Leicester today having scored for United Under 21s against Sunderland in midweek. He was born in Belgium to Brazilian parents. Andreas Pereira and Adnan Januzaj celebrate winning the Barclays Under 21 Elite Group trophy in May . I joined United from PSV aged 16. He was recently taken aside by Van Gaal for a pep talk with the United boss rating him alongside Adnan Januzaj, Tyler Blackett, James Wilson and Jesse Lingard as United’s best home-grown players. Van Gaal said last night: ‘The class of ’92 were guardians of the culture of the club. It is very important that a club like Manchester United have guardians and therefore you need a very good youth education. ‘It is very important and I did it with Barcelona. I gave debuts to Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes. ‘I want to do that but the youth player has to take their chance.’ Van Gaal’s big decision today is if and how he can squeeze his ‘famous five’ — Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Falcao, Angel di Maria and Juan Mata — into the same team.

"Porn has never been more prevalent. Easily accessed online, the adult entertainment industry has been blamed for everything from unrealistic expectations in bed to the depraved behaviour of killers such as Vincent Tabak. Now porn is in the firing line of sexual health specialist and TV personality Dr Harry Fisch, who in his latest book, The New Naked, claims watching too much is making sex lives suffer. In this exclusive extract, he reveals why porn is the sexual equivalent of fast food and explains what to do if your partner likes it a little bit too much. Unrealistic: According to Dr Fisch, too much porn can lead to skewed expectations during real world sex . Expert: CBS TV regular Dr Harry Fisch specialises in sexual health and male infertility . 'Watching porn and masturbating is the sexual equivalent of fast food. It’s instant gratification, and it’s fine once in a while when you’re craving some French fries or nachos smothered in that fake orange cheese goop, but for nourishment? Forget about it. Like many other things that are bad for us yet can sure taste good in the moment, pornography can start out as a harmless, once-in-a-while indulgence. But for a lot of men, it can be surprisingly easy to get sucked into the vortex of a true addiction to porn that will be hazardous to his health, both physically and emotionally, without even knowing it. That’s why porn addiction is the number one issue that sex therapists deal with. Countless experts have discussed the shocking amount of porn consumed in this country but here’s the thing I have yet to hear any of them talk about: For the overwhelming majority of men who watch a lot of porn, it creates unique sexual performance problems. Yes, the very thing that is supposed to stimulate and arouse men (or women) sexually can actually destroy their overall libido and performance. So why isn’t anyone talking about the Effect on Sexual Performance--the ESP—aspect of porn? They’re discussing why a guy watches it--and not what happens to his penis when he watches. I can tell how much porn a man is watching as soon as he starts talking candidly to me about any sexual dysfunction he has. When a man chronically watches porn and gets off on it, or watches porn with his hands on himself so he can masturbate at the same time (which is what usually happens), the sensory stimulation he gets from the virtual world makes it much more difficult for him to get aroused, stay aroused, and be happily aroused by the real, live woman in his life. Not good: Too much porn can also have a negative effect on male arousal according to Dr Fisch . Every addict is different but there are certain behaviours that would suggest porn addiction. If you answer yes to any of these, it might be time for a heart-to-heart. Is he asking for rougher sex or more unusual positions? Is he suffering from any ejaculation problems? Is he being more critical about your body, particularly your breast size? Is he asking you to make any changes to your body, such as getting a Brazilian wax, that you are uncomfortable with? Does he have particular favourites that he likes to watch repeatedly? Does he get angry if you don’t want to watch with him? Does he withhold sex if you tell him you don’t want to watch? Does he want to act out different scenarios he might have seen, even if you make it clear you don’t want to? Does he have secret or password-protected sites online? Has he ever watched porn in an inappropriate public place (such as on an aeroplane)? Does he have another mobile phone account or credit card? Will he cancel social engagements because he’d rather watch porn? Are his friends dropping hints to you about the porn he watches? Is he evasive or defensive when you ask him about porn? Does he choose porn instead of wanting to have sex with you? In other words, his frequent porn-fuelled masturbation leads to sexual dysfunction with a partner. If he can only have an orgasm when watching porn, and if he becomes accustomed to having orgasms only in a certain way or while watching a certain thing, he’s in trouble and so are you. There’s also a flip side: Some porn addicts they want sex on their terms, in order to fulfill whatever fantasies have been “inspired” by what they’ve been watching. The porn and his masturbating are having the opposite effect on his performance when having sex—it’s called retarded ejaculation. His lasting 'too long' is the opposite of what most men experience when they watch a lot of porn—they can’t last at all. While it sounds like it might be a good thing, lasting too long can be just as troublesome for a relationship as when he’s finished too quickly: feeling sore, bored, or fed up, wondering when he’s going to get the job done. Not to mention that the constant friction can actually be painful after a while. What’s disheartening for me is that so many of the people I talk to have yet to realise that there’s such a downside to watching pornography. Unfulfilling: Spending too much time with the computer can lead to a dull sex life on both sides of the couple . Not at first. I’m the first person to tell you that a little porn can be a lot of fun—and that a man who likes to watch once in a while is not necessarily verging on porn addiction. But people can easily develop an addiction to it without even realising because it’s such an easy habit to indulge in. A man can tell himself he’s not really harming anyone or 'cheating'. He may have starting watching as a way to spice up his sex life or because it was fun—but viewing habits can quickly escalate, in part because it’s so easy to stream porn 24/7. He can always find something to watch when he’s in the mood, no matter where he is or what time it is, either.How does anyone get over a porn addiction? It’s not easy but it is doable. Have your partner try these steps first: . Improvement: According to Dr Fisch, porn addiction can be overcome and sex lives put back on track . Out now: The New Naked: The Ultimate Sex Education for Grown-ups is available from Amazon . • Take an immediate break—from all sex and masturbation, not just porn. When a man doesn’t ejaculate for several days, he will be a lot more sensitive (and a lot hornier!), and he’ll be more likely to climax within a normal period of time. • Try to schedule something absorbing during the time he usually spends watching porn. If you can take a short trip, great (just don’t turn on the TV, as there is usually porn available in hotel rooms if that’s where you’re staying). Or have him do additional chores around the house (like the long-overdue garage cleaning, painting, or gardening, for example—something that is physical and makes it impossible to do while any electronic devices are around). • Try to make your foreplay into more play. Ask him what he likes to do when he’s watching porn, and replace his hands with yours. When you touch him where he likes to touch himself, he’ll relearn how to get that same sensation when he’s alone with you. Do this together—no cheating for him and going back to porn!—and I promise that you won’t need thirty minutes for an orgasm any more. • It’s important you both talk about how much you love each other, and how much you cherish the emotional aspects of your sexual relationship so you can refocus on the qualities of your partner that you first were attracted to. Act the way you did when you were first courting—I’ll bet porn was not part of the equation then. This way, your desire will build naturally so that you both can enjoy the pleasure of real sex, and leave the virtual sex to the robots. • If this doesn’t work because your partner is truly addicted and/or unwilling to discuss the matter with you, you should consult professional help. Look for a sex therapist experienced with porn addiction and sexual dysfunction. Be prepared for the addict to have a hard time. If addictions were easy to kick, there wouldn’t be any addicts. Just as smokers need to find something to do with their hands when they quit—drinking coffee, chewing gum, or eating (which is why ex-smokers often gain weight), so do you need to find a better substitute. Luckily, you already have one lying next to you every night. The New Naked: The Ultimate Sex Education for Grown-Ups, £9.05 (Sourcebooks) is out now and available from Amazon.

"Marcos Rojo signed for Manchester United for £16m to plug a hole in their porous defence. The Argentina star played left back for Argentina in the World Cup and on his debut for his new club at Old Trafford against Queens Park Rangers. But he will be played more through the middle, possibly starting against Leicester City this weekend, and here our Portuguese blogger Goncalo Lopes, who watched Rojo extensively for Sporting Lisbon, rates him as a left back and centre half. Marcos Rojo played left back against Queens Park Rangers but could play centre half against Leicester City . Marcos Rojo is a better left back than a centre half, in my opinion. Here in Portugal he played almost all of Sporting Lisbon's matches at centre back but for Argentina, he deployed is on the left side of the defence. At left back he has more confidence - he made more interceptions, tackles and even completed a greater number of passes playing there. As we say in Portugal, at full back he is 'on the beach'. As a centre back - where he played the majority of his games for Sporting - he prefers to use his physicality and his excellent anticipation to disturb his opponents on the ground, but he could do better in the air. He is also sometimes found wanting in his marking and positioning, which for a player in that position is crucial. The Argentina defender (right) played most of his football at Sporting Lisbon in the centre of defence . Rojo (left) showed he is not afraid to put in a challenge during his Manchester United debut against QPR . However, don't think he will make mistakes in all of his matches. Rojo is the kind of footballer that has an excellent game one week but then his weaknesses appear in the next game, particularly at centre half. He is not a panicker. When he plays left back, Rojo is able to go forward with possession. He is good on the ball, has excellent vision and the eye for a pass in attacking areas. He made plenty of goals for Sporting last season. But to do a great job at centre back, he has to have an excellent covering defender at his side. Here in Portugal he did well because he played with a great partner, Mauricio - they conceded 19 goals in 29 games, the fewest in the Primeira Liga - who had more experience in that position. The defender's disciplinary record at Sporting Lisbon was not brilliant and he was sent off five times last year . Rojo could be deployed at centre half when Manchester United travel to Leicester City this weekend . Although he was often played at centre back, Rojo struggled unless he had an experienced player alongside . If Rojo does not have a solid player alongside him, however, there will be more mistakes. I can say that the £16million which Manchester United paid was for Marcos Rojo the left back - he isn't worth that kind of money at centre half. He can still do it but not with the same effectiveness as in his favourite position of left back. It will be a tough examination for Rojo at centre half in a porous United defence vs the newly-promoted Foxes . Rojo was deployed at left back for Argentina during the World Cup, when they reached the final in Brazil .

"Arjen Robben deserves his reputation as a diver and he added to his collection of tumbles shortly after coming on as a substitute for Bayern. With the teams deadlocked it was clear that Bayern were getting more and more desperate for a goal – hence the call for Robben to enter the pitch. Whilst Fernandinho may have made slight contact with his arm Robben went to ground and threw his legs out behind him making the possible contact irrelevant and the act worthy of an Oscar nomination. Arjen Robben went down easily in the penalty box under the faintest of contact from Man City's Fernandinho . Robben, who came on as a late substitute, has a reputation as a diver and this did nothing to help it . Robben's theatrics didn't impress the referee, however, who waved play on following the incident . Robben replaced Thomas Muller with 14 minutes remaining at the Allianz Arena as Bayern searched for a goal . Robben's abundant talent is unfortunately overshadowed by his theatrics . The additional assistant was perfectly placed and was unmoved for the penalty appeal but should have advised his colleague that a yellow card was appropriate. After a dive at the World Cup in the summer Robben issued an apology – until he starts to get retrospective bans he will continue cheating to try and help his team. What a pity that such a talented player will be remembered for his theatrics rather than his obvious skill and pace.","Arjen Robben dived to try and win a penalty towards the end of Bayern Munich's match with Manchester City in the Champions League .

"Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp delivers his verdict on a weekend of shocks in the Premier League. First, Liverpool were humbled at Upton Park, losing 3-1 to West Ham to make it three defeats in five this season. And on Sunday, Manchester United were soundly beaten by Leicester City 5-3 giving Louis van Gaal much to ponder. There was also the small matter of a Frank Lampard goal against Chelsea for Manchester City in a 1-1 draw. How Van Gaal has to prove his genius . It doesn’t take a great tactical mind to go out and sign Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria. Any United fan could have done that. It’s not rocket science. But fixing the United defence is another matter. Now we really will find out if Louis van Gaal is a genius. Everyone could see that United were light years away from where they should be. They were so obviously short of top defenders and have given themselves a major problem by not signing a recognised centre back. They had no Champions League in the week and plenty of time to work on their defensive system. There were no excuses and to concede five goals against a newly promoted club is appalling. Now we will really find out if Louis van Gaal is a genius... the Manchester United boss must work on his system . Van Gaal is well stocked up front but he seriously needs to address the issues in defence . United were defeated 5-3 by Leicester on Saturday at the King Power Stadium . At the beginning of the season, people criticised them for using a back three but even with four they let in five goals. Can you imagine if that had happened with a three? It just goes to show there is more to their problems than just systems. But for all of United’s woes, all credit to Leicester. They were magnificent again and have tested some of the best teams. Their fans will be loving the start they have made back in the Premier League. Leicester were magnificent, they have tested the best teams in the league and the fans should be proud . Goal would have left Frank buzzing . Don't be fooled by the non-celebration. Frank Lampard will have been the happiest man in the dressing room after scoring that goal. He is the ultimate goalscoring machine and if he didn’t want to score, what was he doing in the box? He has perfected the art of arriving late in the area and makes it look so easy. He’s like a magnet to the ball but that’s not down to luck — he has spent a lifetime practising. Don't be fooled by Frank Lampard's celebration, he would have been the happiest player on the pitch! Lampard claps the Chelsea support, but If he didn't want to score, why was he in the box? Andre Schurrle got the blame for not tracking James Milner but Branislav Ivanovic should have known better than to let Frank get in behind him. Lampard is the greatest goalscoring midfielder we have ever seen in the Premier League and maybe even the best in the world. He will not have cared one bit about scoring against his old club. He is a true professional and the ultimate winner. Lampard embraces Didier Drogba at the end of the match - City and Chelsea drew 1-1 at the Etihad Stadium . Set-piece shocker . Liverpool let in two Premier League goals in the first 10 minutes for the first time since February 1994, when Southampton beat them 4-2. BELOW: Record since the start of last season . Without Luis Suarez, Liverpool were never going to score as many goals. The worrying thing for Brendan Rodgers is his side are still letting them in at an alarming rate. They’ve let in 35 league goals and kept six clean sheets in 2014. That’s not good enough. Opposition teams are sensing the fear and set-pieces in particular are now a phobia for Rodgers’ men. That is something you would expect to be fixed on the training ground, but you can overdo it. If you focus too much on weaknesses you can become very conscious of them and start to think more about what you can’t do than what you can. The Liverpool defence look gripped by fear at every corner and free-kick. Since the start of last season they have let in more goals from set-pieces than City or Chelsea. They must improve. Liverpool have conceded 16 goals from set-pieces since the start of last season . Brendan Rodgers' side have actually looked worse in defence since Luis Suarez's departure . City's new beast . Manchester City already have one beast in central defence with Vincent Kompany. Now with Eliaquim Mangala, they’ve found another one. He was magnificent on debut and there’s no bigger test at present than facing Diego Costa. But Mangala was strong, aggressive and fantastic on the ball. Between him and Kompany, City could have a formidable partnership. Manchester City have another new beast on their hands other than Vincent Kompany: Eliaquim Mangala . This grappling is holding us back . Football has become so obsessed with trying to stop diving — correctly, I might add — that we have ignored another disease in our game: grappling at set-pieces. It has been brushed over for years but it’s just as big a problem as diving. Every week we see players holding on to the opposition for dear life at corners and free-kicks. We seem to be losing the art of defending properly and fairly. If it’s outside the area, it’s a free-kick. If it’s in the box, it’s a penalty. Simple. Until referees are strong enough to act, it will not go away. It’s killing our game but if more penalties were awarded, then players would think twice before doing it again. Big Sam sticks to the brief . When West Ham kept Sam Allardyce, he knew he had to produce attacking football if he wanted to stay in the job. Now he’s doing that in abundance. West Ham have better players this season and have pace throughout the team. If they keep it up they will lose the fear factor they had last season of playing at home. Sam Allardyce's attacking football with West Ham could mean the fans actually end up liking him . They deserved their win and it was a tactical masterstroke to play Stewart Downing at the tip of the diamond. He was magnificent all evening. If Sam’s not careful, the West Ham fans might end up liking him. Dele delight . What a performance from Dele Alli. The lad is just 18 but he grabbed a hat-trick as MK Dons thrashed Crewe 6-1. It takes a good player to score three goals from midfield, whatever level you are playing at, and Alli looks the real deal. He was fantastic when his side demolished Manchester United in the League Cup and was at it again on Saturday. Sometimes a young player is better off playing regularly at a lower level. Going through the youth teams at a top club is great but there are so few opportunities for first-team football. I was 16 when I played for Bournemouth before Kenny Dalglish signed me for Liverpool and that early experience helped. It’s good to see Alli starting his career in a similar way. Dele Alli was superb again for MK Dons on Saturday, the young midfielder has a bright future . Bruce's bonus . Mohamed Diame is proving to be a good bit of business for Hull. He scored on his debut against his old club West Ham a week ago and hit an absolute screamer against Newcastle. Steve Bruce has made some good signings during his time at the club and his new midfielder is big, strong and powers his way through games. He’s shown he’s got great technique, too, and at £3.5million he looks a snip. Mohamed Diame could be a bargain for Steve Bruce and Hull at just £3.5m, he scored a screamer on Saturday . JAMIE'S PREMIER LEAGUE NUMBER CRUNCHING . 3 Peter Crouch must enjoy proving a point against his old clubs. The striker scored one and set up another against QPR, where he played for a season in 2000-01. That means that the last three times he has scored a goal and assisted another in the same game have all come against former clubs. QPR were the latest victims and he has done it twice against Aston Villa. 814 Arsenal completed more passes against Aston Villa than in any PL game since 2012, when they made 828 against Wolves. 2010 Spurs have failed to score in straight home games for the first time since August 2010. Not what fans hoped Mauricio Pochettino would add to the team. 100% Crystal Palace clearly took their shooting boots with them when they went to Goodison Park. Neil Warnock’s team only had three shots on target in the entire match but scored with each one. 10 West Brom beat Spurs for the first time in 10 league matches. They also ended a run of nine league games without a win at White Hart Lane, their last coming in 1984. The last three times Peter Crouch has scored  assisted in the same game have all come against former clubs . 2009 Burnley's poor form in front of goal means they are the first side to draw three Premier League games in a row 0-0 since Blackburn drew three blanks in December 2009. 16,171 Portsmouth in League Two drew more than 16,000 fans to Fratton Park for their 1-1 draw with Wycombe. That’s eight more people than watched QPR draw 2-2 with Stoke at Loftus Road in the Premier League.","Manchester United were defensively poor  in their 5-3 defeat byLeicester .

"Coritiba forward Joel’s disastrous goal celebration has somewhat overshadowed his decisive brace in the 3-1 league victory over Sao Paulo.

"Inflammatory language: Nina Shtanski, foreign minister of Transdniestria . The glamorous foreign minister of a breakaway region of Moldova is calling on Vladimir Putin to make her country his next conquest in eastern Europe. Few may have heard of Transdniestria, the unofficial and fictitious-sounding statelet whose head of international relations is 36-year-old Nina Shtanski. However, senior Western figures are alarmed that following the annexation of Crimea it is step two in a Kremlin masterplan to redraw the frontiers of Europe. This top diplomat in staunchly pro-Russian Transdniestria, who has a penchant for revealing black dresses, is gushing in her praise of Putin's takeover of the Black Sea peninsula. She openly invites him to make the same move in her landlocked territory of 509,000 people, wedged between strife-torn Ukraine and Moldova. 'We are pleased to say that the outcome of the Crimean referendum almost fully coincides with the results of the Transdniestrian referendum of 17 September 2006, when over 97 per cent of voters chose  independence and the prospect of voluntary unification with Russia,' she said in a statement. 'The obvious match of the will expressed by people in Crimea and Transdniestria demonstrates that the Russian World is uniting and the people's wish for unity cannot be stopped.' Russian troops are assembling on Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia. An annexation of Transdniestria would be a significant expansion of Russian territory. A Russian force of 1,300 troops - currently on high alert - is already on the ground as 'peacekeepers' in the self-declared state - which boasts the hammer and sickle on its mainly red flag. Last week there were reports of plain-clothed Russian FSB secret services agents flooding into breakaway territory. Nina Shtanski, whose striking looks have been compared to a fashion model . Russian President Vladimir Putin signs bills making Crimea part of Russia in the Kremlin in Moscow . Under international law, the . unofficial country is part of Romanian-speaking Moldova, but after a war . as the USSR broke up, Ms Shtanski and the local population have never . accepted rule by Moldova. They are now bent on being formally integrated as a region of the Kremlin, which has long subsidised this outpost. The . fear for Western military planners is that after taking Transdniestria, . Putin could then seize an arc from there to Crimea, sealing off the . southern Black Sea regions of Ukraine. In the process, he would grab another old Russian jewel, the port city of Odessa, and cripple Kiev's economy. The 36-year-old mother of one said: 'The Russian World is uniting and the people's wish for unity cannot be stopped' Nina Shtanski's inflammatory call, combined with more pro-Russian protests in Ukrainian cities, provoked fresh fears that Putin plans to seize more slices of eastern Europe following his annexation of Crimea . 'Unity and integration, as shown by . today's realities, are not always associated with geography,' explained . mother-of-one Ms Shtanski in the district's capital Tiraspol. 'We . are a striking confirmation of this fact. We consider ourselves part of . the Russian world. We do not separate ourselves from the Russians and . Russian civilization. 'We consider ourselves part of Russia, and not without reason. This has legal and historical background.' Transdniestria . was originally seized by Russia in 1792 under Catherine the Great but . is today a Soviet timewarp with Lenin statues and military checkpoints. Like . many others, Ms Shtanski cannot use her Transdniestrian passport to . travel and instead relies on her Russian citizenship, for example when . travelling to Moscow to complete her doctorate in international . relations. Nina Shtanski is the foreign minister of Transdniestria, a mainly Russian-speaking region . Leading U.S. voices including former Republican presidential candidate John McCain and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have warned about the risk to Western interests in a Putin takeover. 'Now that we've had a crash course on Crimea, read ahead about Transdniestria, a likely target for Putin's next move,' warned Strobe Talbott, a former U.S. diplomat who is president of the Brookings Institution. In Moscow, powerful deputy premier Dmitry Rogozin - hit last week by Western sanctions - has been put in charge of Russia's response on Transdniestria amid complaints from locals that they are being blockaded by both Ukraine and Moldova . The local pleas could become a pretext for Moscow's intervention fronted - Crimean-style - by local self-defence squads.","Nina Shtanski said: 'The people's wish for unity cannot be stopped'

"Arsenal face an untimely injury crisis as they prepare to open their Champions League campaign for another season with one of the toughest trips in Europe on Tuesday night. The Gunners will come up against Borussia Dortmund and the famous 'Yellow Wall' at the Westfalenstadion and will have to do so without a number of key personnel in defence. Summer buy Mathieu Debuchy will be out for two months after damaging ankle ligaments against Manchester City and Nacho Monreal did not make the trip to Germany. Calum Chambers is suffering from tonsilitis and is rated '50-50', leaving Arsene Wenger with a patched-up defence. One of those set to step in is 19-year-old Hector Bellerin, but who is the young star set for a baptism of fire in one of Europe's most intimidating arenas. Hector Bellerin in Arsenal training ahead of Arsenal's Champions League visit to Borussia Dortmund . Arsene Wenger faces a selection dilemma in defence after injuries to Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers and Nacho Monreal, meaning that Bellerin could start at right-back in the Westfalenstadion . Mathieu Debuchy damaged ankle ligaments against Manchester City and could miss two months . NAME: Hector Bellerin . AGE: 19 . CLUB: Arsenal . POSITION: Right-back . I'm going to need more than that... Hector Bellerin certainly won't be fazed by the prospect of stepping out in front of 80,000 fans at the Westfalenstadion on Tuesday night. This is a player who has been crafted for big occasions like this, first at Barcelona and then at Arsenal, and is going places in his career - very quickly. His performances on the right-hand side of defence for Arsenal's Under 21 side over the last couple of seasons caught the eye of Arsene Wenger and the manager clearly feels Bellerin is ready to make the leap into the first team. He also gained valuable experience - and impressed plenty - in his eight Championship appearances for Watford during the middle of last season. The highlight came at Elland Road, when Bellerin's lung-busting 70 yard run from the edge of his own penalty area helped create a goal for Cristian Battochio in a 3-3 draw. Hector Bellerin on the ball in an Under 21 fixture for Arsenal. He has caught the eye of Arsene Wenger with his flying performances at right-back at the reserve level . Bellerin made his one and only first team appearance in the League Cup at West Brom last season. He came on in extra time for Mikel Arteta and played in an unfamiliar central midfield role . Wenger recalled him from that loan spell at Vicarage Road in February but his only senior appearance to date was in the League Cup win at West Brom last season, when he came on for the injured Mikel Arteta and played in an unfamiliar central midfield role. Barcelona-born Bellerin is at his best when allowed to carry the ball forward from his right-back position. He has pace in abundance and the way the ball sticks to his feet betrays his football education both in Catalonia and north London. His name hit the headlines when he broke Theo Walcott's record over the 40m sprint, making him technically the fastest player to ever play for the club. Walcott had earlier stolen the crown from Thierry Henry. It's perhaps explained by the fact he was originally a winger at Barcelona, converting into a right-back only when he moved to London in the summer of 2011. Bellerin shakes hands with Per Mertesacker during training ahead of the Champions League clash . Hector Bellerin takes on Aston Villa's Calum Robinson in an Under 21 Premier League fixture last week . Bellerin explained all in an August 2012 interview: 'When I was at Barcelona I always used to play on the right-wing. 'But last year I learnt a lot from Steve Bould about how to defend and every day I feel more and more comfortable as a right-back.' Bellerin is well known to the die-hards who watch the Under 21 side and the UEFA Youth League at Boreham Wood's Meadow Park. He contributed two goals and an assist in his seven Under 21 Premier League outings last season either side of his Watford loan and played in all but two of Arsenal's maiden Youth League campaign. With Wenger watching on at the Emirates a couple of weeks ago, he delivered an inch-perfect cross for Chuba Akpom to head in the second of his hat-trick in the Under 21s 4-2 win over West Brom. His energetic performance in that game - and another in front of the Sky TV cameras when Arsenal beat Aston Villa 2-0 last Thursday - was sufficient to confirm to Wenger that he is ready. Bellerin gained valuable first team experience at Watford in the middle of last season . What about international honours? Bellerin is currently a Spain Under 19 international and has made eight appearances so far. He previously represented his country at Under 16 and Under 17 level, receiving his first cap in 2011. He blotted his copybook at the European Under 19 Championship in Lithuania, getting sent off in Spain opening match with Portugal and was not able to appear again until the semi-finals. Bellerin played the entire match against France but his team were eliminated 2-1 after extra time, ending their title defence. What's his style? Bellerin's natural instinct is to bomb forward when in possession of the ball, getting white paint on his boots and taking on defenders. This is all well and good in Under 21 matches but Bellerin will have to show greater discipline if selected against Dortmund. Bellerin tackles Everton's Matthew Kennedy during an Under 21 match last season . Against Jurgen Klopp's talented side, if he goes all gung-ho and gets stranded up the pitch, Arsenal could be left exposed. Wenger will certainly stress this in his pre-match team talk and Bellerin will have to cocnentrate on his defensive duties. While we possibly won't see much evidence of it on Tuesday, Bellerin is an exciting player to watch going forward and, as mentioned, is sometimes hard to differentiate from a flying winger. He has dramatic acceleration that leaves opponents trailing, skills, trickery and a magnetic touch. He is also adept at picking out forwards with his crossing. In terms of the defensive attributes, Bellerin is sound too. His tracking back and tackling are of the standard you would expect and will yet be further polished with greater experience. He does sometimes get caught out of position when the opposition counter-attack but at least has the pace to track back. Bellerin beats Birmingham's Lee Novak to the ball in the air during a Championship match at Vicarage Road . What happens next? Hopefully, Bellerin can produce a strong performance if given the responsibility against Dortmund and raise his profile. With Debuchy out for a while, this is a superb opportunity for him to impress in the first team and give Wenger a selection headache. Even if he doesn't feature in Germany, there are plenty of matches coming up in which he should play. At 19, he still has plenty of time on his side and there's no doubt he is very highly-regarded by Wenger and everyone at the club.","Hector Bellerin could start for Arsenal against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday .

"The Scots will effectively lose the right to play the National Lottery if they vote for independence, it has emerged. Laws drawn up when the National Lottery was launched 20 years ago say that any decision by the Scots to opt out of the UK would also result in them opting out of the right to play the games. The right to take part in the Lotto and the EuroMillions is restricted to those who buy a ticket in the UK or have a UK bank account. The same rules make clear the Scots would also have to give up their right to receive billions of pounds in grants to charities, sports, the arts, historic buildings and other causes. Scroll down for video . The right to take part in the Lotto and the EuroMillions is restricted to those who buy a ticket in the UK or have a UK bank account . That would be a hammer blow to Scotland, given that more than 50,000 organisations have received lottery grants totalling £2.5billion. The SNP and the Scottish Government have told organisations north of the border that there will be no change to funds received from the Lottery as a result of a Yes vote. Scots will lose the right to take part in the National Lottery and will not be able to admire the charms of Alysha Dixon (above) However, a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said last night: ‘A new Scottish state would have no automatic right to continue being part of the UK National Lottery.’ Up to 70 per cent of Scots regularly play Lotto and EuroMillions. The biggest donors to the independence campaign and the Scottish National Party in recent years have been the Scottish lottery winners, Chris and Colin Weir, who have handed over £5.5million. The couple, who are from Largs in Ayrshire, won £161million in the EuroMillions in 2011 and they have since enjoyed the hospitality of SNP leader Alex Salmond at his official residence, Bute House.

"The Italian Grand Prix was a good weekend for Mercedes. After what had happened in Spa, it was a strong comeback race for the team to finish first and second. During the race Lewis was just that little bit quicker, so I was always digging and trying to find that extra bit of pace. On lap 29, on the approach to Turn One, I made a mistake and simply messed up. Then, instead of taking the risk that I might damage my tyres, I decided to go straight on at the chicane. Nico Rosberg goes off the track at Monza after making a mistake and has dismissed any conspiracy theories . Nico Rosberg finished second behind Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton on a good weekend for the team . It is a very difficult part of the track and, as you would have seen, Lewis made exactly the same mistake a couple of laps later. He however, managed to make the corner, but his tyres were a bit flat-spotted. That was my worry, and that is why I decided to go straight on, because it was so early in my stint. In hindsight it might have been a better decision to cut the chicane out and go over the grass because that was the quicker route, but it was an instinctive reaction. And let me just add one sentence about the conspiracy theories: that it is complete rubbish. The two Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton pose in their garage in Singapore . On the podium there was a minority of fans who booed me again. It isn't a nice feeling and some of the other drivers have said to me that it is wrong and unnecessary, but I respect the actions of the fans and I understand it in some way. It is their only way of showing me that they did not appreciate what had happened back in Spa and that is OK. Because of my misjudgement a lot of people were not able to see an entertaining battle, and Lewis was also denied a position where he could have challenged for the victory. After Lewis Hamilton's win in Monza Nico Rosberg was booed by some fans, but he says he understands why . Under the lights . The Singapore Grand Prix is without question one of the toughest tracks physically because it is very, very hot here. My doctor advises me to drink six or seven litres of water each day, but I can't do that; it's literally like drinking all day long! So, I just have to take on as much liquid as I can because you sweat so much in the car. But it is a great track, one that really pushes the car to the limits, too, and because it is under the lights it makes for a great atmosphere and a brilliant spectacle. Nico Rosberg poses with two young fans in the pit lane ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix this weekend . The Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg took a selfie with fans in Singapore as he steps up his preparation . The race is at 8pm local time, so we are all staying on a European time zone which means being awake until 3 or 4 in the morning. It might sound crazy, but I find it is really easy to do because essentially my sleep pattern remains unchanged. For instance, back at home in Monaco at 7pm, which is 2am over here, you wouldn't ask 'so, how do you still stay awake?' It does mean that my wife and I have to order room service however, because all of the restaurants in the city are closed. I do a lot of reading or watch a film. I even went down to the bar with my wife Vivian the other year. My best man lives and works in Singapore so I have been able to spend some time with him and his partner which is great, too. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg pose together in Singapore, where they will be head to head again . Formula One drivers including Nico Rosberg will stay on a European sleeping pattern while in Singapore . Ahead of this weekend's race I know I face another big challenge against Lewis but this is an awesome battle to be a part of, and it is the reason why I am in Formula One. Competing with someone like Lewis, who I have known for such a long time, is fantastic. I need to bring my absolute best to beat him and that is very exciting for me, so hopefully we will have many more years like this one. Nico Rosberg says he knows to expect a big challenge at the Singapore Grand Prix but is relishing it . Radio silence . The new team radio rules, which limits the communication between the pit wall and the driver, is a challenge because it is different. Up until now so much of what we were doing in the car during a race was a result of what we were being instructed to do by the team; whether it is to drive fast, drive slow, take care of the tyres, or manage the fuel. Now however, we are on our own, we make our own choices and we do our own thing and that is better and it is the right way for the sport to go because it makes the racing pure. Fans will enjoy the new team rules more, as they provide purer racing, according to Mercedes' Nico Rosberg . For example, earlier this season when I was trying to overtake Lewis. But whenever I went to increase my electronic boost power, which I can only do for a couple of corners, Lewis's engineer did a great job, spotted it and told him to do the same. Every time I adjusted my settings, Lewis would replicate that, so there was not a difference in performance in our respective cars which never gave me the opportunity to surprise him. Nico Rosberg tweeted a picture from the simulator as he attempts to adapt to the new team radio rules . But with the new rules that should be over now. The other car will never see what his team-mate is doing; whether he is trying to attack or defend. We are on our own and that makes the racing much more exciting. The fans are happy about it because it makes the racing simpler. I have done my best to prepare for this new era. Earlier this week I was in the simulator I was working hard to get ready for this change and although I made some mistakes, I am ready for it now. Nico Rosberg's fee for his column will be donated to the Grand Prix Mechanics' Charitable Trust, which is dedicated to providing help to former and current Formula One mechanics and their families, putting F1 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need.

"Cristiano Ronaldo will demand a ground-breaking £500,000-a-week to join either Chelsea or Manchester United next summer. Real Madrid star Ronaldo last week confirmed a story Football Grapevine broke 18 months ago that he was on the verge of re-joining United in the summer of 2013. That deal was scuppered by the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson and the fact that United were not prepared to pay Ronaldo what he wanted and eventually got on a new deal with Real Madrid which is in the region of £350,000-a-week. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . Cristiano Ronaldo will demand £500,000-a-week to join either Chelsea or Manchester United next summer . Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty in Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat against Atletico Madrid on Saturday . Since then, United have given Wayne Rooney a £300,000-a-week contract and last week signed Ramadal Falcao on a deal which will earn the Colombian £280,000-a-week. Falcao’s deal was sealed by super-agent Jorge Mendes, who is also Ronaldo’s agent. That United's American owners the Glazers have been prepared to loosen the purse strings to such an extent has encouraged Ronaldo to consider a return back to the Barclays Premier League. Indeed, Ronaldo last week hinted that he could leave Real Madrid next summer. And he would be ready to move back to Old Trafford which was on the brink of happening in summer 2013 but the deal collapsed over the players wage demands. The new policy at United has now changed the financial dynamic. But, given the links Mendes has with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and owner Roman Abramovich, Ronaldo could also be tempted to a move to the west London club.

Slaven Bilic, boss of Besiktas, has re-emerged as a potential successor to Sam Allardyce at West Ham . Back Heel . Its been a tough start for Louis van Gaal at Manchester United but nothing can really compare to Brian Clough’s brief turbulent reign at Leeds. Its 40 years ago this week that Clough was sacked by Leeds after just six games, seven weeks, or more famously 44 days. A combination of his maverick managerial style and a set of Leeds players who resented the fact that father-figure Don Revie, who had been appointed England manager, had been replaced by Clough and by not veteran start Johnny Giles. To compound the situation Clough, who died ten years ago this week, did not disguise his loathing for the Leeds approach to the game or indeed Revie himself. Amazingly on the evening of his dismissal a Yorkshire TV chat shot managed to get both Clough and Revie in the studio. In a an era before PR spin doctors and candyfloss presenters Clough and Revie locked antlers and the outcome to was an amazing spat between the two men. It was TV in the raw of the like you will never see on Sky today. Brian Clough (right, next to Bill Shankly) was sacked by Leeds  after just 44 days four decades ago this week . Libero . Gareth Bale said the 3G artificial pitch he played on for Wales in Andorra was the worst surface he’s ever played on in a proper game. Pitches of the top level teams are now a subtle blend between turf and synthetics which makes for reliable bowling green surfaces that are evergreen, relatively forgiving and don’t cut up. How times change. Gareth Bale said the   pitch he played on in Andorra was the worst surface he’s ever played professionally . Mon: Roy Hodgson should lose his cool and swear a bit more often. It seemed Hodgson has transferred some of his angst on to his players as England played with passion and purpose to win 2-0 against a strong Switzerland side in Basel. Tue: Chris Coleman hailed Gareth Bale as Wales’ Messi, note not Ronaldo, and Bale lived up to the billing in Andorra. Wed: Brendan Rodgers quite rightly slams the England medical team for not applying basic sense (as opposed to sport science) which sees Daniel Sturridge get injured during international training when clearly he needed a rest not more work. Thurs: After their worst ever Premier League season Manchester United reveal they had a record revenue year - it would seem shirt sales in South America, Asia and so on add up to more than silverware. Fri: Oscar Pistorius, cleared of murder, but guilty of manslaughter for the de facto killing his female partner gets bail. But Paul Gascoigne is in high dudgeon for another drunken rumpus, arrested and by many demonised. But for all his faults - and lets not forget how much joy Gazza gave the country - he never killed anyone. Yet he could serve more time than Pistorius. Life’s a Pitch, and back in the day players had to play on all sorts of surfaces, in the winter months mainly mud or sometimes even snow. One of the worst was Derby’s Baseball Ground. Yes they still played some great football under Brian Clough then Dave Mackay in the Seventies. It wasn’t all long ball back then by any stretch of the imagination as some would like to suggest now, but it’s fair to say that often because the conditions defenders would look for an early ball into channels because passing the ball across the back ran the risk of the ball getting stuck in the mud, intercepted and a goal being given away. Yet at the same some there was a generation of midfielders in that era such as Graeme Souness, Liam Brady and Glenn Hoddle who imperiously glided through the mud with effortless ease during the Seventies and Eighties. As Liverpool boss Bob Paisley used to say: 'Great players can play on broken glass.' To be fair to Bale he is a great player and despite his moans he rose to the occasions in Andorra and saved Wales from humiliating defeat as they came from behind to win 2-1 with him scoring both goals. ........................................................................... BTW . Frank Lampard admitted the moment he knew he had to quit England was when Luke Shaw told him he didn’t know who Tony Adams was. Why is it not part of a scholarship at clubs that young players are told the history of the game? Archie Gemmill gets away from Tottenham's Phil Beal on Derby's infamous Baseball Ground pitch in 1972 . Luke Shaw (right, next to Adnan Januzaj) wasn't aware who former England captain Tony Adams was . Y-Factor . Why has Sepp Blatter suddenly done a U-turn and argued for video replays?

"In a lot of countries across Europe, the holding midfielder is the position for artists, those who effortlessly set the tone and tempo of a game. Andrea Pirlo, for one, has made the role an art form. Sergio Busquets does it majestically for Barcelona and Spain, while Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger are others who have flourished in the role of being their team’s orchestrator, getting everyone to play at their rhythm. In England, however, the holding midfielder has been more about breaking up play and protecting the defence. Go back through the years and you’ll see the national team has lacked a figure who has been happy to sit in and get the team moving forward. Jack Wilshere played in a deeper midfield role in England's 2-0 victory in Switzerland . Jack Wilshere has struggled to kick on in Arsenal's set-up with injury and form problems . We produce those who go box to box — think Bryan Robson, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard — or scufflers like Nobby Stiles in 1966. They produce scrappers in Europe, too, such as Didier Deschamps and Claude Makelele, while Javier Mascherano does that role today, but we have never had anyone in that class. When I played for England’s Under 21s, I was a holding midfielder but my task was hunting down the opposition’s No 10. By contrast, the opposition’s main man was always holding and I’ll never forget facing Argentina’s Juan Roman Riquelme at the 1997 Under 20 World Cup in Malaysia. Riquelme was so good he always had space to do what he wanted. It was as if he was making time stand still, plotting where he would ping his next pass. That is what a high-class holding midfielder can do but, for whatever reason, England haven’t produced that kind of player in modern times. Could that be about to change? Roy Hodgson sprang a surprise by selecting Jack Wilshere at the base of his diamond in Switzerland. The move split opinion. How did you feel he played? Personally, I thought he did OK, but it might be that he needs to get used to it in order to find his niche for club and country as the position we expect him to fill is not there at the moment. Wilshere emerged as someone who likes to burst past players and get forward but, during the time he has been out injured, Aaron Ramsey has made the attacking midfield role his own at Arsenal, with lots of goals and dynamic performances. If England are going to retain a diamond, you wouldn’t look to use Wilshere in the roles Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph fulfilled in Basle, as I don’t think he has their dynamism or energy. Equally, I don’t think he’d be comfortable playing with his back to goal, like the impressive Raheem Sterling. Jack Wilshere trains at Arsenal's base at London Colney ahead of their meeting with Manchester City . But dropping deeper? It could work. One of Wilshere’s qualities, aside from his skill, is his aggression. I remembered that from when I watched him stand out during Arsenal’s FA Youth Cup final win over Liverpool in 2009 and it was evident when I first played against him. Jack was only 18 when he lined up against us on the opening day of the 2010-11 season but, aside from being comfortable in possession, he was fearless, driving into challenges whenever the ball was there to be won. Trust me, he knows how to tackle. He has that in his armoury but Wilshere, to maximise his opportunities, might have to learn the finer details of being a holding midfielder. Andrea Pirlo mastered the deeper role and tormented England at the World Cup earlier this year . Bastian Schweinsteiger has adapted his game to play in a deeper role for Germany and Bayern Munich . Sergio Busquets (centre) plays in a deep midfield role for both Barcelona and Spain . He would have to be more disciplined and stop running with the ball, for instance, as that would invite danger. Those short, sharp bursts have been a trademark for Wilshere but they probably haven’t helped with some of the injuries he has sustained. Think about it: if you keep running with the ball, you become more susceptible to being hit by heavy challenges. The point is England do not have many to choose from in that role. Michael Carrick could play it but enough England managers have looked at him and not been convinced; Gareth Barry continues to do well for Everton but his time appears to have gone. Javier Mascherano, pictured playing for Argentina, made his name as a ball-winning central midfielder . Other options would be Phil Jones, if a man-marking job needed to be done on a world-class No 10, or perhaps Tom Huddlestone, but the concern would be why Tottenham sold him if he was truly international class. So it may be that Wilshere has to learn the role and it can be done. Pirlo started as a No 10 but Carlo Ancelotti experimented by bringing him back at AC Milan. Schweinsteiger was converted from being a winger by Louis van Gaal, while Paul Scholes dropped back to control games for Manchester United. You wouldn’t say any of those players, or some mentioned earlier, were outstanding defensively. Aaron Ramsey (left) has made the attacking midfield role at Arsenal his own with some impressive showings . Jordan Henderson (left) and Fabian Delph (right) provided a lot of energy in midfield against Switzerland . Maybe what happened to Wilshere in Switzerland was for the best, as I don’t believe he is a player you would yet describe, for all his ability, as being one of your first names on the teamsheet, either for Arsenal or England. To excel in the role, he would have to improve his range of passing but it is encouraging to hear he is watching videos, working out what he needs to do to fulfil the expectations many have for him. Time will tell whether he would be suited to playing in that role in the hurly-burly of the Barclays Premier League, particularly in a contest like Saturday's against Manchester City, and maybe he would be more suited to it at international level. Raheem Sterling has thrived in an advanced, central role for Liverpool and now for England . Some would argue that he isn’t suited to the position, that he should be used further forward, but others have more powerful claims to operate in those roles at this time. Who knows? In the future we might talk of Jack Wilshere as England’s conductor-in-chief. Rodgers will relish return of famous Anfield nights . Playing at Anfield on a Champions League night is one of the best experiences in football and my old ground will be full on Tuesday. It is great that Liverpool are back in that competition and nobody will be looking forward to the meeting with Bulgarian side Ludogorets more than Brendan Rodgers, who has been working relentlessly to get his team back on this stage. Jamie Carragher celebrates a famous Champions League win for Liverpool over Chelsea at Anfield . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers shares a joke with Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard in training . Starting this evening, though, is a period when a lot of questions will be asked of Rodgers and his squad and they will be scrutinised to see how they cope with the challenge of keeping the team near the top of the table and competitive in Europe. He has some injuries to contend with but that will not stop Liverpool supporters thinking that they are going to win the next three games — Saturday’s match against Aston Villa and a trip to West Ham sandwich the Ludogorets fixture — over the next seven days. There is no doubt Brendan will have to rotate and it will be crucial that he makes the right decisions at the right times. This schedule shows why Liverpool made so many signings during the summer but fitting them all into the right blend will determine if they can continue to be successful. Mario Balotelli, pictured in training, was brought in to provide added depth and competition for Liverpool . Daniel Sturridge is out for up to three weeks after picking up an injury while on international duty with England . What I'm looking forward to this week... Seeing how Louis van Gaal manages to make it all work. I have been reading a book by Dutch journalist Maarten Meijer on Van Gaal and one line sticks in my mind. Van Gaal says that he does not ‘pick the 11 best’ when selecting his team but he ‘picks the best 11’ and it will be intriguing to see how he moulds everything together for Manchester United. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal unveils new signings Daley Blind (left) and Radamel Falcao (right) Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie could find their places  in the United first team come under threat . After an extraordinary end to the summer window, when they smashed the British transfer record with their £60million purchase of Angel Di Maria and then signed Radamel Falcao on loan, Van Gaal has a squad to start making progress. Falcao, for instance, is a brilliant addition to the Barclays Premier League and if he recaptures the form he showed for Atletico Madrid — his performance against Chelsea in the 2012 European Super Cup is still in my mind — he will transform United. But if 50 people sat down and tried to pick a team for the game against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, I’d say there would be countless formations and few would have the same names. Angel di Maria, who joined in a British record £60m fee from Real Madrid, made his debut against Burnley . If Van Gaal is going to make things tick for United, he is going to have to make some high-profile and tough decisions with his team selection. The biggest one of all is how will he possibly get Falcao, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney in the same team? Should he continue to live by his rule of not picking ‘the 11 best’, there are going to be some disappointed stars in United’s dressing room. How Van Gaal handles that will be key.","Wilshere was used in a deeper role for England against Switzerland .

"The first ever academic journal dedicated entirely to the study of pornography has been announced by publishers Routledge. Called Porn Studies, it is due to launch next Spring and will feature academic papers that look into how pornographic books, films and other content impact our lives. The rise in popularity of so-called 'Mummy Porn', including books such as the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, is expected to be one of the topics covered. Porn and the pornography industry will be the subject of a new journal launching next Spring called Porn Studies. The journal will feature papers, articles and book reviews looking at how pornographic material affects society . The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is an erotic novel written by E.L James. It was the fastest book to sell 1 million copies, beating books by Dan Brown and J.K Rowling. It was also the first book to sell a million Kindle copies. When the book was first released, over 4857 tweets were posted a day referencing the book and its characters. The book's success led to the term 'Mummy Porn' being coined, because it was said to have been bought predominantly by housewives. Source: Neo Mammalian Studios . The journal will be edited by British academics Feona Attwood and Clarissa Smith. Attwood is a media professor at Middlesex University and editor of Mainstreaming Sex: The Sexualization of Western Culture. Clarissa Smith is a reader in sexual cultures at the University of Sunderland and founder member of the Onscenity Network, which ran the Sexual Cultures Conference in April. Attwood and Smith are asking for submissions from academics in sociology, film, media, law and criminology. The editors believe that pornography studies are still 'in their infancy' and hope to rectify that with Porn Studies. The Fifty Shades of Grey books, dubbed 'Mummy Porn' because they were said to have been bought predominantly by housewives, divided opinion when they were released. Studies into how sexually explicit books such as these will form the basis of the new Porn Studies journal . Publisher Routledge said: 'Porn Studies will be the first dedicated, international, peer-reviewed journal to critically explore those cultural products and services designated as pornographic and their cultural, economic, historical, institutional, legal and social contexts.' Adding it will pay particular attention to 'the intersection of sexuality, gender, race, class, age and ability.' The journal will be a mix of papers, articles and book reviews. The editors are currently looking for submissions for its first issue due to print in Spring 2014.","Academic journal will look at how pornographic materials impact society .

"We can only assume at the end of this ferocious East Midlands derby that were Brian Clough looking down a decade after his death, a wicked smile might have spread across his lips. The two clubs to which he brought unequalled glory clattered into one another for 98 minutes — such was the length of added time — and produced a match that made up in drama what it lacked in quality. Old Big ’Ead might also have been able to smack some sense into the pitch invader who managed to delay the match for an inordinate period and stoke even further an atmosphere Stuart Pearce called the ‘best ever in this stadium’. Richard Keogh (right) scored the equalising goal for Derby County against Nottingham Forest during a goalmouth scramble late into the second half .

In the second half a Forest fan left his seat to stroll around the City Ground, goad the Derby fans and swing his shirt round his head, only being caught as he returned to the stands. Expert policing, this was not. Shortly after the interruption, Forest took the lead in the 71st minute. Michail Antonio, a menace down the left, fed Britt Assombalonga, who turned adroitly to fire a crisp left-foot shot past Lee Grant and send the City Ground into raptures. It was the striker’s fifth goal since his move from Peterborough and his £5.5million fee is looking a bargain. Steve McClaren reorganised his Derby side and in the 80th minute they equalised after a goalmouth scramble that should see Ryan Shotton, on his league debut for the club, credited with the goal ahead of Leon Best. Richard Keogh headed Craig Forsyth’s free-kick against the bar, Shotton met the rebound and the ball crossed the line before Best rammed it into the back of the net, even if referee Paul Tierney failed to blow initially. In the closing minutes Jake Buxton was given a second yellow card for a foolish challenge on Chris Burke. This match never looked like ending 11 v 11 and it was the sixth red card in the last eight meetings between these rivals. Forest stay unbeaten at the top of the Championship, with Derby yet to find the form that took them to the play-off final last May. ‘It was probably a fair result,’ reflected Pearce. ‘I’m a little bit disappointed in the quality of some of the football. I don’t think we had enough devilment in our play.’ Pearce lost only one derby match during his 12 years as a Forest player and knows the edge this game carries. But he praised both sets of supporters for celebrating the memory of Clough with a minute’s applause in the 10th minute. ‘It’s great to see,’ he said. ‘There is one person who unites this part of the world and it is that man.’ More choice words were sent the way of the rogue Forest fan, who was allowed to walk on the pitch untroubled for at least three minutes. ‘It was pathetic,’ said Pearce. ‘I have no idea why stewards didn’t intervene.’ Pearce will today find out about the gravity of captain Chris Cohen’s injury. The midfielder left the field after twisting his right knee. He wore the pained expression of a player who has missed two substantial spells with cruciate ligament injuries in the past three seasons. ‘We just hope luck is on his side because I know the hard work he puts in behind the scenes,’ said Pearce.

"If Chelsea blowing key Premier League rivals out of the summer transfer water wasn’t patently obvious already, it is now. The leaders — and their £32million striker — look unstoppable. Diego Costa’s hat-trick against Swansea on Saturday was alluring in its simplicity and illustrated just what Jose Mourinho, by his own admission, had been missing: a fine, unadulterated finisher. The manager is insistent that refusing to dive headfirst into an overpriced market last summer has proved correct, instead biding his time for the right man. Diego Costa has been hugely impressive for Chelsea since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer . Diego Costa will be looking to fill his boots against a Schalke side who lost 4-1 to Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday. Last season’s third-placed team have yet to record a win this campaign and sit second from bottom in the Bundesliga table with a goal difference of minus four. As speculation increases about Jens Keller’s tenure at the club, the manager said: ‘We’ve just got to remain calm. We mustn’t do anything rash.’ He’s got him all right. That’s seven in his opening four games. The former Atletico Madrid bruiser, who joked that he is yet to win a header in England, is making a mockery of similar money lavished elsewhere. For all the talk about his prowess in front of goal, there is a message Mourinho wants to get across. Chelsea have bought more than just a poacher capable of nudging home a Cesc Fabregas assist from six yards. They managed to squeeze £28m out of Everton for Romelu Lukaku while doing homework on Costa properly, bringing in someone who has instantly become a leader at Stamford Bridge. Perhaps not an individual to overtly coerce performances from others, but whose battling spirit makes them follow. Jose Mourinho waited to sign Diego Costa instead of entering and inflated transfer market last summer . Diego Costa is a superb centre-forward who plays like an old-fashioned English target man. He is no lightweight soft foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for diving at Burnley. There was evidence of the more robust nature of his play when he strongly pushed away Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson  after he was being held in the area. Perhaps he could have been cautioned had referee Kevin Friend been slavish to the law, but there was nothing I saw to suggest he should have been sent off. The fact he was not even booked perhaps levelled things up after his yellow card at Turf Moor. Mourinho wouldn’t have a prayer of persuading Costa to have a rest without serious cause. Last week’s hamstring complaint didn’t keep him out at the weekend and it will take something special for the 25-year-old not to be in Wednesday’s starting XI against Schalke in the Champions League. ‘The most important thing of a player’s character is what affects his performance,’ Mourinho said. ‘He was a risk and a doubt before Everton, a risk and a doubt before the Spain game (against France), a risk and a doubt before this game and he played all three. ‘He is a risk and a doubt again for next Wednesday because of an accumulation of matches but nobody can stop him.’ Mourinho has tried to have a word but it falls on deaf ears. ‘If the injury is a clear injury of course, yes, but when the doubt is there and he has not the best feelings but he feels he can, he goes (on). He knows exactly what the team needs and is ready to give,’ said the Chelsea manager. The Brazilian born Spanish striker has now scored seven goals in four games for Chelsea . ‘It is not about the modern player, it is about the modern society. The education they get, the people they have sometimes behind them, make them be a little bit more selfish in the sense of you first and the team second. ‘When you get guys with this mentality they become special and they can be an influence to the people around them.’ Like John Terry? ‘Yeah, yeah.’ Costa asserts that he is ‘adapting very well’ to life in English football. So well, in fact, that he sounded just like his skipper. Jose Mourinho said of Diego Costa: ‘When you get guys with this mentality they become special' ‘The key is the group we have,’ he said. ‘It is like a family...we are working together and the truth is that things are going very well for all of us.’ Chelsea seem to have the whole package here and even one who appears to know who ex-Newcastle striker Quinn is. ‘I am very happy to have this record. A striker has to score and I am happy that I have a little place in history,’ he said. The only blot is that Costa has not yet been out in London to immerse himself in the capital. That will come, but for now he’s the man who can do no wrong. SUPER STAT: Diego Costa is the first Chelsea player to score in his first four games for the club since John Meredith in 1928. He also beat Micky Quinn and Sergio Aguero’s record of six goals in their first four PL games. Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Courtois 7; Ivanovic 6.5, Cahill 6, Terry 5.5, Azpilicueta 6.5; Matic 6.5, Fabregas 8 (Salah 82, 6); Schurrle 6 (Ramires 46, 7), Oscar 7, Hazard 7.5; Costa 9.5 (Remy 72, 7).

"In the reality game of fantasy football being played out at Manchester United this summer, it has become the £150million question: just which of his stars will Louis van Gaal drop when they are all fit to start? The surge of optimism around Old Trafford during Sunday’s win over QPR was almost palpable, such was the transformation in Van Gaal’s team. But it has also highlighted the embarrassment of riches he has accrued during a summer spent throwing money at the transfer market. Four goals to the good and he was still able to summon Radamel Falcao, Adnan Januzaj and Antonio Valencia off the bench. Robin van Persie (left) could struggle to make it into the Man United team following Radamel Falcao's arrival . It is not a problem that will concern Van Gaal. ‘It’s easy,’ was his response last week when asked how he will accommodate them all. Nor are the fans likely to complain about a sudden sprinkling of stardust after witnessing their club’s alarming decline into mediocrity. But for the expensive squad now assembled at Old Trafford, there are bound to be a few bruised egos in the weeks ahead and nowhere more so than in attack, where the arrival of Angel di Maria and Falcao has upped the ante dramatically. It is generally accepted that Van Gaal simply cannot shoehorn all his stars into the same team — Di Maria, Falcao, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata. Something, or somebody, has to give. Angel di Maria celebrates scoring his first goal for Manchester United on his home debut against QPR . The man who appeared to be most under threat in the new order was Mata. Van Gaal was certainly under no obligation to select a £37.1m signing who arrived at the club four months before he took over and, with the new manager looking to inject more pace into the team it was suggested that the Spaniard might actually slow United down. Four games into the new season, and it would appear that Mata has an integral part to play in the No.10 role. Deployed at the top of a midfield diamond on Sunday, he provided the link between midfield and attack and weighed in with United’s fourth goal. It was Mata’s eighth in 10 Premier League games, which is remarkable for a player brought in primarily to provide assists. So who will be the odd man out? It is highly unlikely to be Di Maria, who showed just why United broke the British transfer record to sign him for £59.7m from Real Madrid, or Wayne Rooney, installed as captain by Van Gaal. Falcao has yet to play a full 90 minutes since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee last January, but it will be hard to omit the Colombia star when he is fully fit. That leaves Van Persie. Mata's form - he has scored eight goals in 10 Premier League games - puts Van Persie's place under threat . Amid the wave of euphoria on Sunday, it was overlooked that the Dutchman did not actually play very well. In fact, he has not played particularly well for United for some time. The striker credited with tipping the title balance in United’s favour after he arrived from Arsenal two years ago, faded under David Moyes last season. The highlight, a Champions League hat-trick against Olympiacos, was followed by news that he would miss six weeks with a knee injury. It was not enough to prevent Van Persie from playing for Van Gaal at the World Cup and scoring that spectacular diving header against Spain in the opening game, but doubts persist that he has fully recovered and his early-season form has done little to dispel them. He posed little threat to QPR at Old Trafford, apart from when a moment of brilliance from Di Maria left him with a clear sight of goal, but he fired straight at Rob Green. Van Persie (right) struggled during the 4-0 victory over QPR and was outshone by his United team-mates . When Van Gaal was confirmed as United’s new manager, it was assumed that his fellow Dutchman would be an automatic first choice, if not for the captaincy as well. Van Persie missed out on that honour and is now in serious danger of being squeezed out of the line-up. At 31, few would argue that his best years are behind him. Van Gaal is unlikely to shirk the issue, as Holland team-mate Daley Blind acknowledged after making an impressive debut. ‘He (the manager) is very honest to everybody — that can be frightening, but I like it,’ said Blind. ‘He knows what he wants and he knows his philosophy.’ Blind and Van Persie were pictured on Saturday night enjoying a Chinese meal with Falcao in Manchester city centre. How much longer Van Persie can keep his place at United’s top table remains to be seen.","Manchester United have an embarrassment of riches after spending £150million this summer .

"US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson’s frustration was rendered complete on Sunday night when Billy Horschel produced a brilliant performance to upstage Rory McIlroy and land himself an $11.44 million (£7m) payday. The 27-year-old American followed up his win in the BMW Championship last week by claiming the Tour Championship from under the nose of the Northern Irishman, which in turn earned him the $10 million (£6.15m) bonus for the FedEx Cup play-off series spanning four tournaments. Almost $13 million (£8m) earned in eight days then, and his wife is due to give birth to their first child any day. How’s that for a life-changing fortnight? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Horschel wins FedEX Cup . Billy Horschel celebrates on his way to victory in the PGA Tour Championship at the East Lake Golf Club . American Billy Horschel is on a hot streak having won almost $13m in the past fortnight . Billy Horschel drives his tee shot on the seventh at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta, Georgia, on Sunday . VIDEO Horschel wins FedEX Cup . Horschel shot a final round 68 to win by three shots from fellow American Jim Furyk and McIlroy, with Chris Kirk, Justin Rose and Jason Day a further shot adrift. Horschel and Kirk finished 1-2 in the FedEx and are just what any Ryder Cup team is looking for, two men in the form of their lives. The problem for Watson, of course, is that neither will be at Gleneagles next week. McIlroy said on Saturday Watson must be kicking himself at the turn of events last week. He looked like he was about to say a lot more besides when he probably saw headlines appearing before his eyes and stopped himself. Certainly the play of Horschel and Kirk stood in stark contrast to that of Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson, Watson’s two wild cards who were competing. Rory McIlroy got into trouble after a wayward tee shot on the ninth hole at East Lake . Rory McIlroy ponders a tough shot from behind dense greenery and up against a fence . Rory McIlroy hits his third shot from an unfortunate lie after clearing the trees and finding the rough . Rory McIlroy was well in contention for the $10m FedEx Cup bonus coming into the final round . Rory McIlroy tweeted shortly after the tournament congratulating Billy Horschel . Asked about Horschel in particular, McIlroy replied: ‘You know, I’m sure Tom Watson is sitting at home kicking himself at the minute with some of the ... but anyways, he’s playing great. That’s another story.’ The skipper’s discomfort continued right to the end as Horschel pulled off a series of dazzling strokes and holed some nerve-wracking putts for a success he thoroughly deserved. ‘Why didn’t you play like this earlier?’ was the text an exasperated Watson sent him on Friday night. What on earth must he be thinking now? The key moment came at the 16th. Horschel was just a shot ahead of Furyk and looked likely to drop a stroke but holed a gutsy 20 footer for par. ‘That was the golf tournament, right there,’ said Horschel. There was a nice scene at the end as McIlroy embraced the winner on the 18th green. They had their differences once at the 2007 Walker Cup but that has long since been resolved and here they showed a mutual respect. Chris Kirk finished the Championship four shots back and second in the FedEx Cup play-off series . As is the case for Billy Horschel, Chris Kirk won't be competing in the Ryder Cup next week . Equal second finisher Jim Furyk pushed his fellow American Billy Horschel all the way . Tom Watson has left two of the US's most in-form players out of his Ryder Cup team . ‘I’ve shown I can go toe to toe with the best player in the world and come out on top, and that’s going to be huge for me going forward,’ said Horschel. McIloy’s bid for his own £11.4 million payday to go with his priceless major championship wins over the summer fizzled out over the first 12 holes. After playing 25 of his last 27 rounds under par, it looked like 18 holes too far as he made a series of wild errors to fall from contention. He did rally with three birdies in a row from the 15th but was never going to catch Horschel. Still, third place in the FedEx earned him a tidy $2 million bonus to go with all the other riches he has claimed this year. As for Simpson and Mahan, they finished the week in tied 23rd place in a 29 man field after neither broke par in any round. They’ll certainly be under pressure to deliver at Gleneagles . Meanwhile, at the KLM Open on the European Tour, Paul Casey lived up the old adage of noted golfing author Keith Elliott that players in their thirties who have just fathered a male child are more likely to win by claiming his 13th tour victory - but his first since becoming a parent. The 37 year old Englishman shot wonderful rounds of 62-66 at the weekend to win by a stroke from fellow countryman Simon Dyson, with two more compatriots rounding out the top four – Andy Sullivan and Eddie Pepperell. ‘First tournament as a dad and first win as a dad,’ said an emotional Casey, whose wife Polyanna gave birth to their son on Sept 1.","Billy Horschel won the PGA Tour Championship and a £7m payday .

"Scientists have made a key breakthrough in discovering how the body can destroy cancerous tumours itself. Researchers from Pennsylvania State University have identified a molecule, known as TIC10, which activates a protein that helps fight the disease. The protein, called TRAIL, suppresses tumour development . during immune surveillance, the immune system's process of patrolling . the body for cancer cells. A key benefit of using TRAIL is that it uses the immune system, so it is not toxic to the body like chemotherapy or radiotherapy (pictured) This process is lost during cancer . progression, which leads to uncontrolled growth and spread of tumours. The key benefit of using TRAIL (tumour-necrosis-factor-related . apoptosis-inducing ligand)  as a way to fight cancer is that it is already part of the immune system so it is not toxic to the body like chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Furthermore, the small size of TIC10 also makes it more effective than past discoveries because it can cross the blood-brain barrier, which separates the main . circulatory system from the brain. This barrier can prevent cancer treatments from entering the brain, thereby hindering the action of drugs for brain tumours. 'We didn’t actually . anticipate that this molecule would be able to treat brain tumours - that was a pleasant surprise,' said lead researcher Wafik El-Deiry, an oncologist at . Pennsylvania State University. Another positive is that TIC10 does not just activate the TRAIL gene in cancerous cells, but also in . healthy ones. This is known as the 'bystander effect' - i.e. where cells near cancerous cells are also killed. Nearby healthy cells are also given a boost to increase the number of cancer-killing TRAIL receptors on their cell surface. The small size of TIC10 also means it can cross the blood-brain barrier, which many anti-cancer drugs cannot do, making it effective at targeting brain cancer cells (pictured) Although the study was limited to mice, Dr El-Deiry is confident that a similar approach would work in humans. He added: 'I . was surprised and impressed that we were able to do this. 'Using a small molecule to significantly boost and overcome . limitations of the TRAIL pathway appears to be a promising way to . address difficult to treat cancers using a safe mechanism already used . in those with a normal effective immune system. 'The TRAIL pathway is a powerful way to . suppress tumors but current approaches have limitations that we have . been trying to overcome to unleash an effective and selective cancer . therapy,' he added. The success of TRAIL to trigger cancer cell . death has led to ongoing clinical trials . with artificially created versions, and early trials have shown that giving the protein in drug form is safe. The study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.","U.S. researchers have identified a a molecule, known as TIC10, which activates protein that helps fight disease .

"The saga around Marco van Basten’s health issues continues with his former assistant at Dutch club AZ Alkmaar being accused of leaking sensitive information about his condition to the media. Alex Pastoor was supposed to swap roles with Van Basten after the former European Footballer of the Year said he could no longer deal with the stress of the job but is now accused of being the source of newspaper leaks. 'I know it for sure,' said the club’s technical director Earnest Stewart on Dutch television in the latest twist in the saga. Marco van Basten has quit his job at AZ Alkmaar, citing stress . Pastoor left the club on Thursday, ostensibly because he could not agree terms over his new role but AZ have now said he departed because of doubts over his integrity. Pastoor said he was seeking legal assistance to try and get his old job as assistant coach back. The saga started last month when Van Basten took a surprise leave of absence, just weeks after joining AZ on a two-year contract. The club cited medical issues as the reason but Dutch media reported in more detail he was battling heart palpitations caused by stress. It was then announced that Van Basten, who turns 50 next month, would be returning to the job after missing two league matches in which assistants Pastoor and Dennis Haar took charge. On Tuesday, Van Basten announced that he was battling stress and would never take a major managerial role again, adding he wanted to stay on at AZ and had negotiated a deal to swap roles with Pastoor. Assistant Alex Pastoor has been accused of leaking sensitive information to the press - an accusation he denies . Just under 48 hours later, Pastoor left with AZ announcing they made an improved offer to him but he did not agree to it. 'It’s to do with the principle of integrity,' Stewart told a Dutch television football programme on Friday. 'I never said Alex Pastoor was the leak but I think he was involved in the leaking of the information. I spoke to him about that. It is very disappointing especially when you have trust in someone.' Pastoor, 47, has dismissed the allegation, calling it a 'huge insult' and is now demanding his old job back. The club will host Dutch league front-runners PEC Zwolle on Sunday with Haar and Van Basten set to be on the bench .","Van Basten's assistant Alex Pastoor has been accused of leaking sensitive information about the Dutch legend's health to the media .

"Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao have gained permission from the Spanish FA to wear 'nationalist' kits for their clash on Saturday, leaving some in Madrid fuming. The Blaugrana requested that they be allowed to wear their ‘senyera’ strip from last season, which features red and yellow stripes to match the Catalan flag, as they celebrated their national day on Thursday. The LFP, Athletic, and the referee have all given permission for Barcelona to wear the kit, which will be the first time they have ever worn it at the Nou Camp.

Barcelona midfielder Xavi attended the event to celebrate Catalonia's national day . Xavi took time out of his schedule to join the people of Catalonia in celebrating national day . The celebratory day, which is an annual festival which takes place on September 11, commemorates the defeat of Catalonia during the War of the Spanish Succession. National day of Catalonia was first celebrated in 1886 and an annual festival has taken place ever since. Catalan nationalists often use the event to call for their independence from mainland Spain. Athletic, have been allowed to play in green shirts with white shorts and red socks, which matches the flag of the Basque Country, the Ikurrina. Barcelona insist that they are not mixing football and politics, with the move designed to be a commemoration of a historical event, the 300th anniversary of the fall of the city to the French in 1714. But Alfredo Relano, editor of AS, a Madrid-based daily newspaper, was unimpressed. He wrote: 'Some at Barca say they don’t want to politicise the match. Well, if that was the club’s intention, Barca would play as Barca and Athletic as Athletic, as they’ve done for a century, and not Barca as Catalonia and Athletic as the Basque Country.' Barcelona players were involved in various events on Thursday to mark Catalonia’s national day. Gerard Pique, Xavi and president Josep Bartomeu were among those who took to the streets of the city to join in the celebrations. They were part of the giant V shape formed between two main roads in the city, Avenida Diagonal and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes.

"Teachers have been encouraged to introduce pornography into the classroom, using sex education lessons to explain that porn is 'not all bad' and 'hugely diverse'. The recommendations, included in an educational guide, suggest that teachers confront 'myths' about porn and inform children as young as five about sexualisation. The guidance could have significant influence in British schools after the Government's decision to keep sex education lessons voluntary, leaving schools to devise their own ways of teaching the subject. Guidance from the Sex Education Forum, whose members include the NSPCC and Barnardo's, encourages teachers to introduce pornography into the classroom . The Daily Mail has led a long-running campaign to introduce measures to protect young people from the growing influence of porn. But the guidance, produced by a coalition of charities, encourages dialogue in the classroom about all aspects of pornography. Issued by the Sex Education Forum, whose members include the NSPCC and Barnardo's, the guidance encourages teachers to inform children over the age of 11 about subjects such as sexting, whereby sexually explicit images and pictures are sent in text messages. Critics said that parents would be 'horrified' by the possible introduction of pornography into classroom lessons. Under a section titled 'We want teachers to know', the guide includes advice that 'that porn is hugely diverse – it's not necessarily all bad'. The 'wish list' section, which aims to create the 'ideal environment' for teaching about sexual issues, also advises teachers to 'speak frankly and confidently' about pornography. In a model lesson plan, it is . suggested that children are told about the differences between what is . 'real' and 'unreal' in pornography, using a device known as the 'planet . porn game'. The Daily Mail has led a long-running campaign to introduce measures to protect young people from the growing influence of porn . The guidance, contained within the body's first Sex Educational Supplement titled The Porn Issue, also suggests that teachers use a website that describes porn as 'great' and something that can be enjoyed. A statement on TheSite.org reads: 'Sex is great. And porn can be great. It's the idea that porn sex is like real sex which is the problem. 'But if you can separate the fantasy from the reality you're much more likely to enjoy both.' Younger children should be taught about 'image manipulation in advertising and body image', according to the guide. The Family Education Trust's Norman Wells criticised the guide, saying: 'The intention appears to be to steer children and young people away from a belief in moral absolutes and to encourage them to think that there are no rights and wrongs when it comes to sexual expression.' He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Many parents will be horrified at the prospect of their children being taught about pornography within such a framework. 'To take a no-holds barred approach to sex education has the potential to break down pupils' natural sense of reserve and to encourage casual attitudes towards sex.' 'If we want children to view sexual intimacy as something valuable, special and worthy of respect, it needs to be addressed with modesty and restraint. To give lessons on pornography is to play with fire.' The Government announced in March that sex education would remain voluntary under the National Curriculum after the previous Labour administration tried to make the lessons compulsory. The Daily Mail has been calling for tough restrictions to protect youngsters. David Cameron has promised that new computers will be automatically be fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them - but has not said when this will happen.","Recommendations suggest teachers confront 'myths' about porn .

"The Old Trafford faithful were introduced to four new heroes making their home debuts. So how did the quartet all do? Sportsmail's MARTIN KEOWN gives his expert opinion... ANGEL DI MARIA - 8/10 . Louis van Gaal likes to have someone who can run with the ball, and Di Maria certainly does that. His dribbling gelled the team and helped shift defence to attack. Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata could all move while his movement stretched QPR. Angel di Maria celebrates his goal as he impressed on his Old Trafford debut for Manchester United . Especially dangerous when he runs with the ball, Angel di Maria helps Man United turn defence into attack . He showed excellent technique and vision with his passing and he looked much more collective in his play - at Real Madrid he too often tried to be the main man. He knows how important it is to capture the hearts of the home fans and certainly did that with this performance. Angel di Maria shakes hands with manager Louis van Gaal after his man of the match performance . RADAMEL FALCAO - 6/10 . It was good that he didn’t arrive on the pitch needing to score a winner. He still looked tentative after his injury and will have to ease in. He made some good runs and had one chance but is still not at his sharpest. Radamel Falcao could have, and probably should have, scored on his debut for Manchester United . Radamel Falcao had the Old Trafford crowd in raptures before he even took to the pitch . Juan Mata made way for Radamel Falcao (above) as he made his first appearance for Manchester United . DALEY BLIND - 7.5/10 . An interesting footballer who almost acts as Louis van Gaal’s brains on the pitch. He is trusted by his former Holland and now club manager and showed great defensive intelligence to protect and press forward if needed. Acted as a feeder at the base of the midfield, keeping passes short on the grass. An excellent debut. Holland star Daley Blind impressed as he provided cover for Manchester United's back four . Along with precise and uncomplicated short passing, Daley Blind was an asset in defence . MARCOS ROJO - 6.5/10 . Slotted in nicely and covered his centre backs well. The change of system worked well and Rojo kept things tidy, showed good pace and strength and was happy to get forward. Marcos Rojo was a well-balance addition to Manchester United's defence and kept things tidy .

"Host commentator . It's all over and it ends 4-1 after an impressive home performance from Everton. An own goal from Rodriguez gave the Toffees an early lead before Coleman and Baines scored either side of the break to put Martinez's side into a commanding lead. Mirallas added the icing on the cake with a fourth before a stunning consolation free-kick from Rodriguez. And he has been beaten! There was nothing Howard could do about a stunning free-kick from Rodriguez which grazes the post before flying in. Howard looks a bit annoyed, but the final whistle goes and it ends 4-1! 92mins: Wolfsburg respond with two corners in quick succession before winning a promising free-kick on the edge of Everton's box. Howard has played so well tonight, he won't want to be beaten by this... It's another! And Mirallas is the man to put the Toffees into a 4-0 lead with just minutes to go. The Belgian beats the offside trap after a lovely through ball from Eto'o and slots past Benaglio with ease. Coleman is replaced by Osman. 85mins: Rodriguez crosses well once again but Jagielka is there to clear. At the other end, Baines bombs down the left before crossing for Eto'o. The former Barcelona man can't get near the ball though as Benaglio collects. 81mins: Naismith is replaced by Gibson . 80mins: Just 10 minutes plus stoppage time left at Goodison as Everton try and play keep ball before McGeady races down the right and crossed for Eto'o. The cross is cut out though as Wolfsburg are on the attack again. 74mins: De Bruyne forces a brilliant save from Howard after the winger put Coleman on his backside with a drop of the shoulder. Howard has been in fine form this evening. 70mins: Mirallas is shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away after a foul on the left hand side. Everton are struggling to keep the ball at the moment as Wolfsburg search for a consolation. McGeady curls just wide after a stunning ball from Eto'o to find Naismith who laid the ball off for the winger. Lukaku is replaced by Samuel Eto'o in the 68th minute. He scored his first goal for Everton just six minutes into his debut against former club Chelsea. Can he had to that tally this evening? Just over 20 minutes to go. Joe Bernstein: David Moyes, the last Everton manager to take them into Europe, can take some reflected glory on this result. He signed the entire Everton back-five including the excellent Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines . 63mins: It's been one way traffic since Everton have gone 3-0 up as Wolfsburg try and make a show of things. Martinez's side have coped well though and don't look likely to concede as it stands. Here he comes - Former Arsenal striker and serial maverick Bendtner replaces Caligiuri on the hour mark. What can he do? 55mins: Naismith picks up a needless yellow card for a late tackle on the edge of Everton's box. Rodriguez fires a stunning strike towards goal from the set piece, but Howard stretches out his right arm to pull off a brilliant save. Dominic King: With this game now won, Roberto Martinez has the chance to make changes and it is surely only a matter of time before Darron Gibson is given a runout. He went through an extensive warm-up during half-time and his first action since rupturing his cruciate ligament last September beckons. Expect a big fanfare when he does arrive. Was it ever in doubt? Baines sends Benaglio the wrong way and puts Everton into a 3-0 lead. It was a controversial penalty decision though as McGeady seemed to be fouled OUTSIDE of the penalty area. Everton fans won't care though - it's 3-0! A fantastic half for Everton as the take a two-goal lead into the break thanks to a Rodgriguez own goal and a Coleman header. The two teams have looked fairly even, but the home side have taken their two chances brilliantly while Wolfsburg have failed to truly test Howard. What a time to score! Brilliant play from Mirallas and Lukaku ends up with a Coleman diving header at the far post. Lukaku won the header, Mirallas caused panic in the Wolfsburg box before knocking the ball to Baines who crossed for Coleman to head into an empty net. 2-0! 40mins: Lukaku does well to win a header before winning a free-kick after a neat one-two with Mirallas. From the resulting set-piece, Lukaku sends Benaglio scrambling to his left before saving. 36mins: The two teams trade possession before Wolfsburg attack through Olic. The bearded Howard leaps out of his goal to claim yet another cross. Elliott Bretland: Goodison roared as Everton returned to European competition for the first time in five years and bellowed as the Toffees took the lead. However, it has to be said, the teams on the field haven't really done too much to get fans excited inbetween or since... 29mins: Rodriguez fires a brilliant ball in from the left which was flying towards Olic before Tim Howard runs out to claim. Fascinating game at Goodison so far, Everton may be wondering just how they are ahead... 23mins: Wolfsburg look shell-shocked as Everton attack once again through Lukaku before the big Belgian is flagged offside. At the other end, McCarthy blocks well from Olic. Dominic King: There was a break in play after Steven Naismith’s goal as Diego Benaglio, Wolfsburg keeper, has gone to replace his contact lens. He was shown on TV explaining to the match officials that he had lost it. A word on Naismith: he initially found things difficult on Merseyside and admitted to being in awe of his team-mates after arriving from Glasgow Rangers. But he has really found his stride in the last 12 months and is arguably Everton’s most improved player. Joe Bernstein: Can Everton succeed where Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City have failed this week - and beat German opposition? You better believe it! It's that man again! Naismith pokes the ball towards after a brilliant piece of passing from McCarthy and Baines. Benaglio was the unlucky party, though, as the ball rebounded off the goalkeepr before going in. It was Everton's first real attack of the game after keeping Wolfsburg at bay for the early stages. 13mins: Lukaku sprints towards a long ball and manages to force a corner for the Toffees. The set-piece is cleared by Naldo, but it doesn't stop the Everton attack. Baines picks up the ball from the left before deciding to play safe. 10mins: De Bruyne blazes over after neat build-up play from Olic. Roberto Martinez's side are being far too respectful of Wolfsburg so far. 7mins: Malanda races down the left before being tackled by Barry. From the resulting corner, Rodriguez fluffs his lines after the ball drops kindly to him. Chance missed for the away side. Everton need to sharpen up here. Elliott Bretland: It seems Bryan Oviedo, close to a return to first-team action, has turned up late as stewards frantically attempt to get him seated. Had the Costa Rican turned up late for Everton's last home game against Chelsea he'd have missed the away side's opening two goals! 3mins: Early chance for the away side as former Chelsea winger De Bruyne races through the middle releasing Olic. The Croatian fires towards goal before being flagged offside. On a historic day for Scotland, what price Steven Naismith to be the first goalscorer at Goodison. He'll start in the middle of a three supporting Romelu Lukaku. We're underway at Goodison park with Everton in blue and Wolfsburg in white. Can the Toffees get off to a winning start tonight?

West Ham triumphed 3-1 at Upton Park thanks to goals from Winston Reid, Diafra Sakho and Morgan Amalfitano, with Raheem Sterling netting for the Reds. The minor upset in east London was a huge boost for the Hammers who climb above Liverpool in the table, which left Allardyce purring over his side's impressive performance. West Ham boss Sam Allaryce celebrates during his  side's 3-1 win over Liverpool at Upton Park . 'The first half was outstanding,' Allardyce told Sky Sports. 'From our point of view, the way we got about our job, we took Liverpool by surprise. 'We tried improving our finishing over summer and it's there to see.

Everyone is vulnerable to set-pieces and then you have excellent headers of the ball like James Tomkins. Stewart's Downing's cross to the far post was excellent too.

"Leigh Halfpeny will wonder what he has let himself in for, even if the Wales full back doesn’t have his contract at Toulon torn up, in line with the owner’s threats. In a barmy week on the balmy Cote d’Azur, Mourad Boudjellal warned he may release Halfpenny, who is yet to play for his new French employers due to a persistent groin injury. He also threatened to take legal action if Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe, Bryan Habana and Bakkies Botha don’t nip back from the Rugby Championship on the other side of the equator to line up against Brive on Friday. Toulon have threatened to tear up Leigh Halfpenny's contract over a persistent groin injury . Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal has threatened legal action against players away on internationals . Instead of taking the matter to court, he will probably adjust their pay instead. Rory Lamont, the ex-Scotland full back who had a spell at Toulon, tweeted on Thursday: ‘I came back from the autumn internationals to find out I had been docked a month’s wages. Standard behaviour.’ Toulon and other leading Gallic clubs have engaged in a big-money duel over Galactico imports, only for the thorny issue of international release to crop up time after time. The up-shot is tension and turmoil. Wales coach Warren Gatland says that many of his players based across the Channel want to leave, while Jonathan Sexton is abandoning Racing Metro at the first opportunity, next summer, to return to Leinster. Boudjellal and other wealthy owners have carte blanche to recruit as they see fit, but it is ridiculous to willingly sign current Test players then carp when they go off to fulfil international duties. Rest weekends are a grey area, but the simple solution is to target the domestic market – or Test exiles such as Matt Giteau, who has agreed a new deal at Toulon – rather than mostly shopping abroad. Rory Lamont revealed his pay was docked by Toulon for playing in autumn internationals . There is a lesson for Aviva Premiership clubs here, following their decision to raise the salary cap and allow for another – overseas – signing outside the cap. A post-World Cup boom here would increase the temptation to go star shopping, but it is vital to retain the precious emphasis on nurturing home-grown talent, while carefully adding box-office appeal. Culture is a factor too. Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, struck the right note when asked about big-name imports, saying: ‘That is not Leicester’s way of doing business. It upsets the balance. We want guys to be here for the long haul.’ The English elite should note the scatter-gun approach of Boudjellal & Co, with all the attendant problems, and resolve to fire their golden bullets with more care. James Haskell (R) staked his claim for England with a commanding performance against Northampton . It is all working out exactly as Stuart Lancaster would have hoped. Having secured agreement from the Premiership clubs to delay the announcement of his England squads for the season, the national coach is witnessing contenders raising their games for early-season auditions. Last Sunday, Wasps captain James Haskell delivered a colossal defensive display in the win over Northampton, to put further pressure on the back-row incumbents. His personal challenge to the established hierarchy has been matched by a trio of Saracens; centre Brad Barritt, scrum half Richard Wigglesworth and flanker Will Fraser, not to mention Exeter’s rookie midfield pair – Sam Hill and Henry Slade. In addition, the fly half tussle is a high-class sideshow in its own right, with Danny Cipriani, George Ford and Stephen Myler taking it in turns to excel as they strive to deputise for Owen Farrell or even usurp him. Test cases are being made with heartening regularity for the England coaches. Now they just have to hope that the exuberant efforts don’t lead to a pile-up of injuries… . Danny Cipriani's (C) form for Sale could see him threaten Owen Farrell's England place . The architect of New Zealand’s World Cup triumph in 2011 has warned that the All Blacks may have trouble retaining their title if they keep winning. Steve Hansen’s dominant side have lost just once since the last global tournament and haven’t been beaten at home since 2009, but Graham Henry doesn’t think that is entirely good news. ‘I think they need to lose,’ he said. Graham Henry believes New Zealand must lose if they want to retain the World Cup . ‘The odd hiccup here and there gives you the opportunity to re-analyse where you are at, look at everything, turn over every stone; make sure you're on the right track. If you don’t do that you might miss something. I think (a loss) galvanises people.’ New Zealand face Argentina, Tonga, Georgia and Namibia in their World Cup pool next year. There is a very real threat that they could progress serenely between now and the quarter-finals, then find themselves caught cold, as they were under Henry in 2007. Australia are attempting to lure the Lions back to their shores in 2017, even though Britain and Ireland’s finest were there for a tour last year. In a bid to generate much-needed income, the ARU have made a pitch to stage a warm-up match before the Lions arrive in New Zealand. Chief executive Bill Pulver said: ‘If they want preliminary games outside New Zealand, then we would be a wonderful location. We would take it in a heartbeat.’ Australia want to lure the British Lions back after they played an opener in Hong Kong last year . Last year, the Lions stopped off in Hong Kong for a tour opener prior to landing Down Under, in what was an overwhelmingly commercial venture. This Australian offer must be politely rebuffed. New Zealand can deliver enough suitable, pre-Test series opposition to make a game outside that country unnecessary. But if one is to take place, the Lions should take their high-profile roadshow to where it can do some good; the Pacific islands. If trips to any one of the SANZAR nations became more regular than the current once-every-12-years routine, the aura and the magic will be lost. These Lions should be rare attractions. The Last Word . The RFU have blundered into a storm this week, in relation to the new England kits. The inclusion of Victoria Cross symbols within the fabric of the shirt led to accusations of disrespecting military sacrifice. But this was clumsy, rather than a crass insult to servicemen and women. Lancaster has invoked the country’s armed forces repeatedly as a source of inspiration, without suggesting that the heroism required on a rugby field equates to that needed in armed conflict. This is a game in which courage is a pre-requisite, but it is not a life-and-death exercise. The inclusion of the Victoria Cross in England's new shirts has kicked up controversy . Bill Shankly once said football meant more than that, while warfare terminology has long abounded in sport. The 1991 Ryder Cup in golf was dubbed the ‘War on the Shore’. More recently, South Africa’s Blue Bulls have worn army-camouflage kit. George Orwell referred to sport as ‘war minus the shooting’ and the tribalism involved has led to endless talk of battles, which largely amounts to harmless hype. The use of Victoria Crosses on the England shirt is an error of judgment and the RFU have duly apologised. The underlying concept of national service was well-intentioned, but the symbolism was mis-guided.","Toulon have threatened to terminate Leigh Halfpenny's contract before he has even played a game .

"As my stepfather put the shepherd’s pie on the table, the pride on his face was palpable. ‘I’ve been working on this recipe for decades,’ he announced. ‘And I’ve finally perfected it.’ My reaction was not what he’d hoped for. After just one forkful, I groaned, sprinted through the back door and vomited in a flowerbed. But this was no reflection on the meal. It was my response to almost all food, leaving me starving and lethargic — and at a time when I needed my energy most. Torture: Jennifer with her husband Richard and children James and Jessica. Both proved difficult pregnancies . For I was pregnant, and suffering the extreme morning sickness that blighted both my pregnancies and has afflicted Kate Middleton — though the generic, ubiquitous term ‘morning sickness’ little reflects the unending, inescapable nausea and vomiting I suffered every day. Throughout the 18 long, terrible months I carried my children I did not live, I merely existed, sick and exhausted, waiting for my sentence to be served. It was so severe, and so much worse with my second pregnancy, that it destroyed me both physically and mentally. It meant I was even forced to forgo my hopes of another child. This torture is, I fear, the fate awaiting the Duchess of Cambridge as she embarks on her own second pregnancy, having once again been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum. It is a strangely flowery title for such a vile condition. For those who wonder what it feels like, I would compare it to having food poisoning every day for nine months solid. Strong resolve: The Duchess of Cambridge earlier this week (left) and during her first pregnancy (right) Of course, there are times when it eases off, briefly, or sufferers would be hospitalised throughout. But in my 42 years on earth nothing has been harder than living with hyperemesis gravidarum. It even made the pain of childbirth come as a relief. It is the sole reason my husband and I decided not to have any more children. We would have loved more — Richard is one of three and we both wanted a brother or sister for Jessica, eight, and James, six — but the prospect of going through nine months of hell again was beyond me. It didn’t start out like this, of course. When we married in 2005, Richard and I were keen to have lots of children and we didn’t have to wait long. Jess was a honeymoon baby and the miracle of a tiny new life growing inside me was so exciting it carried me through a tough pregnancy. For reasons unknown, my sickness tended to come on in the afternoons, so the mornings weren’t too bad. But as the day wore on, I would become exhausted — and by the time Richard came home in the evenings, I would be lying on the sofa groaning, with a washing up bowl on standby for when I couldn’t reach the bathroom. Still, at least I had the freedom to sleep when I needed and had no responsibility to anyone except myself. Doctors prescribed medication, none of which made the slightest difference, so I soldiered on until Jess came along and gave me no time to think of anything, or anyone else. Relief: The Royal couple with Prince George, who was born after Kate experienced severe morning sickness . Yet while that pregnancy was difficult, it was as nothing compared to my second, with James. Ironically, we were hopeful that history would not repeat itself and this would prove an easier ride. But when I became pregnant again, when Jess was just one, we realised immediately that this time around would be infinitely worse. Not only did I have the extreme sickness and the unborn baby to think about, I also had a lively, inquisitive little child who needed my attention at all times and required round-the-clock care. The experience nearly broke me. The sickness was even worse this time, too. Whereas in the first pregnancy it came and went, easing off slightly by the third trimester, now it was a near-constant companion. I felt so sick the weight dropped off me. While mothers are supposed to gain weight throughout the pregnancy, as they store the reserves to feed their baby, I lost it: at seven months, I weighed half a stone less than I did before I got pregnant. I remember my mother looking at me one day, concern in her eyes, and saying my face looked ‘gaunt’. I ate a tub of ice cream every night, as it was the only thing I could stomach. Doctors juggled prescriptions in an attempt to ease the symptoms, to no avail. At one point they suggested hospitalising me under a consultant’s care, for an intravenous drug, but said they couldn’t guarantee there wouldn’t be risks to my baby. I was desperate for help, but on hearing those words I declined. Yet the impact ran far deeper than the physical symptoms. It had a deep psychological impact which we are still, to a degree, dealing with today. I developed a phobia of speaking on the phone because I was petrified of throwing up mid call. I felt stressed and unhappy, and as the pregnancy wore on my mood got only lower. Friends would try to lift my spirits by saying it would pass, but after five months of sickness I knew in my bones it wasn’t going to end until the baby was born. Life was miserable. As the pregnancy wore on we had to hire a nanny to look after Jess in the afternoons, as I was incapable of anything more strenuous than fitful sleep. I felt terrible guilt both for the damage I was doing to my unborn child and also to my daughter, who couldn’t understand why her mother kept disappearing. Baby seat: Prince William with baby George last year. He will soon have a brother or sister to play with . I was ashamed of it at the time — and to this day I feel awful for having ever uttered these words — but the nadir came at seven months when I tearfully blurted out to my husband: ‘I just want this thing to die so it will stop.’ We were both shocked and distraught by my outburst. It is an unspeakably terrible thing to resent your unborn baby, but I wasn’t in my right mind at the time. Months of relentless sickness had, in the bleak moment of that 3am outcry, driven me to the brink of madness. I spoke to my doctor again and started seeing a counsellor, which helped me stay sane in those final two months. The birth came as an utter relief to both of us. Finally the sickness ended. James was, and remains, utterly gorgeous, and he and Jessica are the light of our lives. But the difficulties were not extinguished with his arrival. For nine months of sickness had left me at my lowest ebb, both psychologically and physically, and when I gave birth I was utterly spent. More confident: Jennifer with her family today . Just at the time when I needed all my strength to care for twice as many children, the well was dry. It is hardly surprising that I went on to develop post-natal depression and I would be astonished if Kate has not experienced something similar. I feel terribly sad that I was unable to enjoy the earliest days of my children’s lives. Since they came along I have put work aside and given my life to them, staying at home as a full-time mum. They make me laugh every day and I cannot imagine life without them, but in the aftermath of my pregnancies the world was a very bleak place. Over time I recovered and there have, thank goodness, been no ill-effects for the children. They are thriving at school, Jess is already a budding actress and James is never without a football at his feet. But there is one lasting legacy of my morning sickness which will never go away: the fact that we were unable to have any more children. For during the dark times we went through in that second pregnancy, we both agreed we could never subject ourselves, or our children, to that again. I don’t think my body or mind could withstand another torment. Yet I have lost count of the number of occasions a newborn has tugged at my heart strings and made me madly broody. While we do not talk about it often, I know Richard feels the same. He is perhaps not as dotty about the nappy changing stage (few men are), but I know he always wanted a bigger family and we often reminisce about what Jess and James were like as toddlers — the silly words, the quirky mannerisms and just how tiny they were. There has been an odd occasion on which we have had a pregnancy scare, raising the awful question of what we would do. Thankfully they were false alarms, so we have never had to make the choice, but the fear of what might happen is all too real. People have said to me that it is ‘only nine months’, but that is a lifetime when you are seriously ill. Psychologically it was incredibly trying — I was in therapy because I felt so trapped and awful. Yet the ache for another sought-for child never quite goes away. It is stronger than ever right now, as our children are growing up so fast and James, my lovely baby boy, is at the age where he refuses a kiss in public. I long to hold another baby in my arms. But having another is out of the question and I do feel extremely lucky to have had two healthy children. Thankfully for Kate, she has all the support money can buy. She will have staff who can cook, clean and look after George, not to mention the best doctors in the country on hand to ensure the new child is born strong and well. Am I jealous that she has greater support? Knowing what she is suffering right now, there is nobody I would less like to be.","JENNIFER PRICE suffered same extreme sickness as Duchess of Cambridge .

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide to the game, including Ulloa's winner . A win at Manchester City and a home defeat by Leicester: Mark Hughes must wonder about this strange game sometimes. His sense of bemusement will only be heightened by the way his side battered Leicester in the first half but coughed up all the points to a Leonardo Ulloa goal in the second. Certainly the arrival of Esteban Cambiasso at half-time helped the promoted side. He is 34 but lacks little in class, even if the motor that won him 23 European and domestic trophies is a touch worn. Leonardo Ulloa scored the second half winner for Leicester as they ran out 1-0 winners away at Stoke . It was the Argentine's third goal in four Premier League games so far this season for Leicester in their first win of the campaign . Ulloa celebrates in vociferous fashion with his strike partner David Nugent following his strike . Stoke City (4-2-3-1): Begovic 6; Bardsley 6, Shawcross 6, Wilson 5, Pieters 5.5 (Muniesa 85); Whelan 6, Nzonzi 6; Moses 6.5, Bojan 5.5 (Diouf 74, 6), Walters 6 (Assaidi 82); Crouch 6.5 .

His willingness to direct a side lacking in top-level experience was impressive; his timeless ability to ping passes and set pieces with his left foot even more so. Combined, his skills helped settle a team unadventurous in the first half but which left with their first Barclays Premier League win. ‘They probably think they created enough chances to win,’ said Leicester manager Nigel Pearson. ‘Whether we deserved to win is, in some ways, irrelevant. 'We stayed in the game but the changes at half-time certainly allowed us to get a bit more control. Cambiasso’s game management is exceptional. He has not been the success he has in his career without qualities away from the ball, in terms of organisation. He was a very important influence.’ But this was largely about Stoke’s failings. They controlled much of the game, having 60 per cent of the possession and 24 shots.That only four of those shots were on target says plenty. ‘We needed something to drop and it didn’t,’ Hughes said. ‘I thought we handled the first half well, put any number of crosses in the box, but didn’t have the luck.’ Stoke started well. Steven Nzonzi dragged a shot wide after 10 minutes and moments later Peter Crouch missed the chance of the half with a header from six yards. Ben Hamer — in for Kasper Schmeichel, whose knee injury ended a streak of 141 league starts — spilled a cross from Jonathan Walters but wasn’t punished. Cambiasso came on at half-time and quickly created a chance with a left-footed through-ball that was inches from putting Ulloa clear. Ulloa started and finished the move that led to his winner, rolling a pass to Danny Drinkwater on the edge of Stoke’s area before surging on. Drinkwater played in Paul Konchesky on the left and his low cross appeared to be going behind Ulloa, who twisted and turned the ball in. Jonathan Walters wasted a chance to level after 71 minutes by running into traffic and losing possession before Hamer made two good close-range saves from Mame Diouf and Victor Moses.

"There have been times in the past five years, particularly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when turning on the TV pushed Steven Gerrard to the limit. Liverpool’s captain is a football fanatic who never misses a chance to sit down at home and watch a game. But, at various points since December 9, 2009 — the date his club relinquished a place among Europe’s elite — Gerrard has found viewing the Champions League almost intolerable. ‘When you aren’t involved, there is a big jealousy,’ Gerrard admits. ‘I was jealous of the teams and players who were involved when Liverpool had nothing to do it with it. But that’s a good thing, isn’t it? It’s the best competition to play in at club level. There’s a hole there when you are out of it.’ The Champions League is back and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is eyeing glory again . Gerrard takes on the Fiorentina defence in his last Champions League game back in December 2009 . It is why, when he leads out Liverpool against FC Ludogorets on Tuesday evening, Gerrard will savour the occasion a little more than usual. Not so long ago, a meeting with unremarkable opponents from Bulgaria would have failed to quicken the pulse but absence has increased Liverpool’s fondness. For a period under Rafael Benitez, Liverpool were regulars at the business end of this tournament, which explains his position when talk turns to what adventures this campaign may unearth. Gerrard’s message is clear: returning to the Champions League has provided a colourful narrative but it is not the summit of ambitions. ‘Maybe you forget how lucky you are,’ he says. ‘When you are consistently getting to the latter stages and popping up in finals, it was such an unbelievable achievement. But I’ve got confidence that might not be too far away, if the owners continue to back (manager) Brendan Rodgers as they have done. Gerrard celebrates his dramatic late winner against Olympiacos at Anfield in 2004 . Yossi Benayoun rises to heads home against Real Madrid in the 2008-09 Champions League season . ‘I’ve got a lot of confidence in Brendan and in the squad. Listen, I’ll put it another way. If we go out in the group stages, or the last 16, we will be majorly, majorly disappointed. We want to progress. We want to go as far as we can. This can’t be a one-off. This can’t be, “Isn’t it great where we are?” ‘This isn’t a reward for finishing second last year. I don’t see it as a reward. This is where Liverpool should be — and should be consistently. It’s the responsibility of myself and the players to give it our best crack. It is important that we have got the Champions League next year as well. ‘The players who haven’t sampled this and then get a taste of it — once they have had that taste I know they are going to love it. Hopefully, it will drive them on to want to keep it at Liverpool for a long time to come.’ Those who have not experienced those great European nights need only look at Gerrard to see what big performances at this level can do for a reputation. It is, after all, 10 seasons since he immortalised himself when leading a crusade that culminated spectacularly in Istanbul when Liverpool fought back from 3-0 down to win on penalties. Gerrard celebrates winning the 2005 Champions League in Istanbul with Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher . What happened that night in the Ataturk Stadium is never far from chatter on Merseyside — Gerrard last week attended the premiere of a new comedy film set around the Champions League final against AC Milan — but does he ever think about what may have occurred had the comeback not taken place? ‘I can’t help but think about when Andriy Shevchenko decided to dink his penalty,’ says Gerrard, rewinding to the climax of the shootout that Liverpool won 3-2. ‘If he had put his laces through it or smashed it in to the corner, maybe I’d be sitting here talking about playing in two losing European Cup finals. ‘I know I was going to be our fifth penalty taker but maybe I could have missed? They are the small details at this level. It is the decision-making from big players in big moments. If he hadn’t dinked his penalty, the pressure on me would have be humongous. Who knows what would have happened?’ There is a pause as he thinks about it for a moment but then he quickly moves on. Istanbul might be his defining moment but he doesn’t dwell on it — ‘I can do that when I hang the Predators up’ — and the appetite to add more chapters to his and Liverpool’s story is as strong as ever. Negotiating a group which also contains Real Madrid and FC Basle is the first priority and if this inexperienced squad is to do that — Gerrard has made 129 European appearances for Liverpool, the rest of the squad’s combined total for the club is 153 — Anfield must live up to its reputation. Gerrard trains alongside his Liverpool team-mates at Melwood ahead of Tuesday night's game . Fellow Liverpudlian Rickie Lambert has a chat with Gerrard on Monday afternoon . ‘We understand that we are not one of the favourites,’ he says. ‘There are some big hitters that people will be tipping to win it, but the message from me, as captain of this team, is that we are not making up the numbers. No way. ‘We have got such a big advantage over two legs, with Anfield, that other teams haven’t got. Let me tell you right now: you come to Anfield, you’re getting a terribly hard 90 minutes. And we are going to make it even harder for you.’ But how will they do that? They have struggled to replicate the blitzkrieg starts of last season so far and life without Luis Suarez is still causing adjustments. However, the stage is set for someone to take over his mantle and Gerrard hopes it will be the man who has been entrusted with the No 45 shirt. Mario Balotelli (right) shares a joke with Raheem Sterling as Liverpool prepare for Ludogorets . Mario Balotelli might split opinion but he is already the subject of a banner on The Kop and Gerrard, in quiet moments at the Melwood training complex, has told the Italian where he could be propelled if he scores the goals to give Liverpool back their Champions League season ticket. ‘There is no doubt Luis Suarez is going to be one of the big players in the Champions League this season,’ Gerrard says. ‘I know how much he wants to play in the competition. I had many conversations with him about it. But we have got Mario now and we have got to move on. ‘If we get the best out of him, we have got him. If people want to write stories about him and say that he is crazy or he is a nutter, let them. But he is one of us now. We have welcomed him into this clubs with open arms and we want to help him succeed. Everyone is hoping he is going to be a hit. He has got a great set of team-mates who will work for him and back him. He has got to do the same for us.’ Gerrard has backed his former Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez to star for Barcelona this season .

"Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale scored five goals between them as Real Madrid romped to an 8-2 win over Deportivo at Riazor with Javier Hernandez also scoring twice – his first goals since his move from Manchester United. With two defeats in their opening three games Madrid had come into the game languishing in mid-table but Ronaldo rose to the occasion with a towering header for the first goal. He also scored the third giving Madrid a 3-1 lead at half time and when the home side dared to edge back into the game at the start of the second half Gareth Bale finished them off with a quick double. He now has four goals this season and Ronaldo, who scored a hat-trick continues his incredible goal a game record.

Great headers of the ball score from bad crosses and Alvaro Arbeloa’s centre had no pace on it and was slightly behind Ronaldo. But still he climbed above the Deportivo defence and looped a header past keeper German Lux to score his first goal on this ground in his fourth visit, on the half hour. He celebrated – from a seated position inside the penalty area – with his now trademark hands out palms-down calm down gesture: do not fear, Ronaldo is here. Six minutes later Real had doubled their lead and James Rodriguez had his first league goal for the club. He broke his duck in midweek in the Champions League with a tap-in from a rebound, this was a little bit more like that World Cup wonder-goal volley against Uruguay. On the left-hand side of the penalty area he received the ball from Karim Benzema and curled a shot into Lux’ top corner with the Argentine keeper helplessly flapping as it sailed past him. The Deportivo keeper’s afternoon was about to get much worse. Marcelo played the ball forward to Benzema and he was scythed down by Lux rushing out from his goal. The loose ball ran to Ronaldo and he put it into the empty net with the keeper saved from a red card but Deportivo having to restart the game for the third time in the first 45 minutes. Madrid had made hard work of breaking Deportivo down. Bale had seen plenty of the ball but when he dropped one perfect right footed cross on Ronaldo's head the Portuguese headed straight at the keeper.

Bale should have put Real Madrid ahead but shot straight at the keeper from close range after Benzema’s shot was parried by Lux and he then should have been played in by Ronaldo but the former Manchester United man snatched at a shot instead of playing the pass. But, once Ronaldo had found his range, Carlo Ancelotti’s side just moved up through the gears and looked far superior to their opponents. Deportivo have been reading too many 'Madrid in crisis' stories - throwing men forward at will and leaving huge space in behind. They made two changes at half time with Helder Postiga and former Real Madrid-B midfielder Juanfran hooked and soon they had narrowed the margin. Ramos was adjudged to have handled in the area and Haris Medunjanin sent Casillas the wrong way from the penalty spot. It was harsh on Ramos who claimed the ball hit his side but the finish had been emphatic. Deportivo’s tails were up and Casillas had to save from Luis Fariña. Defensive midfielder Asier Illaramendi replaced forward Benzema as Ancelotti tried to close the game down.

Bale had responded with Real's fourth goal and his third of the season and soon he scored the fifth and his second of the afternoon from an Isco pass. Ronaldo completed his hat-trick from another Isco pass and there was still time for Hernandez to get in on the act. ‘Chicharito’ had replaced Bale and he hammered home from the edge of the area to score his first and repeated the trick in injury time to make it 8-2. After the game Sergio Ramos was asked if 12 goals in two games put paid to Real’s crisis. He said: ‘This can be a difficult place to come but we won the ball back well and kept the intensity up throughout.

Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville asked fans for their opinions after Enner Valencia's brilliant goal . Thierry Henry - Arsenal 1-1 Manchester United, Premier League - March 28, 2004 . Even though he was well known for his ability to generate power, Thierry Henry took everyone at Highbury by surprise when he smashed a long-range effort past Roy Carroll in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United in March 2004. The Frenchman's strike was straight down the middle but United's goalkeeper had no chance given the swerve and pace on the shot. Thierry Henry beats Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with a swerving drive at Highbury in 2004 . Cristiano Ronaldo - Porto 0-1 Manchester United, Champions League - April 15, 2009 . Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo had the last laugh on his return to his homeland when he fired Manchester United into the semis of the Champions League with an incredible strike at the Estadio do Dragao.

Cristiano Ronaldo sent Manchester United into the Champions League semi-finals  with this goal against Porto . Erik Edman - Liverpool 2-2 Tottenham, Premier League - April 16, 2005 . Swede Erik Edman will be forever remembered by Tottenham fans for his out-of-character goal against Liverpool at Anfield back in 2005. The left back, who was allowed plenty of space inside the Reds half, pushed the ball out from his feet and smashed an unstoppable left-footed shot into the far top corner. Keeper Jerzy Dudek could only watch and admire. Tottenham defender Erik Edman stunned Anfield with this brilliant goal in a 2-2 draw in April 2005 . Darren Ambrose - Manchester United 1-2 Crystal Palace, Carling Cup - November 30,  2011 . The hosts might have had youngster Ben Amos in between the sticks but no goalkeeper in the world would've saved Darren Ambrose's ferocious drive during Crystal Palace's Carling Cup quarter-final upset at Old Trafford. The former Charlton midfielder has a tendency to pull off the spectacular but this will likely go down as the best goal of his career. Crystal Palace midfielder Darren Ambrose celebrates after scoring a screamer against Manchester United . Sebastian Larsson - Tottenham 2-3 Birmingham City, Premier League - December 2, 2007 . As if scoring a brilliant goal at White Hart Lane wasn't enough, Sebastian Larsson decided to do it in the last minute to seal a dramatic away win for Alex McLeish's side. The Swedish international cut across the ball from 25 yards to swerve it just out of the reach of Paul Robinson, whose dive made it look even more impressive. Sebastian Larsson sealed a 3-2 win against Tottenham for Birmingham with this long-range effort . Obafemi Martins - Tottenham 2-3 Newcastle, Premier League - January 14, 2007 . Another 3-2 for the away team at White Hart Lane and another thunderbolt of a goal, this time by Newcastle forward Obafemi Martins.

AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli scores a stunning winner against Bologna on Valentine's Day earlier this year . Laurent Robert - Newcastle 4-0 Tottenham, Premier League - December 13, 2003 . Having already bagged a typically eye-catching volley in the first half, Laurent Robert followed it up after the break with another left-footed Goal of the Season contender. The Frenchman drove down the left before smashing a 25-yard effort into the back of Kasey Keller's net as the Magpies sealed a comfortable win against Spurs. Newcastle midfielder Laurent Robert celebrates the second of his brilliant goals against Tottenham in 2003 . Giovanni van Bronckhorst - Uruguay 2-3 Holland, World Cup - June 6, 2010 . Dutch defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst helped his side into their third World Cup final with this wonder goal against Uruguay in South Africa.

The extra firepower of Robert Lewandowski and the added class of Xabi Alonso mean Bayern Munich are my tip. Robert Lewandowski (left) will spearhead Bayern Munich's Champions League charge . Can the English teams compete? Chelsea and City are best equipped, Liverpool will relish being back and Arsenal are desperate to win it for Arsene Wenger. Which player will be the surprise star? A few years ago it was Gareth Bale taking Europe by storm. Can Raheem Sterling do the same? Both moved in from the wing and both are so exciting — it’s Sterling’s time to shine. Raheem Sterling has been tipped to take Europe by storm this season . MATT BARLOW . Who will win the tournament? Barcelona. In a slight state of flux of the post-Pep years but in Messi, Neymar and Suarez they have three match-winners. Can the English teams compete? Expect all four to progress, with Chelsea best equipped to go furthest. Manchester City’s tough group will take its toll with injuries, suspensions and confidence. Which player will be the surprise star? It will be some effort to eclipse Ludogorets defender-turned-keeper Cosmin Moti, but Sterling can leave his mark. Lionel Messi and Barcelona will be hoping to improve on last year's run to the semi-finals . IAN LADYMAN . Who will win the tournament?

"Wayne Rooney, Manchester United's No 10, is one of only four players to start every Premier League match under Louis van Gaal. The others are Juan Mata, David de Gea and Tyler Blackett. Louis van Gaal has indicated that Wayne Rooney is the only untouchable outfield player in his star-studded Manchester United squad following this summer’s £150million spending spree. Rooney faces competition from Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie in United’s attack, but Van Gaal says that only his captain and possibly goalkeeper David de Gea are likely to be the guaranteed names on the teamsheet. ‘I don’t think any player is fixed,’ said the United boss. ‘Only the captain has more privileges but no other player has privileges I think. Every player knows that because you see how I manage my teams – my captain shall always play and normally the goalkeeper.’ Wayne Rooney, pictured in training on Friday, was handed the armband by boss Louis van Gaal this season . Rooney shares a joke with Manchester United No 2 Ryan Giggs and (right), looks focused . Rooney was all smiles with his former team-mate Giggs at Carrington on Friday . Tyler Blackett is the surprise name among United's four Premier League ever-presents this season . Rooney is one of only four players to have started Van Gaal’s first four Premier League games and, surprisingly, one of the others is young defender Tyler Blackett. ‘There are always players you put in a team,’ said the United boss. ‘Maybe it’s a surprise Blackett has played all the games but he has played well.’ The Dutchman also insisted that Van Persie will still be in contention for a place in the starting line-up once Falcao has reached full fitness. He added: ‘I don’t think that Falcao interferes with Van Persie or Van Persie interferes with Falcao. ‘Falcao is a very good striker but I said in the first press conference that I like Van Persie also. He’s also a very good striker and we also have Rooney, (Adnan) Januzaj and (James) Wilson. We have five players for the two strikers positions and I have to choose.’ Van Gaal admits that he would love to have Rooney's former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo back at Manchester United but does not think Real Madrid would sell the Portuguese star. Asked if he would take Ronaldo back, the Dutchman said: ‘When it is possible, what I said with Falcao, players like Ronaldo give a lot extra to a team, but I don’t think Real Madrid shall sell him. ‘It’s always a discussion in the papers and I don’t think the media shall buy Ronaldo.’ Angel di Maria climbs on to Juan Mata's shoulders as David de Gea chats with the pair .

"Leicester City completed a remarkable comeback at the King Power Stadium, turning a 3-1 deficit into a 5-3 victory over Manchester United. Here, Sportsmail's Laurie Whitwell gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players. Leicester 4-3-1-2: . Kasper Schmeichel 6 – Could have saved Van Persie’s header had it not nicked off Moore. Taken completely by surprise for Di Maria’s lob, wrong-footed by Herrera. Jamie Vardy assisted the first three goals, then scored Leicester's fourth and assisted the fifth . Richie De Laet 6.5 – Given a torrid time by Di Maria and got turned by Falcao for the opening goal but offered much as an attacking force as match went on. Wes Morgan 6 – A solid presence at the heart of Leicester’s defence, marshalling his men amid the United onslaughts. Liam Moore 6 – Showed strength to nudge Falcao off the ball in the first half and generally coped well with some awesome opponents. Paul Konchesky 6 – United were quieter down his flank and largely enjoyed the better of his duels with Rafael. On his full debut for the club, Esteban Cambiasso scored Leicester's second-half equaliser . Danny Drinkwater 7.5 – The former United academy player showed why he was named Championship player of the year last season. Some excellent passes. Esteban Cambiasso 7.5 – What a finish he found just when Leicester need it. Had he not driven his shot with such accuracy the comeback might never have happened. Dean Hammond 6.5 – Had few outstanding moments but was equally a composed figure in central midfield. Not small statement given the attacking force he had to contend with. Leonardo Ulloa continues his fine form with another excellent headed goal against Manchester United . Dave Nugent 7.5 – Began confidently in the No 10 role, pulling the strings as Leicester’s front three combined well, and took his penalty with conviction. Leonardo Ulloa 7.5 – Two more goals for the £8million signing to take his tally to five for the season. A bulldozing header and perfect penalty. Jamie Vardy 8.5 – A nuisance all afternoon, surprising United’s backline with direct running at pace. Excellent cross for Ulloa’s goal. Subs: King 6, James 6, Schlupp 6. All three came on to provide energy in the closing stages as United wilted. Nigel Pearson 8 –Fought fire with fire and left United feeling burnt. Picked a bold attacking team and it paid off spectacularly. Robin van Persie scored his first goal of the season, set up by loan singing Rdadmel Falcao . When Ander Herrera scored United's third, Louis van Gaal's side thought they'd wrapped it up . Manchester United 4-3-1-2: . David De Gea 5.5 – Conceded five goals but could not be faulted for any of them. Both penalties he faced were sure and the other finishes were out of reach. Rafael 4.5 – Showed his defensive liability by rushing in to challenge Vardy after feeling hard-done by after his shove. Soft penalty but fell for it. Rafael's foul, which was admittedly soft, on Vardy for the penalty was the start of Leicester's comeback . Jonny Evans 5 – Went off early after a crunching foul from Ulloa and looked like he could be out for some time sitting on the bench with crutches. Tyler Blackett 4.5 – Had been United’s best defender until he stood off for Cambiasso’s goal and then lunged foolishly at Vardy after being out-muscled to get sent off. Marcos Rojo 4 – Was exposed defensively by Leicester’s pace and at fault for Ulloa’s first goal (allowing the cross) and Vardy’s finish (poor pass to Mata). Leicester City's Dave Nugent chases after Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney . Ander Herrera 7 – Clever flicked finish to give United a 3-1 lead and generally a bright spark. But faded as the game went on. Daley Blind 6 – Looked to have the screening job sorted in the first half but was simply overrun as Leicester surged forward scenting blood late on. Angel di Maria 8 – Van Gaal might need to keep his star player on the pitch for the duration, such was his impact with runs from deep, sublime passing and scoring. Angel di Maria scored a delightful chip against Leicester at the King Power Stadium . Wayne Rooney 7 – Started well and his measured pass allowed Di Maria to scoop his shot first time. But grew irritated and could have been twice booked for dissent. Robin van Persie 7 – Smart header to open his account for the season but was unable to control Di Maria’s pass in the second half and slipped out of the contest. Rdamel Falcao 7.5 – Produced a superb cross with his left foot to set up the opening goal and cracked an instinctive half-volley with his right onto the crossbar. Subs: Smalling 5, Mata 5, Januzaj 5. Smalling failed to bring any stability to United’s defence, Mata gave the ball away for Vardy’s goal and Januzaj was anonymous. Louis Van Gaal 6 – Big call to drop Mata and initially found success. But found to be defensively weak and his substitutions failed to address this. Mark Clattenburg 5 – Got it horribly wrong for Leicester's first penalty, allowing Vardy's shove on Rafael before penalising the Brazilian for a lesser touch.

"Paul Scholes has raised questions over Arsene Wenger's tactical preparations after Arsenal's comprehensive defeat against Borussia Dortmund in midweek. The Gunners were outplayed in the 2-0 loss against Dortmund, and Scholes suggested that Wenger may not have watched any videos of the German side. Scholes claims that Arsenal's attempts to play their own game regardless of the opposition are only useful if they're winning every game, but need to be adapted under more difficult circumstances. Jack Wilshere chases Henrikh Mkhitaryan as Arsenal were overrun in midfield against Dortmund . Mesut Ozil trudges off after another poor performance in which he was denied time and space on the ball . Arsenal were outplayed by Borussia Dortmund and Paul Scholes thinks it was down to their preparataion . 'I do wonder how much Arsenal look at videos of the opposition in their preparation for games like the one they played on Tuesday,' Scholes wrote in the Evening Standard. 'Watching the match it seemed like they hand't given Dortmund much more than a moment's consideration. 'All Wenger and Arsenal appear to think about is how they are going to approach the game and how they will play. 'Which is fine if you win all the time but not if - like Arsenal - you haven't made it out of the Champions League's last 16 for the previous four seasons.' Arsene Wenger only cares about how his own team will set up, which is to their detriment, says Scholes . Pierre-Emmerick Aubameyang scores Dortmund's seconds and the Germans could have won by more . Scholes also said Mesut Ozil shouldn't has been under par on the left wing, but Arsene Wenger has defended his team's approach, and hit back against criticism of his playmaker. 'It’s a bit unfair because I believe that our offensive talents on Tuesday night [against Borussia Dortmund] were not in their best condition, and they couldn’t express that talent,' said Wenger. 'On the other hand it’s post-World Cup. He came back on August 11. You know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best, that can happen. 'They should not be concerned and just support him. I understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good. You help. Scholes says Mesut Ozil shouldn't be shunted out wide but Wenger believes he is being made a scapegoat . Gunners captain and vice captain Mikel Arteta and Per Mertesacker look on during a poor performance . 'A club is a union between players, supporters and directors. You have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well.' Scholes suggested that the formation Arsenal are currently playing, with Ozil often playing out on the wing, does not suit the German's talents. But Wenger believes that is merely a side issue. 'That's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants,' he added. 'If you look at the heat map where he plays, you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch. Ozil was out on the wing against Dortmund and failed to have a significant impact on the game . Despite struggling Arsenal did create chances, but Danny Welbeck missed their best opportunities . 'Why should he be a scapegoat? For what? We've lost one game since April 1. Let's be realistic. We've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games. We had very difficult games against Besiktas. I don't know a scapegoat for what? 'What is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game. You have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life.'","Paul Scholes says Arsenal hadn't prepared properly for Dortmund game .

"A study into how porn affects men had to be scrapped and radically rethought after experts failed to find any young men who had not watched it. Originally researchers at the University of Montreal wanted to compare the behavior of men who viewed sexually explicit material with those who had never looked at it all. Professor Simon Louis Lajeunesse says he had to drastically rethink his study after failing to find any male volunteers who had never viewed porn. A study into how porn affects men had to be radically rethought after experts failed to find any 20-something men who didn't watch it . ‘The objective of my work is to observe the impact of pornography on the sexuality of men, and how it shapes their perception of men and women,’ Lajeunesse said. ‘We started our research seeking men in their twenties who had never consumed pornography but we couldn't find any.’ Instead Lajeunesse had to refocus his study on the porn viewing behaviors of his subjects. From the information gathered by his team of researchers, Lajeunesse found that single men typically spend about 40 minutes viewing porn three times a week, while men in committed relationships averaged 20 minute porn viewing sessions 1.7 times a week. Lajeunesse found most boys seek out pornographic material by the age of 10, when they are most sexually curious. However, they quickly discard what they don't like and find offensive. Professor Simon Louis Lajeunesse of the University of Montreal had wanted to compare the behavior of men who viewed sexually explicit material with those who had never looked at it all . As adults, they will continue to look for content in tune with their image of sexuality. They also rarely consume pornography as a couple and always choose what they watch. All test subjects said they supported gender equality and felt victimized by rhetoric demonizing pornography. ‘Pornography hasn't changed their perception of women or their relationship which they all want as harmonious and fulfilling as possible,' said Lajeunesse. 'Those who could not live out their fantasy in real life with their partner simply set aside the fantasy. The fantasy is broken in the real world and men don't want their partner to look like a porn star.'

"Luca di Montezemolo has resigned as Ferrari's president, bringing an end to one of the most successful eras in the history of Formula One's most famous brands. Di Montezemolo, 67, paid the price for a lean recent spell of success, with his position no longer tenable after last Sunday's Italian Grand Prix at which the team scored just two points. Di Montezemolo served as assistant to Enzo Ferrari and later as president for 23 years. His departure robs the sport of another of its big beasts. Standing down: Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo has resigned following a lean spell of success . Bernie Ecclestone, 83, is the last full-time survivor of those larger-than-life figures who dominated the paddocks and pit lanes of the world over the last four decades. Di Montezemolo will officially step down on October 13. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of parent company Fiat, will replace him. Relations between Di Montezemolo and Marchionne are believed to have disintegrated in recent times as they fought over the direction of the company. Di Montezemolo’s departure comes four days after he denied he was on his way out. Speaking at last weekend’s race at Monza, he struck a business-as-usual tone by saying he had offered his services to the Fiat board for a further three years. But Marchionne countered Di Montezemolo’s bullish prediction, saying: ‘We are good friends but his statements... these are things I wouldn’t have said myself.’ Grateful: Di Montezemolo, pictured with Bernie Ecclestone, thanked the 'exceptional Ferrari men and women' Speaking immediately after the race, Marchionne added that Ferrari’s F1 performance was ‘unacceptable’ and winning races was ‘absolutely non-negotiable’. By then, Di Montezemolo’s departure was only a matter of days away. In a statement released on Wednesday, Di Montezemolo said: 'This is the end of an era and so I have decided to leave my position as Chairman after almost 23 marvellous and unforgettable years in addition to those spent at Enzo Ferrari’s side in the 1970s. 'My thanks, first and foremost, to the exceptional Ferrari women and men from the factory, the offices, the race tracks and the markets across the world. They were the real architects of the company’s spectacular growth, its many unforgettable victories and its transformation into one of the world’s strongest brands. 'A warm farewell and my thanks also to all of our technical and commercial partners, our dealers across the globe and, most particularly, the clients and collectors whose passion I so wholeheartedly share. Di Montezemolo won 18 world titles at Ferrari as team principal and president, overseeing the Michael Schumacher years of dominance at the start of the century. He brought about a 10-fold increase in revenue and tripled car sales. But Ferrari have not won a world title since 2008 and are in the middle of their latest revamp under recently appointed team principal Matteo Mattiacci. 'Ferrari will have an important role to play within the FCA Group in the upcoming flotation on Wall Street. This will open up a new and different phase which I feel should be spearheaded by the CEO of the Group. 'This is the end of an era and so I have decided to leave my position as president after almost 23 marvellous and unforgettable years in addition to those spent at Enzo Ferrari’s side in the 1970s.

'But my thoughts go also to our fans who have always supported us with great enthusiasm especially through the Scuderia’s most difficult moments. 'Ferrari is the most wonderful company in the world. It has been a great privilege and honour to have been its leader. I devoted all of my enthusiasm and commitment to it over the years. Together with my family, it was, and continues to be, the most important thing in my life. 'I wish the shareholders, particularly Piero Ferrari who has always been by my side, and everyone in the Company the many more years of success that Ferrari deserves.'","Luca di Montezemolo resigns as president of Ferrari .

"'12:45 is a good kick-off time. I like it,' Arsene Wenger says. That is despite early Saturday defeats last season to Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. Four goals scored, 17 conceded. City will be hoping to replicate their 6-3 performance at the Etihad Stadium, while Wenger insists his game will be on their guard this time. But what is it about 12:45pm Premier League kick-offs and Arsenal? Well, even before last season Arsenal promised to entertain, defy the odds and occasionally fall apart when kicking off early. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Arsenal v Manchester City preview . Arsenal suffered three big early kick-off defeats against Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea last season . Sitting pretty at the top of the Premier League table when visiting Liverpool at Anfield last season, the Gunners were nicely backed to beat Brendan Rodgers' side. Four goals early on though, and the game was over. Similarly at Chelsea, early strikes for the hosts plus a sending off to Kieran Gibbs put Arsenal out of the tie on BT Sport. 'Would you rather kick off at three o’clock or 12:45?' Wenger asked on Thursday. 'It’s two hours and 15 minutes. That does not produce a miracle in your physical recovery.' Arsenal were beaten 6-0 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last season after a 12.45pm kick-off . Chelsea players celebrate Andre Schurrle's first half goal which gave the Blues an early 2-0 lead . The 6-0 defeat by Chelsea was Arsene Wenger's (above) 1,000th game in charge of the Gunners . 2013/14 . August 24: Fulham (a) won 3-1 . October 26: Crystal Palace (a) won 2-0 . December 14: Manchester City (a) lost 6-3 . February 8: Liverpool (a) lost 5-1 . FA CUP March 8: Everton (h) won 4-1 . March 22: Chelsea (a) lost 6-0 . But Arsenal were noticeably unprepared for the early fixtures, and have been in the past, too. Over the last three seasons Wenger's side have won seven, drawn two and lost seven of their 12.45pm kick-off's. Not too bad a record when considering last season. 32 goals scored and 38 conceded in these 16 fixtures tell you one thing, while the games themselves are surprising, almost random. Beating Tottenham 5-2, drawing with relegation contenders Norwich 3-3, beating Chelsea 5-3 away from home but falling to Blackburn in a seven-goal thriller at Ewood Park.

The only notable high-scoring fixture Arsenal avoided in these early kick-offs was an 8-2 defeat to Manchester United; luckily for the statistics that was on a Sunday. Wenger protests that the results last season were purely a coincidence, and more a combination of a great performance from the opposition and a poor Arsenal showing. After all, a 4-1 win against Everton in the FA Cup came at 12:45pm. Arsenal have the chance to right what was wrong last season against the league champions. They have already beaten Manuel Pellegrini's side, albeit in the Community Shield, and are armed with the fire power to blow City away. But Wenger must prepare his team better mentally, and perhaps more importantly physically to get the required result. Either way, expect goals at the Emirates Stadium.

"1. Daniele de Rossi - £100,000-per-week . 2. Gonzalo Higuain - £84,000-per-week . 3. Carlos Tevez - £70,000-per-week . As the annual salaries of every Serie A player were released on Monday, there seems to be little doubt that the Italian league is falling behind Europe's top leagues. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Serie A clubs are now spending close to a combined £500million less on wages compared with 2011 as even the league's highest earners collect far less than Premier League and La Liga stars. Paul Pogba, for example, is set to earn just £23,000-per-week net this season despite being one of the most talented young midfielders in the world and a player Juventus will no doubt hope to keep hold of. Worth more? Paul Pogba (right) will earn just £23,000-per-week from his current deal with Juventus . Juventus, however, do lead the way in money spent on wages and are the only Italian club to increase their wage bill from the 2013/14 season with the likes of Carlos Tevez and Arturo Vidal earning upwards of £60,000-per-week. Roma star Daniele De Rossi can boast that he is Roma's highest earner with a contract worth £5.2m excluding any bonuses. Former Chelsea star and Roma new boy Ashley Cole decided to move to Italy after failing to agree a contract extenstion with the Blues and has signed up to earn around £35,000-per-week with Rudi Garcia's side. Big money: Former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez (left) is the top earner at Juventus . Love of the game: Ashley Cole (right) has taken a wag cut to join Roma and will earn £35,000-per-week . 1. Daniele de Rossi - £100,000-per-week . 2. Marco Borriello - £54,000-per-week . 3. Miralem Pjanic - £49,000-per-week . 4. Gervinho - £45,000-per-week . 5. Kevin Strootman - £43,000-per-week . 8. Ashley Cole - £35,000-per-week . 1. Carlos Tevez - £69,000-per-week . 2. Gianluigi Buffon - £61,000-per-week . 3. Arturo Vidal - £61,000-per-week . 4. Andrea Pirlo - £58,000-per-week . 5. Fernando Llorente - £54,000-per-week . 15. Paul Pogba - £23,000-per-week . Cole's former England team-mate Micah Richards decided to follow in the left back's footsteps and head to Italy in search of first-team football with Fiorentina. The 26-year-old is set to earn £26,000-per-week with his new club and becomes Fiorentina's fourth highest earner behind Alberto Aquilani, Giuseppe Rossi and Mario Gomez. Elswhere, former Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic will recoup around £50,000-per-week as he shares the highest earner at Inter Milan award with Argentine forward Rodrigo Palacio, with both set to earn a minimum of £2.5m for the 2014/15 season. After a difficult three years with Chelsea, Fernando Torres has finally searched for pastures new after signing a two-year loan deal with AC Milan. At the back: Nemanja Vidic is Inter Milan's highest earner after his move from Manchester United . Cut: Fernando Torres (above) goes from £175,000-per-week at Chelsea to £60,000-per-week at AC Milan . Main man: Daniele De Rossi is Serie A's highest earner with a contract worth £5.2m excluding any bonuses . 1. Fernando Torres - £61,000-per-week . 2. Philippe Mexes - £61,000-per-week . 3. Riccardo Montolivo - £54,000-per-week . 4. Nigel de Jong - £54,000-per-week . 5. Diego Lopez - £38,000-per-week . 1. Nemanja Vidic - £50,000-per-week . 2. Rodrigo Palacio - £50,000-per-week . 3. Hernanes - £46,000-per-week . 4. Fredi Guarin - £43,000-per-week . 5. Andrea Ranocchia - £34,000-per-week . The Spanish striker slips straight into the club's highest earner spot and will collect close to £61,000 each week - nowehere near his £175,000-per-week deal in west London. The decline in wages, and perhaps the decline is Italian football is clear to see when looking at the pay of Inter's highest earner Samuel Eto'o during the 2009/10 season. Eto'o was earning a staggering £160,000-per-week at the San Siro compared to the £50,000-per-week of Vidic. Dip: Micah Richards has move to Fiorentina in search of first team football and will earn £26,000-per-week . High earner: Samuel Eto'o was on a £160,000-a-week contract during the 2009/10 season at Inter Milan . Inter's second highest earner Patrick Vieira was quite a way off Eto'o's figures but still managed to collect £84,000-per-week. The figures are also a stark contrast to that of the highest earners elsewhere with the likes of Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi all earning over £200,000-per-week to ply their trade in La Liga. De Rossi's highest-earner tag is dwarfed by the Premier League's top earner Wayne Rooney, who can boast a stunning £300,000-per-week. In the money: Wayne Rooney's £300,000-per-week wages dwarf those in the Serie A .","Serie A reveal annual salaries of each player .

"On the night the dark shadow of Luis Suarez fell over the Las Vegas strip, the lights were switched back on at full power by the genius of the greatest boxer on earth. Floyd Mayweather was allegedly bitten on his left hand by Argentine wild man Marcos Maidana and not only the deed but the words were ugly reminders of serial chomper Suarez. The scene had moved from the football pitch to the prize ring but the act seemed just as despicable. After Mayweather protested he had been bitten in the eighth round, referee Kenny Bayless issued a severe lecture to the Maidana corner before allowing the fight to continue. Floyd Mayweather celebrates a unanimous points victory over Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas, extending his career record to 47-0 . Floyd Mayweather moved to 47-0 in his career with another routine victory at the MGM Grand as Marcos Maidana failed to match him . Floyd Mayweather was a clear and deserved winner over the Argentine Marcos Maidana at the MGM Grand, taking the win on  unanimous decision . One he had finished delivering a masterclass to his challenger, Mayweather said: ‘At first I didn’t know what had happened but then I realised that he bit me. My fingers went numb and from the eighth round I could only really use the other hand.’ In true Suarez fashion, Maidana said: ‘No, no.’ And when showed the video clip of his crime he said: ‘Perhaps he put his glove in my mouth. Maybe he thinks I’m a dog.’ It was outrageous behaviour but it could not diminish the brilliance which gave Mayweather the 47th victory of his phenomenal, undefeated career. The face of Marcos Maidana is contorted as Floyd Mayweather catches him on the cheek with a powerful left . Marcos Maidana makes his way to the ring looking relaxed and in good spirits but he was unable to reproduce his performance in May's first encounter . Floyd Mayweather makes his way to the ring at the MGM Grand looking business-like in a gold and black robe . Once again, a Floyd Mayweather fight ended with panic among the crowds leaving at the sold-out 16-000 seat arena. The exit procedure seemed to be working better than when there was crushing at the first Maidana fight four months ago. Suddenly, hundreds of fans came running back into the MGM Grand Garden Arena, several of them falling over the seats. There was a report that someone had brandished a gun on the concourse and the fans were fleeing. Several were wheeled away on stretchers but none of the injuries appeared serious. And once he had corralled Argentina’s raging bull for a second time, he raised the prospect that the world might finally see him meet Manny Pacquiao in the $300 million mega-fight for which the world is still waiting, saying: ‘I will talk to my team to see what the future holds. But if the Pacquiao fight presents itself lets make it happen.’ Mayweather only gave himself ‘a C or a C-minus because I got caught with some shots I shouldn’t have.’ Modesty from this man, after giving a master-class in ring-craft. But then he is something of a contradiction. Confronted by suggestions that his legs may be weakening, he danced and moved to drive Maidana to the distraction which no doubt led him to use his teeth rather than his fist. And while so doing he picked off his out-classed challenger with dazzling combinations and bursts of power which nearly landed the statement KO he craved. Mayweather was on the floor twice but each time from shoves better suited to wrestling and on the second occasion referee  Bayless deducted a point from the Argentine. Maidana could have been thrown out for the biting incident but Mayweather needed no help to pirouette and punch his way to victory. He even found time to give a pointer to Maidana, which I have never previously witnessed in all these years reporting boxing. Floyd Mayweather complained that Marcos Maidana bit his hand as they were about to break from a clinch . Floyd Mayweather confronts Marcos Maidana about the alleged bite as referee Kenny Bayless intervenes to calm the simmering tensions . The incident was reminiscent of Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's match against Italy at the World Cup .

Floyd Mayweather was shaken by a blow to his head late in the third round and required treatment from his corner but regained his composure to claim victory .

The fighters exchange punches as Marcos Maidana catches Floyd Mayweather on the throat and Mayweather connects with the cheek . Floyd Mayweather's left makes a clean contact with Marcos Maidana's face as the American takes control of the contest . Twice Maidana was so bewildered that he wandered towards the wrong corner at the end of two rounds. On the second occasion, Mayweather turned round to point his opponent in the right direction. Maidana was in denial on all fronts. He claimed he had won the fight saying: ‘If the judges want to give it to a fighter who ran, good luck to them.’ In truth those three official gave it to ‘still’ the best boxer in the world. Two of them by the same score as my card - 116-111. Once again, Mayweather was bang on the Money. Will Smith enjoys the action from the stands at the MGM Grand's Garden Arena . Marcos Maidana roughs Floyd Mayweather up by rubbing his arm in the American's face but the tactics proved unsuccessful in rattling the champion .

Marcos Maidana has a point deducted by referee Kenny Bayless after being adjudged to have pushed Floyd Mayweather to the canvas . Floyd Mayweather looks incredulously at Marcos Maidana has he raises his arms at the conclusion of the fight . 1 - This is Mexico Independence weekend and the patriots from south of the border joined the Argentinians who had made the longer trip north in roaring Maidana into the ring. Mayweather arrived to his customary mixed reaction from the lovers and haters. The atmosphere was intimidating, the boxers less so than at the start of their first fight. Mayweather slipped into elusive, dancing mood, rode a couple of swinging rights and pocketed the first round without undue exertion. 10-9 Mayweather. 2 - Mayweather  moving more than he did four months ago and Maidana  having trouble pinning him down. But when he did find his range he clipped the great man with a couple of good rights.That did not go unpunished but another flurry from the Argentinian probably stole the round. 10-9 Maidana. 3 - Maidana trapped Mayweather on the ropes early but few, if any, of his big swings were connecting. The champion changed up a gear and stopped Maidana in his tracks with several stinging rights. With referee Kenny Bayless keeping it as clean as possible there was more punching than brawling. Although Maidana landed a shuddering right as the bell rang it was Mayweather’s round – just. 10-9 Mayweather. 4 -  Encouraged by that success at the end of the third, Maidana launched a major assault. Mayweather was unable to dance away as he was pummeled on the ropes. Maidana ate some leather in the closing stages but the round was already his. 10-9 Maidana. 5 - With Maidana taking a breather after his exertions in the fourth, Mayweather got into his rhythm and began picking him off with a variety of accurate punches. The Hispanic contingent fell quieter as Maidana was rocked a couple of times in Mayweather’s best round so far. 10-9 Mayweather. 6 - The crowd had been sensing one of the ring’s major upsets earlier but there were cheers as Mayweather’s defensive genius made Maidana miss repeatedly. The old movement and counter-punching skills were back in evidence as Mayweather reeled his way a couple of rounds ahead on my card. 10-9 Mayweather. 7 - The away crowd tried to rouse Maidana but he seemed to be becoming mesmerised by Mayweather’s skills. For the first time Mayweather was on the front-foot, the aggressor. So bemused was Mayweather at being caught by laser beam punching that he wandered towards the wrong corner at the bell. 10-9 Mayweather. 8 - The pre-fight questions had been about Mayweather’s 37-year-old legs but it was Maidana who seemed to be flagging. Mr Money staggered him two or three times with classy combinations. Controversy raged with Mayweather apparently complaining he had been bitten on his left hand. Bayless issued stern warnings to the Maidana corner and the jeers for the Argentine would have sounded familiar in the ears of Luis Suarez. Afrer all that, it was Maywearher’s round by a distance. 10-9 Mayweather. 9 - Mayweaher continued to proves as elusive on the retreat and as wounding with his left right combinations. When Maidana lost his way again at the end of the round it was his tormentor who turned to direct him to his corner. 10-9 Mayweather. 10 - Mayweather returned from that unique piece of behaviour at the end of the ninth to dictating the direction of the fight. In his frustration Maidana wrestled Mayweather to the canvas and had a point deducted for his troublesome conduct. With Maidana rallying thereafter we had a round scored at 9-9. 11 - Maidana was granted recovery time for an alleged low blow but it looked a marginal offence by Mayweather, whose body punching was taking as much out of his challenger as the stinging attention to the head. Maidana was treading deep water throughout the round and almost sank in the closing seconds as Mayweather caught him with punishing lefts and rights. 10-9 Mayweather. 12 -  As if to mock those who had suggested his legs were slowing, Mayweather danced through the last in Ali fashion. That provoked some boos but Maidana needed a knock out and this became even less likely as he hit thin air. 10-9 Maidana.

'Just like a personal trainer, Microsoft Band guides you to improved wellness by constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and your future needs.' Unlike the forthcoming Apple Watch, people won't be able to make phone calls from the device, but like other smartwatches, such as the Motorola 360, they will be able to read texts, emails, social media updates and other notifications. 'It also helps you be more productive with email previews and calendar alerts - right on your wrist,' the company,' Microsoft said. Users will be able to talk to their device using the Cortana personal assistant, which is similar to Apple's Siri. Using Windows 8.1, users can ask Cortana to take notes or set reminders. 'She'll give you driving directions and keep you on top of traffic spots, weather and more,' according to Microsoft. The wrist-worn device (pictured left) has sensors that monitor pulse rate,measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said. It works alongside a health app called 'Microsoft Health' (shown on various devices) that includes a cloud service for users to store and combine health and fitness data .

'The Microsoft Band enters a highly competitive market where the company has little or no brand. At $200 Microsoft is targeting the higher tiers of the fitness band market – its going to have make a big marketing investment to raise awareness with US consumers. 'There are already numerous other products with heart rate sensors that track fitness and sleep including the new product Fitbit announced earlier this week. 'It’s interesting that Microsoft is clearly positioning its product as a fitness band rather than a smart watch given it has many of the features several smart watches already support. It is banking on the fact that consumers don’t want to replace their watches and that this will be what it calls the ""band for the other hand""'. Fitbit has revealed a trio of new trackers this week - including a $250 smartwatch, which it hopes can take on the Apple Watch. Called Surge, the watch has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality. The firm has also added a heart rate monitor to its traditional tracing wristband, now called the chargeHR.

"Vincent Kompany is the only defender in the Premier League who I would back in a one-v-one situation against Diego Costa. The Chelsea man is one of Europe’s best but so is Kompany: they both have pace, strength and intelligence. Costa is tough to mark because he bullies defenders, can get on the end of crosses and is fast enough to get away from most people marking him. But it is his touch that surprises me most — he has excellent technical ability with both feet. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: I am not surprised about Diego Costa . Vincent Kompany has had an excellent start to the season and here stops Arsenal's Danny Welbeck . Kompany puts his body on the line against Bayern Munich in an attempt to stop Robert Lewandowski . Costa's attacking stats make good reading but Kompany seems to have lost a few of his battles . He has a mixture of Dennis Bergkamp’s touch and Didier Drogba’s strength and presence. He can have a tear up or score the perfect goal and that is unusual. Every defender in the Premier League will be relishing the chance to play against Costa. Kompany will play him in a fair way — he is not a wind-up merchant — and likewise Costa will know not to waste energy trying to wind up the Belgian. It won’t work. Kompany has started the season brilliantly and won’t be thrown around by the Spaniard like Gylfi Sigurdsson was last weekend. Kompany will be thinking, 'You’re not going to do that to me'. He will keep tight to him and back himself to win each duel, be that in the air or on the ground. Kompany’s main problem will be that Costa will try to shift away from him and on to Martin Demichelis. Demichelis copes well in the air but he’s not as fast as Costa and Kompany may well stand nearer to his central defensive partner in order to help him out. The problem with that is it will mean there is space elswhere for others to exploit. Chelsea must also put a lot of pressure on Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Ramires and Willian. If they can stop the supply to Costa, their lives will be a lot easier. Diego Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea and has seven in five matches this season .

He's not a Manchester United player anymore though so what, if anything, will have changed as he returns to Old Trafford to face his old employers for the first time. At 35 he's no spring chicken and with his new boss Harry Redknapp well into the numbers needed for a free bus pass, we thought the pair would be up for a game of bingo - and you can play along too. Below is a list of things that could or should happen when Ferdinand goes up against some familiar faces on his old stomping ground, just tick them off as and when they happen. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . 1 - Ferdinand applauds both sets of fans . This one's your starter for 10. Away fans always get a clap, during the warm-up and at the end of the game, simply for making a lot of noise. But Rio's remembered fondly at the Theatre of Dreams so expect the home fans to show their appreciation and him to return the favour. Rio Ferdinand is guaranteed to be doing a fair bit of clapping at Old Trafford this Sunday . 2 - All aboard the banter bus I . There will be a moment in this clash where Ferdinand flies into a former team-mate. Rooney could get riled and Fletcher might get fiery. But expect them to pick themselves up, dust themselves down, shake hands and have a laugh about it in a 'why I oughta' sort of way. 3 - All aboard the banter bus II . Tunnel hugs and handshakes will be the order of the day as the teams prepare to walk out at the corner of the pitch. It's not Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira you know. Don't rule out a high-five or two. Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney will be on different teams in the same tunnel this time at Old Trafford . 4 - Long shot . QPR aren't expected to have much to cheer and Rio Ferdinand goals are rarer than hens' teeth. But if he does find himself in the wrong box and manages to ripple the net, he won't celebrate. No, no, no. It's the 11th commandment after all. 'Thou shalt not rub their noses in it.' Or something like that. 5 - Other people's goals are different though . If some other QPR player had to fire one in, well, that's a different matter entirely. And Ferdinand only knows one way to enjoy a goal. Expect him to be pictured head and shoulders above his team-mates, hands resting on a pal's shoulders, screaming at the fans. We've seen this celebration from Rio Ferdinand many times over the year . Rio Ferdinand had many happy times in the home dressing room at Old Trafford . 6 - Easy mistake to make after all these years . Even if Ferdinand does this one for a giggle, it counts. Walking into the wrong dressing room. 7- Fergie who? Now it's me and you . At some point Ferdinand and Redknapp, the new man(ager) in his life will get together and enjoy that special moment only a boss and his big player can enjoy. A cuddle or a handshake (Harry's not a high-fiver) both count. 8 - Choon . Big players + big reputations + big salaries = MASSIVE headphones. Look out for Ferdinand getting off the bus with the cans on. And there's a bonus point if it's confirmed he's listening to the Duran Duran classic Rio. It's unlikely Rio Ferdinand is listening to Duran Duran but you never know . 9 - Rio who? If a United new boy, signed after Ferdinand's departure, steps out of line or on Rio's toes, expect the squaring up but without the happy ending (see No 2). Rio Ferdinand has never been scared to stand his ground against opponents . 10 - You didn't need to get me a card . It won't be one with 'welcome back' written on it. Tick this one off if the ref dishes out a red or yellow to Ferdinand. With Man United expected to launch wave after wave of attacks, Rio Ferdinand could well pick up a card . 11 - All aboard the banter bus III . Mascots love the limelight these days, the furry rascals. If Fred the Red and Ferdinand have anything to do with each other, put a line through No 11. Fred the Red will be on hand to welcome Rio Ferdinand back to his old stomping ground . 12 -  You never know... If Ferdinand keeps out Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie and Co it really will be the game of his life. He picks up the champagne for Man of the Match, after a 1-0 QPR win in which he scored with a bullet header, and announces he's available for England again. Rio Ferdinand won 81 caps for England before retiring from international football .","Rio Ferdinand returns to Manchester United with QPR on Sunday .

He is expected to get a warm reception from the home fans .

"Brendan Rodgers insists he has no problem with the treatment dished out to Mario Balotelli by Aston Villa defender Philippe Senderos during Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Anfield. Liverpool boss Rodgers, who said football is a 'man's game', saw Balotelli kicked by Senderos in the first-half in an off-the-ball incident, which the referee and his assistants missed. Balotelli was also on the receiving end of a hefty challenge from right-back Alan Hutton. Mario Balotelli chats with Raheem Sterling during Liverpool training on Monday . Balotelli was in a happier mood at Melwood after receiving some hefty challenges on Saturday . Philippe Senderos kicks out at Balotelli during the first-half at Anfield on Saturday . Senderos then had another swipe at the Italian, which the referee completely missed . And although Rodgers says Balotelli should have been given protection by referees, he said there were no complaints overall. Rodgers said: 'We expect the referee to protect all our players, not just Mario. 'It is a man’s game. It is a competitive game but if it oversteps the mark when he’s not involved in the build-up then we would expect the referee and officials to look at it. 'But there are no complaints for me. Football is competitive and strong and we ask the players to be that in our team but be fair in the way we work.' Rodgers has set his sights on the knockout stages after he insisted Liverpool have earned the right to be in the Champions League. Liverpool end a five-year absence from Europe’s premier competition on Tuesday evening with a home game against FC Ludogorets and Rodgers has admitted he is ready to embrace the challenges that await in the coming months. Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool will be targeting the knockout stages of the Champions League . Rodgers sais he had done his research on Ludogorets and claimed they will arrive in a bullish mood . Liverpool's manager said they will take the Champions League one match at a time and see what happens . Rodgers said that Champions League football was the key to making any club sustainable . Ludogorets will be viewed as the weak link in Group B but Liverpool will have no easy task progressing as they also face reigning champions Real Madrid and the improving Swiss side FC Basel. Rodgers, however, believes his squad’s time to be at this level has come. They finished second in the Barclays Premier League last season, losing the title by just two points to Manchester City, and Rodgers wants Liverpool to be rubbing shoulders with the biggest names in the new year. He said: 'I am very excited. Five years is a long time. We deserve the right to be in it. We had a great season. 'Success is about qualifying from the group. We will take it one game at a time. But the overall first objective is to get out of the group and qualify.' But Rodgers is taking nothing for granted, even if fans will expect a comfortable victory against their Bulgarian opposition. He said: 'Like all games at this level, it will be a tough game. They are the top team in Bulgaria and we have done a lot of research on them. They play 4-2-3-1 and the full-backs push up. They want to attack. Dejan Lovren claimed Liverpool needed to 'move on' from their recent Premier League defeat . Dejan Lovren admitted that Liverpool's 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa at the weekend was 'painful' 'They come here with confidence and will want to perform like they are in Bulgaria. We now have to be really aggressive with our pressing and passing. We know they will be a tough opponent.' Liverpool struggled defensively against Aston Villa and while the manager confirmed Martin Skrtel will soon return he also admitted that more work was needed. 'We need to be better in those areas,' said Rodgers. 'We were disappointed with the goal we conceded. It is going to take that little bit of time. Our emphasis will always be positive but, for sure, we have got to tighten up.' Liverpool have not played a Champions League match since they lost to Fiorentina 2-1 in 2009, a result which saw them finish third in their group. But the five-time winners are back and, for Rodgers, it's not a moment too soon. He said: 'It is only the last couple of days that it has brought home how long it has been a way. This was my main priority to get the club at this level. As well as Bulgarian side Ludogorets, Liverpool will face Real Madrid and Swiss side Basel in their group . 'This is one of the football greats around the world and this is the elite competition. This game can’t come quick enough for us. I have had supporters in my office, telling me about it. We do this for our supporters. 'The key is to build towards making this a sustainable club. The Champions League is the elite level.' Meanwhile, Dejan Lovren admitted Liverpool were still feeling the effects of the defeat to Aston Villa, but claimed the club just needs to move on. He said: 'We have shown to everyone that we can play and are not scared about defeats. Aston Villa was a little bit painful, we didn’t expect it but it happens. We need to keep our head up and concentrate. We need to move on. 'We have the Champions League now and we have to forget (about Villa).Of course we need to improve in every game but I am really confident in our team. We are practically a new team with a lot of new players. Everything will settle down. Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli at Liverpool's Melwood training ground before the Ludogorets match . 'I think for everyone it is a pleasure to be back in after five years. We want success here. I will not say that we have got an easy group but I am sure that we can pass (out of) the group.' Unlike some of Lovren's team-mates, though, this is not his first time playing in the competition. He said: 'It will help me (having played for Lyon). I think I have played 21/22 games in the Champions League and I know what can happen. It is something different to the Premier League. 'I think I am ready to play in the Champions League and I can’t wait to start. It will be something different. It will be a massive game. 'It is a big part of football, it is not the same thing to play in the Champions League for Lyon as it is for Liverpool. We just need to concentrate, be calm and play our style of the game.

"An Elmo character looking for tourists to pose for pictures with in Times Square instead had an unpleasant run-in with police that ended in handcuffs. Rosa Sanchez, 36, from Clifton, New Jersey, was taken into custody Tuesday for allegedly demanding tips in an aggressive manner from passersby while dressed as Elmo. Arresting officers who were part of an undercover sting operation restrained the woman's hands behind her back and took a picture of her fuzzy red costume with the caption: 'just another day in Midtown south.

Ms Sanchez was then taken to Midtown South Police Precinct to be charged for aggressive solicitation.

"Barcelona continued their perfect start to the season in La Liga with a comprehensive win over bottom side Levante. After being held out for 34 minutes the visitors finally got themselves ahead through Neymar, who rounded the keeper and slotted home with ease, following a sumptuous ball over the top from Lionel Messi -  his five assist of the season already. Five minutes later Barcelona had the opportunity to extend their lead with that man Messi again the architect, closing in on goal before being hacked down by both Loukas Vyntra and Tono Garcia - however bizarrely only the former got the red card despite both of them involved in the altercation. To cap a remarkable few minutes Messi then smashed the penalty over the bar as the score remained 1-0 to the visitors. The floodgates opened after that though with goals from Ivan Rakitic, Sandro, Pedro and Messi completed the rout and kept the Catalan giants top of La Liga. See how the action panned out below . Host commentator . Perhaps it was a harsh sending off, but Barcelona have torn Levante apart here. Five different scorers and a continuation of their 100 per cent start to the season. Malaga away next up for Luis Enrique's men on Wednesday night. Having been anonymous for 30 minutes, Lionel Messi has been superb since and deserved his sublime goal. He has harried every Levante man on the ball and not wasted a single pass. World class. Mathieu is found at the far post by Xavi, but his cut back goes just wide as Pedro attempts to get there before the post. Perhaps he could have scored there... Barca just knocking the ball about now like it's an exhibition game. Real hit Deportivo for EIGHT yesterday, and this hasn't been a weekend to claim La Liga is competitive. Easy. What a goal by Messi, who chips the goalkeeper and defender with his right foot. 357 goals for Barcelona and this one looks like the other 356 others. Jesus comes too far out of his area and made up the little man's mind for him, but it's still a great finish. A clean sheet is all Luis Enrique will want now to keep up their 100 per cent record this season for the team of Soleros... Andres Iniesta, quietely effective tonight, comes off for Sergi Roberto . Mathieu, who in truth has been dodgy today, slices a clearance as the ball falls to Morales. But the Levante man's weak shot trickles wide. It's quiet inside the ground as Messi piles into the area. He is brought down by Simao, but it was more of a shoulder barge as Gonzales Gonzales waves play on. The floodgates are well and truly open, as predicted. Great football on the left as Sandro flicks the ball to Alba. The left-back's pace takes him away from the Levante defence and the cut back to Pedro, who slots home from eight yards. Four zip. And it will probably be more. Two in two for young Spaniard Sandro Ramirez . Messi gets through two on one with Sandro to his left... he slides the ball through to the youngster and he slides the ball past Jesus. Very much like Mesut Ozil's finish against Aston Villa yesterday. Sandro hit the winner against APOEL in midweek having come on as a sub, too. He looks a prospect. Levante have had a bit of the ball since Neymar went off, and they have a free-kick on the edge of the area. The referee DOES have spray on him this time! But Diop's free-kick hits the wall. The ball goes out of play after Jordi Alba is hit by Simao's flailing arm. Uh oh, the Brazilian is on a heap off the pitch but Barca have played on. When the ball eventually goes out of play, we see how Neymar stretched to keep the ball in play and landed on his backside. It may be THAT back injury... but the medical staff won't let him back on despite him being back on his feet. Sandro comes on to replace him. Neat footwork in the area from Alba and Messi ends with Iniesta, who curls over from the corner of the box. Oh, and it's pouring down in Valencia. Levante, their centre-back Vyntra sent off, have no defenders on the bench. It's going to be a long 45 minutes. Here's the moment Messi was brought down in the area by both Vyntra and Tono. The former saw red. And the floodgates have opened. What a goal from Ivan Rakitic. His first for the club as the ball falls to him 25 yards out. He thumps it into the corner past Jesus, who has absolutely no chance. The replay shows it may have slightly touched the defender, but nonetheless, that is a hit. In an attempt to clear things up... here we go. Both Vyntra and Tono tackled Messi in the area, but only one was given the red card. A mad decision but Pedro Gonzales Gonzales has had a crazy evening already. With 10 men, surely Barcelona will open the floodgates will open. Messi MISSES the penalty... he's hit it high and wide! Unbelievable few minutes. Bemusement in Valencia... Vyntra is sent off despite it looking like Tono who pulled him down! Iniesta finds Messi in the area, the Argentine controls it, gets in between two defenders and is fouled. Clear penalty. Messi's fifth assist of the season. He really is becoming the new king of the perfectly weighted through ball in Xavi's absence. Every goal Barcelona have scored this season has been made or scored by Messi. Messi, who I was just about to say had done nothing in the game, plays a wonderful ball over the top for Neymar, who gets in just before the keeper, rounds him and slots home. Goalkeeper Jesus did get a touch to Neymar's initial touch around him, but couldn't deflect the ball clear, and Barcelona finally have their opener. The Brazilian's third goal of the season. Iniesta rather disappointingly produces a 'hit and hope' effort looking for a deflection, and the game has settled as Levate look to keep the ball. Barca will want a goal before half-time to hurt Levante. You get the feeling one would open the floodgates... Last year's top scorer for Levante, Barral, heads just wide after a fine cross into the area. Bravo was rooted to the spot and the hosts could easily be 2-0 up. Saying that, a very open game at both ends so far. At the other end, Mascherano floats a long ball over the defence and Neymar bravely gets up ahead of the goalkeeper but heads wide. Unlucky. Neymar gets charged in the back by Rodas with the ball miles away, just like his injury at the World Cup. He's down for 30 seconds but gets back up, and then with his next touch flicks the ball over a Levante defender's head. Beautiful. Back to the football... The ball falls to Neymar in the area at a slight angle and with not much space. The Brazilian tries to spash the ball past Jesus, but the keeper saves well. A dink over the onrushing Jesus would have done nicely there... Match official Pedro Gonzales Gonzales has dropped his cannister of vanishing spray TWICE, and then, unbelievably, he throws it onto the sideline. He's done with it. No more fun in the defensive wall. So good they named him twice. Jordi Alba is in acres of space inside the area on the left, and his cross-cum-shot evades Pedro and goes out for a throw in. Too powerful and erratic from Alba. He'll be disappointed with that. Mathieu dives in on Morales but misses the ball, he didn't need to go to ground! Morales skips past him and looks for the far post, but Rakitic does so well to clear the ball before a Levante man got on the end of it. Poor from Mathieu, brilliant from Rakitic. 0-0 after 10 minutes. When current Levante coach Mendilibar faced Barça last season his Osasuna lost 7-0 so, so far so good. Mathieu gets himself into trouble as Morales picks up a loose ball in the centre circle... he paces forward but Alba comes back to clear for a corner to Levante. The corner finds its way to Morales, whose volley goes a few yards wide. Corner for Barca after Alba's centre is cleared. Pedro's header is awful, and goes straight back to corner taker Rakitic. The ball goes up the other end and Bravo has to rush off his line in Neuer-esque fashion to clear out for a throw in. Diop has a go from 18 yards, but it's weak and into the arms of Bravo. Alba puts a disappointing ball into the box from the left in space, cleared by Tono inside the area. The Spaniard then puts another poor ball into the box, but Barcelona have plenty of time on the ball. Early corner for Barca finds its way to Dani Alves, who pulls back for Mathieu, but his effort with the outside of the foot is deflected wide for another corner. Perhaps Mathieu could have stroked that one, rather than attempt a clever effort. The resulting corner comes to nothing before Neymar is thwarted on a forward run. And they're off! Everyone tipping Barcelona at 2-11, Levante are at 14-1. We'll see how that turns out... The form guide suggests Barcelona will win this easily, with Levante struggling so far this season and Barca turning on the style. The teams are just about to come out, with Iniesta leading Barcelona in their fluorescent kit, looking more like 11 Soleros than a football team. Levante, of course, play in Barcelona's famous red and blue. Here's a sneak preview of the dressing room from Barcelona earlier... And welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of Barcelona's trips to Levante. Here are your teams: . Levante: Jesus, Tono, Hector, Vyntra, Barral, Morales, Casadesus, Pedro Lopez, Diop, Simao and Camarasa .

"Gary Neville always thought the manager of Manchester United should be British. He said it privately, he said it publicly. He stated it very passionately one night in Barcelona, when the dwindling embers of the David Moyes era were being raked over following a Champions League match. Neville was adamant, defiant, that Manchester United should resist the appeal of a foreign coach. In his eyes this meant giving Moyes more time but it was plain that, even if a change had to be made, Neville felt the successor must hail from within these shores. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail preview: Manchester United v QPR . David Moyes (left) was sacked earlier this year and replaced at Manchester United by Louis van Gaal .

Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind are expected to make their Manchester United debuts against QPR . Manchester United have a proud tradition of hiring British managers, such as Sir Alex Ferguson . Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Matt Busby celebrate United's Cup Winners Cup win in 1991 . Others disagreed, and spoke of the practical realities, but he was insistent. It was what made United unique, he said. It was part of the culture of the club. A British manager affording opportunity to young British players. It was what set Manchester United apart. Not any more. Sunday, September 14, 2014, is the first day of the new Manchester United. Against Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford, a foreign coach will preside over a starting XI of mostly foreign, expensively-acquired, players. If there are English names on the team-sheet they will have been purchased for a king’s ransom, just like the rest. If Jonny Evans or Darren Fletcher does make the starting line-up, they will merely be keeping that seat warm until the injury list shortens or the next transfer window signals another round of improvements. The vow these days is to buy the equivalent of one Luis Suarez every year. Ryan Giggs says United will continue giving youth its chance but, like Neville, he sounds like a man out of time. A project that intends to take a team from seventh place to automatic Champions League qualification in one season is in too much of a hurry to rely on old-style youth development. New signings Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo (right) are both expected to face QPR on Sunday . (from left) Juan Mata, Anderson, Ander Herrera, David de Gea, Angel Di Maria and Marcos Rojo share a joke . Doubts remain about where Adnan Januzaj and Luke Shaw fit into Louis van Gaal's team . Manchester United celebrate their Champions League success in 1999, beating Bayern Munich in the final . Louis van Gaal’s overhaul has cast out some ordinary players, but it cannot help but scratch the odd gem, too: one of its first casualties would appear to be Adnan Januzaj, the rising star of the previous campaign, now pegged behind a who’s who of world football. His starting opportunities would appear bleakly limited, short-term at least. It isn’t that Manchester United’s spending spree is immoral — they’ve got it, so why not flaunt it — or even that towards the end the purchases seemed to be based on what was available, rather than what was required. Everyone agreed significant investment was needed. The Class of 92 was a beautiful windfall, but United have not produced talent in any depth since then and waiting for the next generation would have seen the club slip further from the elite. Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, took a big gamble, but a necessary one, the Glazers having got away with reduced investment for so long. Positively thinking, there is a genuine sense of anticipation and wonder around the team Van Gaal will field tomorrow, the biggest buzz in English club football for several years. But is it United? No. Not the one Neville, Giggs and many others thought they knew. Not the United that Sir Alex Ferguson nurtured. Pat Crerand (left), George Best (right) and their manager Matt Busby hold the European Cup aloft in 1968 . Manchester United have yet to produce another batch of youngsters like their famous class of 92' Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham were stars for United . Ryan Giggs (left, with Wayne Rooney at training) says United will always gives home-grown players a chance . Gary Neville has concerns about how the club he played for his entire career is being run now . Sir Alex Ferguson applauds the Manchester United fans as he makes his way off the Old Trafford pitch . It is United as Manchester City, as Chelsea, as Real Madrid or Inter. It is Manchester United Internationale, the way every modern elite club, with one or two exceptions, is now a melting pot of star names and contracted performers, passing through as if on tour. Cristiano Ronaldo was an unforgettable force for good at United but, ultimately, his team was Real Madrid. Old Trafford was a mutually beneficial stop on a career path that began at Sporting Lisbon and ended at the Bernabeu. Radamel Falcao talks of staying at United for many years, but this is a vague notion also. He was ‘eager to start the challenge’ and ‘very happy’ at Monaco, too, a year ago. ‘I have chosen this project,’ he announced. Now he has chosen another one. So this team may achieve great things, but it is not like the old days. One does not see Falcao, Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo sinking their savings into Atletico Salford 10 years from now. And with this new dynamic come changing attitudes, in the boardroom and also the cheap seats. No club ends up with the most expensively assembled squad in the Premier League, and settles for life outside the Champions League just three games into the season. Cristiano Ronaldo was a great player for Manchester United but his true love was Real Madrid . David Beckham said he had a special relationship with the Manchester United fans during his time at the club . Ryan Giggs is one of the only remaining links to the old Manchester United left at Old Trafford . Manchester United may be in 14th place now, but that is only seven points from the top and five behind the automatically qualified third-placed team, currently Aston Villa, who nobody thinks will be there come the end of the season. There are 105 points up for grabs from here, including home and away fixtures against every current Premier League club that has ever qualified for the Champions League in its modern format. So it’s on. With the names on their roster, United’s owners now have every reason to expect to make the top three this season. And that is a sign of shifting times, too. Moyes would undoubtedly have been given a longer run, if only his first season had not been such a disaster. Van Gaal’s reputation may buy him indulgence, but there will also be irritation if he does not turn this ship around, and fast. The board will not see the mitigation of a squad brought together in haste and on the hoof; they will see numbers, big numbers, and with them comes a demand for results. Tyler Blackett is one of the young players that Louis van Gaal has given a chance this season . Striker James WIlson is seen as a player who could break into the United first team in the future . At Old Trafford, too, there may be an unfamiliar atmosphere. The majority of United fans were steadfastly supportive of Moyes even when they knew his regime was damaged beyond repair. There will be a huge sense of excitement around tomorrow’s game — but what if the change in fortunes is slow to unfold? Not against QPR, now viewed more as cannon fodder than tomorrow’s opposition, but against Chelsea on October 26, Manchester City on November 2 or Arsenal on November 22? The club that Neville and Giggs knew enjoyed a special relationship with its home-produced players. David Beckham summed it up last week. ‘When you are a young player at United, when you are there from a young age and are home-grown, you feel it from the fans,’ he said. # . ‘You have a really special bond and association with them. You are their player. When we were successful, when we were winning European Cups, leagues and FA Cups, it felt really personal from the fans, like how I feel when I see my son score a goal, or how my parents felt when they saw me win a championship. You feel like you have 75,000 parents watching you in the stands. That’s how Manchester United have always been.’ Tom Cleverely (centre) was sold by Manchester United to Aston Villa during the January transfer window . Danny Welbeck (centre) surprisingly moved from Manchester United to Arsenal for £16m . So while the new signings are not exactly orphans — Ronaldo was loyally supported, too, after the 2006 World Cup — they will not be as tenderly indulged through the difficult times. It was easy to support Ronaldo. He was a budding genius, and an important part of a very successful team. Yet what of a striker earning in the region of £300,000 who is not performing, in a team that has failed to click? Even Tom Cleverley, with United from the age of 11, spoke of the oppressive tension around the club last season. What if this continues? Will Falcao feel he has 75,000 parents too? Or will he be like Mesut Ozil at Arsenal, or Fernando Torres at Chelsea, judged in relation to his transfer fee, salary and performance? Jack Wilshere gets an easier ride than Ozil ever will, for the reasons Beckham identified. So this is it for United. Day one of a new era. The club Red Nev thought he knew no longer exists. Manchester United will look the same and sound the same tomorrow — they may even play the same if Van Gaal can overcome the time-poor restrictions of the international break to restore some of the old swagger. Yet they are not the same. United are like the rest from here: only richer, grander and with great, great expectations.","United have prided themselves on having British managers and players .

"Australia will deploy a military force of 600 to the Middle East as part of international efforts to combat Islamic State extremists, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Mr Abbott said Australia had received a specific request from the US government to contribute forces to possible military action in Iraq. He said the contingent of Special Forces troops had been sent to the Middle East to act as military advisers, but he outlined the role they would play should Australia commit to combat. Scroll down for video . The Australian military will deploy to the Middle East as part of a US-led operation against Islamic State, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on 14 September 2014 . 'What we are trying to do here, should the decision to commit to combat be made, is to help the Iraqi forces to help the Kurdish forces to try to ensure that people who are at risk of dislocation and death from the murderous rage of ISIL have some better means of protection,' he told The Today Show. 'We had a specific request from the United States to be prepared to commit and we have been welcomed by the Iraqi government. 'So this is one of the fundamental differences between this potential commitment and the commitment that was made 11 years ago.' Cabinet and the National Security Committee met on Sunday to discuss the matter. Australia's contribution will include up to eight Super Hornet aircraft, an early warning and control aircraft, aerial refuelling aircraft and a contingent of Special Forces troops. 'The government has decided to prepare and to deploy to the United Arab Emirates a military force, ' Abbott said in Darwin on Sunday . The prime minister emphasised that Australia was part of an international coalition. He said the deployment did not mean Australia was at war. 'There are obviously further decisions to be taken before Australian forces will be committed to combat operations in Iraq,' Mr Abbott said. 'Nevertheless, Australia is prepared to engage in international operations to disrupt and degrade ISIL because of the threat that this murderous death cult poses not just to the people of Iraq, not just to the people of the Middle East, but to the whole world, including to Australia.' Special forces troops will act as military advisers to Iraqi and other security forces fighting Islamic State extremists. Mr Abbott warned Australia's involvement could last many months, rather than weeks. He said he was not aware of any Australians being held hostage by IS terrorists. Tony Abbott has announced that 600 Australian troops will be sent to the Middle East in an effort to diffuse ISIS conflict . The Islamist group has released a video purportedly showing a masked militant killing British aid worker David Haines, who was taken hostage in Syria in March 2013. Mr Abbott's reaction to the beheading - the third in recent weeks - was one of 'shock, horror, outrage and fury' and he now had a steely determination to tackle the terrorists. 'The evil and exaltation in evil that was yet again on display today, should make all of us more resolved than ever to do whatever we reasonably can to disrupt, degrade and if possible destroy this movement,' he said. He would not call the movement Islamic State because it was neither Islamic nor a state.'It is a death cult,' Mr Abbott said. The prime minister said about 400 air personnel and about 200 military personnel would be involved in the deployment. He said 'air elements' would depart in the next week or so, while ""military elements"" could depart sooner. 600 Australian troops will be sent to the UAE to join an American led initiative . 'We think this is a balanced and proportionate contribution to what is our fight, but it is the world's fight,' Mr Abbott said. 'Australia has a long and proud tradition of doing what we can to help at home and abroad to make for a safer Australia and a safer world.'He rejected suggestions growing involvement in Iraq would make Australia a target. 'These terrorists and would-be terrorists are not targeting us for what we have done or for what we might do, they are targeting us for who we are, they are targeting us for our freedom, our tolerance, for our compassion, for our decency,' he said. Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, said disrupting and degrading Islamic State would take a 'comprehensive and sustained effort'. 'But ... if we do nothing, the risk of allowing the shocking acts of ISIL to further destabilise the Middle East and spread beyond the Middle East region, potentially back to Australia, is a greater risk,' he said.","Prime Minster Abbott announces that Australian troops and aircrafts will join American troops in the Middle East .

"Jose Mourinho called it 'fantastic news' after Wembley was named as the host stadium for the climax to Euro 2020. The Chelsea manager indicated he has no plans to leave the club game by then to take up a national team job. But, as a supporter, the Portuguese believes England's national stadium will be an ideal venue for the semi-finals and final of the European Championship in six years' time. Jose Mourinho said he was delighted Wembley will host the final and semis of Euro 2020 . Greg Dyke, chairman of the FA, celebrates the announcement in Geneva on Friday . Asked about the Football Association's successful bid to stage the three crunch games, Mourinho said: 'Great. I think it has to be a special Euro because it is playing in so many countries, but ending in London and Wembley, I think is fantastic news. 'I'd like to be there as a fan, not as a manager.' The tournament will be played across 13 European cities: London, Baku, Brussels, Copenhagen, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Amsterdam, Dublin, Bucharest, St Petersburg, Glasgow and Bilbao. The new Wembley, which opened in 2007, hosted the Champions League finals in 2011 and 2013 . Mourinho's Chelsea were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw against Schalke in the Champions League on Friday . Former England striker Gary Lineker warmly welcomed news of Wembley's success, and hopes it can spur the national team. Lineker was a star for England in two World Cups but could not transfer that form to the European Championship stage, and bowed out of international football after a painful Euro 92 experience. He is keen to see England, who hosted Euro 96 and reached the semi-finals, put in another strong performance and still be battling for the trophy come the point the tournament reaches Wembley. The Chelsea manager said he hopes to be at the Wembley matches, but as a fan not as a manager . Lineker wrote on Twitter: 'Terrific news that Wembley will host the semis and final of Euro 2020! Hope we're in it at that stage, and that I'm still alive to enjoy it.' In an aside, and making reference to Glasgow's trend-bucking verdict in the Scottish referendum, Lineker added: 'Good to see too that Glasgow got another yes vote, and will host a last 16 game.' London Mayor Boris Johnson pointed to the city's Olympic Games success as he added on Twitter: 'Great news that Wembley Stadium will host both semi-finals and the final of Euro 2020, continuing the lasting legacy of 2012'. Former England striker and Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker was also delighted with the news . Boris Johnson said Wembley hosting the final and semis would continue the legacy of London 2012 . While Scotland had other issues to debate, after the country's overall referendum 'No' vote, there was delight in Ireland at Dublin being handed three group games and one last-16 fixture. Former Republic of Ireland winger Stephen Hunt said: 'Fair play to @FAIreland for getting four games during the euros 2020! I know irish people will buy into it and the buzz that goes with it. 'It's not just the 2020 tournament. Ireland will get to show people what we are capable of, maybe one day hosting one ourselves is now on'.","Jose Mourinho was delighted that Wembley has been given the final and both semis of Euro 2020 .

"Harry Redknapp aside, it will be difficult for most football people not to be excited by Sunday's Manchester United debut for Radamel Falcao against QPR. The procession of genuine world-class talent to Spain has seemed like one-way traffic in recent years while the Premier League sat around waiting for the scraps left over from Barcelona and Real Madrid. Latterly, even Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco have been the preferred destination over England. So even players of international renown and some experience are infected by the vibrancy that the Colombian has brought to the Premier League and to Manchester United, Wayne Rooney included. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal: Welbeck wasn't good enough for Manchester United . Radamel Falcao and Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (right) talk during training on Thursday . Manchester United fans will be hoping Radamel Falcao will inspire them to their first Premier League victory . Radamel Falcao will make his Manchester United debut against QPR at Old Trafford on Sunday . ‘I’ve seen him play throughout the years and he’s a fantastic player,’ says the United captain. ‘It’s exciting — and also for the Premier League. He could have gone to a number of other clubs but it’s great we’ve got him.’ And given the desperate start the club have made — two points from three games and elimination from the Capital One Cup — the arrival of Falcao, along with Daley Blind, Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo, has provided a renewed sense of optimism at the club. ‘Obviously last season, we all know we were not good enough,’ says Rooney. ‘But the time is now right to get these top players to get us back to where we belong, back to winning titles again. It’s exciting times, it’s interesting times for United. We’ve not got off to the best of starts but we are confident. It’s a great signing. It’s a great statement of intent. And I am looking forward to working with him. Hopefully we can form a great partnership.’ As captain, Rooney will be responsible for ensuring the transition from Monaco to Manchester is smooth. ‘You have to make sure the new players are made to feel welcome,’ said Rooney. Angel di Maria was signed by Manchester United for £60million from Spanish giants Real Madrid . Argentine defender Marcos Rojo will finally make his ManUnited debut two weeks after signing for the club . Daley Blind was another of the stars to arrive at Manchester United over the summer . But in terms of how the team are going to play, even Rooney has not quite figured that out yet. ‘Falcao is a world-class player and it’s down to the manager how he chooses to play. He [Louis van Gaal] has myself, Falcao, Robin van Persie, Di Maria, Juan Mata, so it’s a great selection of players for him to pick from.’ Yet amid the sense of euphoria that big-name signings always create, there are ripples of discontent. Eric Harrison, Mike Phelan and Gary Neville have all spoken of their surprise that United sold Danny Welbeck, a youth-team graduate, who understands the club, fans and the area, and recruited a Colombian on loan, a player who has never spent more than two years at a club since he left River Plate in 2009. To make way for the new arrivals, another youth-team graduate, Tom Cleverley, has also been moved on loan to Aston Villa and over the summer £160million has been spent. It might have transformed some people’s view of United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, with Paul Scholes saying he had done his job ‘brilliantly’ after questioning whether United were capable of finalising the biggest deals. Former Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck made his debut for Arsenal on Saturday . Tom Cleverley (right) made his Aston Villa debut on Saturday against Liverpool having been let go by United . But for Van Gaal, the man who made his name primarily by promoting young players and not through lavish spending, it looks an unlikely change of direction. Nurturing the youth was his stock in trade at Ajax in the Nineties, where he established his reputation by winning the Champions League in 1995. And even at the richest clubs such as Barcelona and Bayern Munich he seemed to concern himself more with young players from the academies than with major signings. The manager bristles when the point is put to him, his explanation being that he still believes in youth but that he has sought to disrupt the atmosphere of the dressing room to create a new dynamic. ‘You have seen Tyler Blackett, Jesse Lingard and Reece James playing. When you see my line-ups there are several young players who have played already. So I don’t think I have changed my philosophy, only that we have to change the selection to give a new rhythm in the dressing room,’ he says. ‘When you are there for more than two or three years as a substitute, do you think this is a good thing for the players? No. Jesse Lingard started Manchester United's first game of the season against Swansea . Tyler Blackett (right) has been a regular for Manchester United since Louis van Gaal took over . Reece James is another young player that Louis van Gaal has given a first-team chance to . ‘My philosophy is that you have to sell those players or send them on loan. Better for them and also better for the atmosphere in the dressing room. So we let go 14 players and we bought six players, so there are eight vacancies for young players. But it depends on the level of the young players at United. I cannot change that. But I have already played with a lot of youngsters so I don’t understand your question.’ He might not put it this way but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Van Gaal feels he has cleared out some dead wood to allow new flowers to blossom. But there are more seasoned Van Gaal watchers, those who have worked closely with him in the past, who have been surprised by the signals the summer transfer window has sent out. Kenneth Perez was one of Van Gaal’s key players at AZ Alkmaar, the club where Van Gaal restored his reputation by winning the Dutch league in 2009 after failing with the Holland national team in 2002 and his indifferent second spell at Barcelona in 2003. Perez became close to Van Gaal, is still in touch with him and now works as a pundit for Fox Sports in Holland. ‘I’m really surprised about the players he has bought, the money he has spent, the positions they are in,’ says Perez. ‘Maybe because of the good results in pre-season he thought United were better than they are. For me, from the outside, it looks like he’s not the only one deciding who is coming in. Kenneth Perez (left, who worked with Louis van Gaal) shoots for goal during his time at AZ Alkmaar . Javier Hernandez played for Real Madrid against rivals Atletico on Saturday after leaving Manchester United . ‘I understand Angel di Maria because Van Gaal is looking at a type and he needs a player like Arjen Robben, who can do something on his own, carry the ball 50 metres passing people. He couldn’t get Robben, so I guess Di Maria was second best. But renting Falcao for that kind of money when you have Van Persie, Rooney and you had Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck, is a big surprise.’ Significantly, Van Gaal suggests the spending is not yet over. ‘We have more balance in the squad but not enough balance,’ says the United manager. When pressed on areas which remain out of equilibrium, he said: ‘Obviously the defending part.’ Perhaps at Old Trafford there will be a balance. Sources close to United speak of how he has spoken with enthusiasm about Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, players with whom domestic observers have long since become impatient. And his persistence with Blackett, another who is said to be soaking up Van Gaal’s instructions, the insistence that James Wilson can be his fourth striker, the use of Lingard on the opening day of the season are actions more in line with the Van Gaal of old. ‘That’s his trademark,’ said Perez. ‘He likes to prove you wrong. If you write Smalling is the worst player, he likes to show you: “Hey, I can make Smalling a good player”. Louis van Gaal is said to be enthusiastic about the potential of Chris Smalling and Phil Jones (right) Danny Koevermans (left, a AZ Alkmaar player Van Gaal improved) celebrates with Moussa Dembele . ‘The best example was Danny Koevermans at AZ. He wasn’t that good passing or in his first touch. And after four months with the training of Van Gaal, he became brilliant. That was the biggest change I’ve seen, from a player who couldn’t pass to one who was very good. ‘My only worry that Van Gaal would not be a success is because English players are not tactical, clever players. At the moment the back-line don’t push up, so the space between midfield and the defence is too big so everyone can just play in between there. It’s just too easy. It was unbelievable in that first game against Swansea and I doubt they understand what he wants.’ Of course, if he can transform Blackett, Lingard, James and even older players such as Jones and Smalling into significant United defenders, the £160m spent will seem unimportant given the money he has saved the club. But if he can’t, he may just find himself knocking on Woodward’s door again in January asking for more. Louis van Gaal has a stunning squad to choose from after a summer of spending at Old Trafford but the new United boss has his work cut out choosing a starting XI and keeping those he leaves on the bench happy. 1. 3-4-1-2 . If LVG wants to squeeze the majority of his signings, this is the way to go. But it has Blind in an unfamiliar central role and is ridiculously open in central midfield. Would surely need a Darren Fletcher type in there to shore things up. 2. 4-3-3 . Looks a little more balanced but asking Van Persie and Rooney to run wide for Falcao might not go down terribly well. Rooney will do the job but RVP hasn’t played there since his early days at Arsenal. Still no room for Januzaj. 3. 4-4-2 . A classic Fergie formation — wingers (though you might want Valencia on the right to really get outside players) and two central midfielders who can tackle and pass. But Mata, RVP and Herrera — £75m of talent — are sat on the bench.","Manchester United take on QPR at Old Trafford on Sunday .

"While the return of the Premier League this weekend will see debuts from exciting deadline-day signings, there's also room to celebrate loyal servants at clubs. Ryan Giggs' retirement at the end of last season brought an end to a glittering career for the Manchester United winger, but it also ensured his baton of longest-serving Premier League player needed to be passed on. Taking the Welshman's place as the top flight's longest-serving player is Steven Gerrard, with the Liverpool captain's debut coming as far back as November 1998 when the midfielder replaced Vegard Heggem with a minute to be played in the Reds' 2-0 home win over Blackburn. The retirement of Ryan Giggs has made Steven Gerrard the Premier League's longest serving player . Not far behind Gerrard is John Terry, with the Chelsea captain making his Premier League debut a month later on Boxing Day. The former England skipper was also a second-half substitute, replacing Gus Poyet in Chelsea's 2-0 win at Southampton. Few of the remaining top-flight sides have players who have spent over 10 years at the elite level, but with the transfer window now shut and the squads settled, Sportsmail has looked at the longest serving players at Premier League every club. Arsenal - Abou Diaby (Debut for current club - 21/1/2006) He's only managed 124 appearances in eight-and-a-half years, but Abou Diaby takes the crown as Arsenal's longest serving player. The midfielder, who signed from Auxerre in January 2006, made his debut as substitute in a 1-0 defeat to Everton in the same month and is currently fighting to get back into Arsene Wenger's first team. Abou Diaby (left) signed for Arsenal from Auxerre before making his debut in 2006 while Gabriel Agbonlahor came through Aston Villa's youth academy before netting on his first start for the West Midlands club . Aston Villa - Gabriel Agbonlahor (18/3/2006) There won't be many Aston Villa fans too keen to remember Gabriel Agbonlahor's debut, but the Villa striker at least has a reason to smile about it as he scored in the club's 4-1 defeat by Everton. Burnley - Michael Duff (20/12/2009) Michael Duff made his Premier League debut in 2009, but first featured for Burnley in August 2004 in a 1-1 Championship draw with Sheffield United. The 36-year-old signed for just £30,000 from Cheltenham Town. Michael Duff (left) has spent 10 years at Burnley while John Terry is the league's second-longest-serving player . Chelsea - John Terry (07/08/2004) Now known as 'captain, leader, legend', it was small steps to start with for John Terry who was thrown into the Premier League spotlight on Boxing Day in 1998 as a substitute during the Blues 2-0 win at Southampton. Crystal Palace - Julian Speroni (14/8/2004) Not many would have backed Julian Speroni to have lasted over 10 years at Crystal Palace after a shaky first season, but the goalkeeper has turned into a fan favourite over the years, . Tony Hibbert (left) joined Everton's senior team in 2001 from the youth academy while Julian Speroni arrived at Crystal Palace in 2004 following the Eagles' promotion from the second tier . Everton - Tony Hibbert (31/3/2001) A product of the Toffees' academy, Tony Hibbert began his senior Everton career way back in 2001 under then manager Walter Smith. The tough-tackling right back has since gone on to earn a testimonial and signed a new two-year contract earlier this summer. Hull - Paul McShane (13/09/2008) Paul McShane made a winning start for Hull in a 2-1 win at Newcastle, and despite suffering relegation with the Tigers has since helped the club back into the top flight. Andy King (left) came through Leicester's academy in 2007, while Paul McShane joined Hull a year later . Leicester - Andy King (02/10/2007) It's not hard to be Leicester's longest-serving Premier League player given this is their first season back in the top flight for 10 years, but King made his club debut against Wolves in an October 2007 Championship clash after coming through the academy. Liverpool - Steven Gerrard (29/11/1998) Get out your record books and make a note because Steven Gerrard's small cameo a minute from time in a 2-0 win over Blackburn makes him officially the Premier League's longest-serving player. Steven Gerrard has been in the Liverpool team since 1998, while Micah Richards made his City debut in 2005 . Manchester City - Micah Richards (22/10/2005) Micah Richards burst onto the scene in 2005 after working his way up Manchester City's youth academy. His debut came against Arsenak in October 2005 but he has recently joined Italian side Fiorentina on loan after finding first team opportunities hard to come by. Manchester United - Darren Fletcher (27/09/2003) Darren Fletcher already had Champions League experience when he made his Premier League debut, which came in a 4-1 win at Leicester, with Ruud van Nistelrooy grabbing a hat-trick for the Red Devils. Darren Fletcher (left) broke into Manchester United's team in 2003 in a 4-1 win at Leicester City while Steven Taylor made his Newcastle debut a year later in a 1-0 defeat by Bolton . Newcastle - Steven Taylor (28/03/2004) Steven Taylor's debut in the Newcastle defence was just four minutes long when Bolton's Henrik Pederson scored the winning goal, but the centre-half has since proven his worth by going on to make 196 league appearances for the Toon. QPR - Alejandro Faurlin (18/08/2009) Currently ruled out with another serious knee injury, Alejandro Faurlin became QPR's club record signing when he moved to Loftus Road for £3.5million in July 2009. The talented midfielder has played for the Hoops 121 times since but his career hit by a number of serious knee problems in recent years. Alejandro Faurlin (left) and Kelvin Davis made their debuts for their respective clubs, Queens Park Rangers and Southampton, while both teams were in the Championship . Southampton - Kelvin Davis (06/08/2006) Signed from Sunderland in 2006, Kelvin Davis enjoyed a prolonged spell in the Southampton first team but is now third choice behind Fraser Forster and Artur Boruc. The veteran goalkeeper made his debut in August 2006 and has gone on to play for Saints on another 261 occasions. Stoke - Andy Wilkinson (16/10/2001) After coming through Stoke's academy system Andy Wilkinson made his debut for the club while he was still a teenager way back in 2001. Thirteen years later and he's still a member of the first team squad, having also spent time out on loan at Telford United, Partick Thistle, Shrewsbury Town and Blackpool. Andy Wilkinson (left) is still part of the Stoke first team squad after coming through the club's academy system, while Lee Cattermole's five years at Sunderland is bettered by no Black Cats team-mate . Sunderland - Lee Cattermole (15/08/2009) No Sunderland player can boast more than Lee Cattermole's five years at the club, with the midfielder playing in a 1-0 win at Bolton following a £6million move from Wigan. Swansea - Alan Tate (07/02/2004) Signed from Manchester United after two successful loan spells, Alan Tate has enjoyed over a decade at Swansea since arriving in 2004. The defender has spent the last couple of years mostly out on loan, with stints at Leeds, Yeovil and, most recently, Aberdeen. Alan Tate (left) and Aaron Lennon (right) are the longest serving players at Swansea and Tottenham . Tottenham - Aaron Lennon (27/08/2005) The departure of Michael Dawson has left Aaron Lennon as Tottenham's longest-serving player having made his debut in a 2-0 home defeat by Chelsea in August 2005. West Brom - James Morrison - (11/08/2007) Along with James Morrison, Chris Brunt also made his Premier League debut for West Brom in a 1-0 loss at Arsenal, but Morrison made his first Baggies appearance a year earlier in a 2-1 Championship loss at Burnley. James Morrison (left) and Mark Noble had a year's worth of Championship football behind them at their current clubs before making their Premier League debuts for their respective West Brom and West Ham teams . West Ham - Mark Noble (13/08/2005) Mark Noble had already been in the West Ham team for a year when he made his Premier League debut, which came in a 3-1 Upton Park win over Blackburn.","Steven Gerrard is the Premier League's longest serving player .

"Louis van Gaal may be one of the stern faces in the Premier League but the Manchester United manager showed his humorous side in a press conference on Friday afternoon. The Dutchman took journalists by surprise with his double dose of comedy, rebuffing a question about fitness updates before pretending to walk out of the room. Asked about the expected return dates if his injured players, Van Gaal said: 'It's very difficult to say and it's also not good to say, because then I lay pressure on the evaluation. Louis van Gaal is all smiles as the Manchester United boss addresses the media on Friday . Louis van Gaal jokes with reporters ahead of Manchester United's game with Queens Park Rangers . 'After three weeks you will say: ""Louis, Louis, why is he not fit enough"". That's not good, it's not good for the players and it's not good for me. Only good for you maybe!' The 63-year-old is still searching for his first Premier League victory as United manager, but will be hoping to pick up three points against QPR on Sunday. When asked about his previous comments on his squad needing time to settle, Van Gaal pretended to leave the room after saying: 'I have not spoke a lot. You have asked.

"Papiss Cisse came off the bench and scored twice to rescue Newcastle from another ignominious defeat but the fans’ discontent with manager Alan Pardew remains evident and doubts about his future will continue. Nikica Jelavic gave Hull the lead early in the second half with a stunning volley and Mohamed Diame hit a screamer to hand them what looked a decisive advantage. But Cisse’s heroics saved the day, and perhaps Pardew, certainly for now. There were protests against him beforehand, in pubs and around the ground, but inside the stadium they were limited and sporadic, and the manager was grateful for that small mercy. Senegal international Papiss Cisse proved the hero for Newcastle in Saturday's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw against Hull . Cisse (second right) tapped home from close range to give his side a share of the spoils against the Tigers . Cisse (centre) is mobbed by his fellow Newcastle team-mates after earning his side a draw on Saturday . Newcastle (4-2-3-1): Krul 5.5; Janmaat 6.5, Coloccini 6, Williamson 6, Dummett 6; Colback 6, Tiote 7.5 (Ameobi 85); Cabella 4.5, Sissoko 5.5, Gouffran 6 (Perez 90); Riviere 5 (Cisse 69, 8.5) Subs not used: Anita, Haidara, Elliot, Steven Taylor .

Goals: Jelavic 49, Diame 68 . Booked: Robertson, Aluko . Manager: Steve Bruce 6.5 . Man-of-the-match: Papiss Cisse . Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire) 7 . ‘I have to say thank you to the fans for that,’ he said. ‘A lot of them took a neutral position. I don’t expect them to cheer for me but they took a position to support their club.’ Small bursts of protest peppered the game, from chants of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ from sections of Newcastle’s fans to ‘We want Pardew out!’ On a couple of occasions Pardew was required to kick or hit the ball back into play from touchline, and was jeered. At 2-0 down a supporter with a piece of A4 paper adorned with an anti-Pardew slogan walked behind the dugout and shouted ‘Alan, Alan!’ to try to get Pardew to look up. He did not, and a steward shepherded the fan away. ‘It was a tough day,’ Pardew said. ‘But I’ve had to approach it as a normal working day.’ He accepted that some of the criticism had been merited given some recent results, such as last week’s 4-0 drubbing at Southampton. ‘We can’t moan about it because we’ve brought it on ourselves,’ he said. He also said that the health crisis of Argentine midfielder Jonas Gutierrez, who revealed he is receiving treatment for testicular cancer, put matters into perspective. ‘Sometimes in desperate situations, like Jonas’s illness is, it can bind you together,’ Pardew said. Yet the pre-match talk of the Toon was all about Pardew, mass protests, a dedicated website — SackPardew.com — to have him removed and of threats that 30,000 protest sheets and 100 huge banners would be on display. They were not, in the ground at least. The fans’ reasons for wanting Pardew sacked include ‘increasingly poor results over the past two years’, his ‘deceit and empty promises’, ‘mismanagement of the club and the playing staff’ and ‘his misrepresentation of our hopes and expectations’. Certainly, results have not been good. Since Newcastle beat Hull 4-1 in March in a match remembered for Pardew butting the midfielder, David Meyler, Newcastle have won just two of 15 Premier League games. In 24 league games played in the calendar year, they have failed to score in 15. Newcastle started brightly yesterday and they had the first chance in the fifth minute after Yoan Gouffran’s run and Remy Cabella’s cross led to Emmanuel Riviere’s header, which flew over. Gouffran and Cabella then combined to set up Jack Colback, whose shot was saved, and after a Moussa Sissoko run, Daryl Janmaat crossed from the right to Gouffran, whose header was also saved. The home crowd began to get restless. Early dominance with no end product, allied with errors that were giving Hull chances, made them restless and in the 32nd minute the first loud, concerted chants of ‘We want Pardew out!’ began. Hull increased the tension in the 48th minute thanks to a magnificent finish by Jelavic who leapt into the air and smashed the ball home from 15 yards with his right foot after being fed a ball from his right. ‘We want Pardew out!’ roared the crowd. The Premier League clash was shrouded by a poisonous atmosphere from Newcastle supporters who want manager Alan Pardew (right) sacked .

Hull extended their lead in the 68th minute, courtesy of a second screamer, this one from Diame from 25 yards, that went in off a post. ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning,’ got another rancorous airing. Pardew, however, made what would prove to be a major substitution in the 69th minute, replacing Riviere with Cisse. The sub scored his first goal after a fine pass from Cheik Tiote and his second, with three minutes left of normal time remaining, after a knockdown from Gouffran, . He lifted his shirt to show a message of support — for Gutierrez. Hull manager Steve Bruce bemoaned the lost opportunity of three points away from home. ‘When you’re 2-0 up, it feels like a defeat to draw,’ he admitted. ‘We made terrible mistakes.’ He specified that goalkeeper Allan McGregor’s positioning was poor for Cisse’s first goal. The Scot certainly left a little too much room between himself and a post as Cisse slotted it through the gap. Bruce also said one of his ‘kids’ got ‘caught out’ for the second — a reference to 20-year-old left-back Andrew Robertson failing to mark Gouffran properly with three minutes remaining, allowing the latter a knockdown across goal from a cross, right to the feet to Cisse, who scored. ‘At 2-0 up we should have seen it out,’ said Bruce, whose side also led twice before drawing 2-2 with West Ham last Monday. ‘We’ve been up four times in a week. It could have been a fantastic start to the season for us. Instead, it’s only been a decent one.’ Pardew’s side are no longer bottom, as they were at the start of play, if only because Crystal Palace and West Bromwich did not play.

"Jose Mourinho claims Diego Costa cannot play three games a week for Chelsea because of a hamstring injury he picked up on international duty with Spain. Costa, who scored seven times in his opening four Chelsea games, was forced on to the substitutes bench with the problem ahead of their 1-1 draw with Schalke in the Champions League. Although Mourinho did not go as far as criticising the Spanish national team for their handling of the striker’s delicate muscular issues, he admits they are having to treat him carefully. Jose Mourinho says £32m signing Diego Costa needs a week to recover after matches . Costa was named on the substitutes' bench, along with Loic Remy, as Chelsea drew 1-1 with Schalke . The duo were introduced in the 74th minute in the Champions League game at Stamford Bridge . The Chelsea coach said: ‘He went to the national team in perfect conditions and came back injured. ‘But what happened to Diego happens to many other players in other national teams. I have nothing to say about it. It's just what happens. He played one match and was perfect, then went to the national team, played against France and came back injured.’ Costa came on for the final 17 minutes last night and will start Sunday’s Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City. Mourinho, though, has already ruled him out of next week’s Capital One Cup tie with Bolton art Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho says Costa wasn't in the right condition to play on Wednesday night . Costa struggled with injuries last season with Atletico Madrid . He added: 'Costa has a problem and he can't play in this moment three matches in a week. If he has one week to let the muscle recover, he can start again like he has been since he had that problem with the national team. ‘But three days, after Saturday, is not enough. It was not to protect him for the game for Sunday, but because today he was not in the condition after Saturday. ‘He signed for us and was completely fine. He had a problem again in the national team, not with us. ‘And now we have a problem and now we have to resolve it as best we can. Today he was not in condition to play. Sunday we believe he is. ‘Next week, against Bolton, for sure he isn't. We have to manage the situation until the moment he's completely fine. ‘I don't know (how long that will be). If today he had started the game, for sure he could not play on Sunday. We have to go step by step.’ VIDEO Our plans worked perfectly - Keller .","Mourinho says Costa isn't fit enough to play more than one game a week .

"Angel di Maria scored on his Manchester United home debut as Louis van Gaal's side thrashed QPR 4-0 at Old Trafford. First-half goals from Di Maria, as well as Ander Herrera and Wayne Rooney put the hosts in the ascendancy before Juan Mata added gloss to the scoreline in the second half. Radamel Falcao also came off the bench to make his debut for the Red Devils as they romped to victory over Harry Redknapp's side. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players. Angel Di Maria's free-kick flies into the bottom right corner as Manchester United take the lead against QPR . Manchester United (4-4-2) DAVID DE GEA – First-half mistake nearly proved costly but the Spaniard made amends with a couple of smart saves 6. RAFAEL – The Brazilian looked fired up and determined to prove a point following speculation that he could be on his way 6.5. JONNY EVANS – Far more comfortable in a four-man defence and produced a fantastic block to deny Phillips an open goal in the first half 6.5. TYLER BLACKETT  – Amid the big-money arrivals at United, the homegrown youngster continues to blend in comfortably and capable 6.5. MARCOS ROJO  – Quieter debut at left back than United’s other new boys but dealt with everything that came his way. There will be sterner tests than this 6. Marcos Rojo takes control of the ball for Manchester United during their 4-0 win against QPR . DALEY BLIND  – He prefers a midfield holding role to left back and showed why. Looked comfortable from the start. No fuss, no problem for the Dutchman 7. Daley Blind looks to get Manchester United on the attack during their thrashing of QPR . ANDER HERRERA  – Poor distribution early on but grew into the game and excelled after that, scoring the second and having a hand in the third. 7. Ander Herrera's precise drive doubled Manchester United's lead against QPR . Ander Herrera is understandably delighted after scoring his first Manchester United goal to put them 1-0 up . JUAN MATA  – Some questioned whether he would have a place in the new order, but played well behind the two strikers and weighed in with a goal. 6.5. Juan Mata finishes brilliantly from close range to put Manchester United further ahead . Juan Mata turns away to celebrate after making it 4-0 to Manchester United . ANGEL DI MARIA – Has there been a better home debut at Old Trafford than this since Rooney’s hat-trick against Fenerbahce in 2004? Scored one, had a hand in three more. Outstanding 8.5. Angel di Maria celebrates scoring his first goal for Manchester United on his home debut against QPR . Angel di Maria produced a classy performance on his Manchester United debut against QPR . WAYNE ROONEY – He’s no longer the lone star at United but still showed his worth with a well-taken strike to make it 3-0 and put the game beyond QPR 7. Wayne Rooney fires home emphatically to put Manchester United 3-0 up before half-time . Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring Manchester United's third goal of the game . ROBIN VAN PERSIE  – Still not at the top of his game amid concerns that he might still be hampered by old knee problems. Booked for a poor challenge 5.5 .

QPR (4-3-3) ROB GREEN  – Could possibly have done better with the first goal but couldn’t be faulted for the others and kept the score down 6.5 . MAURICIO ISLA – Had the misfortune to come up against Di Maria on a day when the most expensive player in the history of British football was simply on fire 5 . STEVEN CAULKER  – Tried to stem the tide but wasn’t nearly tight enough on Rooney when he fired in the third goal from the edge of the box 5.5 . RIO FERDINAND – Probably cursing his luck that his return to United didn’t come a couple of weeks earlier. He’s been on the other side of these results enough times at Old Trafford 5.5. Rio Ferdinand endured an unhappy return back at Old Trafford as his QPR side were thrashed . CLINT HILL  – Looked to be struggling in the first half in every sense, and was subbed at the interval 5. SANDRO  – Worked hard in a holding role in front of the back four, but there could have been four of him and they would still have struggled to contain United 6. Sandro had a frustrating debut for QPR as they were thrashed at Manchester United . Sandro's afternoon went from bad to worse as he went off injured on his QPR debut . MATT PHILLIPS – Had the best chance to equalise after De Gea’s error in the first half but didn’t take it and there was only going to be one result after that 6. LEROY FER  – Worked hard in the centre of midfield in very difficult circumstances. They won’t come any harder than this 5.5. NIKO KRANJCAR  – Had a chance to pull a goal back early in the second half but his  effort was well saved by De Gea 6. Niko Kranjcar, seen holding off Ander Herrera, made his first appearance of the season for QPR . JUNIOR HOILETT – Starved of possession and had very little opportunity to make an impact on the game 5.5. CHARLIE AUSTIN  – Thankless task ploughing that lone furrow up front and the former Burnley man was finally given a breather 14 minutes after half-time 6. Charlie Austin struggled to make an impact for QPR in the lone role upfront . VIDEO We were unlucky - Redknapp .

"Alan Hutton insists Roy Keane's passionate personality has been key to Aston Villa's impressive start. The defender believes the Villa assistant has added fire to the dressing room after his summer arrival. Villa are second in the Barclays Premier League and host Arsenal on Saturday after opening their campaign with four unbeaten games. Roy Keane's passion has been key to Aston Villa's excellent start to the season . Keane (R) makes his feelings known during victory over Liverpool in Aston Villa's last game . And right back Hutton, who signed a three-year deal at the club this week, said Keane's famous passion is vital. When asked whether Keane could occasionally be volcanic and whether that was useful Hutton replied: 'I think so, it keeps you on your toes, but you want to perform for yourself. 'You know he'll give you the shot you need to perform and spur you on, it's not a negative thing. 'You just have to look at his career, if there's anything you need to ask he's the man to go to. Just to have a man like that in your corner is unbelievable. 'He's passionate about the game, so if anyone needs to say anything about the game he's the man to do it.' Scotland international Alan Hutton has forced his way back into the reckoning at Villa Park . Christian Benteke (C) trains at Bodymoor Heath as he closes in on a return from injury . Former Manchester United midfielder Keane arrived in July as Paul Lambert's assistant and has also continued in his role as Martin O'Neill's Republic of Ireland No.2. Lambert and Keane had not previously worked together but have been long-term friends and Hutton believes that has helped them to quickly develop a close relationship. 'They have worked unbelievably well together - everything has worked and clicked - I don't see why we can't go from strength to strength in the future,' he said. Keane arrived at the club in the summer and will continue in his role as Martin O'Neill's No 2 for Ireland . 'Roy's done brilliantly for everyone - he's lifted the standard in training and he'll let you know if that standard drops. 'Though there's no doubt who's number one. Everyone knows who the manager is and no one has ever questioned that.'

"Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal's opener - click here for that and more from our Match Zone . Like all great managers, Arsene Wenger is at his best when being written off and bombarded with advice from supporters who should know better. The call from Arsenal fans for the manager to sling out Mesut Ozil had reached fever pitch in the build-up to Saturday's match at Villa Park. So what did Wenger do? He ignored popular opinion, made Ozil the focal point of his team and relegated midfielder Jack Wilshere and the popular striker Alexis Sanchez to the bench. Mesut Ozil evades Philippe Senderos to latch on to Danny Welbeck's pass and score Arsenal's opening goal against Aston Villa .

Wenger admitted that dropping his £42million record buy from Real Madrid — pilloried for his poor showing in Tuesday’s Champions League defeat against Borussia Dortmund — might destroy his fragile confidence. Instead, he moved the 25-year-old into a central position where he could affect play — and Ozil did not let him down with a goal and assist. ‘I didn’t really consider leaving out Ozil,’ said Wenger. ‘I have a lot of attacking players and you are always looking to find the right balance. Alexis Sanchez for example has played every game and I felt he needed a rest. ‘I wanted Ozil to play behind their midfield. It was important for him to find space between the lines and it worked. ‘I felt we were at the point where I had to show confidence in him. You never know how people respond to being left out. It’s a sensitive point.’ Improbable as it sounds, Paul Lambert’s men could have gone top of the table with a victory here, with the only team above them at kick-off, Chelsea, playing Manchester City on Sunday. But Villa’s chances were dealt a cruel blow following a training ground virus which cost them Darren Bent and Nathan Baker in the morning, Ashley Westwood in the pre-match kickabout and Andreas Weimann at half-time. Even at full strength, Villa would have been hard-pressed to stop Ozil in this mood, as he belatedly showed everyone why he has just won a World Cup. The German does not like the rough stuff but, in terms of talent and composure on the ball, he is up there with the best, as his opening goal in the 33rd minute showed. When Welbeck found Ozil on the edge of the box, two shaven-headed Villa players hurtled towards him; goalkeeper Brad Guzan off his line and defender Philippe Senderos from the side.

The completely unflustered No 10 simply looked up and stroked a left-foot finish underneath Guzan’s arm with the nonchalance of someone nipping out to get a pint of milk at the corner shop. A minute later, Ozil turned provider for Welbeck to net his first Arsenal goal. As Wenger pointed out, it was almost a carbon copy of the striker’s close-range effort for England against Switzerland. This time, Ozil played the Wayne Rooney role with a whipped-in cross from the left. Welbeck ran into the six-yard box like a good centre forward and finished with one touch into the roof of the net. The only difference this time was that he made a good connection with the ball rather than the shinned version in Basle. Wenger said: ‘Knowing how people look to see how long it takes a new signing to score, I’m glad he did it now! ‘He was able to score it because of the timing of his run. It was a good all-round performance.’ Poor Villa were shellshocked and rueing two early saves made by Wojciech Szczesny from Fabian Delph and Ciaran Clark while the score was 0-0. Poor Aly Cissokho tried to stop Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from getting on the end of a Kieran Gibbs cross and succeeding only in turning the ball into his own net. Three goals in 192 seconds and the contest was all but over. The second half was akin to a training ground exercise, with Villa not wanting to be slaughtered and Arsenal saving themselves for bigger challenges ahead.

A view from behind as Welbeck steers home Arsenal's second from close range via Guzan's face . Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert will close the club’s Bodymoor Heath training ground for 48 hours after a virus outbreak wrecked preparations for Saturday's match. Nathan Baker, Darren Bent and Ashley Westwood were ruled out beforehand — with Westwood being replaced minutes before kick–off by Carlos Sanchez. Andreas Weimann  was also ill at half-time and replaced by Jack Grealish, while goalkeeper Brad Guzan and Fabian Delph played despite struggling. Lambert said: ‘I don’t feel 100 per cent either. I’ll shut the training ground for a day or two to try and eradicate it.’ ‘It was a response we needed after Tuesday,’ said Wenger, whose side are still unbeaten in the Premier League this season. ‘Villa started well but after that we were in control. We scored three and it was a possession game after that.’ Villa’s tally of two shots on target actually upped their average for the season — their early success has been based on clean sheets. Lambert cited medical problems as a reason why his team did not have more of a go at Arsenal in the second half. ‘The players were running on empty,’ he said. ‘Against a team like Arsenal, you can get beaten by six if you’re not careful. We had to keep confidence intact.’ Villa will close their training ground this week to try and stop the virus spreading and Lambert is keen this heavy defeat does not dent morale after what had been a promising start to the season. ‘We had so much bad luck with all the players and staff having the bug,’ he said. ‘We weren’t the best prepared and we have to look back on a tally of 10 points from our first five games, which is good.’ Then, without a hint of irony, Lambert said about the defeat: ‘We have to take our medicine.’ Wenger has not been beaten at Villa Park for 15 years and he will spend the week mulling over where Ozil should fit in next. ‘He can play anywhere,’ said the Arsenal manager. ‘He likes to be central but you can find 10 players in my squad who like to play in the middle!’ Danny Welbeck scored his first goal for Arsenal from close range after a nice move down the left... for more go to our brilliant Match Zone .

"Ever since the Cardiff Express Gareth Bale pulled out of London and into Madrid, English football’s top division has been bereft of a player with the pace, close control and courage to run with the ball from deep. Now, thanks to Real Madrid and Barcelona deciding they were surplus to requirements, Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez are tearing up the Premier League and terrorising its defences. Sportmail takes a look at what makes Manchester United’s No 7 and Arsenal’s No 17 so unstoppable. Alexis Sanchez (left) and Angel di Maria have injected pace and power into the Premier League . Real Madrid star Gareth Bale (left) has a similar style to the new Premier League recruits . PASSING AND VISION . It’s easier to find space in the Premier League than it is in Spain, where almost all teams have two defensive midfielders shielding the back four and often don’t come out of their own half – particularly if they are playing Real Madrid or Barca. Alexis and Di Maria would have been used to playing tight games against teams camped in and around their own penalty area and neither can probably believe the space they are now finding in England. Cesc Fabregas has spoken about this key difference between La Liga and the Premier League. Sanchez (centre) isn't afraid to run at defenders from deep as he showed against Manchester City . Di Maria will have been used to playing in tight games while at Real Madrid . Manchester United's new signing looks to skip past QPR midfielder Sandro on Sunday . 'In England opponents come chasing you and it is easier to play a quick one-two and go beyond him into space,' he says. 'You can’t do that in Spain where you are likely to be up against two very shrewd defensive midfielders.' Many of the players who move from La Liga to the Premier League talk about the anarchy of English football with the crowd roaring both sides on and players responding by throwing caution to the wind at the expensive of positional discipline. Both Di Maria and Alexis are bound to benefit. Both Sanchez and Di Maria will benefit from finding more space in the Premier League . Angel di Maria (above) made his Premier League debut for Manchester United against Burnley . PACE . It was once said of Lionel Messi that he runs faster with the ball than without it and it is easy to get the same impression watching Di Maria. The run down the left that led to Ander Herrera’s goal on Sunday was reminiscent of Ryan Giggs at his best. Alexis is also bursting with pace although perhaps not the same control over longer distances as the United man. DRIBBLING . Both Sanchez and Di Maria can go past people in tight areas but neither will try to do so if they see a more efficient route to goal via either a shot or a cross. Both players have all the tricks but neither is a showman for the sake of it. The goals and assists statistics from last season prove that – it’s all about end product. The former Barcelona forward looks to get past Frank Lampard (left) on Saturday . SET-PIECES . Did Di Maria over-hit that free-kick? Surely if he had over-hit it, it would have ended up in the seating behind the goal instead of the back of the net. It was a clever delivery perfectly measured to zip over the turf just in that dangerous area between advancing keeper and the back-pedaling defenders; designed to end in the far corner, or if someone got a touch on it, to beat the keeper at his near post. Both these two can score from set-pieces and both will be glad of having moved up the pecking order: Di Maria was behind Sergio Ramos, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bale at Real and Alexis behind Lionel Messi, Neymar and Xavi last season at Barca. Di Maria scored Manchester United's first against QPR on Sunday with a free-kick . Sanchez (right) celebrates scoring Arsenal's second goal against City with a superb volley . END PRODUCT . Sanchez scored 21 goals last season for Barcelona finishing behind only Messi in the scoring stakes. It’s little wonder he has been increasingly used by his country through the middle, although with Arsenal dominating many of the games in which he plays up front means he spends too much time with his back to goal – a monumental waste of his ability to run into space. Wenger seems to have realised that with the purchase of Danny Welbeck. Sanchez (above) has settled in well at Arsenal, scoring three goals so far including this one against Besiktas . KILLER PASS . Di Maria played the final ball in 17 of Real Madrid’s goals last season and created a staggering 91 chances. He topped the assist table in La Liga with Atletico Madrid’s Koke creating 68 chances and Cesc Fabregas, in his final season at Barcelona, 58. Sometimes the assist is unintentional. In the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid last season it was his shot on goal that bobbled up for Bale to head Real Madrid in front. Sanchez also made it into double figures at Barcelona with 10 assists in La Liga. His decision making improved across his three seasons at the Nou Camp and Arsenal can now reap the benefits of that.

"Alan Pardew has revealed the pressure he is under at Newcastle after describing supporter unrest and calls for him to be sacked as ‘mass hysteria’. The 53-year-old is bracing himself for a poisonous atmosphere inside St James’ Park when they take on Hull City on Saturday. ‘This situation at the moment is almost like mass hysteria, to a degree,’ he said. Alan Pardew is expecting a poisonous reception from the fans when Newcastle take on Hull on Saturday . Pardew said Mike Ashley had every right to be disappointed with Newcastle's results as the club's owner . ‘It's really gone to a level which makes it really difficult for players to perform in. The environment for the players will probably be as tough as it’s ever been and we have to accept that. I am hoping we can turn that around. I don't expect the start to be easy.’ He added: ‘I think I am the best person for the job – but I don't think our fans agree with that. ‘It has been suggested that I don’t care about this position, and that I’ve got this long contract and that I’m going through the motions – nothing could be further from the truth. I was absolutely sick after the game on Saturday. I have been hurt this week.’ Sportsmail can reveal that United loanee Hatem Ben Arfa – a fan favourite on Tyneside - WILL be in the visiting dugout, although he is not eligible to play. And Pardew expects to face a difficult afternoon against Hull when supporters are expected to demand his four-year tenure be brought to an end.

The Newcastle supporters have printed thousands of posters with the simple message, 'Sack Pardew' Fans at the 4-0 defeat by Southampton last weekend produced banners calling for Alan Pardew to leave . Pardew met Ashley on Sunday and Sportsmail understands that, while no specific assurances were given over his future, he will be given time to improve results. ‘We didn’t have a conversation regarding my position,’ revealed Pardew. ‘He was upset with the performance and I think he has every right to be that as an owner. I told him some things which I think should be sorted out and some things that can help me. ‘At the end of the day, Mike and myself do not want Newcastle to lose. We want to have the best possible team and we want to win. Now at the moment, of course, we haven’t got that.’ Pardew – who comes up against David Meyler for the first time since headbutting the Hull midfielder in March – has also defended right-hand man Carver following the confrontation with fans at St Mary’s. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has not held talks with Alan Pardew about his positions as manager . Hull's David Meyler and Pardew clash at KC Stadium last season - the incident saw the manager suspended . ‘I hate the fact John got involved in that incident before the game, because he has got black and white blood. Nobody loves this club more than him,’ he said. ‘He’s had more roles at this club more than anyone else probably – academy director, youth team coach, first team coach to Bobby Robson and to me in different eras. That all hurts. ‘Do you think before a game he wants to see the banners going up and negativity towards the team? Of course not. He tried to defend that and has apologised for being slightly aggressive, but that’s all it was.’ Meanwhile, Pardew has paid tribute to Gutierrez who this week revealed he is currently undergoing chemotherapy in Argentina. ‘As a player, the best left side I have had at this club was (Jose) Enrique and Jonas, there is no doubt about that - that was a terrific pairing. When we finished fifth, Jonas was a massive part of that,’ he said. Jonas Guiterrez revealed this week that he is suffering from testicular cancer and is receiving treatment . Alan Pardew was full of praise for Jonas Gutierrez who was 'popular not just on the pitch but also off it' ‘Now he finds himself in a different fight and a different situation. I have to admire the way he has conducted himself. We honoured his decision to keep it quiet until such time he felt comfortable. I am sure people will use this as an example of hopefully how to deal with it. ‘He has been incredibly brave to go on TV and give interviews. Someone will be diagnosed with it in the North East today and it is that common. All our love goes to him and we just send our best wishes. ‘I have not spoken to the squad yet (about it) but I intend to on Friday or Saturday. ‘He was popular not just on the pitch but also off it with his stupid singing and dancing and naked antics up and down the corridor. He is much missed. We send our love.’","Alan Pardew is under pressure at Newcastle after poor start to season .

"Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal's opener - click here for that and more from our Match Zone . A few early-season narratives got ripped to shreds at Villa Park, as Mesut Ozil showed his class, Arsenal displayed their steel, and Aston Villa’s stout defence was breached three times in a devastating spell of 200 seconds. The scoreline shows a chasm between these teams when in reality the match was much closer, but Arsene Wenger’s side ruthlessly exploited their openings to prove a defeat to Borussia Dortmund should not completely colour opinions. Wenger has been forced to defend his record purchase Ozil at various points since his £42.5million transfer from Real Madrid but none more so than in the aftermath to the German’s limp performance in the Westfalenstadion. Mesut Ozil evades Philippe Senderos to latch on to Danny Welbeck's pass and score Arsenal's opening goal against Aston Villa . Welbeck adds to Arsenal's lead a minute later, tapping the ball past Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan from close range for his first Gunners goal .

Subs not used: Ospina, Diaby, Sanchez, Coquelin . Manager: Arsene Wenger 7. Man of the match: Mesut Ozil. Referee: Mike Jones 6 . Attendance: 40,013 . Ozil has been played on the left to limited effect but at Villa Park he was given the vital No 10 role behind Danny Welbeck. Alexis Sanchez never made it off the bench and Aaron Ramsey was deployed alongside Mikel Arteta. For half an hour Ozil was on the fringes of this game; dropping deep to pick up the ball, providing links to attacks that lacked potency as Villa appeared the more threatening team. But as the clock struck 32 minutes he altered the complexion of this match and perhaps how he is viewed by pundits and supporters alike. Escaping his marker and running beyond Philippe Senderos he collected a smart through ball from Welbeck and stroked a finish past Brad Guzan with the composure of someone born to do it. One minute and 20 seconds later he exhibited the creative aspect of his game to hand Welbeck his first Arsenal goal on a plate. The England striker fed Ozil on the left and his cross to the six-yard box was so precise it allowed Welbeck to sprint on to it and drive a shot into the roof of the net without breaking stride. It was his first club goal since netting for Manchester United at West Bromwich Albion in March. Villa Park was reeling. More than 40,000 had turned up off the back of an unbeaten start to this campaign that saw Paul Lambert’s team start this match in second place in the Barclays Premier League. They had kept Liverpool to one shot on target at Anfield and conceded only once in four league games. But soon after they had let in three goals in three minutes and 20 seconds. Kieran Gibbs was allowed too much space on the left and his devilish ball was diverted into his own net by Aly Cissokho with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain lurking behind. A virus had rendered Lambert without Ashley Westwood shortly before kick-off, as well as Nathan Baker, who was replaced by Ciaran Clark in central defence alongside Senderos.

For the opening 30 minutes those absences had not looked like hampering Villa, who began with purpose and energy, twice bringing fine saves from Wojciech Szczesny. Within three minutes of the start the Polish goalkeeper’s poor kick was seized upon by Fabian Delph, who exchanged a one-two with Andi Weimann on the edge of the Arsenal area and struck a well-placed shot to the corner of the goal. But Szczesny dived to push round the post. Not long before Arsenal won this game, Clark had an excellent opportunity to hand his team the lead. Tom Cleverley swung over a deep free-kick and the defender had space at the back post to head home but a star jump save from Szczesny came to Arsenal's rescue again. That was to be as good as it got for Villa, who found out, like most of us, Arsenal are a better team than a bad night in Dortmund would have us believe.

If Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal were left red-faced following their meetings with the Bundesliga’s leading lights, Everton had no such problems at Goodison Park, blitzing Wolfsburg to announce their return to Europe in the grand style. From first whistle to last, Everton impressed, attacking with menace and defending stoically when questions were asked of them. The margin of victory — courtesy of an own goal and strikes from Seamus Coleman, Leighton Baines and Kevin Mirallas — was fitting reward.

Everton remain unbeaten against German sides and that record was never in danger here. Crucially, victory puts them in the driving seat in Group H. Martinez believes his team will thrive in the Europa League and this display supported that view. ‘It was a phenomenal feeling,’ said Martinez. ‘Our work rate was magnificent and we were clinical when it was needed. The teams were evenly matched and maybe the score did not reflect the game but we are delighted. I was so impressed. We looked mature.’ An idea of how much importance Martinez had put on this game came in his team sheet. It has always been his intention to take this tournament seriously and he selected the same team that had beaten West Brom 2-0 at The Hawthorns last Saturday. With a big crowd at Goodison crackling in anticipation – this famous old stadium looked a picture under the floodlights – the stage was set for Everton to deliver and though there were a couple of early, anxious moments, they soon found their stride. Gareth Barry and James McCarthy ensured they had plenty of the ball and soon Everton’s passing and movement started pulling Wolfsburg players out of position; in the 14th minute, a flowing counterattack resulted in them taking the lead, albeit with a hint of good fortune. Naismith started the move, ushering the ball out to Baines, who scampered forward menacingly; he increased the tempo, exchanging a one-two with McCarthy before playing in Naismith. The Scot did the rest, applying the finish via a deflection off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. If his first year at Everton was unremarkable, the past 12 months have been a roaring success and Naismith could comfortably be described as the biggest beneficiary of the Martinez era. He has blossomed from sporadic substitute to regular starter. Commemorative Europa League scarves are displayed for sale outside Goodison Park as Everton make their return to European football .

Naismith celebrates after his first-half effort was deflected in for Everton's opening goal . That goal immediately settled any nerves but it did not necessarily mean Everton had things all their own way. Wolfsburg have quality and they tried to cause problems, not least through the former Chelsea winger Kevin de Bruyne. Everton, however, got their tails up and key men started ticking. Mirallas and Baines, especially, had an influence and those two were heavily involved as they got the goal on the stroke of half-time that provided a crucial buffer. Mirallas seized possession on the edge of the area and Benaglio could not deal with his dipping shot, parrying it only as far as Baines, who had followed in. His cross-cum-shot skidded off the floor and Coleman applied the finishing touch, heading in unmarked from four yards. On the touchline, Martinez celebrated in his usual manner, punching the air with one arm, the other folded around his waist, and smiling broadly. It was a big moment in this game.

Mirallas broke away late in the game to score Everton's fourth goal before Rodriguez netted a consolation free kick . Immediately after the restart, the hosts had extinguished any hope of a comeback. When Robin Knoche dithered, Aidan McGeady darted forward but his run was crudely halted by Knoche and, after some deliberation – the initial foul looked outside the area – a penalty was awarded. Up stepped Baines and he took his record to 18 successful conversions from 19 penalties when sending Benaglio the wrong way and Mirallas completed the demolition in the final minute, when he raced on to pass from substitute Darron Gibson. ‘The environment was incredible,' said Martinez. ‘We had a bit of everything, we were well organised, we carried a good threat. We have had some magnificent tests so far and we have a great platform to build on.’ Though Ricardo Rodriguez scored a consolation with a thumping free-kick, the mood could not be altered. Goodison revelled at being back on this stage.","Everton defeated Wolfsburg 4-1 in their opening Europa League game at Goodison Park .

"This is the panoramic view of the skyline of Kobane showing just how close Islamic State fighters have come towards taking control of the Syrian border town. ISIS flags can be seen fluttering on the hill near to where militants are gathered, just yards from Kurdish forces with reports that the terror group are pouring in reinforcements in their bid to cause Kobane to fall. The image also shows the exact area targeted by US-led coalition airstrikes and how close the fighting has moved towards the Syrian Turkey border, where Turkish forces are stationed but refuse to intervene. Scroll down for video . The hill overlooking the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane, where ISIS flags have been raised as they close in on taking control . The central area of the town where ISIS militants have advanced to despite battling US-led airstrikes and Kurdish forces . The frontline of the battle lies right next to Syria's border with Turkey, where Turkish forces are stationed but despite their proximity, they refuse to intervene . Smoke rises after an air strike on the Syrian town of Kobane as seen from the Turkish border, with a Turkish military vehicle pictured in the foreground . Thick smoke, debris and fire could be seen rising over the Syrian town of Kobane as fighting intensified between Syrian Kurds and ISIS . ISIS is said to have sustained serious losses in the battle for the town despite their superior armour with 36 of its fighters killed . The UN has warned that if Kobane were to fall to ISIS, thousands of civilians living there are at risk of massacre . It was revealed today that Kurdish forces have kept up their high-profile resistance in keeping ISIS militants away from the centre of Kobane and halted their advance. It comes after the ISIS capture of the Kurdish command headquarters in Kobane on Friday failed to deliver a decisive blow and claims the terror group are sending additional forces to the area from other areas they control in Syria including Raqqa. Rami Abdel Rahman from the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights explained: 'They are sending fighters without much combat experience. 'They are attacking on multiple fronts but they keep being repulsed, then countering and being pushed back again. 'It's a decisive battle for them. Kurdish forces from the People's Protection Unit can be seen walking in a line through Kobane after holding back ISIS fighters . The newly arrived fighters can be seen crouching down behind a wall and waiting in the deserted streets of Kobane today . 'If they don't pull it off, it will damage their image among jihadists around the world.' Today the town has been described as relatively quiet apart from some sniper fire. Farhad Shami, a Kurdish activist confirmed that ISIS fighters launched an offensive south of the town on Saturday but were repelled and lost many fighters. He said: 'There are large numbers of dead fighters for Daesh (ISIS) who were either killed by the People’s Protection Units or the (coalition) airstrikes. He added that Kurdish fighters also were able to regain the border village of Tel Shair west of Kobane, although the jihadists still control more than a third of the town. The blockage on the ISIS advance on Kobane comes amid warnings by the UN that thousands of civilians in the town risk massacre if it falls. If ISIS do take the town, they will control territory abutting Turkey to the gates of Baghdad, some 450 miles slicing across Syria and Iraq. The main Kurdish armed group, the YPG, said in a statement the airstrikes had inflicted heavy losses on Islamic State, but had been less effective in the last two days. Through the haze, the embattled town of Kobane can be seen today after airstrikes by US-led coalition forces yesterday .

Shelling continued in Kobane today although Kurdish fighters have described it as fairly quiet apart from the sound of sniper fire . The blockage on the ISIS advance on Kobane, pictured, comes amid warnings by the UN that thousands of civilians in the town risk massacre if it falls . A Kurdish military official said street-to-street fighting was making it harder for the warplanes to target Islamic State positions. 'We have a problem, which is the war between houses,' said Esmat Al-Sheikh, head of the Kobane defence council. 'The air strikes are benefiting us, but Islamic State is bringing tanks and artillery from the east. We didn't see them with tanks, but yesterday we saw T-57 tanks,' he added. While ISIS has been able to reinforce its fighters, the Kurds have not. ISIS has besieged the town to the east, south and west, meaning the Kurds' only possible supply route is the Turkish border to the north. Small groups of Kurdish fighters were trying to harry the encircling jihadists with operations across the front line. Turkey has tightened security of its porous border after the fighting in Kobane sparked the exodus of 200,000 refugees over the frontier. It has been deeply reluctant to allow weapons or Kurdish fighters to cross the border despite repeated nights of protests among its own large Kurdish minority that have left 31 people dead. Reacting to the 31 deaths in Turkey, senior PKK figure Cemil Bayik said the group had called its fighters back to Turkey from bases in Iraq and could resume attacks, threatening a fragile peace process. US-led coalition air strikes against ISIS have intensified but the Pentagon says there are limits to what can be done without ground troops . A map showing how ISIS have launched a three pronged attack on the town of Kobane. Today, it has been reported Kurdish forces have managed to hold back the militants . 'We have warned Turkey. If the state carries on like this then the guerrillas will resume the war of defence in order to protect the people,' Bayik told German broadcaster ARD in an interview recorded in Iraq. But Turkey's foreign minister said on Sunday that a corridor allowing weapons and volunteer fighters from Turkey to reach Kobani, the Syrian border town under attack from Islamic State fighters, was unrealistic. Speaking to France 24, Mevlut Cavusoglu said a more comprehensive approach was needed to defeat Islamic State, which now control large parts of Iraq and Syria and have been targeted by air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition. But in an interview posted on the France 24 website, Mr Cavuoglu said: 'Turkey cannot actually give weapons and the civilians and ask to go back to fight with terrorist groups. 'This (corridor) is not realistic. Who is going to supply the weapons today? First of all sending civilians to the war is a crime. Meanwhile, US-led coalition warplanes launched two air strikes against ISIS targets south and east of town early on Saturday according to the Observatory. They added that a sandstorm later prevented more air raids, while fighting raged in southern Kobane and near the captured headquarters. The coalition has intensified air strikes against ISIS, which began its assault on September 16, but the Pentagon says there are limits to what can be done without ground troops.

A Turkish Kurd on the Turkey Syria border stands behind a wall as fighting between ISIS militants and Kurdish forces continues . Today U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel has said that the embattled Syrian town of Kobane was a very difficult problem but added that air strikes had made some progress. 'We are doing what we can do through our air strikes to help drive back ISIL. In fact there has been some progress made in hat area,' Hagel told a news conference in Santiago, the Chilean capital. 'It is a very difficult problem. The U.S.-led coalition escalated air strikes on Islamic State in and around Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, some four days ago. Hagel underscored that the battle against the militants, who have seized swathes of Iraq and Syria, was a long-term fight. 'It is a long-term effort. This is difficult, it is complicated. It's going to require many factors. And we are working now (with) coalition partners,' he said. Turkish armoured vehicles were also spotted patrol the border near Kobane, with some Kurds furious that Turkey has not intervened in the crisis . The Syrian Observatory on Human Rights say at least 554 people have been killed in and around Kobane since the ISIS advance . Asked about the situation in Iraq, Hagel said Iraqi security forces were in full control of Baghdad and continue to strengthen their positions there. 'We continue to help them with air strikes, with our assistance and advisors.' Meanwhile the U.S. has also been speaking with Turkish officials about increasing their own efforts to equip and train opposition fighters in Syria and U.S. Central Command and European Command will travel to Turkey this week to meet with officials there and discuss the different ways Turkey can contribute. Today, a Turkish government official confirmed that Turkey has agreed with the U.S. to train 4,000 Syrian opposition fighters. The official said the fighters would be vetted by Turkish intelligence.","Islamic State are thought to have sustained serious losses despite their superior armour in battle for Kobane .

"Ryan Sidebottom ripped through the Nottinghamshire lower order to secure Yorkshire the County Championship for the first time in 13 years. The former England fast bowler took four wickets on the final morning at Trent Bridge to bowl Nottinghamshire out for 177 and seal a win for Yorkshire by an innings and 152 runs. James Taylor, who aside from a first innings duck has been in superb form recently, made a resolute 75, but wickets tumbled around him and the 36-year-old Sidebottom eventually removed him to make certain of the Championship title with a game to spare. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire highlights . Joe Root, captaining Yorkshire in the absence of Andrew Gale, lifts the Championship trophy . The players go into a celebratory huddle after Sidebottom removed James Taylor to seal the title . It is Sidebottom's fourth title, his second with his home county, following their last success in 2001, and Yorkshire's 32nd. His other two successes came with opponents Nottinghamshire before he returned north. The white rose emphasised their dominance of this year's competition, as they took charge of this match against their closest challengers Notts from the very first session. A century from Adam Lyth, as part of an opening partnership of 176 with Alex Lees set the tone, and after amassing 532/9 declared, the pace attack set about dismantling the hosts. Jonny Bairstow (centre) Adam Lyth (left) and Ryan Sidebottom rush to grab a stump at the end of the game . Ryan Sidebottom bowled beautifully to end with figures of 6-30 and win the game, and the title, for Yorkshire . Sidebottom and Josh Brooks shared seven wickets in the first innings, and eight in the second to win the game by an innings. Brooks described the title win as 'the best day of his life' while Sidebottom failed to hold back the tears during the celebrations. The shaggy-haired left-armer showed his enduring quality on the final morning, first swinging a ball through Gary Keedy's defenses and then having Chris Read caught behind with a jaffa of a delivery. Luke Fletcher edged to second slip and then, after Adil Rashid's leg spin had removed Jake Ball, Sidebottom rounded of the game, and the season, with the wicket of Taylor. Sidebottom celebrates removing Chris Read with a beauty which gave the Notts keeper no chance . Former Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie (r) will take credit for the excellent season Yorkshire have had . If the shot which finally brought an end to Taylor's innings, a wild swipe which looped to gully, was out of keeping with his current form, the bowling performance was completely typical of Sidebottom's, and Yorkshire's season. Under Jason Gillespie's leadership the county have lost just once this season, winning eight of their 15 first class matches this season. In fact, since the former Australian fast bowler joined in 2012, Yorkshire have lost just three times. They lead the table by 47 points with just one game remaining, and even with games in hand neither Somerset nor Warwickshire can catch them up. England batsman Joe Root was leading Yorkshire in the absence of club captain Andrew Gale, banned by the England and Wales Cricket Board for this match and the last one of the summer in two weeks' time after his on-field spat with Lancashire's Ashwell Prince at Old Trafford. Root, 23, has had many highlights for his country already - but this achievement is still one he will never forget. 'This is obviously very special ... to get this opportunity is very memorable,' he said. Josh Brooks celebrates a wicket on the third day - the fast bowler has taken 67 first class wickets this season . Adam Lyth set the platform for victory with a brilliant century on day one, and Yorkshire never looked back . VIDEO Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire - Day 3 . 'I didn't expect to captain the side. 'But unfortunately it came about, in bad circumstances, and it's credit to Galey that the way he has captained the side made it very easy for me this week. 'For a big club like us not to have won anything for such a long period of time is obviously very frustrating. 'I think the lads deserved it - they have played exceptionally well all year in all departments. 'The guys put in some great performances with bat and ball - which meant they captained themselves - and I only had to do tinkerings here and there.' Permanent captain Gale had to watch the celebrations from the side before eventually being able to lift the trophy, and wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow said it took a gloss off the win. 'I'm absolutely gutted for Andrew, not being able to be on the pitch with us at those final moments, because he's been such a crucial part in what's been a fantastic season for Yorkshire,' said Bairstow. Andrew Gale, banned for the final two matches of the season, comes onto the pitch to lift the cup . 'To drop himself at the start of the season at Middlesex shows the integrity of the bloke and shows how much the county means to him. 'It was a real big team performance today and something we really wanted to do for Galey being sat up there. He's a very proud man and for him not to be on the pitch with us was desperately disappointing. 'It's definitely not soured it but it's still disappointing to find out the day after it happened that all of a sudden he's banned. 'It's the fastest thing that I've ever heard of and we're all disappointed as a club that there wasn't a longer time taken to look into it perhaps. But that's the way that things have panned out. 'We've moved on from that, taken it on the chin and come here and put on a fantastic display.'","Ryan Sidebottom takes six wickets to secure title with a game to spare .

"The spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone this summer stemmed from one traditional healer’s funeral where 14 women were infected, experts have claimed. Scientists have studied the blood of recent victims and believe the funeral, in mid-May might have acted as a ‘super-spreader’ event. They say this is comparable to a case in 2003 in a hotel in Hong Kong where one doctor from China who had SARS infected nine other guests. These in turn spread the virus within the city and to other countries such as Canada and Vietnam. Scroll down for video . Scientists sequenced the virus found in 78 patients treated in the Kenema Government Hospital, pictured, in northern Sierra Leone close to the borders with Guinea and Liberia . The New York Times reports that the funeral took place in the diamond-mining community of Koindu. This lies near Guéckédou in neighbouring Guinea where the outbreak is believed to have started in December. The newspaper reports that the healer was known for treating a ‘mysterious illness’ which then turned out to be Ebola. Although this had already been the suspected cause, the New York Times reports that it was confirmed by geneticists at the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard. They are understood to have sequenced the virus found in 78 patients treated in the Kenema Government Hospital in northern Sierra Leone close to the borders with Guinea and Liberia. The research was published in the journal Science. The spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone this summer stemmed from one traditional healer’s funeral where 14 women were infected, experts have claimed . The New York Times reports Dr W. Ian Lipkin from Columbia University as saying: ‘It’s frightening that a single event could catalyse a whole outbreak, but that’s what it looks like happened. He added that the research was a ‘really nice piece of work’. Experts also discovered that the West African strain of Ebola was different from the one that has been circulating in Central Africa, thousands of miles away, since the mid 1970s. But the newspaper reports that the two ‘probably diverged as far back as 2004’. The study’s co-author Dr Pardi C. Sabeti, a geneticist at Harvard, said in that time it may have been circulating in forest animals including bats and apes. But she added that ‘it could have been circulating in humans for 10 years with little or no notice.’ As of August 26, 422 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone while the outbreak has claimed the lives of 1,552 people across West Africa . Scientists say the research is helpful as tests to diagnose Ebola and vaccines being considered are based on the Central African strain. It means a current diagnostic test may not provide a clear positive if a patient had a ‘low viral load’ in the early stages of an infection, the newspaper reports. The news comes a day after it was revealed that Ebola had spread to a fifth nation in West Africa. A case of the deadly virus has been reported in Senegal, making it the first time a new country has been hit by the outbreak since July. As of August 26, 1,552 people had been confirmed dead from Ebola in four countries - Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. Liberia was the worst affected with 694 deaths; 422 people have died in Sierra Leone; and 430 in Guinea, where the virus emerged at the start of the year. Nigeria has now recorded six deaths.","Experts believe spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone came from one funeral .

Rodgers, however, has made it clear that it is going to take time for Balotelli to fit into Liverpool’s style of play and if the Italy international is to have the same kind of impact as Suarez, he is going to have to show the Uruguayan’s willingness to put in the hard yards. Balotelli will retain his place for Saturday’s trip to West Ham, as Rodgers feels ‘perseverance’ is going to be required as the 24-year-old adjusts, but he has been reminded that the art of being a successful Liverpool striker comes from the work they do without the ball. ‘Mario is a boy who has really looked into the history of the club,’ said Rodgers. ‘He understands the great strikers of the past. We’ve spoken about Suarez and his time here but if you’re clever you’ll remember he’s still young and still learning the game and he still has this hunger to do well. Striker Balotelli has been told he must work hard to be a success at Liverpool . ‘He’ll get fitter and the idea is to persist with him. He’s a good reference for us and he’s improving with each time he trains and plays. It was a brilliant finish and that was exactly what we needed at that time – that bit of genuine Champions League class and he showed that. ‘You saw his work rate. He’s put his body on the line and he needs to do more of that but I think that will come as he gets fitter. But he’s well in tune with the history of the club. I think you can see what he’s trying to put in for the team. That’s going to be very important. ‘The crowd demand that as the players who’ve been here in the past in that position have been non-stop and he’s becoming attuned to that. He’s aware of the demands and it’s going to take time but if he continues to score goals and work hard, he will be fine as he has got the quality.’ Daniel Sturridge has stepped up his rehabilitation from the thigh problem he sustained training with England a fortnight ago and could be fit to face Everton on Saturday week, if there are no complications. Until then, the onus will be on Balotelli to deliver but Jordan Henderson, Liverpool’s new vice-captain, is confident he will cope with the expectation. ‘I thought his finish was outstanding,’ said Henderson. ‘Mario led the line and held it up well. He had a couple of chances here and there and hopefully that goal will kick him on now and he will get plenty more.’ Luis Suarez was willing to put in the hard yards to be a success at Anfield .","Mario Balotelli scored the first goal of his Liverpool career in the 2-1 Champions League success over FC Ludogorets .

"Angel Di Maria left Switzerland full-back Ricardo Rodriguez on the floor with a fleet-footed piece of skill on the right flank and burst to the byline, with five Argentina team-mates waiting in the box for that killer cross. Then, with no-one around him and time to pick out a man, he went for an unnecessary, extravagant rabona pass. As his left boot wrapped around the outside of his right, the ball skewed off the pitch. Another chance wasted, an opportunity gone. His team-mates looked away. It just about summed up Di Maria's match. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jamie Redknapp show Angel Di Maria a proper rabona pass . Fluke? Angel Di Maria went for an unnecessary rabona pass and it failed to come off - a trend of his game . Frustrated: Di Maria's performance was well below par despite winning the match for Argentina in added time . 51 - Di Maria gave the ball away 51 times . 4 - Just four crosses were good out of 19 tries . 63 - His pass completion was at 63 per . cent, the worst of any outfield player to start and the worst of any . player in the tournament who has played 40 minutes or more . 12 - He had 12 shots, three were on target . The Real Madrid attacking midfielder may well be remembered for scoring the decisive goal against Switzerland, finishing off Lionel Messi's clever run through the middle with a low shot into the bottom left corner to send his side through to the quarter-finals, but his will go down as one of the worst match-winning performances in history. Di Maria gave the ball away 51 times. He struck 19 crosses and only four of them were any good. His pass completion was down at 63 per cent, the worst of any outfield player to start the game and the worst of any player in the tournament who has played more than 40 minutes of a match. 'I suppose that's what this World Cup is about, the worst player on the pitch scores the winning goal,' Alan Hansen said afterwards on the BBC. 'He was lucky to still be on there when he scored as he had played so badly. 'He only lost the ball 51 times? That's amazing, I thought he lost it more than that.' Alan Shearer . further twisted the knife, adding: 'He gave it away so many times, . whether it was on the left-hand side, whether it was on the right-hand . side, whether he was coming down the middle. 'He lost possession so many times trying to whip balls in and constantly hitting the front man.' Difference: Di Maria touched the ball plenty (right) but his completed passes were few and far between . Heat map: Di Maria was all over the place and gave the ball away a staggering 51 times . Chase: Di Maria runs with the ball as Granit Xhaka tries to stop him near the touchline . Di Maria's passes were intercepted – short ones, long ones, mid-distance ones; high ones, low ones. His crosses were cut out, or headed away. His runs mainly ended at the first man. The astonishingly bad level of his performance was the antithesis of his incredibly high tenacity to keep going and going and going. He struck 12 shots during the game, even though only three of those landed on target. Lionel Messi, who admittedly had a poorer game than his usual standard, must've wondered what he had to do to help his team through after creating eight goal-scoring chances in the match before Di Maria finally converted one of them in extra-time. Di Maria has missed just one minute so far of Argentina's World Cup campaign, coming off in the final minute of their 1-0 win against Iran in the group stage. Their last-16 game on Tuesday was the one blip in an otherwise solid tournament from the 26-year-old. Although, like the rest of his Argentina team-mates, he has been bailed out by Messi on too many occasions. But regardless of all the damning statistics and the armchair critics, Shearer summed it up succinctly: . 'You know what? No-one will remember that whatsoever. They'll remember that one piece of magic that got them through to the quarter-finals, that's what people will remember.' Drama: Di Maria celebrates netting his last-minute goal in extra-time for Argentina . Embrace: Lionel Messi was the architect of the goal as he set Di Maria up to score the winner .

"Another woman has come forward to claim that she was drugged and raped by Bill Cosby. Therese Serignese, of Boca Raton, Florida, says in a new interview that when she was just 19-years-old Cosby gave her some pills after a show in Las Vegas, and she later came to and found the actor having sex with her. This as Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, has revealed that Cosby tried to sexually assault her at a party when she was just a teenager. Scroll down for video . Victim: Therese Serginese (above) is the fourth woman to come forward to claim she was drugged and raped by Bill Cosby . Same story: Serignese says Cosby (above) gave her pills when she was just a teenager at his show in Las Vegas, and that he was having sex with her when she came to . Lines up: Serignese's story of being a teen when she was drugged and raped by Cosby is very similar to the stories told by two of his recent accusers . Serginese met Cosby in 1976 before he was set to perform a standup set at the Hilton in Las Vegas. Cosby offered the teenager a ticket, and later invited her to the afterparty. Then, he offered her some pills. 'I took them, didn't know what they were didn't even ask. I just was intimidated I guess and I took them,' Serignese told WPTV. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis -  Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. 'Then my next memory is feeling drugged and him having sex with me.' Despite this, she ended up staying with Cosby, living in his penthouse for weeks, but eventually she moved out and later married. She did however take up Cosby on his promise to pay her $500 if she went to school and earned good grades. After attending nursing school, and doing well, she got word to go down to Western Union. In the end, she got $10,000 from Cosby. That did not change what happened however, and Serginese was one of the woman who came forward after another woman publicly detailed what happened to her, claiming that she too was drugged and raped by Cosby . That is when Serignese became Jane Doe 10 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. In the end 13 woman would come forward to make similar claims in the trial, though the statue of limitations had run out on their own cases. That case was eventually settled out of court. Now, Serignese has a message for Cosby. 'I'm gonna say to Bill Cosby. You do owe me an explanation for why you did this to me,' she says. 'I want an apology. I want you to apologize for hurting me. I want you to apologize for taking advantage of me.' Being heard: Serignese says she wants to make sure Cosby knows what he does was not acceptable . He responds: This as Cosby has recently said he has 'no comment' about recent rape allegations . Meanwhile, Carla Ferrigno has become the most recent woman to claim that she was almost sexually assaulted by the star, saying the event happened at a party in 1967. In an interview on the John and Ken Show, Carla says Cosby lunged at her and forcefully kissed her at a party when she was just a teenager - and his wife was home. Speaking with MailOnline after the interview, she said, 'I feel so bad for these women. I was the lucky one.' She added, 'I mean ""lucky"" in that he didn't harm me. It harmed me emotionally all my life but he didn't physically harm me.' Another victim: Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou (above) also said on Wednesday that Cosby tried to sexually assault her in 1967, when she was just a teenager . Showing support: Actor Stacey Dash tweeted her support for Cosby on Wednesday . Carla would go on to marry Lou in 1980, and said she did not even share this story with him until five years ago. Also on Wednesday, actor Stacey Dash showed her support for Cosby, tweeting that he never assaulted her when they worked together, and that he was a mentor to her. Meanwhile, Cosby finally gave some response to these recent allegations in an interview with the AP on November 6, saying he had 'no response' and 'no comment.' With his wife Camille by his side, he then asked that that section of the interview not be shown. Prior to Serignese's claims, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and supermodel Janice Dickinson all came forward in the past few weeks to publicly say they were drugged and raped by Cosby. Cosby has never been convicted on any of these charges. These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star. Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations. TV Land has also stopped airing repeats of The Cosby Show.","Therese Serignese has become the fourth woman in the past month to come forward and say she was drugged and raped by Bill Cosby .

"The lions sit dazed in the shade of their damaged pen, while nearby the decayed carcasses of two vervet monkeys lie contorted on the grass of a Gaza zoo. The animals were caught in the crossfire of fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants that has killed more than 1,960 Palestinians and 67 people on the Israeli side. In one enclosure  a fly-covered pelican huddles in the corner with a duck. Opposite, a small crocodile sits motionless in an inch of stagnant water, next to the rotting corpse of a stork. A gazelle shares another pen with a goose. The shattered pride of Gaza: A lion and lioness look on from inside their cage at the Bisan City tourist village zoo, in Beit Hanun, Gaza. The zoo was built by the Hamas government in 2008. Now debris and dead animals lie strewn around, and the remains of militant rocket launchers lie nearby . Farid al-Hissi feeds the lioness and the lion in their cage. The animals were caught in the crossfire in over a month of fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants . Around the corner, a baboon picks listlessly at the ground of the tiny pen it shares with the dried-out remains of another monkey. Everywhere, there is a sickly stench from the animals' cages, which have not been cleaned for weeks. Shadi Hamad, the park's director, said the zoo was damaged and that the animals died as a result of Israeli air strikes. An Israeli army spokesman told AFP that the military was looking into allegations that it fired missiles in the Al-Bisan park area. Israel launched an air campaign over Gaza on July 8 to take out militants' rockets, followed by a ground offensive nine days later to destroy a network of Hamas cross-border tunnels leading into the Jewish state. The zoo - part of Al-Bisan City - was built by the Hamas government in 2008 as a tourist village to give Gazans some relief from the hardships of life in the Strip, and had a cafeteria and tables where families could sit and relax. Love: Farid al-Hissi scratches the neck of the lioness. He said the zoo was 'very beautiful' before the hostilities started . Caged: The lion's enclosure was wrecked and the zoo was completely destroyed, according to one of the zookeepers . Victims: A lion and lioness in a steel pen inside their enclosure, the roof of which has collapsed from the force of the nearby explosion . The animals were all smuggled through tunnels that connected Egypt to Gaza, before the passages were shut last year with the ouster of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, a key ally of the Islamist movement Hamas. Now, Al-Bisan is far from relaxing, with the wire of its enclosures twisted and crushed, debris and dead animals strewn around, and the remains of militant rocket launchers lying nearby. 'Before the war the area was very beautiful. There were trees, lots of greenery, palm trees. It was an area for children, there were playgrounds and areas for families,' zookeeper Farid al-Hissi said. Hissi got his job at Al-Bisan after working in a zoo in Israel and because of his love for animals. The death of the animals he cared for has clearly left him in a state of shock. 'Eight monkeys were killed, and an ostrich was killed too. The lion's enclosure was wrecked and the zoo was completely destroyed. The Al-Bisan zoo was totally devastated,' he said. Grim: A Hamadryas baboon stares at the carcass of another baboon inside their cage. The stench in the zoo is overpowering . Bizarre cell-mates: A gazelle shares a pen with a goose. The animals were all smuggled through tunnels that connected Egypt to Gaza . Birds of prey  inside their cage at the Bisan City tourist village zoo. 'When the birds heard the shelling they would take flight and flap around the enclosure in panic because they were so scared,' said Aamir Abu Warda, director of the Jabaliya park. An Israeli army spokesman told AFP that the military was looking into allegations that it fired missiles in the Al-Bisan park area . The administrative centre has been flattened and some of the palm trees lining the avenue from the entrance down to the animal enclosures have been uprooted. The destruction to the zoo has shaken Hissi badly. 'You can see that the cages for the animals are badly damaged. When you see it, it makes you sad because they are in a jail now,' he said, standing by the lion enclosure. A lion and lioness lie in a steel pen inside their enclosure, the roof of which has collapsed from the force of the nearby explosion. They make little noise, standing only when Hissi tosses in a couple of dead chickens. And in a filthy three-by-three metre (10-by-10 foot) pen, seven mange-ridden wild dogs zig zag around their enclosure incessantly. Hissi was insistent there had been no militant weapons inside the zoo. Hissi got his job at Al-Bisan after working in a zoo in Israel and because of his love for animals. The death of those he cared for has clearly left him in a state of shock . Devastation: A general view of the animal cages at the zoo, twisted and ripped from Israeli bombardment . But buckled rectangular metal rocket launch systems lay among the debris on the edge of the park, near a large building that was also hit by Israeli air strikes. Some appeared still to be loaded with rockets. Hamad, the park's director, was adamant that the rockets had not been fired from inside the park. 'Maybe there was a base around Al-Bisan village or next to it. But the enemy decided and insisted on punishing Al-Bisan village,' said the  director. 'They punished the park for the presence of the rockets nearby, but not inside, the village,' he said. The Jabaliya area north of Gaza City is home to the Strip's second park, the Jabaliya Zoo, which escaped major damage. Completed just six months ago, the park's exhibits range from pigeons and a German Shepherd in cages to six lions. All were smuggled through tunnels from Egypt. Although the park in Jabaliya was relatively unscathed, bombardment had impacted on the animals psychologically. 'It was the noise that really affected the animals here. The sound from the bombing terrified the animals. When the birds heard the shelling they would take flight and flap around the enclosure in panic because they were so scared,' said Aamir Abu Warda, director of the Jabaliya park. 'The continuation, the repetition of this killed several birds, and other animals abandoned their young ones, some of which died,' he said. Palestinian protesters hurl stones at Israeli soldiers during clashes at Bet Forik checkpoint near the West Bank city of Nablus. According to reports, 30 Palestinians were injured in the clashes during a protest against Israel attacks to Gaza strip . Rooms are seen in a damaged home early morning in the Shejaia neighborhood of Gaza City.

"Somalian teenager Islam Feruz sensationally has turned his back on Scotland – earning a sharp rebuke from the man whose rule change fast-tracked the former Celtic striker into the international game. Chelsea kid Feruz has been tipped for the top and, having featured for Scotland at Under-17 and Under-21 level, was to be a key player in the UEFA Under-19 elite round qualifiers starting in England tomorrow. But the 18-year-old, who hasn’t featured for his adopted nation since a 6-0 hammering by England Under-21s in Sheffield last August, withdrew with a mystery injury – despite starring in last week’s Under-21 Premier League Final win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Snub: Chelsea teenager Islam Feruz has turned his back on playing for Scotland . Hope: Many behind the scenes believed that he could take Scottish football by storm . The SFA have repeatedly pleaded with Feruz, whose family arrived in Glasgow via Yemen as refugees when he was just 10, to turn up to squad after squad – but he has made it clear that he’s not interested. His decision to quit Scotland will come as no surprise to anyone at Celtic, with Feruz’s departure to Chelsea in 2011 still a source of some rancour – especially as the late Tommy Burns had spoken on behalf of the Feruz family when they were threatened with deportation. And the man whose foresight allowed Feruz into the Scottish international set-up believes the forward has been guilty of an equally poor attitude by ditching his adopted nation. As SFA chief executive, Gordon Smith pushed through a change allowing youngsters who had gone through a country’s education system to represent their adopted nation. Smith told Sportsmail that he was saddened – but not surprised – to learn of Feruz’s decision, saying: ‘He is a real talent, of that there is no doubt. There’s a reason he was capped at age groups several steps beyond his actual years – he is a great talent. ‘But I . felt his attitude was wrong when he left Celtic, to be honest. Celtic . did a lot for him, helped his family, helped him enormously. ‘I . felt it was a slap in the face, leaving Celtic the way he did and . throwing in his lot with Chelsea. I was personally disappointed with . that, because I thought he should have shown more loyalty. ‘With . that in mind, I’m not really surprised that he’s done the same thing to . Scotland – although I find it hard to understand why he’s done it. Dejected: SFA Chief Gordon Smith changed the rules to allow Feruz to play for Scotland in the first place . Composed: Feruz had been likened in some quarters to Brazil legend Romario . Under-16: 3 caps; 1 goalUnder-17: 18 caps; 7 goalsUnder-19: 5 caps; 3 goalsUnder-20: 1 cap; 0 goalsUnder-21: 4 caps; 2 goals . ‘Just like Celtic did a lot for him, Scotland did a great deal for him and his family. On a football level, we gave him an opportunity to express himself in international football, getting great experience and benefiting his career prospects enormously. 'You can’t tell me it didn’t help him. On top of that, his family came to Scotland as refugees and were treated well. ‘If he doesn’t want to play for Scotland, well, you just have to accept it. The one thing you need at international level is motivation on the part of the individual. ‘People have to be fired up and want to play for their country, to feel pride in the jersey – to feel like they belong to the country and have a stake in its success. ‘If you’ve got someone - like Islam Feruz – who doesn’t want to play for Scotland, the only option is to reject him immediately. If he cannot commit to playing for this country, we shouldn’t have anything to do with him. ‘I don’t know what he is thinking now because, under the rules, he cannot play for any other Home Nation, so it’s not as if he can play for England.’ Smith said that Feruz was never the driving force for the rule change, insisting: ‘His name was put forward when the rules were being changed – him and Andy Driver at Hearts. ‘But the rules weren’t changed for the benefit of any particular player, people just mentioned both of these guys as potential early beneficiaries of any change. ‘I had nobody in mind at all. We just took the decision, the four Home Nations, that we would not comply with the rules making it easy to change nationalities just like that. ‘Were collectively keen to stick to the restrictions on eligibility – parents, grandparents or being born in the country. ‘But I felt that it would be only fair to a kid whose family had settled here that they should be allowed to play for Scotland. If they had gone through the education system because they’d emigrated here, and if they held a British passport, I thought we should be free to consider them. ‘So I put the new rule together and put it before the three other Home Nations, who agreed, then we got it past FIFA.’ Mover: The teenager moved from Celtic  to Chelsea in 2012 .

Capped for the Under-17s at the age of 14 and Scotland’s youngest ever Under-21 cap while just 16, Feruz was likened to a young Romario by SFA performance director Mark Wotte. Instead of turning out for Ricky Sbragia’s young squad in qualifiers against England, Ukraine and Montenegro, he will be in Hong Kong to represent Chelsea at HKFC Citibank Soccer Sevens. SFA chiefs insist the door is still open for Feruz if he changes his mind and Sbragia is refusing to rule out a return for him - or Southampton’s English Under-19 stars Matt Targett and Sam Gallagher, who were previously approached to play for Scotland. He said: ‘The doors are never closed. I can understand Matt Targett and Sam Gallacher because they are English-born players. ‘I spoke to them and I’ll speak to them when we see them down there, but the door is always open to them. We never close the door and that’s the same with everybody.’","Feruz had played at almost every youth level for Scotland .

"The library opening with the first day of classes on Monday at Florida's newest college features a sunlit arched roof and cozy reading chairs - but not a single book. A fully digital library is among the futuristic features of Florida Polytechnic University's striking dome-shaped building, designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. 'It's a boldly relevant decision to go forward without books,' said Kathryn Miller, the university's director of libraries. The inaugural class of 550 students, offered scholarships covering tuition to attend a public university so new it's not yet accredited, can access more than 135,000 ebooks on their choice of reader, tablet or laptop.

Digital: Students at the university can access more than 135,000 ebooks on their choice of reader, tablet or laptop. A bookless library is a rarity among U.S. colleges but reflects the high-tech ambitions of the university in Lakeland, Florida. Rising along a drab stretch of highway between Tampa and Orlando, Florida Polytechnic envisions building a technology corridor in the image of Silicon Valley. Without stacks to organize, librarians staffing the main reference desk, which is called a success desk, will steer students to tutoring resources and train them in managing digital materials. While the library is not paperless, students are discouraged from using its printers too much, Miller said. They can buy traditional textbooks in the bookstore, or digital texts when available. Old-fashioned books can be requested on loan from libraries at Florida's 11 other public universities.

'Instead of the librarian putting books on the shelf that I think would be relevant, the students are choosing,' Miller said. Robust digital resources in an academic library are not unusual, she said, but most also have traditional books. The college consulted with similar libraries run by NASA and a mostly digital medical school library at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. 'Digital in some ways is better. People can find things easier, and they can discover more things by accident,' said Carrie Russell, a policy analyst for the American Library Association. The downsides include the difficulty of preserving information when technology changes, she noted, and licensing agreements that can require paying annually rather than owning outright. 'In the past, you could buy a reference book and it could sit on your shelf for 120 years,' Russell said. Several thousand such traditional books were inherited by Florida Polytechnic and are gathering dust in an off-campus library shared with a nearby community-based college. The titles can be browsed digitally and requested online from the new, bookless library.","Recently-opened Florida Polytechnic University includes a bookless library .

"The Paralympics closing ceremony kicked off with a spectacular post-apocalyptic Mad Max-style invasion of the Olympic Stadium. Amid fire and smoke, performers drove in on dozens of British-made welded-together vehicles, burning bicycles and bizarre machines that looked straight out of Mel Gibson's classic 1979 dystopian action movie. The outlandish performance for the Festival of the Flame also included a grand entrance by Prince Edward who entered the stadium in a chauffeur-driven carriage made out of second-hand cars. It was followed by war hero Captain Luke Sinnott, who lost his legs and an arm in a blast on the battlefields of Helmand, climbing a flagpole and proudly flying the Union Flag.

Fountains of water rose from circular stages to finally extinguish the Paralympic Flame. The stunning send-off ended with a spectacular firework display that flashed over the Olympic Stadium and Park. Fireworks lit up the sky along the Thames, including Tower Bridge and the words 'Thank you London, thank you UK' were projected onto the Houses of Parliament.","War hero Captain Luke Sinnott climbed a flagpole to fly the Union Flag .

"Manager Arsene Wenger is confident Arsenal will not be caught out by the early kick-off time when they host Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime. The Gunners struggled in their early away Barclays Premier League games last season, beaten 6-3 at the Etihad Stadium, before going down 5-1 at Liverpool and then humiliated 6-0 by London rivals Chelsea in March, which was Wenger's 1,000th match in charge. Wenger, however, insists there is no reason to believe his team - which could include a debut for England forward Danny Welbeck following his £16million deadline day switch from Manchester United - will have no problems with a slow start this time around.

It is not the kick-off time, it is your performance, how you turn up,' said Wenger. 'At 12:45 or three o'clock - for me that is just talk, the rest is the quality of the performance that counts.' Wenger continued: '[We were worse] away from home, but I think the coincidence was that we played against very strong teams away from home at 12:45.

"The legs exciting the most intense fascination in Las Vegas this weekend do not belong to the tallest show-girl or the sexiest lap dancer on the famous Strip. It is the muscular under-carriage of the wealthiest athlete in town which is attracting the closest attention. It is the legs which weaken first when even the greatest of boxers reach a certain age. Not the punching power. Not even the reflexes. VIDEOS  Scroll down to watch... Marcos Maidana lands a punch on Floyd Mayweather during their first bout in May but lost the brutal fight . Floyd Mayweather is 37 now and there are many among the blood brotherhood of the prize-ring who believe they are detecting a tell-tale slowing of the dazzling footwork which has helped him bank hundreds of millions of dollars. That speed of movement is as important a weapon in Mayweather’s formidable armoury as the lightning hand speed and he did not appear as quick across the canvas in his last fight. On that night here, four months ago, this most elusive practitioner of the noble art of self defence found himself obliged to stand and trade hefty punches with Argentine slugger Marcos Maidana. After being roughed up like never before, Mayweather now goes into a re-match with that same presumptuous opponent. And Senor Maidana returns emboldened yet further by how much physical hurt he has already been able to inflict on the world’s best pound-for-pound fighter. Mayweather Jr works with his uncle Roger Mayweather in front of a crowd as he looks to be in peak condition . That gut-wrenching effort, while not enough to prevent Mayweather’s hand rightly being raised at the end of 12 ferocious rounds, did create sufficient debate to justify them returning to Floyd’s Money pit a second time. Mayweather is guaranteed a minimum $30 million, Maidana roughly a tenth of that. The contentious American has explained away whatever problems he had in the first fight as a consequence of him ‘choosing to stand and fight so I could give all the fans the thrills they want.’ Er…maybe. Boxers do not usually choose to be hit. The best of them withstand it heroically when it happens but they would rather be the ones doing the hitting. Floyd Mayweather poses with his WBC Welterweight title belt after defeating Robert Guerrero in 2013 . VIDEO Mayweather ready for title defence . True or not this left the impression that he is now obliged to trade punches at times, where once he used to sashay out of touching distance like mist in the night. That in no way diminishes Mayweather’s stature as one of the finest ring-craftsmen of all time but it may indicate increased vulnerability as he approaches the end of his career. This will the 47th fight on a so-far unblemished record and he repeats that there will be only two more, one in May and another in September next year. The full-frontal assault he must expect from Maidana in the MGM Grand Arena will provide an indication of how likely he is to realise his cherished ambition of quitting as an undefeated world champion. In all probability he would have retired into a life of luxury already had it not been for the Showtime television network presenting him with a six-fight contract worth at least $250 million and up to $300 million. So far, three down and three to go. Mayweather aims to defeat Maidana again and is set to earn at least $30million from the re-match fight . Mayweather’s welter and light-middleweight titles are not the most valuable prizes on the line here. The Showtime must go on but for that goose it to keep laying its biggest eggs he has to keep winning. If he can do so in a manner which convinces himself that his powers are not waning, then he may feel strong enough to reach out for the golden fleece itself – the $300 million super-fight against Manny Pacquiao for which the world still awaits. That potential epic to finish, preceded by the promised clash with our own Amir Khan, would generate the maximum interest back home in Blighty. As usual Floyd Mayweather is the main focus for the camera bulbs as he promoted the fight in Las Vegas . Can those legs carry Mayweather through all these challenges? If he wants to steer clear of danger against Maidana he will have to be at his most nimble. El Chino will go for the Money as hard as he can, once again. Intriguingly, Mayweather claims he will make no technical adjustments so as to avoid being cut and bruised again. But then he can be as deceptive when discussing his approach to a big fight as he is clever in selling it to the pay-TV public. Manny Pacquiao first faces Chris Algieri in November but is expected to take on Mayweather after . Controversy has again contrived to grab world-wide interest. One former girl-friend is suing him for assault, while Mayweather has apologised for offering a qualified defence of a giant NFL footballer who was caught on film knocking out his wife in an elevator. Then there is all the publicity about his bling-laden lifestyle. But behind it all works a dedicated sportsman who trains himself to the limit, in absolute readiness for the moment when the hype has to stop, the fight begin. The casino bookmakers here know that. So while he complains that his genius is under-appreciated, another Mayweather win is quoted at 2-15 on with Maidana at 5-1 against. Floyd Mayweather enjoys showing off his wealth on social media, here with his pair of Bugatti Veyron cars . Both men say they will go for the knock-out ‘to make a statement.’ While a stoppage would appear to be Maidana’s only realistic chance of winning. But if Mayweather has his dancing shoes back on I expect him to pirouette to victory on his own Las Vegas stage, with the help of a stricter referee to keep the challenger’s bull-rush tactics within the laws. Sin City has been the ruination of many a great man. Thought probably not this Saturday night. But next year? In one of what Mayweather insists will be his last two fights? We will have a better idea come the early hours of Sunday morning UK time.

"A video interview has been released that shows Bill Cosby finally responding to recent allegations that he drugged and raped several women. With his wife Camille by his side, the actor seems uncomfortable, and very irritated, when the question is asked of him. The previously unreleased interview was filmed back on November 6. Scroll down for video . Awkward moment: Bill Cosby was forced to respond to claims that he drugged and raped several women in an interview with his wife Camille by his side (above) Speaking out: Cosby (above) responded to the allegations made against him saying he has 'no response' and 'no comment' 'There’s no response,' Cosby tells the AP interviewer. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis -  Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. 'There is no comment about that. And I’ll tell you why. I don’t want to compromise your integrity, but I don’t talk about it.' His publicist then get extremely irritated that the question was even asked, and Cosby himself demands that it not be put in with the video. 'I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,' says the actor. The AP has revealed they did not release the video at the time, which was meant to be about the Cosbys loaning 50 artworks to the Smithsonian, as they were just asking him based on claims that Hannibal Buress had made, the standup comedian whose acknowledgement of Cosby's past troubles with women claiming he sexually assaulted them brought up the subject again. This is the most Cosby has said on the subject since three women came forward recently saying that the actor drugged and raped them. Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, and supermodel Janice Dickinson have all told similar stories of being given pills and then sexually assaulted by Cosby. Bowman and Tarshis were both teenagers when the incidents with Cosby occurred. Meanwhile, Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, called Dickinson's allegations 'false and outlandish,' adding that the former model was 'seeking publicity to bolster her fading career.' Cosby, who has never been convicted on any of these charges, did settle a civil suit with a woman in 2006 who accused him of drugging and raping her two years earlier in his Philadelphia mansion. Uncomfortable pause: Cosby later said he did not want his response to the question to air . Support: Actor Stacey Dash tweeted her support for Cosby on Wednesday . These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star. Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations. TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the netowrk. At least one person came forward to show some support for Cosby however, with actor Stacey Dash tweeting on Wednesday that he was a mentor to her and never tried to assault when they worked together.","Bill Cosby was asked to respond to recent allegations, with his wife Camille by his side, and said he had 'no response' and 'no comment'

"Paris Saint-Germain's interest in Yaya Toure is expected to be given short thrift by Manchester City. The French are looking at strong midfielders who can help them dominate sides in the Champions League and are keen on City’s free scoring talisman.

Hot property: Toure is not likely to leave Manchester City this summer . They are eager to make Toure, Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany remain at Eastlands as part of their own plans to dominate the Champions League next season. With a faltering finish to the season they will look to add a further four players in the summer with West Ham target Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards both leaving. Bayern Munich are showing an interest in Aston Villa prospect Easah Suliman. The 16-year-old defender has captained England at U17 level and impressed Bayern’s scouts playing for Villa in the FA Youth Cup. Suliman, who is from Hall Green, has been with Villa since he was eight years old and was spotted playing in a tournament at Butlins. Prospect: Easah Suliman of Aston Villa (left) could have a big move on his hands . He turns 17 in January and has shown versatility playing at left-back as well as centre-back.

The Liverpool-born youngster failed to settle though and has since returned to England with Championship Barnsley. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admitted he enjoyed the sausages on his recent scouting trip to Germany, however, the trip home wasn’t so successful. Allardyce was at Wolfsburg against Nuremberg to watch Swiss striker Josip Drmic play for the visitors. The 21-year-old struggled to impress against a dominant Wolfsburg and the day got worse for Allardyce on his way back to the airport when his hire car broke down and he had to get out to help his driver push the car to the side of the road. Fortunately for ‘Big Sam’ an Everton scout, who had also been to the game, was passing and stopped to give him a lift to the airport. Watchful eye: Josip Drmic (left) has been looked at by both West Ham and Everton . Allardyce gave little away saying: ‘I was at Nuremburg versus Wolfsburg. The sausages were great! They ot beat quite comfortably so in terms of that player you wouldn’t be able to judge him on that particular game because they got battered.’ Drmic has scored 16 goals this season and is understood to have a release clause of £5million should his side, who sit second from bottom, be relegated. Arsenal, Everton and Liverpool have also checked on him. Aston Villa and Everton have expressed interest in West Bromwich Albion loan star Morgan Amalfitano. The 29-year-old is loan from Marseille but West Bromwich Albion have missed the cut-off date to make his move permanent. Marseille are willing to sell for £2.5million and Hull City have also expressed an interest. Potential: Villa and Everton have expressed interest in West Brom loan star Morgan Amalfitano . Amalfitano has caught the eye with his performances this season and his ability to play in a number of positions across the midfield. His goal contribution has also helped, notably his individual effort against Manchester United at Old Trafford early in the season. Villa, meanwhile, are also among clubs monitoring Watford striker Troy Deeney with Niklas Helenius expected to return to Alborg in the summer. Blackburn Rovers are considering a move for PFA Scottish Championship Player of the Year contender Kane Hemmings. The young striker has put his career back on track after leaving Rangers following a spate of knee injuries as a youngster.

"On the battlefields of the First World War, he showed death-defying bravery and inspired thousands of soldiers. In the mud and blood of the trenches, he survived bullets, bombs and bayonets as well as twice escaping from burning buildings. But this war hero was not a serviceman. He was an unflappable steed called Warrior – dubbed ‘the horse the Germans couldn’t kill’. Scroll down for video . Courageous: General Jack Seely and Warrior, who was awarded medal, painted by Sir Alfred Munnings in 1918 . General Jack Seely, who later became Lord Mottistone, leaving his Isle of Wight home on his horse Warrior . Yesterday Warrior, who braved machine guns and shells on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916, was posthumously awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross in the conflict’s centenary year. The medal was accepted at the Imperial War Museum, at a special ceremony compered by Kate Adie OBE, by author and broadcaster Brough Scott, the grandson of Warrior’s owner General Jack Seely, who would later become Lord Mottistone. Warrior was represented by serving Army horse, Irish Draught Charger, Benjamin Buckram, from the The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Woolwich. It was the first honorary PDSA Dickin Medal to be presented in the charity’s history, and marks Warrior’s courage as well as that shown by all the animals who served on the front line in the First World War.

The horse has been presented with a posthumous medal for his bravery in the Great War . After arriving on the Western Front on August 11 1914 with Gnrl Seely, Warrior stayed there throughout the war, surviving machine gun attacks and falling shells at the Battle of the Somme. He was dug out of the mud of Passchendaele and twice trapped under the burning beams of his stables, surviving many charges at the enemy and proving an inspiration to the soldiers he was fighting alongside. Despite suffering several injuries, Warrior survived and returned home to the Isle of Wight in 1918, where he lived with the Seely family until his death aged 33. Tribute: Author and broadcaster Brough Scott MBE, grandson of Warrior's owner and rider General Jack Seely, proudly displays the Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal . Mr Scott said he accepted the medal with 'great pride and gratitude' on behalf of Warrior and all the 'remarkable' animals in the Great War. He said: 'Warrior's story - which I grew up hearing at my mothers' knee - was lost in time to the wider world. But now he rides again 100 years later, thanks to PDSA. 'My family and I are more than honoured that Warrior has been given this award on behalf of all animals that also served; we are truly humbled. I only wish Jack Seely were here today to witness Warrior receiving the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross.' The PDSA Dickin Medal, instituted by the charity's founder Maria Dickin in 1943, is recognised as the highest award an animal can achieve while serving in military conflict. Warrior's award as the first ever First World War recipient of a medal, and the first honorary award, has been recognised by celebrity supporters including Steven Spielberg, director of the Oscar-nominated film War Horse. Warrior was dug out of the mud of Passchendaele and twice trapped under the burning beams of his stables. He also survived many charges at the enemy. Right, Seely with war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill . He said: 'Warrior is an extraordinary example of the resilience, strength, and profound contribution that horses made to the Great War. Recognising him with an Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal is a fitting and poignant tribute not only to this remarkable animal, but to all animals that served.' PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin added: 'Warrior's gallantry and devotion to duty throughout World War One reflects the bravery shown by the millions of horses, dogs, pigeons and other animals engaged in the war. 'That is why he is a worthy recipient of this very special Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal - the first and only of its kind. 'And in this anniversary year of remembrance there can surely be no more fitting way to honour the bravery and sacrifice that millions of noble animals displayed during World War One.' Rob .

Gina Koutsika, head of national and international programmes and projects at IWM, said: 'Over 16 million animals served in the First World War. 'They were used for transport, communication and companionship. Our love for animals is something that will never change and many members of the First World War Centenary Partnership are reflecting this in their programming. 'By honouring Warrior in the centenary year, PDSA have brought to the forefront the story of all animals.' Since its introduction, 65 Dickin Medals have been awarded - to 29 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, three horses (not including Warrior) and one cat. The last recipient was Military Working Dog Sasha, who died while on patrol in Afghanistan, who was given the award posthumously in May this year.","Warrior braved machine guns and falling shells at the Battle of the Somme .

"Yaya Toure was nowhere near his best against Bayern Munich but he'll soon be Manchester City's midfield beast again . One day Yaya Toure will no doubt see his name in the Manchester City hall of fame. Big goals in the Barclays Premier League and big goals in FA Cup finals tend to do that for you. As City have rampaged across England over the last four years, their big central midfielder has been at the heart of the machine, pouring forward with the burners on. At his best Toure is an incredible sight. A technically gifted, adaptable and brutally strong footballer, few in the history of the sport — never mind the history of his club — have managed to ally touch, vision, energy and ferocious power quite like he has. This weekend, however, the 31-year-old heads into a Premier League clash with Chelsea with questions being asked about his contribution, and also about his state of mind, for perhaps the very first time. VIDEOS SCROLL down to watch . Yaya Toure wasn't at his best on Wednesday night as Manchester City lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich . Toure is helped to his feet by City captain Vincent Kompany . In Bavaria on Wednesday night, Toure had a bad night as City lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich in their opening Champions League fixture of the season. He looked slow and unfit, unable to cover the ground quickly enough, as Pep Guardiola’s team pressed hard in the opening half-hour. As one respected pundit said on the way home from Germany: ‘Fernandinho had to do the work of four men in City’s midfield. Certainly he had to do far too much of Toure’s.’ Every player is allowed a bad night, of course, and Toure wasn’t alone on Wednesday. What opened him up to the social-media criticism that came his way, however, was the manner in which he was caught on camera laughing and joking with Guardiola moments after the final whistle. As Fernandinho struggled with cramp and keeper Joe Hart sought consolation from winning goalscorer — and former City colleague — Jerome Boateng, Toure exchanged pleasantries with his old Barcelona coach as though he were reflecting on a friendly. It would be wrong to criticise Toure too much. He and Guardiola achieved greatness together at the Nou Camp at the end of the last decade and the mutual affection is clear. Nevertheless, what leaves Toure open to question is his conduct in the summer that has left most City supporters asking if he really wants to be at the club at all. Toure was off the pace, by his usually sky-high standards, looking slow, unfit and unable to cover the ground . Bayern Munich's David Alaba (left) keeps his feet as Toure makes a desperate lunge for the ball . The story of the big bad footballer and the missing birthday cake would be hilarious if it wasn’t so pathetic and it appeared clear all through the off season that Toure’s complaints about the fact City didn’t recognise his big day (they actually gave him two cakes) represented nothing more than a clumsy attempt to get a new deal or a lucrative transfer elsewhere. Subsequently, Toure spoke of his admiration for clubs such as PSG in France and talked again of his enduring love for his old flame Barcelona. When it got him nowhere, he declared his loyalty to City once more and his world returned to normal, the only problem being that football fans don’t forget. At City, they like their heroes colourful but modest. That’s why they love Summerbee, Kinkladze, Rosler and Goater. Toure is not an arrogant footballer. He is a bright man and he listens. This is a man, after all, who returned a big TV to the shop in Manchester after his wife told him she thought it too ostentatious. Toure smiles as he is greeted by his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola after the match . Toure and Guardiola, who shared great success at Barcelona, embrace after the Champions League clash . He behaved foolishly in the summer, though, and may be about to pay the price. In these pages Jamie Redknapp argues Toure should be given time to recover fitness lost in the wake of the World Cup. Redknapp suggests the Ivorian will soon be back to his marauding best and he may be right. However, City assistant Ruben Cousillas denied there was a fitness issue when quizzed after Wednesday’s match. And, if Toure really isn’t fit then why? ‘I don’t share your verdict,’ said Cousillas. ‘On Saturday he didn’t play at Arsenal but he only returned on Friday from his national team. He was absolutely fit and physically is without problems.’ When City lost at home to Chelsea last February, Toure had one of his worst days in a City shirt. Without Fernandinho by his side because of injury, . Toure almost drowned in the shifting tides of Jose Mourinho’s midfield. On Sunday at the Etihad, Fernandinho will at least be there. ‘The best way to recover is to win that game,’ said the Brazilian. ‘We have to win because there are six or eight points between us. We have to keep working and keep going until we are top of the table.’","Yaya Toure has been at the heart of Manchester City's recent success .

"Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier was hospitalised after a head injury left him convulsing during his side’s 4-1 African Nations Cup defeat by Cameroon. The PSG full-back knocked his head in a challenge with home captain Stephane Mbia and was then seen convulsing on the ground as both sets of players called for help. There was no immediate news regarding his situation but manager Herve Renard said: 'It (the injury) is not serious.' Serge Aurier was hospitalised after sustaining a head injury in a challenge with Stephane Mbia . Vincent Aboubakar and Clinton Njie both scored twice in the win at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium as Cameroon continued their rehabilitation after a dismal World Cup. Despite missing the influence of now-retired captain Samuel Eto’o, Cameroon went top of the Group D standings after starting their campaign last Saturday with a 2-0 away win over the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Indomitable Lions had returned home in disgrace from Brazil after losing all three games at the World Cup and being involved in unseemly on-field fighting and off-field disputes over money. Captain Yaya Toure said that the Ivory Coast will aim to win all of their remaining ANC qualifiers . Njie scored the opener, as he had on his debut on Saturday, before Yaya Toure equalised but Aboubakar’s 38th-minute effort put Cameroon back in front. Aboubakar added a second 10 minutes after the break and then in the 75th minute set up Njie for a delightful goal. Njie sprinted on to Aboubakar’s pass, chested the ball and hit a full volley into the net. The Ivorians, minus the retired Didier Drogba, had to come from behind to beat Sierra Leone at home in their opening qualifier on Saturday. Serge Aurier was taken to hospital but manager Herve Renard said the injury was 'not serious' Ivory Coast captain Yaya Toure said: 'We need to win the remaining four games to go through and that's what we shall work towards achieving.' Newcastle's Cheikh Tiote and Swansea's Wilfried Bony also featured in the defeat. In the other qualifiers, Republic of Congo followed up its surprise victory over defending champion Nigeria with a 2-0 win over Sudan to take charge of Group A. South Africa and Nigeria drew 0-0. Everton midfielder Christian Atsu’s scored in the 85th minute to lift Ghana to a 3-2 win in Togo, but Uganda is still the surprise leader on goal difference in Group E after it beat Guinea 2-0 at home. Cape Verde put itself in a good position to reach the African Cup next year in Morocco after a second straight win, this time over 2012 Cup of Nations winner Zambia. Egypt, the record seven-time African champion, lost 1-0 at home to north African rival Tunisia.","Ivory Coast lost 4-1 to Cameroon in African Nations Cup qualifier .

"The father of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani yesterday wiped away tears as he examined items of evidence at the trial of one of her alleged killers. Vinod Hindocha was accompanied by Anni's cousin Nishma Hindocha at the Cape Town court where one of the alleged hijackers - who has already confessed - pointed the finger of blame at his alleged partner in crime. Mr Hindocha stood close to his niece as they examined the bracelet and watch Anni had been wearing when she was killed. Alongside these items was a mobile phone alleged to belong to the hijacked taxi's driver and a handgun allegedly used to murder her. Scroll down for video . Bereaved: Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, examines the evidence with her cousin Nishma Hindocha in the Western Cape High Court, where suspect Xolile Mngeni is appearing in connection with the honeymooner's murder . Evidence: Anni Dewani's bracelet, watch and mobile phone, plus the gun used to shoot her . During the hearing, the South African 'hitman' who killed Anni in a honeymoon hijack told how he wore yellow . Marigold-type rubber gloves during the newlywed bride’s murder. Mziwamadoda Qwabe wore the bright . rubber kitchen gloves as he drove Anni’s commandeered taxi at high speed . through the darkened township roads. He . did so in the knowledge that Anni’s then-imminent death had been . planned and paid for by her own husband, the South African court has . been told. Although he has already admitted his role in Anni’s murder, Qwabe, 27, yesterday appeared in court as a witness against Xolile Mngeni, who is alleged to be his partner in crime. Accused: Xolile Mngeni (black jacket) and Mziwamadoda Qwabe (striped shirt) appear in the Cape Town High Court, on February 10, 2012 . Happy couple: Shrien and Anni Dewani on their wedding day. Swedish-born Anni was murdered in November 2010 and the convicted assassin has said Mr Dewani ordered her death . Deadly weapon: The semi-automatic handgun used to killl Anni Dewani . Qwabe used his court appearance yesterday to point the finger of blame for Anni’s death at Shrien Dewani. While admitting that he never spoke directly to the British businessman, the South African recalled being told that the murder was Shrien’s idea. Confession: Mziwamadoda Qwabe is testifying against his alleged partner in crime . ‘There is a husband who wants his wife killed and it must look like a hijacking,’ Qwabe recalled being told. He went on to say how the hijack and murder plan had initially faltered when the two hijackers failed to be at the agreed rendezvous point on time. It was Shrien, Qwabe claimed in court, who nonetheless insisted that the 'job' should continue. ‘The husband wants the job to be done that same night,’ Qwabe recalled being told. Anni, 28, and her husband were . hijacked on the fifth day of their honeymoon as their taxi drove through . Gugulethu township outside Cape Town. After stealing all their valuables, the . two hijackers permitted Shrien to leave the car. Anni, however, had to . stay. She was later shot dead. So far, the taxi’s driver, Zola Tongo, . plus one of the hijackers, Qwabe, and another anonymous ‘middle man’ have all admitted their roles in the plot. All . three men have received substantial sentence discounts (or in the . middle man’s case, complete immunity from prosecution) in return for . evidence fingering Shrien, whom the South African prosecution claim . masterminded Anni’s murder. Like Mngeni, Shrien insists he is innocent. All that's left: Anni's possessions displayed at the trial included a delicate watch and bangle . Silent witness: The murdered bride's mobile phone was also handed in as evidence . Grieving: The pair at the court yesterday, left, and today, right. Mngeni is accused of pulling the trigger on their relative but he denies kidnapping, robbery, murder and owning an unlicensed gun . 'Hired': Mngeni at court today in relation to the murder allegedly plotted by Anni's British husband Shrien Dewani . Mngeni used a zimmer frame at court yesterday, where he is standing trial before a judge but no jury . Hidden: Three men have already received substantial sentence reductions for fingering Shrien, but like Anni's husband, Mngeni insists he is innocent . Giving evidence yesterday, Qwabe told how the two friends had agreed with Zola Tongo to kill Anni for a share of £1,335.They met up with Tongo on the afternoon of the murder - 13th November, 2010 - to arrange details. Tragedy: Anni Dewani died on her honeymoon in South Africa tow years ago . It was Mngeni, Qwabe claimed, who carried pointed his 7.62mm handgun at the Dewani’s taxi as part of the pretend hijack plan. Under questioning from prosecutor Adrian Mopp, Qwabe revealed that he wore yellow rubber gloves as drove the VW Sharan at speed through the township. ‘The type that people wear for washing dishes?, asked Mr Mopp. ‘Yes’, said Qwabe. According to Qwabe, it was Mngeni, who was sitting beside him in the passenger seat, who turned around and shot Anni in the neck. Anni’s bereaved father Vinod Hindocha listened in anguish as Qwabe spelt out his daughter’s last moments. Mr Hindocha, who wore Anni’s photograph on his shoulder, appeared to wipe a tear from his eye as the self-confessed killer made an appeal for his forgiveness. Addressing ‘the family’, Qwabe said: 'I truly and humbly regret and apologise about what happened to their daughter. If ever or whenever they can find it in their hearts to forgive me I am sorry from the bottom of my heart.' South Africa’s attempts to extradite Shrien Dewani back to Cape Town for trial have stalled while the Briton is treated for post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. Mngeni denies kidnapping, robbery, murder and owning an unlicensed gun. His trial, which takes place in front of a judge, but no jury, continues.

I looked at the line-up and felt they were growing old together. Football allows that less and less. The fruit is ripe - but you had better eat it quickly, because it's going to go off. 'The value of those players will drop quite sharply in the next 18 months because everyone will know they are going over the edge. People used to say of Ferguson: 'Why has he sold this or that player when he's still performing really well?' Answer: because he knew what was coming. 'There is a trace of that now with City. Their problem, though, is that Financial Fair Play is chasing them down the road. So their option is to sell big now and buy young replacements in the next 12 months.

"Two years on from his shocking collapse against Sergio Garcia at the Ryder Cup, and Jim Furyk is still getting asked about it. ‘Every time I go to the Press room, I know the questions are coming and I feel like we’re in a morgue,’ he says. Never mind that he has career earnings of more than $60 million (£37m), will make his ninth consecutive appearance in the biennial match at Gleneagles next week and, at 44, looks up at only six fellow professionals in the world rankings. ‘Everyone is looking at me with this blank stare and they ask me depressing questions,’ he added. ‘And they bring up the Ryder Cup the last time, and we go through Akron (he doubled the 18th hole in 2012 to lose the Bridgestone Invitational) and I leave there feeling like I lost my dog. It’s golf. No one died. I don’t expect anyone to feel sorry for me.’ Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson and Webb Simpson watch Europe celebrate after winning the Ryder Cup in 2012 . As you might gather, Furyk in conversation is every bit as straight as one of his drives — and you can understand the slight irritation at the recurring theme. He is, after all, the great survivor of world golf, a man defying ridiculous odds. It is eight years since he was asked whether the game was passing him by. It was a reference to his struggle with his funky swing and being a medium hitter in the era of the power game. He’s certainly answered that one. Eight years on, just two players finished above him when it came to making this American team. ‘I’m very proud to represent my country and when I look back on my career and the things I’ve done, making nine teams means an awful lot,’ he said. ‘You have to be consistent and to be able to qualify by right for eight of them, to be in the mix that often, I’m proud of that.’ The Garcia question keeps coming up, of course, because of the extra-ordinary circumstances. Furyk was one up with two holes to play against the Spaniard on the final day in Chicago but bogeyed them both to make his own unfortunate contribution to the miracle of Medinah. Jim Furyk will make his ninth consecutive appearance in the biennial match at Gleneagles next week . Captain Davis Love had picked him as a wild card and Furyk was devastated when he didn’t deliver. ‘I think if you ask Sergio he would agree I outplayed him but it doesn’t matter if you don’t win the point,’ he said. ‘I think I was the most disappointed of our team because I felt bad for Davis. He got everything right as captain but quite honestly we laid an egg on Sunday and the Europeans got the momentum.’ You might expect him to be leading from the front alongside some of his more excitable colleagues such as Keegan Bradley in declaring this forthcoming visit to Scotland a mission of redemption. But Furyk has been down that road before, putting pressure on himself, and he knows it doesn’t work for him. It’s exactly four years, for example, since he claimed the last of his 16 victories in the 2010 Tour Championship in Atlanta. Since then, he has led eight tournaments going into the final round and not once has he ended up with the trophy. ‘Some of them have been taken away from me by people playing great final rounds but I’ve got in my own way a few times as well,’ he conceded. Furyk bristled when BBC Five Live golf correspondent Iain Carter asked him last week if this team was more pumped up than previous American sides. ‘Any other clichés you want to throw at me?’ he replied. ‘Are the Europeans more of a team, and we’re just individuals, perhaps?’ Earlier, he had given a more considered response. Team Europe's Sergio Garcia of Spain smiles as he walks up to the green on the eighteenth hole at Medinah . ‘If it was the same 12 players against their 12 then yes, it would be a lot of motivation,’ he said. ‘The Yankees lose to the Red Sox 3-0 then yes, the next time they meet it’s a big deal. But this is going to be a different group of guys and it’s two years later and also, I don’t think you ever need motivation to play in the Ryder Cup. Every team I’ve played in, the motivation has been the same.’ Furyk still considers it his favourite event, even though he’s only been on two winning teams. ‘Three-six would sound an awful lot better than two-seven, wouldn’t it?’ he said, smiling. ‘I just love the whole atmosphere. I remember losing one match to Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell on the final green but I still loved it. They hung tough at the end, and you can have no complaints when that happens. ‘I like the friendships I’ve made and the spirit in which the matches are generally played. I remember competing against Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood in 2006. I had a short putt and someone said pick it up and I wasn’t quite sure what they said and Darren gave me this look that said, “Come on Jim, you know better than that, there’s nothing goofy going to happen in this group”. ‘I’ve made some good friendships over the years with Europeans like Darren and Lee. But it is true we’ve been on the losing side rather more than I would have liked.’ He has a good relationship with the British crowd, too, and is looking forward to the European songs. ‘They’re a great part of the occasion,’ he said. ‘My favourite was at Celtic Manor when you couldn’t see the fairway and the fans started singing, “Follow your nose, Jim”. I could barely hit my tee shot I was laughing so hard.’ Look to Furyk to be a formidable presence in the two foursomes series and a vital member of the American team room. And he knows exactly what needs to happen to prevent the press room feeling like a morgue. ‘I’m not chastising the press or anything, y’all have been very fair to me over the years,’ he said. ‘I understand the questions. I guess I just want to get away from having a sad conversation all the time, and walk out of there feeling happy. ‘I guess we have to win, right? So if and when that happens, I’ll be the one with a big smile on my face.’","Jim Furyk will make his ninth consecutive appearance in the biennial match at Gleneagles next week .

"Tim Howard protected the USA's goal heroically during 90 minutes of regulation time against Belgium in their World Cup last-16 tie - breaking the record for most saves in a World Cup match in the process. Howard's 15 stops saw him make history but he was eventually beaten twice in extra time as the Belgians progressed to the quarter-finals. He later tweeted of his pride at representing his country at the 2014 World Cup, saying: 'Im proud to suit up w every one of these guys. It's a tremendous honor to represent this country & a ride I'll never forget. Thx for joining'. The Everton goalkeeper's performance was so impressive that a White House petition was started to rename the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after Howard and, if it receives 100,000 signatures, the US government must respond.

"The hostages in Islamic State execution videos appear calm because they do not realise they are about to die, according to a former captive. French war reporter Didier Francois, who was released by the terrorists earlier this year, said that prisoners were threatened with execution ‘several times’ and IS militants carried out macabre mock crucifixions. Commenting on why the hostages, including Briton David Haines, remained calm even seconds before their deaths, the journalist said: ‘They did not realise that this time it was the real thing’. Scroll down for video . Didier Francois, who was released by IS earlier this year, said that prisoners were threatened with execution ‘several times’ and were put through mock executions . Mr Francois said James Foley was treated worse than the other hostages because the militants found a picture of his brother - who is a member of the US armed forces - on his computer . Mr Francois, 53, of Paris-based radio station Europe 1, and three other French journalists were freed in April near the Syrian-Turkish border. The French government has denied that a ransom of $18million (£11million) was paid to end their ten-month captivity, but many believe the cash was paid through middlemen, including private companies and Turkish secret agents. Mr Francois revealed after his release that Foley was treated harsher than the other captives because the militants found a picture of his brother - who serves in military - on his computer. Giving an insight into the physical and mental torture the hostages endured at the hands of the terrorists, the french journalist called Foley 'one of the pillars of the group,' who 'never cracked even under the most difficult conditions'. 'He was an extraordinary guy, an extremely nice companion in detention, very solid,' Mr Francois said in August. He described the conditions in which all the hostages were held in Syria, as always ‘rough and sometimes violent.","French journalist Didier Francois was held by ISIS militants earlier this year .

"The entertainment company behind The Muppets has cut ties with restaurant Chick-Fil-A after the fast-food chain’s CEO revealed his anti-gay marriage stance. The Jim Henson Company had partnered with the eatery to provide toys in their kid’s meals from mid July until August 18. However, following Chick-Fil-A’s president Dan Cathy's comments last week that his company supported families headed by heterosexual couples only, The Jim Henson  Company said they would never work with the fast food giant again. Muppets: The Jim Henson Company, which is behind the beloved TV show The Muppets, have cut ties with Chick-Fil-A after the chain's president Dan Cathy, left, revealed his anti-gay marriage stance . The Jim Henson  Company, which is . also behind popular shows such as Fraggle Rock and Labyrinth, posted . that their were severing their ties with the restaurant on their . Facebook page on Friday. The company also said they would be . dedicating their payment from Chick-Fil-A to the charity Gay & . Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination. Their full post, reported on the Huffington Post, read: 'The Jim Henson . Company has celebrated and embraced diversity and inclusiveness for over . fifty years and we have notified Chick-Fil-A that we do not wish to . partner with them on any future endeavors. 'Lisa Henson, our CEO is . personally a strong supporter of gay marriage and has directed us to . donate the payment we received from Chick-Fil-A to GLAAD.' 'Going forward': The Atlanta-based fast food chain released a statement on Facebook saying they will 'leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena' This is the latest in a huge backlash . to comments made by the multimillion dollar empire’s president Dan Cathy . when he said his company is ‘very much supportive of the family,’ but . only when it involves heterosexual couples in an interview with the . conservative newspaper Baptist Press. As well as customer backlash, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has vowed to block Chick-fil-A from opening a restaurant in the city. To appease disgruntled consumers . Chick-fil-A issued a statement via the company's Facebook page on . Thursday saying their restaurants ‘treat every person with honor, . dignity and respect – regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual . orientation or gender’. The statement continued: ‘Going forward, . our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the . government and political arena.’ More than 13,000 comments were posted on the company's Facebook page in response to the statement. According to the Los Angeles Times, Mr Cathy he previously said: ‘We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are . married to our first wives.’ Contradictory: Mr Cathy's backing of  'traditional' families as husband and wife is a far cry from the ensuing statement from Chick-fil-A . The Atlanta-based business currently has 1,608 locations and boasts sales of more than $4billion. According to the Los Angeles Times, Chick-fil-A workers are trained ‘to focus on values rooted in the Bible,’ and the eateries nationwide are closed on Sundays. Mr Cathy said: ‘We don’t claim to be a Christian business. ‘Companies are not lost or saved, but certainly individuals are but as an organisation we can operate on biblical principles.’ In response to Chick-fil-A's Facebook statement there was a range of criticism and support for the company's position.

"Pictured with volunteers about to take aid to a refugee camp on the Turkish-Syrian border, this is the British father of two whom Islamic State extremists claim will be their next victim. Taxi driver Alan Henning, 47, travelled to war-torn Syria last Christmas in a convoy of old ambulances in an attempt to take much-needed medical supplies to hospitals. But the charity volunteer was kidnapped by Islamic State extremists shortly after making the 4,000-mile journey to the town of Al-Dana. Scroll down for video . Humanitarian aid: Alan Henning, circled, with other volunteers before setting off for the Syrian border . Footage emerged on Saturday night of him looking ill and exhausted as he knelt before the knife-wielding militant nicknamed Jihadi John in the desert. He wore an orange jumpsuit, his arms tied behind his back, Jihadi John said Mr Henning would become the second British hostage to be killed if David Cameron persisted ‘in fighting the Islamic State’. The Salford-born driver had volunteered with a Muslim charity to drive a convoy of 20 vehicles, including old NHS ambulances, to war-torn Syria last December. They were transporting life-saving medical equipment such as defibrillators and stethoscopes to a hospital in Idlib province in the north-west of the country. Mr Henning said goodbye to his wife of 23 years Barbara Henning, 45, and children Lucy, 17, and Adam, 15, just days before Christmas. He left the family’s red-brick terrace house in Eccles, Greater Manchester, where he had lived for a decade, and met eight other volunteers from Salford. Taxi driver Alan Henning, pictured, travelled to war-torn Syria last Christmas in a convoy of old ambulances in an attempt to take much-needed medical supplies to hospitals . They joined a larger team before Mr Henning embarked on the risky humanitarian mission. Friends said it was his third charity trip to Syria and he was ‘an ordinary guy just trying to help women and kids’. Martin Shedwick, 50, whose company Sprint Motors helped to service some of the old ambulances before they went to Syria, said the self-employed taxi driver would lose two weeks’ pay each time he went but was determined to help the refugees. ‘He saw the suffering of all the women and children and he just wanted to do his humanitarian bit,’ he said. ‘They’d fill up the vehicles with aid stuff and things like toffees for the kids. ‘Hearing that he’s in danger of being beheaded, I don’t know what to say. There’s nothing political going on in his head. There’s no agenda.’ Mr Shedwick said Mr Henning even once took a fire engine to Syria. ‘We serviced it and I remember thinking “I wouldn’t fancy driving that all the way to the Turkish border”. Islamists proudly described Jihadi John as a ‘serial killer’ last night as they gloated at the global wave of revulsion over his atrocities . Islamists proudly described Jihadi John as a ‘serial killer’ last night as they gloated at the global wave of revulsion over his atrocities. One radical boasted that the three beheadings made better viewing than Dexter, the hit US TV series about the secret life of a psychopath. The man, known only as Abu Shiddah, taunted security agencies working around the clock to identify John and track him down. He tweeted: ‘Jihadi John got 3 confirmed kills. Kuffaar [non-believers] still ain’t caught him. 3 kills makes him a serial killer. Forget watching tv Dexter or 24.’ The comments were among a torrent of bile spewed out on social networking sites supporting the latest atrocity by Islamic State. Many fighting in Syria and northern Iraq begged the West to send in ground forces, using the sarcastic line: #bringbackyourtroops. Others focused on Prime Minister David Cameron, saying his decision to return to Downing Street was ‘too little, too late’. Chief among them was notorious firebrand cleric Trevor Brooks, a former acolyte of Omar Bakri Muhammad and Abu Hamza. He tweeted: ‘What’s your next move, Dave?’ alongside a picture of a poppy-wearing Mr Cameron at a remembrance event. Another Twitter user, Mujahid Miski, gloated: ‘#IslamicState sent another1 to hell.’ ‘But he loved it. He was that sort of guy. He’s just a great guy with a good heart. He was the nicest guy you could ever meet, the sort who’d do anything for you. ‘I hope to God they’ll let him go. All he’s ever done in Syria is good.’ Sources said the trip was organised by Worcester-based Muslim aid charity Al Fatiha Global. A friend who accompanied him to Syria last year – but said he could not talk about the kidnapping – said Mr Henning was not Muslim but had ‘wanted to do his bit’. ‘He’s done more than anyone could possibly imagine for the children of Syria – it would take me a week to tell you about it if I was allowed to,’ he said. ‘The best of the best – that’s the only way I can describe him. This is the heartbreaking thing, the amount this guy has done. Half the people of Syria are grateful to him.’ Asked why he was targeted by kidnappers, the friend said: ‘That’s what terrorists do, they target people. It wasn’t because he’s white, it’s because he’s a non-Muslim. They’ve got their own perverted view of Islam.’ Asked if others in the convoy were also kidnapped, he said he could not ‘go into it’, but that ‘everyone else got back eventually’. Footage has emerged of Alan Henning looking ill and exhausted (left) as he knelt before the knife-wielding militant nicknamed Jihadi John in the desert. The Charity volunteer Alan Henning was kidnapped by Islamic State extremists shortly after making the 4,000-mile journey to the town of Al-Dana . ‘We know from other released hostages that ISIS (Islamic State) know he’s a humanitarian,’ he added. Yesterday morning Mr Henning’s wife and children returned to their home in Eccles in a taxi after apparently being updated on the situation by officials. They were escorted into the house by a friend. Tam Hussein, a journalist who has reported on conflicts in the Middle East, suggested yesterday that Mr Henning had been warned not to travel to Syria. He wrote on Twitter: ‘Despite the advise [sic] given – Henning wanted to make sure aid reached the intended, this as far as I understand was his motives for going in.’ He added: ‘Henning was genuinely trying to help the Syrian refugee crisis – nothing more. People spoke very highly of him.’ Dutch journalist Harald Doornbos said he was told by a Syrian activist who had been in jail in Al-Dana that a man called Alan Henning was placed in the same cell. The activist apparently said he and Mr Henning had spent a day and a night together. During this time, the Briton was said to have been in good spirits and believed he would be freed soon as he was carrying out aid work. But rather than releasing Mr Henning, IS reportedly took him to the rebel-held city of Raqqa instead.","Alan Henning travelled to Syria last Christmas to provide medical supplies .

"A drug company executive has set a new record for the biggest retirement pay package in U.S. corporate history, prompting experts to brand his remuneration package ‘excessive’. John Hammergren, the CEO drug distributor McKesson, would have received $159million on top of his salary, which has risen to more than $50million a year, if he had left the company on March 31. The Wall Street Journal reported the outlandish bonus, saying that in their latest corporate filing, McKesson disclosed that had Mr Hammergren voluntarily departed on March 31 this year, his pension would have been $159m. Pay day: John Hammergren would receive a $159m retirement package if he left McKesson Corp. last month . Big moves: The drug company waived some standard operating procedures resulting in the massive potential payout . McKesson, a drug distribution company, normally imposes an early retirement penalty on executives who quit before they turn 62, but they waived that in the case of Mr Hammergren, who is just 54. This concession alone meant that his pension was 28 per cent higher than it should have been. The Journal cites Equilar, a company that examines executive pay rates, as saying that over the past seven years, Mr Hammergren took home more than $355m in cash and realized stocks. Mr Hammergren has spent a long time with the company and joined in 1996, meaning he has 17 years of service. He became chief executive in 2001 and under his tenure the company’s stock price has more than tripled. Despite this, James Reda, a New York executive-compensation consultant, said that he was staggered at the package Mr Hammergren was entitled to. Top contenders: The next highest pension record holder was Edward Whitacre (left) who would have gotten $84.7m in 2006 when if he left AT&T that year. Rupert Murdoch (right) comes next, as his pension package is expected to be $73.9million . He said: ‘I’ve never seen a pension that high’. The second-largest retirement bonus on record for a current executive is that of the former CEO of AT&T back in 2006, was then-CEO Edward Whitacre who would have received $84.7million if he retired that year. He retired a year later in 2007. The second highest possible pension for a current executive who continues to head his company is Rupert Murdoch, who would take home $73.9million should he retire now.","John Hammergren of McKesson, a drug company, could have taken a $159m pension package if he left by the end of the last corporate filing period .

"Levante have warned Atletico Madrid that Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas will not leave on the cheap - and that they will have to up their offer to sign the World Cup star. Navas has been in sensational form throughout the tournament for Costa Rica, decisively saving Greek striker Theofanis Gekas' spot-kick to seal a quarter-final spot against Holland for his country. He also made eight saves during the match and has conceded just twice during the tournament as unfancied Costa Rica topped Group D - containing England, Italy and Uruguay. Wanted: Levante have told Atletico Madrid to up their offer for Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas . Clause: Atleti have offered £5m plus Brazil striker Leo Baptistao but Levante want Navas' £8m buy-out fee . The stopper has 12 months remaining on his £5,000-a-week Levante contract but he will not be allowed to leave until Atletico or another club match his £8million buy-out clause. Atleti need a goalkeeper to replace Belgian Thibaut Courtois, who spent three years at the club before returning to parent club Chelsea at the start of this summer. They are believed to have offered £5m plus Brazilian forward Leo Baptistao for Navas, but Levante want more. Speaking to Spanish radio station Cadena Ser, Levante president Quico Catalan said: 'Keylor has a 10million euro release clause and we know that Keylor is worth more than that. 'All the teams that have made offers for Keylor know what the answer will be - the release clause. 'Six million euros plus Leo Baptistao is not 10million. 'Keylor . is having a great World Cup and many clubs, foreign and Spanish, have . shown their interest.' Stopper: Navas has starred for Costa Rica at the Brazil World Cup, conceding just twice in four games . In safe hands: Navas saved the decisive spot-kick in the last-16 match against Greece . Navas also performed brilliantly during Levante's shock 2-0 victory over eventual champions Atleti in La Liga last season. Speaking on the same radio programme, Navas gave no indication about his preferred future destination. 'The . most important thing for me right now is the World Cup,' said the . goalkeeper. 'I will evaluate other things later, I just want to enjoy the . World Cup.'

"While the world is on tenterhooks waiting for the Duchess of Cambridge to give birth, her family dropped the biggest clue so far last night that perhaps the baby isn't quite ready to make an appearance yet. Grandparents-to-be Michael and Carole Middleton and their children Pippa and James were invited en masse by the Queen to join her in a royal box at Buckingham Palace. Looking happy and relaxed, they mingled confidently with members of the royal family watching a gala performance of music and dance from throughout the Queen's reign as part of the Coronation Festival. Family outing: All of the Middletons, except for heavily pregnant Kate, attended the gala at Buckingham Palace . Floral: Pippa wore a white dress with a flower motif and lace top to the event . Relaxed: Grandfather-to-be Michael Middleton did not seem worried about his eldest daughter's impending labour as he chatted with Pippa . Siblings: Pippa and brother James joined the Queen in the Royal Box for the evening . Sitting two rows behind the Queen, Carole looked supremely elegant in a cream dress and jacket with bracelet sleeves and greeted the first royals to arrive, which included Lady Helen Taylor with warmth and familiarity. Pippa and James waved and exchanged greetings with Zara Phillips, who was making her first public appearance since announcing she was pregnant earlier this week and hid any baby bump under a loose fitting patterned shift dress. Sources have told the Mail that Kate is feeling so comfortable and relaxed even in these latter stages of her pregnancy that she even considered attending the performance with her family tonight, but eventually decided against it. The other grandparents to be, Prince . Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, were also present and accompanied . the Queen who would normally have Prince Philip by her side. He is still . recovering from abdominal surgery. Celebration: The Queen was joined by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at the festival to mark the 60th anniversary of her coronation . Loose-fitting: Any signs of a baby bump were concealed under Zara Phillips's floral dress . Svelte: Sophie, Countess of Wessex, showed off her slim figure in a white dress with an unusual feather ruff . The Duke of York, Princess Eugenie and the Earl and Countess of Wessex were also in the front row. Sophie was showing off her newly svelte figure in a form fitting cream dress, which was rather spoilt by a bizarre feather ruff around her neck. Each member of the royal box had a blue blanket on their seat in case of a drop in temperature. Among the performers were Katherine Jenkins and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.","Whole Middleton family joined the Queen for her Coronation Festival .

"A protester leaps from a wheelchair and runs onto the pitch during the USA’s World Cup clash with Belgium. The man, an Italian named Mario Ferri with a history of such stunts, stopped the game in the 16th minute when he ran around on the grass wearing a blue Superman t-shirt with ‘#SAVE FAVELAS CHILDREN’ and ‘#CIRO VIVE' printed on it. Ferri had managed to secure a ticket for the match in the disabled section which gave him a front row seat. Making his move: Mario Ferri gets out of wheelchair in the 16th minute of the game . Sending a message: Mario Ferri stuns players by running around before being escorted off by security . He slipped through the barrier unnoticed before running unimpeded for several seconds, pulling down on his t-shirt to better reveal his message. He was eventually escorted off the field by security. #CiroVive was a reference to Ciro Esposito a Napoli fan who was shot in May during fan violence before the Italian Cup final.. He died last week, 50 days after the shooting, at the age of 29. Ferri is a repeat offender from Italy, famous invading Serie A and Italy matches wearing a Superman shirt. Ferri also ran onto the field during a match at the World Cup 2010 with a a vuvuzela, interrupting the semi-final match between Germany and Spain. Ferri’s antics will prompt new fears over security and also concern that concession seats are being sold on the black market. Footage taken at the Maracana during match between France and Ecuador last week shows what appears to be a wheel-chair bound man walking to his chair. Dozens of supposedly disabled fans have also been seen standing up in other games. Easy access: Mario Ferri slips through the barrier and onto the field unnoticed .

"Sorry end: The needletail pictured after its unfortunate and deadly altercation with a wind turbine on the Isle of Harris in the Hebrides . There had been only eight recorded sightings of the white-throated needletail in the UK since 1846. So when one popped up again on British shores this week, twitchers were understandably excited. A group of 40 enthusiasts dashed to the Hebrides to catch a glimpse of the brown, black and blue bird, which breeds in Asia and winters in Australasia. But instead of being treated to a wildlife spectacle they were left with a horror show when it flew into a wind turbine and was killed. John Marchant, 62, who had made the . trip all the way from Norfolk, said: ‘We were absolutely over the moon . to see the bird. We watched it for nearly two hours. ‘But while we were watching it suddenly got a bit close to the turbine and then the blades hit it. ‘We all rushed up to the turbine, which took about five minutes, hoping the bird had just been knocked out the sky but was okay. ‘Unfortunately it had taken a blow to the head and was stone dead. ‘It was really beautiful when it was . flying around, graceful and with such speed. To suddenly see it fly into . a turbine and fall out the sky was terrible.’ The last sighting of a white-throated . needletail was 22 years ago. A relative of the common swift, it is said . to be capable of flying at an astonishing 106mph. The bird was thousands of miles off course when it was originally spotted in Northumberland, before travelling further north. But it hadn’t reckoned on the wind turbine hazards of the Hebrides when it landed on the Isle of Harris. Average wind speeds in the area are 50 per cent higher than the national average, making it a valuable natural resource to tap into. Lewis and Harris, technically one island, already has a number of wind farms, with several more planned in future. See video of the bird captured before the accident below . Incoming: The turbine at Drinishader on the Isle of Harris which the rare bird crashed into, right in front of a group of keen twitchers who had tracked its progress all the way from Northumberland . The white-throated needletail’s journey through northern Britain was enthusiastically tracked by several bird watchers. A spokesman for the website Bird Guides said: ‘Why it is ended up in Harris is a bit of a mystery – it should be well away in Siberia, Australia or Japan. ‘It obviously got lost and the weather may have played a part. It is difficult to say. ‘It . was spotted by chance by two birders from Northumberland who were on . holiday, and they knew what they were looking at. So there is a chance . it may have been here a lot longer. ‘It . could have re-orientated itself and is capable of flying vast . distances. In fact it spends more time in the air than on the ground. So . it could have worked out it was in the wrong place and flown to where . it should be.’ Nick Moran, who runs bird tracking online for the British Trust for Ornithology, said he had been monitoring the bird’s progress since its arrival in the UK. He said: ‘It is not the happiest ending for a bird that has flown half way around the world. ‘It was a real day of mixed emotions for everyone there, they were all so happy they got to see it, but then witnessed it die.’ Mr Moran said that birds like this would be most at risk from turbines during the day when they are flying low to feed on insects. A spokesman for the RSPB said it did not know the exact details of the case but migrating birds can be blown off course when travelling and the needletail may have lost its bearings and ended up in the UK. She added: ‘Careful choice of location and design of wind farms and turbines prevents, as much as possible, such occurrences happening on a large scale. ‘Wind energy makes a vital contribution towards mitigating the impacts of climate change, which is the biggest threat to our native birds and wildlife.’ The Rare Bird Alert, an online service that notifies users of sightings, had passed on reports of the white-throated needletail on Tuesday. A spokesman for the service said users had told them the bird died on Wednesday. Yesterday morning, the service tweeted: ‘The white-throated needletail on Harris flew into a wind turbine and has died. ‘Pathetic way for such an amazing bird to die.’ It is not the first time a bird-watching trip has ended in tragedy. On a previous outing, a group of twitchers in the Hebrides had seen a migratory wryneck hit by a train.

"They say if you don’t ask, you don’t get. Even so, Jessica Fitch could not quite believe her luck when she – with a little help from her dad – persuaded the Queen to pose for a photograph with her battered old teddy bear, Bertie.

Jessica was absolutely fearless.’ Jessica and Bertie pose with her mother Heather and father Michael . Moments before confident seven-year-old Jessica Fitch asked the Queen to pose for a photograph .

"When they first set eyes on the rundown old farmhouse and derelict outbuildings, all Graham  and Susan James wanted to know from a local surveyor was: Will the property fall down before we buy it? Most people would have baulked at taking on four-and-a-half acres of untamed land, a silted-up pond and crumbling Grade II listed house, but the Jameses were certain the property ‘had our name on it’. That was 1976. And for the next 38 years, they spent every weekend painstakingly restoring Luxford Farm, near Crowborough in East Sussex, and creating the most beautiful gardens. Hard work: Graham, 76, and Susan, 74, bought derelict Luxford Farm near Crowborough in East Sussex, in 1976, and after doing it up, are now selling it . At the beginning of each year, Graham would make charts detailing what they would work on, from laying reclaimed floor tiles  to building garden walls. The couple cheerfully admit that Luxford Farm was not so much a project as an obsession. It became their life’s work. ‘I can honestly say I never resented a single day of it,’ says Graham, now 76. ‘We were both working in London and we had two children – our son was ten and our daughter was 13 when we moved in – so to be here at weekends in this beautiful setting was all we wanted. I’d do it all again.’ Graham did nearly all the work himself, and each brick and stone was recycled or salvaged to ensure authenticity. The result is a beautifully renovated period home that has received a commendation from Sussex Heritage Trust. Before buying Luxford, the Jameses lived in a 1970s-built house – which they hated –  in nearby Langton Green. They had previously renovated a Regency property in Leamington Spa, but other than that they had no professional training. They are, however, both art college graduates and very creative: Susan was head of the London College of Fashion, while Graham had his own graphic design company. Green project: Graham has done nearly all the work himself, and each brick and stone has been recycled or salvaged to ensure authenticity . They bought Luxford for £34,000, having sold their five-bedroom ‘executive home’  for £32,000. ‘We didn’t have a lot of money to fund the work,’ recalls Graham. ‘When we had money, we did what needed to be paid for. When we didn’t, I worked on whatever I could that didn’t cost anything except my labour.’ He says he did everything apart from ‘electrics and serious plastering’. ‘If I didn’t know how to do something, I learnt it so that I could do it properly,’ he adds. The Jameses had no idea the house had medieval origins until an antiques dealer who came to deliver a table recognised its age from the beamed dining-room ceiling. It turned out the room dated from the  15th Century, and records showed there were buildings on the site as far back as 1279. The dining room is the oldest part of the house, dominated by a large inglenook fireplace with a bread oven on one side. The sitting room next door is part of a  16th Century extension, with an even bigger fireplace containing a substantial groove where the residents would sharpen their kitchen knives. There’s also a sunny second sitting room, part of a Victorian extension, as well as a long kitchen and a breakfast room. An ancient wooden staircase leads up to the first floor, where what was once the biggest bedroom has been dubbed ‘the repository’ by the Jameses, as it’s now stuffed with antique furniture and tapestries. Yet another inglenook in  this room was discovered only during the couple’s renovations. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a dressing room,  all with their own quirky charm, complete this floor, while under the eaves of the top floor are two more large bedrooms as well as a study. Making a profit: The six-bedroom house is now on the market for £1.995million . While Graham was busy carrying out the heavy labour, Susan was focusing on the interior, finding exactly the right furniture  for each room. ‘Collecting antique furniture became another obsession,’ she says. ‘We got to know some of the dealers – they would ring us up if they had a piece they thought we’d like.’ The gardens were as much a labour of love as the house. What was once brambles and rubble is now a magical series of connecting courtyards, green lawns, lush borders and a wonderful walled garden. The once-silted pond now has an elegant curved bridge across the narrowest part. ‘Clearing that pond was one of my least favourite jobs,’ admits Graham. ‘When we moved in you could walk across it on dead trees and bulrushes.’ The couple bought several more acres of land when a neighbour put them on the market, bringing their total to more than  ten acres. ‘We had delusions of grandeur,’ jokes Graham. ‘But it was a chance to protect our view and add to the peaceful tranquillity.’ He has restored all the outbuildings with the same dedicated craftsmanship as the house. The piece de resistance is the oast house, which was just circular brickwork when the couple moved in. It is now a beautiful two-bedroom guesthouse which could easily be turned into holiday accommodation. The Jameses have reluctantly decided  to sell, putting the house on the market for £1.995 million. Now that Graham is 76 and Susan 74, a large house is more than they want to maintain. More importantly, Graham admits: ‘I haven’t had the same interest in the place since it was finished.’ The couple are proud of their efforts,  and whoever buys Luxford Farm will be the beneficiary of 38 years of loving attention and creative renovation. So where will the couple downsize to  – surely not a 1970s bungalow? ‘We’re open to ideas,’ laughs Graham. ‘But it has to be somewhere that fires our imagination.’ Hamptons International, 01892 516611 .","Graham and Susan James bought derelict Luxford Farm in 1976 .

"West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard will have no reason to complain about the state of the Upton Park pitch on Saturday because of new rules saying the grass cannot exceed 30 millimetres in height. After Liverpool won 2-1 in the corresponding fixture last season Gerrard, who scored two penalties, complained about West Ham’s direct style, the distance the team bus had to park from the ground, the temperature of the changing rooms and the pitch. Allardyce said: ‘We’ve all got “grass size” this year — a certain size of grass that we can’t go beyond. It’s one of the most bizarre rules I’ve ever seen. Someone’s got a measuring tape to see what size your grass is.’ Steven Gerrard's complaint about the pitch at Upton Park is nullified by new grass rules, says Sam Allardyce . Gerrard won Liverpool's returning match in the Champions League against Ludogorets with a penalty . Two penalties from Gerrard saw Liverpool claim a tough victory over West Ham last season . Gerrard claimed after the win in April that West Ham had ‘tried everything to upset’ them. Allardyce said: ‘They came and said that the coach couldn’t park where it should have parked, the changing rooms were too hot, the grass was too long and they still managed to win by two penalties.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has hit back at Allardyce’s claim that a lack of focus caused Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa last week because of their return to the Champions League. Rodgers said: ‘No we weren’t complacent. We are allergic to complacency here.’ Allardyce dismissed Liverpool's grievances about West Ham 'trying everything to upset them'","Steven Gerrard had a range of complaints after year's visit to West Ham .

"The brother of beheaded aid worker David Haines has read from the Koran in an impassioned plea for the world to 'repel evil with something better'. Mike Haines said extremism, not Islam, was to blame for the on-camera butchering of his brother, a married 44-year-old with two children who devoted his life to helping victims of war. David Haines was beheaded in a gruesome video released last night by the British Islamic State terrorist who has been dubbed 'jihadi John'. Scroll down for videos . Passionate appeal: Mike Haines, the brother of murdered British aid worker David Haines, read from the Koran in a tribute. He said: 'Since good and evil cannot be equal, repel evil with something that is better' Murdered: David Haines, 44, worked in warzones for more than two decades and was described as a hero . Speaking to the BBC, Mr Haines said: 'My first reaction could be one of hatred. But my brother's life wasn't about hatred. It was about love for all men. 'Radicalisation remains the biggest threat to the wholesale safety of every person in the world. Increasingly we are seeing more and more radicalisation in every walk of life. 'It is not a race, religion or political issue - it is a human issue and it is in our everyday lives. 'I have become aware of a number of verses in the Koran that I feel are particularly apt at this time, if I may. '""'Since good and evil cannot be equal, repel thou evil with something that is better.""' The quote comes from Chapter 41, Verse 34 of the Koran. He added: 'The Muslim faith is not to blame for Isil [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant], nor is it the fault of people of Middle Eastern descent. Evil: A still from the video, which was posted online last night, in which David Haines was beheaded. He was forced to recite a diatribe blaming David Cameron and Britain's foreign policy for his own execution . Not in our name: The propaganda video said it was speaking in the name of Islam - a claim rejected by moderates, the Prime Minister David Cameron and the brother of the latest victim of Islamist terrorism . Beloved: Born and raised in Scotland, Mr Haines had moved to Croatia to live with his second wife Dragana, 45 (right). They met when she was working as a translator and he wore a kilt at their wedding ceremony . 'The attraction of complete control and the use of terror as an implement of operational control has a widepsread appeal to many disenfranchised people throughout society, as you can see by the amount of foreign nationals - not just British - that are fighting for Isil. 'My family and I agree with the government that we need to identify those travelling to fight with Isil and hold them responsible for their actions.' Mr Haines was abducted in March last year while working in the Atmeh refugee camp for the French aid group Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED). It followed more than two decades of travelling with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, the former Yugoslavia and South Sudan. Mr Haines, described by the Prime Minister today as a British hero, dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines. Bleak: Mr Haines was abducted while working in the Atmeh refugee camp in Syria's northern province of Idlib . He was born in Holderness in East Yorkshire and brought up in Perth by his parents Herbert, 77, and Mary, 79, who now live in Ayr. He had a teenage daughter in Scotland from a previous marriage with his first wife, and a four-year-old daughter, Athea, in Croatia from his second wife. His brother added: 'We hoped, we prayed in our own way. Unfortunately it was not in our hands. It was in the hands of terrorists. 'We have been in constant contact with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the police and other authorities. 'We have, as a family, received all the support and cooperation that could under the circumstances be given. 'We can only praise and give our thanks to the agencies who have helped us during our time of need. 'We agree with the Government in that Isil are extremely dangerous, and pose a threat to every nation, every religion, every politics and every person.' Mr Haines was forced to recite a diatribe against the British government in the video, blaming David Cameron for his own execution. Mr Cameron responded by saying: 'They claim to do this in the name of Islam. That is nonsense. Islam is a religion of peace. They are not Muslims, they are monsters.' Today the Prime Minister vowed to hunt down Mr Haines' killer, who paraded a second British aid worker before the camera and warned he would be murdered next. Alan Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from Greater Manchester, was a volunteer on his second aid convoy to Syria despite having little experience because he felt a 'pull' to return and help refugees. Hostage: Alan Henning, a 47-year-old taxi-driver-turned-aid-worker from Manchester, was paraded in the clip.

"A nomadic movie fan has recreated some of the most famous moments on the big screen,  by photographing stills shots in their original locations. Christopher Maloney, 37, from Atlanta, spent more than two years travelling the world armed with a backpack full of stills from iconic cinema scenes. He scoured New York and visited Chicago, Toronto and Rome among other places to line up scenes from Home Alone, The Dark Knight and Rocky in their real locations. Fans of Home Alone 2: Lost in New York will recognise Duncan's Toy Chest, where mischievous Kevin lures crooks Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the 1992 blockbuster. For lovers of romantic comedies, the moment where Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan embrace when they were reunited in 1998 for You've Got Mail can be relived. Movie lover Christopher said: 'One day I noticed that the CNN building where I worked was next to the street the Stay Puft Man took in Ghostbusters. 'So, I printed off a shot from the movie, lined it up, and snapped a photo. 'It was quite popular when I posted it to Facebook. So, I did more.' The photographer calls his project FILMography and has set up a Tumblr website where visitors can access more than 500 photos of around 600 films all over the world. Perhaps the most iconic New York movie of all time: A still of Audrey Hepburn peering into the window of Tiffany's jewellery shop in Breakfast at Tiffany's . Memorable moments: Woody Allen and Diane Keaton feature in this shot from Annie Hall, pictured in the Manhattan streets where the film was set . The Rocky Steps, in Philadelphia, were made famous in the 1976 movie, when Sylvester Stallone  ran up them and raised his arms triumphantly at the top . Catch Me if You Can: Leonardo Di Caprio's character, Frank Abagnale, sauntered through the streets of Manhattan in his airline pilot uniform . You talkin' to me?

"In time, this may be remembered as the day Manchester United were reborn. The Gaal-acticos have found their mojo. It turned into a party, with 75,000 watching United move through the gears and give the fans what they want: goals, and lots of them. United settled on four, even though manager Louis van Gaal was after more when he sent on Falcao to join Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney in attack for the final 23 minutes. Wayne Rooney, Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria celebrate as the mood improved around Old Trafford . Radamel Falcao's arrival on the field was greeted with a rapturous reception by the home support . ‘Falcao, Falcao, give us a wave,’ demanded the Stretford End when the forward arrived on the pitch and the Colombian duly obliged. The build-up to his arrival on the field was momentous, with a whole stadium being swept along in the euphoria when Van Gaal sent his latest recruit dashing down the touchline to warm up. This was like the old United as they piled forward in search of goals, flooding Robert Green’s area and firing at will. QPR never stood a chance. Bravo Van Gaal, because the Dutch coach abandoned the disastrous three at the back and returned to the system English teams are most comfortable with. Marcos Rojo looked assured as part of a back four on his Manchester United debut on Sunday . Tyler Blackett marked himself out as a star of the future while Angel di Maria is already world class . A flat back four feels and sounds antiquated, but at least United’s defenders — Marcos Rojo, Tyler Blackett, Jonny Evans and Rafael — knew what they were doing. Rojo offered certainty, a composed figure alongside the improving and maturing Blackett. In time, Blackett can be one of the best. That’s the beauty of Van Gaal, because he has brought through some of the best talents in the game, Clarence Seedorf and Thomas Muller among them. Blackett is beginning to look the part. For all their eye-bulging spending over the past year, United and their fans know how to look after one of their own. Sunday, in a run that stretches back to October 1937, was the 3,705 successive match in which they have named a homegrown player in the matchday squad. It is early days for this new-look United, but this stadium responded to a team who played with purpose and pace. When you watch Angel di Maria contort his body to get past Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker, it is mesmerising. Angel di Maria scores his first Manchester United goal, and, whether deliberate or not, it was deserved . The Argentinian winger was the stand-out performer in a superb Manchester United display . Di Maria was replaced on 82 minutes, given a breather after 95 touches of the ball. Many of them were jaw-dropping. When he influences a game in this fashion, it is easy to understand why Cristiano Ronaldo was so critical of the decision by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to sell the deep-lying winger. During the international break, Di Maria scored once and set up three in Argentina’s destruction of world champions Germany in Dusseldorf. This was another bracing performance. He didn’t seem sure whether his free-kick was supposed to beat QPR’s keeper, but there was no doubt about the touch that led to Juan Mata’s goal. It was a day for standing ovations, from the moment the team walked off at half-time when United were three goals to the good, to Di Maria’s departure, to Falcao’s arrival on the field. The fans wanted goals and now they have them. ‘Rooney, Rooney,’ they chanted when the captain drilled United’s third goal from the edge of the area just before the break. The Old Trafford fans were clearly excited to see their stars in the flesh and were pleased with what they saw . Daley Blind impressed on his Manchester United debut sitting in front of the back four . Wayne Rooney's goal made it 3-0 before half time and was well-received by the Old Trafford faithful . United supporters have retained a sense of humour, singing, ‘We’re going to win the league’, as the ball kept rippling the back of Green’s net. That seems a long way off, but Van Gaal is up and running after an uncomfortable start. Only a couple of weeks ago, when United were beaten 4-0 at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup, the aura surrounding him seemed to be to wearing off. After this tub-thumping win, the doubts have evaporated. VIDEO Van Gaal happy to get goals on board .","Louis van Gaal abandons disastrous three-man defence .

"Eden Hazard close to signing new five-year deal at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week . Jose Mourinho has challenged Eden Hazard to become one of the world’s great players after confirming that the Chelsea forward is poised to sign a new contract. Sportsmail revealed how the Belgian was close to agreeing a new five-year deal worth £200,000 a week, and, speaking before Tuesday evening's Champions League clash against Schalke 04, Mourinho said he hopes the new deal will see Hazard reach even greater heights. ‘He is a fantastic player,’ said Mourinho. ‘We see day by day his motivation to work hard and improve. We have big hopes that he will go from the top player he is at this moment and reach higher levels to become one of the best.

Drogba could be in line for a start against Schalke as Mourinho looks to give star striker Diego Costa a rest as the Spaniard's Premier League exploits . ‘We are very proud that he thinks Chelsea is the perfect environment for him to have that evolution. ‘That’s why he wants to commit to us and we want to commit to him for the future too. ‘It will be a question of time, but it will end with a new contract.’ At times last season, however, it seemed Mourinho might have hesitated to sanction a deal that doubles Hazard’s wages. In May he said of Hazard: ‘He’s not the kind of player ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team and his mates.’ In November, Hazard was dropped for a match against tonight’s opponents for missing a training session after losing his passport. But now Mourinho insists the 23-year-old Belgium international is showing signs of maturity. ‘Even last season he was changing,’ said Mourinho. ‘It was a big evolution from the Hazard I met in Thailand (on pre-season) when I arrived. He was a kid always living on his natural talent... but there’s been a big improvement.’ Belgian winger Hazard (left) is sent into a fit of laughter by Chelsea striker Drogba (centre) as the pair head our for training with Cesc Fabregas (right) Cesc Fabregas (left) leaps for the ball during training as Costa and Oscar show off what looks to be a special handshake .

Mourinho believes his Chelsea side are yet to hit top gear despite winning their first four games of the 2014/15 Premier League campaign . Predicted line ups: Chelsea vs Schalke, Wednesday September 17 . The Portuguese boss also fired a chilling warning to Chelsea's rivals, insisting his side are yet to hit top gear despite their 100 per cent start to the season. The Blues have lived up to their tag as title favourites with a blistering start to the season, summer signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas in particular impressing for the Stamford Bridge club. But Mourinho insists there's still much more to come from his side ahead of Wednesday's Champions League opener. 'We are far from perfection, we try to improve every day,' said the Portuguese. 'There's things we do behind the scenes to improve everyday. There's different aspects added to our game all the time. 'There's been an evolution from last year. We feel he have the conditions to do better than last season.' Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic also believes although his side have enjoyed a bright start to the season, the Blues still have a long way to go if they are to collect any silverware this season. Sitting alongside Mourinho, Ivanovic said: 'Our squad looks good but we know the season is long, so we have to say on this level and be even better. 'I just try to do my best, I've got a couple of goals, but as a defender that's not so important. I really enjoy getting forward and it's good for the confidence when you score, but I prefer not to concede.' The team has had the unfamiliar presence of Petr Cech on the substitutes' bench after a decade in the first team, with Thibaut Courtois displacing him as first-choice goalkeeper. Mourinho declined to reveal who would start in goal, but insisted he has not designated competitions for his goalkeepers. 'Don't be surprised if he (Cech) plays a Champions League game or a Premier League game, or if Courtois plays a Capital One Cup game,' Mourinho said. 'What I don't do is this competition is for me and this competition is for you. I must make choices. Petr is more than ready to play every game.' Schalke could be in for a tough night if Chelsea continue their blistering start to the season with four Premier League wins in four games. By contrast, the Germans have just one point from their opening three Bundesliga fixtures. They also have major injury concerns over defenders Benedikt Howedes, Atsuto Uchida and Christian Fuchs.

"Greg Dyke has made a confused, faltering, ego-stricken start to his stint as FA chairman but he has taken a positive step in the right direction with proposals aimed at bringing more and better youngsters to the aid of England’s ailing national team. Stricter limitations on foreign imports and a prohibition against the big clubs signing players by the bucket-load and immediately farming them out on loan would create Premiership opportunities for home-grown talent. A pity, then, that this initiative has coincided with a faltering start to the Champions League by England’s leading clubs. Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski hold their heads after Arsenal's defeat by Borussia Dortmund . With Arsenal and Manchester City losing at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich respectively and Chelsea held at home by Schalke, our only winners this midweek were Liverpool. And they needed a last-gasp penalty from Steven Gerrard to struggle past a team nobody here had heard of until last month and whose name few of us can pronounce. These ragged showings are likely to set up another raft of over-priced buys from abroad when that transfer window creaks open again in January. Even if their Euro-results improve in the meantime, they have been warned as to how difficult the Germans will be to beat when it comes to the sharp end of the Champions League in the new year. Since the answer to that threat will not be to bring on young English talent, do not expect the Premier League to be encouraged by its biggest paymasters to accede to Dyke’s reforms. Do not expect, for example, Chelsea to be forced to rein back on their 26 – yes, 26 – players currently being borrowed by other clubs here and on the Continent. Dyke made a pompous ass of himself when he declared that England would not bid for any future World Cup while Sepp Blatter is still president of FIFA but he is right to highlight the abuse of UEFA’s transfer system. But is it likely to make much difference? Not while the giant clubs effectively run our national game for their own selfish ends. James Milner (left), Martin Demichelis and Gael Clichy (right) after Manchester City's loss at Bayern Munich . Football, the universal language . Arsene Wenger admits ‘it would have been a paradox’ if Arsenal had taken their couple of half chances in Dortmund and deprived Borussia of a deserved victory. You have to love him, managing in his second language as he does. Arsene Wenger is stoney-faced as Arsenal are beaten in Dortmund . Yes or No, Blatter knows home nations back him on TV referrals . It seems that fooball was the only element of the United Kingdom in a win-win situation as Scotland voted on the independence referendum. If we are waking up to a Yes on Friday morning, it will be an end to the pressure from the wider football world for Britain, England included, to field a combined team in World Cups. If it’s No, FIFA president Sepp Blatter will reinforce the position of the four home associations on the International Board which rules on the regulations of the game. He knows he has the support of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish for the introduction of TV referrals of disputed decisions during matches. Ole's a goner from Cardiff - Pardew could be next .

Twenty-one years after his premature death the legacy of Bobby Moore grows ever stronger, not least through the raising of millions of pounds to help fight the bowel cancer which killed the only England captain ever to raise the World Cup aloft. Driven by the unstinting commitment of his widow Stephanie, the Bobby Moore Fund has now surpassed £20million. That figure will grow significantly this November when the most lucrative annual event in the Fund’s calendar takes place in London.

"American sprinter Wallace Spearmon has accepted a three-month suspension after testing positive for methylprednisolone, the United States Anti-Doping Agency has announced. The 29-year-old 200 metres specialist returned a positive test in an in-competition urine sample collected at the Edmonton International Track Classic in July. Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticosteroid prohibited in competition and classified as a specified substance, meaning its presence can come with a reduced sanction. Wallace Spearmon has accepted a three-month suspension after testing positive for methylprednisolone . USADA said in a statement: 'USADA announced today that Wallace Spearmon, Jr, of Fayetteville, Ark, an athlete in the sport of track & field, has tested positive for a prohibited substance and accepted a three-month sanction for his rule violation.' The anti-doping body added in the statement that it accepted Spearmon's explanation that the substance was not being used to enhance performance, but 'he was taking the prescribed medication in a therapeutic dose under the care of a physician'. Spearmon, though, failed to apply for a therapeutic use exemption before using the medication. His three-month ban was backdated to start on August 27. Spearmon is a former world 4x100m relay champion and world 200m silver medallist. He is the seventh fastest man over 200m in history with a best of 19.65 seconds.

Isis launched an offensive to capture Kobane On September 15 and have advanced steadily despite U.S.-led air strikes . Mr Khalil added that Kobani is now almost empty of civilians and that the situation around the town is 'very dangerous'. He said Kurdish fighters in the town 'will fight until the last gunman and last gunwoman'. The Observatory reported intense shelling of Kobani, saying that a volunteer fighting with the Kurdish force known as the People's Protection Unit, or YPK, was killed. It said at least 60 shells had struck the town today. A journalist at the Turkish border town of Suruc reported intense shelling of Kobani from the south and west. Ismet Sheikh Hassan, the Kurdish defence minister for the Kobani region, said IS fighters were trying to advance from the east, west and south east of Kobani. He said jihadis fired rockets on the town, and called on the US-led coalition 'to hit the tanks instead of bases'.

HMS Defender is using its hi-tech air defence weapons to protect US navy aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush and her aircraft as they launch air strikes as part of the international coalition. The Portsmouth-based Type-45 destroyer is using its air defence radar and Sea Viper missile system as part of an 'umbrella' of support for the Nimitz class aircraft carrier and its escort ships while they patrol the Gulf and launch air strikes against the terrorist group IS. Deployed to the Gulf in June 2014, HMS Defender's primary role has been to conduct maritime security operations. It is now operating with the US navy's Arleigh-Burke class destroyers USS Truxton and USS Roosevelt and the Ticonderoga class destroyer USS Philippine Sea to provide support for the aircraft carrier. Engaged in round-the-clock operations, HMS Defender's task is to build an accurate air surveillance picture over the whole of the Gulf in order to guard the US aircraft carrier against possible air attack.

HMS Defender is seen in the background as a American jet takes off from  the US Navy aircraft carrier, USS George H W Bush . Royal Navy Commander Phil Nash, Defender's commanding officer, said: 'As an air defence destroyer, HMS Defender was built for exactly the sort of tasking that we are conducting in support of the USS George HW Bush. 'Since we arrived in the Gulf in June, we have been engaged in exercises with navies from around the world to test our air defence capabilities and I am delighted that my ship's company now have an opportunity to put into practice the training they have received over the past few months. 'This will be our primary role in the future, so to be able to provide the same defensive shield to a US navy aircraft carrier that we will deliver as part of a British carrier strike group is an excellent chance to prove the value we can add in a national and international environment.' Commodore Keith Blount, the United Kingdom Maritime Component Commander based in Bahrain, said: 'HMS Defender is just one of several Royal Navy ships deployed to the Gulf, which demonstrates the importance of the region to the United Kingdom and how much we value the relationships we have with our regional partners and allies. 'The decision by the Government to task a Royal Navy destroyer to support operations against Isil (IS) also shows the United Kingdom's commitment to combat terrorism. 'The ship's company of HMS Defender can be proud that, in whatever they are doing on board, they are actively contributing to the security of the region and the interests of the United Kingdom.'

"Manchester United are expected to announce record revenues on Wednesday of around £420million for last season with a £25m profit helped by sales of two million replica shirts worldwide. The annual results should also include details of pay-offs to former manager David Moyes and his coaching team, but the figures will not reflect any financial losses incurred from failing to qualify for Europe for this season. The key results have already been flagged up in a prospectus released in August for a new release of shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Money men: United vice-chairman Edward Woodward (centre), Joel Glazer (left) and Richard Arnold (right) Magnificent Seven: Angel di Maria is the latest to wear the iconic Manchester United number seven shirt .

By comparison Real Madrid's turnover was £480m but that includes player sales. Profit for the year is expected to be £23m to £25m - significantly down from the £146.4m for 2012-13 but that was mainly due to a one-off tax credit. Approximately five million Manchester United-branded licensed products were sold last year including two million replica shirts. Commercial revenue is expected to be up 25 per cent to around £190m due to pre-season tours and higher sponsorship renewals. Operating costs are due to be up 20 per cent to £373m mainly due to expenditure on transfer fees and higher player wages.

"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left Cardiff City by mutual consent, bringing an end to a hugely underwhelming eight-month spell at the club for the Norwegian. The final straw, on the back of last season's relegation, was Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat against Middlesbrough, which left Cardiff 17th in the Championship. Solskjaer was called to London on Wednesday morning for lengthy talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman who, on the instruction of absent owner Vincent Tan, opened discussions on terms for the 41-year-old's exit. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left Cardiff City  after a disappointing spell that lasted just eight months . Cardiff owner Vincent Tan instructed chairman Mehmet Dalman to hold exit talks with the Norwegian . During the course of those conversations, it was put to Solskjaer that the club wanted to head in a new direction, with the former Manchester United striker admitting on Thursday: 'Our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside.' A prominent club source is adamant that Tan and other senior figures were not seeking to influence team selection. Solskjaer's exit comes on the same day Dundee said their manager Paul Hartley, Cardiff's leading target, was staying at the club. And Tony Pulis, who was attending an event at one of Tan's hotels in Malaysia, also indicated to a TV reporter that he would prefer a job in the Premier League. He added that he has not been approached by Cardiff. Solskjaer said: 'I want to thank Vincent for giving me the opportunity to manage Cardiff City FC. He has my full respect and I really wish him all the best in his pursuit of making this football club successful. 'However, our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside and allow the club to move forward in the direction Vincent wants. 'I leave the club with some very talented players and want to thank them for their efforts and hope to see them challenge for promotion this season. I also want to thank Mehmet Dalman for his continued and loyal support and feel I have gained a new friend.' Cardiff want to appoint Dundee manager Paul Hartley as the new boss, but the Scottish club are resisting . Solskjaer's team lost 1-0 to Middlesbrough on Tuesday night as their poor run of form continued . The club confirmed that Danny Gabbidon, who returned to the club as a player-coach this month, will join academy coach Scott Young in preparing the side for this weekend's trip to Derby. Tan added: 'Ole was hired by Cardiff City on our understanding and belief that he would help us fight relegation from the Premier League. Unfortunately that did not happen. After the club was relegated many people advised me to let him go, but I decided to keep Ole on for the Championship season. Regrettably our recent results do not justify Ole's continued role as manager at Cardiff. 'Ole has therefore decided to step down and I have accepted this. During my short association with Ole, I have found him to be an honest and hard-working professional, but unfortunately the football results were not in his favour. 'As long as I am the owner of this club, Ole and his family will always be welcome in the Chairman's Suite as my guests. I wish Ole the very best in his future career in football. We now begin the process of finding his replacement and working towards giving all our stakeholders in Cardiff City the results they deserve.' Cardiff are also interested in  Tony Pulis but the Welshman wants a job with a Premier League club . A senior source at the club told Sportsmail that relations between Solskjaer and the club's hierarchy remained 'amicable', but added that serious doubts were raised after Cardiff threw away a 2-0 lead in the 4-2 defeat against Norwich on Saturday. Dalman said: 'Having spoken with Ole on deciding the best course of action for all parties, I'm sorry to say that we have agreed that it is in the best interest of the club for us to go our separate ways. 'Ole has been a wonderful professional to work with since his arrival at the club. Due to a difference in philosophy of approach to the game, we have decided to part company amicably. He and his family will always be welcome at Cardiff City. I know I have gained a good friend whom I wish well and remain confident in his future success.' There are some at the club who are keen on giving the manager's job to former player Craig Bellamy . Contact is said to have been made with Hartley, with several prominent Cardiff sources claiming he was the leading candidate. But Dundee released a statement on Thursday – before the Cardiff release confirming Solskjaer's departure – that insisted Hartley has 'long-term plans' to stay at the club. It read: 'The club would like to confirm that manager Paul Hartley has long term plans to stay at Dundee Football Club. 'Paul is committed to the club and is looking forward and focused on the upcoming derby matches this week. Solskjaer (right) applauds the fans as the Welsh club are relegated from the Premier League at Newcastle . 'As a club, we are not surprised that speculation linking Paul to other clubs has come up due to the fantastic job he continues to do at Dens Park. 'The club and Paul see the solid foundation which has already been put in place as the beginning of a long term plan which will see Paul at the helm of the club for years to come.' Tony Pulis, meanwhile, is currently unlikely to step down to the Championship, but he has admirers at the club. Glenn Roeder was pictured in the directors' box on Tuesday, though he is not currently thought to be a managerial candidate, while there are also elements of the club who favour Craig Bellamy's return. The decision will be largely down to Tan. Despite the club's relegation as the Premier League's bottom-placed club – Cardiff were 17th when Malky Mackay was sacked - Tan was determined to stick with Solskjaer, though it was made clear that promotion in this campaign was the only acceptable target. Instead, Cardiff have plummeted after a promising start and are currently winless in their past four Championship games. In all, Cardiff have won only five of their 25 league matches under Solskjaer. Glenn Roeder was pictured in the Cardiff directors' box on Tuesday but is not thought to be a candidate . The poor results come in spite of vast investment in the squad, with Tan having spent roughly £16m on 17 new players since Solskjaer took over. Dalman was also permitted to sign off on one of the division's biggest wage bills. But Solskjaer has consistently given off the impression that he does not know his best line-up or formation, having kept an unchanged side only once in league fixtures – a factor that is believed to be behind the 'philosophy' differences. Further to that, Solskjaer's promise of attacking football, which was so alluring to Tan, has not materialised, with only eight goals scored in the league this season. Cardiff City Supporters' Trust chairman, Tim Hartley believes that the new manager needs to quickly inject some energy into the club. Enrique Kike Garcia celebrates after scoring against Cardiff for Middlesbrough in Solskjaer's final match . He said: 'Given the team’s performances on the field this season, it was inevitable that the manager’s position would come under scrutiny. 'What is needed now is a new manager who can energise the players and take the club up the Championship table. 'The next appointment of a manager will be crucial. The club must get the decision spot on because there is need for stability and renewed success at the football club. 'Chairman, Mehmet Dalman, cites a ""difference in philosophy"" of approach to football in his statement. The departure of Ole again flags up the need for the club to have some recognised footballing knowledge and experience in the boardroom to ensure we get and then keep a manager who knows his football and can push forward for promotion. We wish Ole all the best for the future.'","Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left Cardiff  after just eight months in charge .

"Airplane economy-class passengers of the future could enjoy almost as much luxury as those travelling in first class thanks to a revolutionary new kind of airline seat. AirGo airline seats, brainchild of Malaysia-based engineering student Alireza Yaghoubi, are a low-cost, ergonomic approach to economy class cabin design. As anyone who has travelled in the cheap seats knows, today's standard reclining models, which have not had a major design upgrade since the Sixties, leave little space if the passenger in front decides to lean back. Each seat in the Airgo design has its own storage pod above the seat, which also contains the tray table and entertainment screen . The aircraft seat of the future: The radical new design can give passengers more room - and stop the nightmare of reclining passengers i front causing problems . To solve this problem, AirGo seats sit in an independent space for each row - yet are so cleverly designed that they take up just 16 per cent more space. Last year Mr Yaghoubi, who studies at the University of Malaya, won the Malaysian national James Dyson Award, an annual award run by the the British inventor's foundation, for his groundbreaking design. He was inspired to come up with the elegant solution after a series of cramped and uncomfortable eight-hour flights back home to visit his family. 'Ergonomic features in economy class seats nowadays are limited to a mere reclining ability,' said Mr Yaghoubi, which, he explained, causes more problems than it solves. He told ABC News of a typical flight experience in which the passenger in front reclines his seat, taking up 'one third of the space I have paid for.' What's more, as well as the uncomfortable space invasion, such seating space interlopers also take screens and fold out tables out of suffering passengers' control because of the way they are fixed to the seat in front, he says. 'It gets worse when the person in front decides to recline his/ her seat and the screen as well as the tray is then no more in your control,' he said. To solve the problem, Mr Yaghoubi designed AirGo to not only give every passenger a minimum personal space, but also give them full control over their monitor and table without affecting others seated behind. Each pod can be moved without affecting nearby passengers - and seats only take 17% more space than existing economy seating . The unique design includes both a tray table and drop down screen . This he has done by separating the seat's tray and screen from the seat in front, and instead having each floating from the hand luggage locker above the passenger. The back support of AirGo is made of flexible, but strong nylon mesh which readily takes the shape of your body to avoid fatigue and whilst also preventing sweating. A set of 3 motors within the design of each chair allows passengers to customise the seating position to perfectly fit their posture - helping them to avoid neck and back pain. And instead of having a footrest on someone else’s seat, the footrest is now part of the passenger's own seat and can be controlled to maximise comfort. The touch-screen through which the system is controlled is also meant for entertainment and is fixed independently from the seats, so passengers can easily move the arms to configure its position. The tray has a similar mechanism. Of course, airlines are hardly likely to install new seats that take up more space just to make their passengers more comfortable, and Mr Yaghoubi conceded that at first glance they would seem to come at significant cost. The cabin design claims to offer first class comfort, but in a much smaller footprint so airlines can use it as a new 'mid-class' seat . The back support of AirGo is made of flexible, but strong nylon mesh which readily takes the shape of your body to avoid fatigue and whilst also preventing sweating . Seats taking up 16 per cent more floor space would leave airlines with 16 per cent fewer seats to fill. However, Mr Yaghoubi said the bigger screens could allow the companies to make up for their lost revenue by selling a range of in-flight 'extras' - in much the same way Apple makes money selling apps for their mobile devices. 'The big screen for example can be used to encourage passengers to purchase a few dollar applications, movies, songs, games and books that could be used on their other devices elsewhere through cloud syncing,' he told ABC. 'They [the passengers] can video chat with others and call home for small rates or they can choose to take part in surveys or watch advertisements to use these services free of charge. 'They can connect to the local network and play matches against other passengers. 'The possibilities are just countless.' Mr Yaghoubi was the winner of the 2012 Malaysian national James Dyson award. The competition opens again this year on March 14.

"Murderous prison gangs in an overcrowded jail in the state of Maranhão, north eastern Brazil, left 10 dead and 30 injured in a violent uprising on Thursday. Rioting broke out in the Pedrinhas Penitentiary Complex in the city of São Luis between rival factions  and spilled out into the city centre, where marauding supporters torched seven buses and besieged the local hospital. The mutiny started after several prisoners refused to allow wardens to carry out an inspection of their cells. The situation rapidly escalated into a confrontation between the officers and the detainees. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO: GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Violent end: Dead and mutilated bodies are lined up outside the Pedrinhas prison, near Sao Luis, Brazil . Carnage: An injured prisoner is carried out through crowds of anxious relatives . Bloody revolt: Injured prisoners lie on the ground awaiting treatment outside the jail . 'The uprising began after wardens discovered that 60 prisoners were digging a tunnel through which they intended to escape,' said Aluísio Mendes, secretary of public security in Maranhão. 'When prison officials tried to access the block, the prisoners rebelled.' The standoff sparked fierce clashes between opposing prison mobsters and spiralled out of control as inmates went on a killing spree. Rioters set fire to the prison blocks as special elite shock troops were sent in to contain the situation. Guns, homemade bombs and other lethal weapons were found inside the jail which was built to hold 400 but currently detains over 600 inmates. A representative from the Commission on Human Rights for Brazil’s legal profession, Diogo Cabral, who was present as an observer at the scene said:  'I am very shocked at what happened.  If the shock troops had been dispatched earlier maybe the barbarism and the death toll could have been avoided.' Burning rage: Violence erupted across the city and this bus was torched by angry relatives awaiting news . Wreckage: Firefighters continue to pour water on a burned out bus in the city of Sao Luis . Anger: A relative hurls stones at the prison in frustration amid chaotic scenes outside . Relatives and onlookers outside the prison, waiting developments, reacted angrily by throwing stones in an attempt to break into the jail. In the city centre, gangs linked to the prisoners set fire to seven buses after ordering passengers off. The local hospital where the injured were transferred to had to be manned with extra police as mobs threatened to invade the complex. In a statement, a state government spokesperson linked the rebellion to the apprehension a few days before of  39 people during a party at a beach house in Araçagi to celebrate the birthday of a drug dealer known as ‘Babs’. Rival gang members were accused of using the mayhem to carry out revenge attacks and killings. Police officers have been involved in an ongoing campaign to break up gangs in the area, which is riven with regular turf wars and violent clashes between the largest gang known as Tram 40, and its opposition the PCM. Brazil is due to host next year's World Cup. Maranhao is nearly 1,000km away from Fortaleza, one of the closest host cities,  which is on Brazil's north east coastline. An earlier outbreak of violence on Tuesday this week left three prisoners dead during a transfer of 18 detainees at the same penitentiary. One was decapitated. Two other inmates and one prison guard were wounded. The mutiny ended the same day with the arrival of the elite troops. In April 2011, inmates were involved in one of the largest and bloodiest rebellions that lasted about 30 hours in the São Luis penal complex. The revolt left 18 dead, three of them by beheading. Five prison guards were held hostage. At one point police attempting to break into the site were held back by the convicts who threw two severed heads over the wall. The criminals had gone on the rampage demanding better treatment saying the food wasn’t fit for human consumption and the water was polluted and rank.","Violence erupted when prison officers tried to access the escape tunnel .

"Hamburg SV have sacked coach Mirko Slomka after the former European champions' bad start to the Bundesliga season, the club said on Tuesday. The 47-year-old Slomka, who took over at Hamburg in February, was informed of the decision on Monday, club officials told reporters. Hamburg director Dietmar Beiersdorfer said under-23 coach Joe Zinnbauer would take temporary charge of the first team.

Despite signing the likes of Lewis Holtby (left) Hamburg have not scored a single goal yet this season . Slomka was tasked with lifting Hamburg away from relegation last season but they still needed a playoff to stay up and protect their perfect record of having played in the Bundesliga every season since its creation in 1963.

Newcomers Lewis Holtby, U.S. international Julian Green and winger Nicolai Mueller have so far failed to deliver with Hamburg having failed to score yet while Swiss international Valon Behrami and centre back Cleber have failed to plug a leaky defence.

"Eden Hazard is on the verge of is signing a new contract with Chelsea worth a staggering £200,000 a week. Talks with the Chelsea forward’s lawyer are at an advanced stage and the club are hoping to conclude negotiations with the Belgian international within the next few weeks. Hazard’s extended deal, which will be worth around £10million to the forward over the next five seasons, will also be a bitter blow to long-term suitors Paris St Germain. Eden Hazard (left) is close to signing a new five-year deal at Chelsea worth a staggering £200,000 a week . The Chelsea winger has scored 31 goals in 114 appearances since signing for £32million from Lille in 2012 . Jose Mourinho confirmed on Tuesday: 'It's true Chelsea is trying to have an agreement for a new contract (for Hazard). 'It will be a question of time. It will end with a new contract. 'He wants to commit to us and we want to commit to him for the future.' Hazard is now one of Chelsea’s most influential players and he will be rewarded with a deal that reflects his growing status at the club. The Chelsea forward, who was named the club’s player of the year at the end of last season, was given the No 10 shirt vacated by Juan Mata at the start of the new campaign. Hazard only joined the club two years ago from Lille in a deal worth £32m and has settled in to life in London after some initial difficulties. His partnership with new signing Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa continues to flourish and he is now considered to be one of the club’s biggest assets.

They announced last week that Thibaut Courtois, who has replaced Petr Cech as the club’s first choice keeper, has signed a new five year contact. Chelsea want to protect their interests by committing the best young talent to long-term contracts, but they are also being rewarded with huge rises. Hazard’s deal with Chelsea was worth around £100,000 when he arrived from Lille two years ago, but he will double that when he signs his new contract with the club. Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho continues to influence the key decisions at the club and he has built a new team at Chelsea after a year of transition following his return from Real Madrid. After their Champions League group game with Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, they will turn their attentions to a reunion with referee Mike Dean at the Etihad on Sunday. Dean hasn’t refereed a Chelsea fixture since his unbeaten home record came to an end following the defeat against Sunderland at Stamford Bridge last season. Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly interesting in Hazard during the summer but he is committed to Chelsea . At the time, Mourinho sarcastically said: ‘Congratulations to Mike Dean because he made a fantastic performance and congratulations to Mike Riley, because what they did during the season was fantastic for the way the championship is going. ‘Congratulations to all of them and I have nothing more to say.’ Mourinho was later fined £10,000 by the Football Association, but insists he has no issue with Dean, or referees’ chief Mike Riley.","Chelsea winger Eden Hazard to sign new five-year deal at Stamford Bridge .

"Adnan Januzaj staked a claim for being included in Louis van Gaal's side to face Leicester City at the weekend by netting a hat-trick for Manchester United's Under 21 team in a 4-0 win over Sunderland. The Belgium youngster played just eight minutes of Manchester United's emphatic 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers at the weekend after coming on for summer signing Angel di Maria. Januzaj will have to bide his time at Old Trafford over the course of the season following the arrival of Di Maria, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao - but showed his true quality in front of the watching Van Gaal. Red Devils starlet Adnan Januzaj hit a hat-trick for Manchester United on Monday night . Adnan Januzaj makes it 4-0 by scoring past Sunderland goalkeeper Maksymilian Stryjek . Anderson congratulates Adnan Januzaj after the Belgium international completes the scoring . Louis van Gaal and his wife Truus watched Manchester United's game against Sunderland at Old Trafford . Louis van Gaal's assistant managers Albert Stuivenberg and Ryan Giggs watched the game along with first team fitness coach Tony Strudwick and former Manchester United striker Michael Owen . Manchester United: Amos; Janko, McNair, Vermijl, Shaw (Pearson 46); Thorpe, Anderson (Rothwell 72), A. Pereira, Harrop; Januzaj (Weir 83), W. Keane . Substitutes not used: O'Hara, Grimshaw . Scorers: Januzaj 20, 27, 81; A. Pereira 22 . Sunderland: Stryjek, Cartwright, T Robson, Agnew, McNamee, Ferguson, Watmore, Smith (E Robson 65), Gooch (Pybus 87), Lawson, Greenwood (Oliver 65) Substitutes not used: Dixon, Sukar . Manchester United assistant managers Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg along with fitness coach Tony Strudwick were also at Old Trafford to witness Januzaj's impressive performance. It will give Van Gaal food for thought as his expensively-assembled squad fight for places in the starting line-up. First team stars Luke Shaw and Anderson also played a part in Manchester United's victory in a bid to step up their fitness. Shaw was denied the chance to make his Manchester United debut at the weekend as Van Gaal instead opted to start fellow summer signing Marcos Rojo at left back. Anderson, on the other hand, was left out of the Dutchman's 18-man squad despite the fact fellow central midfielders Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini missed the game through injury. Summer signing Luke Shaw also started Manchester United's match against Sunderland . Luke Shaw will be hoping to start Manchester United's next Premier League match against Leicester City . Andreas Pereira, who was an unused substitute against QPR at the weekend, grabbed the other goal in a convincing win for Manchester United. Januzaj was eager to impress and it took just two minutes for the Belgium international to create his first opening - Anderson slipped him in but Januzaj's shot found only the side netting. Saidy Janko was the next to pose a threat, bursting forward and firing narrowly wide of the mark. A United goal was inevitable and Januzaj duly obliged in the 20th minute when he played a one-two with Will Keane before placing the ball into the net with a low left-footed drive. Brazil Under 20 international Pereira doubled the lead just three minutes later after getting on the end of a  cross by Shaw, who had been found by Josh Harrop's astute pass out wide. Manchester United forked out £30million to bring Luke Shaw to the club from Southampton . Adnan Januzaj came close to scoring against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday afternoon . Sunderland were shell-shocked and Januzaj added a third on 27 minutes - United's third goal in the space of just seven minutes - with a typically composed finish after Keane and Shaw combined to good effect. Januzaj almost completed his hat-trick before the break after Janko again powered forward from the back. The Belgian produced some lovely pieces of skill but could only locate the side-netting. United slowed down the pace in the second half though Anderson nearly scored the fourth when his strike beat Sunderland goalkeeper Maksymilian Stryjek but rebounded back off the post. Januzaj completed the rout in the second half after he beat  Stryjek from close range after Marnick Vermijl had delved deep into enemy territory.","The Belgium ace was in devastating form for United's development side .
