"(CNN) -- Cecilia Lopez, a student who is the first person from her family to go to college, sees something of herself in the first Hispanic woman to be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic person to serve on the Supreme Court. ""To me, as a student that comes from a low-income background, I think she's a true example of the fact that when you're wanting to achieve something, it's truly possible, regardless of your background,"" said Lopez, a 20-year-old senior at the University of Texas. On Tuesday, President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor, a woman of Puerto Rican descent, to the U.S. Supreme Court. If confirmed, Sotomayor will be the first Hispanic person and only the third woman to serve on the nation's highest court. In the wake of the nomination, Hispanics celebrated Sotomayor as a symbol of success and also as a reflection of the changing demographics of the country. In a sense, she is the Hispanic community's answer to Obama's narrative -- a sign that, as Lopez said, anything is possible in America if a person works hard enough, no matter their race or economic situation. Sotomayor, 54, a federal judge in New York, rose from humble beginnings. She grew up in a South Bronx housing project, supported by her mother, who worked six days a week. Sotomayor has called her mother her inspiration and said she instilled in her the values of education. Sotomayor went on to attend Princeton University and Yale Law School. Her story of battling past obstacles is an inspiration for all Hispanic people, said Roberto Ramirez, president-elect of the Puerto Rican Bar Association. ""It would be hard for anyone to argue that somehow merit and talent and commitment and perseverance ... does not ultimately yield the kind of achievement that is recognized by everyone,"" he said. Although it may not be possible for everyone to succeed against the odds, ""at this juncture, we are closer to the ideal than we have ever been,"" Ramirez said. Gender, ethnicity and socioeconomics are no longer the obstacles they once were, he said. Advocacy groups had been putting pressure on Obama to nominate a minority to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice David Souter. Minorities on the court have been rare in its 220-year history. All but two of the 110 justices have been men, and only two of them have not been white, according to CNN's political unit. Ramirez said Latino people have been waiting a long time for a person of Latino descent to be nominated to the court. But he said he's so excited now that the wait doesn't seem to matter. ""It's here! It is the right nominee. It is a woman who will make this country and the U.S. Supreme Court proud, so I'm not going to ask whether it was a long time coming,"" he said. ""I'm just glad that it is here."" David Perez, a 23-year-old student at Yale Law School, where Sotomayor attended, said many people in the Hispanic community feel such excitement about the nomination that they're almost numb. ""People are going to remember where they were when they heard about this nomination,"" he said. The nomination also makes the court a more accurate reflection of America's racial demographics, Ramirez said. Hispanics are the largest minority group in the United States, and their presence is expected to continue to grow. About 12.5 percent of people in the United States were Hispanic in the 2000 Census, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By mid-century, Hispanic people will make up nearly a quarter of the U.S. population, the bureau estimates. Sotomayor's nomination ""helps to create a tapestry of this country that is very reflective of the people who live in it,"" Ramirez said. However, some conservatives in the Hispanic community said a judicial nominee's ethnic background and life story are not as important as his or her interpretations of the law. ""While it is laudable and desirable to have a Supreme Court that reflects a diversity of views and backgrounds, Justices must check these at the Supreme Court door,"" Raquel Rodriguez, a Miami attorney who was general counsel to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, said in a prepared statement. ""Personal views must be surrendered in favor of applying the law."" Anne Guarnera, spokeswoman for the Hispanic College Fund, said Latinos are inspired by the fact that someone of their ethnic group is being portrayed in such a positive light. Sotomayor will inspire young Latinas to chase their dreams, she said. ""I think her cultural background does give her an advantage in being a role model for these students,"" she said. ""It's, in a way, redeeming or affirming to see someone who looks like you succeeding in the public sphere."" Lopez, the college student in Texas, said she always thought her dream of becoming a prominent Latina attorney was possible. But Sotomayor's nomination serves as proof, she said. ""It's always better when there's precedent and you feel that someone else has been able to do it; I can do it, too,"" she said.","If confirmed, Sonia Sotomayor will be the first Hispanic person on Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- F1 history will be made in Friday's first practice at the Italian Grand Prix when Ma Qing Hua takes to the Monza track for HRT. Qing Hua will become the first Chinese driver to compete in an official F1 competition when he takes over from India's Narain Karthikeyan for the session. The 24-year-old will not compete in the actual race, but is pleased to be closer to fulfilling that ambition by rubbing shoulders with the likes of title leader Fernando Alonso of Ferrari. ""This is a very important step towards my dream of becoming a Formula One driver,"" he told the official F1 website. ""I'm excited, but also calm about it because I've been training hard in the past months to be prepared when the opportunity presented itself."" Qing Hua acquired his FIA super license, which allows him to compete in F1, during a test earlier this year at Silverstone. He has previously competed in Formula Renault, A1 Grand Prix and Formula Three as well as winning last year's Chinese Touring Car Championship. HRT team boss Luis Perez-Sala has had no hesitation in giving the young driver his chance to compete at the top level. ""He has proven himself as a quick and safe driver with a great capability to adapt, besides also possessing a very positive and professional attitude. ""Without a doubt, this is a very important step which comes with great responsibility, but we consider he's prepared to take it on.""

"(CNN) -- A runaway teen who said her father threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity has been returned from Florida to Ohio, but not yet to her family, her mother's lawyer said Tuesday. Rifqa Bary, 17, is in the custody of Franklin County Children Services while other issues in the case are settled, attorney Roger Weeden said. ""We're very happy that Rifqa is back where she should be, close to her parents,"" Weeden said. ""The allegations of abuse and neglect were unfounded. Now some unification can begin."" A Florida judge ruled earlier this month in favor of her parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, who had requested that their daughter be transferred to Ohio. The teen's attorney, John Stemberger, who leads a Christian advocacy organization, opposed the move. The teen left her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July and took refuge in the home of a minister in Orlando, Florida. She was later moved into foster care after she said in an affidavit that her Muslim father had threatened her after finding out about her conversion. Her father has denied the allegation. Judge Daniel Dawson, in his October 13 decision, said it was in Bary's best interest for her emergency custody case to continue in Ohio. The transfer was delayed until the teen's immigration status was determined. Attorneys for the parents, who are from Sri Lanka, sent her immigration documents to the court within two weeks. Her return to Ohio comes after months of legal wrangling, including the affidavit from the teenager claiming that her father was pressured by the family's mosque in Ohio to ""deal with the situation,"" referring to her conversion. In an earlier court filing, Rifqa Bary alleged that her father said, ""If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me."" The teenager claims her father added, ""I will kill you."" Mohamed Bary, 47, has denied the accusations. ""We wouldn't do her harm,"" he said, saying he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations. ""I have no problem with her practicing any faith,"" Bary said, but acknowledged that he prefers that she practice Islam. A report by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement says, ""Our investigation has provided no clear evidence of criminal activity."" During a Florida court hearing, the teen periodically read a Bible, as did many of her supporters who filled the courtroom. The supporters said they were disappointed by the ruling, but believe Jesus is with Bary no matter where she goes. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Rifqa Bary has returned to Ohio, but she is not back with her family, lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- A sheriff's deputy who was shot and killed at a trailer park in western Ohio has been identified, as has the suspect who was also killed. Deputy Suzanne Hopper was investigating reports of gunfire in the area Saturday when she was killed, Clark County Sheriff Gene Kelly said. ""Our deputy never had the opportunity to return fire or take cover,"" the sheriff said. A second law enforcement officer also was shot at the Enon Beach trailer park in suburban Springfield, Ohio. The officer, Jeremy Blum, is in fair condition, Rebecca Czachor, a spokeswoman for the Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, said Sunday. Video from CNN affiliate WDTN shows Blum being shot. He falls to the ground and rolls before other officers help him out of the line of fire. The suspect, identified by authorities as Michael Ferryman, 57, was shot and killed, said Kelly. The sheriff praised Hopper as an outstanding deputy. He said she was married and the mother of two children.

Residents of the city awakened to crumbling walls, crushed cars, fallen trees and scattered branches after heavy rain, wind and hail hit Wednesday night, the state-run Telam agency said. ""The level of virulence of this storm is not normal,"" said Diego Santilli, the city's environment minister, according to Telam. ""The winds were similar to those of a tornado."" One resident told the news agency that the Parque Avellaneda neighborhood ""looks like they threw a bomb."" Fallen trees blocked streets. A wall in at least one historic building collapsed, Telam said. Damage occurred within the city limits and also in the surrounding province, where at least nine people were killed when they were crushed or electrocuted, Telam said. Wind gusts ranged from 100 kph to 120 kph (62 mph to 75 mph), said Luciano Timerman, a provincial emergency official, Telam reported. Authorities evacuated 500 people in the western and southern areas of the metropolitan area as the storm raged, Timerman said.

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors' decision not to file charges against Bernard ""Bernie"" Fine means that the former basketball coach may have escaped ever facing criminal charges stemming from sexual abuse allegations. Fine lost his job as an assistant basketball coach at Syracuse under a cloud of suspicion. At one time, four people accused him of sexual abuse. The university had investigated the allegations in 2005 and never sought criminal charges. Last year, the state of New York said it couldn't seek criminal charges because the statute of limitations had passed. That left the federal case open, which came to a close Friday with the announcement that no criminal charges are coming. The yearlong investigation revealed insufficient evidence to pursue federal charges, U.S. Attorney Richard S. Hartunian said. The U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of New York has closed its investigation. Syracuse ball boys Mike Lang and Bobby Davis, who are stepbrothers, had stepped forward to accuse the coach of molesting them over several years. Another accuser, Zachary Tomaselli, said he had fabricated allegations against the coach. Man says his allegations were lies . William Fitzpatrick, district attorney for Onondaga County, New York, said last year that despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct with minors, he could not bring charges against Fine because the statute of limitations had expired. DA: Statute of limitations expired . A fourth accuser, prison inmate Floyd ""David"" VanHooser, also admitted to making up allegations against the coach. When the allegations first surfaced, Fine -- married with a son and two daughters -- called them ""patently false."" The U.S. attorney said that in all, about 130 witnesses were interviewed and more than 100,000 pages of documents and records were examined during the federal investigation. ""We have concluded that the investigation has not developed sufficient credible evidence of the commission of a prosecutable offense to merit either federal charges or a referral to a district attorney's office for state prosecution,"" Hartunian said. He added that the closing of the case does not prove what did or did not happen, only that there wasn't enough evidence to take it to court. Lang and Davis originally made their allegations in 2005 about events that occurred years before then. The university noted it had conducted an investigation in 2005 and was ""unable to find any corroboration of the allegations."" In November 2011, The Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper and ESPN both reported the existence of a recording of a 2002 phone conversation that they say Davis recorded between him and Laurie Fine, the coach's wife. In the tape, a woman -- whom ESPN, citing experts, claimed was Laurie Fine -- said she knew ""everything that went on"" with her husband. Bernie Fine was fired from his position as assistant basketball coach the same day as those reports.","Federal prosecutors investigated sex abuse allegations against Bernie Fine .

"(CNN) -- The associate men's basketball coach at Syracuse University on Friday called allegations that he inappropriately touched two boys starting more than 20 years ago ""patently false in every aspect."" The university placed Bernie Fine on administrative leave Thursday after the accusations surfaced. Bobby Davis, 39, a former ball boy for the school's basketball team, told ESPN on Thursday evening that Fine molested him ""hundreds of times"" over the course of 16 years, starting from when he was in the fifth or sixth grade. Davis told university officials six years ago that he informed Syracuse, New York, police that he had been ""subjected to inappropriate contact by an associate men's basketball coach"" during the 1980s and 1990s, according to university Senior Vice President Kevin C. Quinn. Police had originally told Davis that they would not pursue the case because the statute of limitations had expired, Quinn said in a statement Thursday. On hearing of the allegations in 2005, the university launched its own investigation through its legal counsel, Quinn said. ""That nearly four-month-long investigation included a number of interviews with people the complainant said would support his claims. All of those identified by the complainant denied any knowledge of wrongful conduct by the associate coach. The associate coach also vehemently denied the allegations."" Had the school found evidence or corroboration of the allegations, it would have terminated the associate coach and reported the case to the police, the statement said. But Davis' stepbrother, Mike Lang, 45, told ESPN on Thursday that Fine also molested him ""15 to 20 times,"" kick-starting a new police investigation. ""I didn't feel right about it and told him, 'Bernie, don't do that to me,' but he kept doing it again and again,"" Lang, also once a ball boy for the team, told ESPN. In a statement Friday, Fine again denied the newest claims against him, saying ""simply put, these allegations are patently false in every aspect. ... I am confident that, as in the past, a review of these allegations will be discredited and restore my reputation."" Police say they reopened the investigation after Lang came forward. Quinn said the university ""will cooperate fully"" with the investigation. Davis alleged that Fine started touching him inappropriately when he was in sixth grade or so, at about age 10 or 11. The touching included rubbing his genitals and occurred at Fine's home, at university basketball facilities and during road trips, Davis said on ESPN's ""Outside the Lines."" ""I didn't feel right about it,"" he said. ""He'd do it again and again. ... Made you feel odd."" Syracuse head basketball coach Jim Boeheim defended Fine. ""This matter was fully investigated by the university in 2005, and it was determined that the allegations were unfounded,"" he said in a statement. ""I have known Bernie Fine for more than 40 years. I have never seen or witnessed anything to suggest that he would been involved in any of the activities alleged. Had I seen or suspected anything, I would have taken action. Bernie has my full support."" Former player Gerry McNamara will fill in for Fine while he is on leave, Boeheim said Friday. CNN's Tom Watkins and Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","NEW: Fine is ""confident ... allegations will be discredited""

"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Sunday he will gather a round table to form a plan aimed at easing the financial burden on Israeli citizens in the wake of protests across the country. Netanyahu said he will invite representatives of various groups and sectors to join a special ministerial team that will propose a ""practical plan to alleviate Israelis' economic burden"" and come up with solutions. Tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets Saturday night in ten major cities to rail against soaring costs to the middle class in the Jewish state. The ongoing campaign is the latest and most extensive civil protest in recent years. Eight men were arrested late Saturday night in Tel Aviv for attempting to block roads, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Activists have set up tent cities across the country to demand affordable housing and protest against what they describe as social injustice. Some marchers in Tel Aviv held signs reading ""The people demand social justice,"" ""Welfare state now,"" and ""When the government is against the people, the people are against the government."" ""I think it's about time to say, 'Enough,'"" protester Liran Gurbacha told CNN. ""They open too many doors for rich people to make their own rules, to take our money to get richer. This is a democracy, it should act like that."" Hundreds of police have been deployed nationwide related to the demonstrations. The protesters themselves expressed support for police, saying they should have better pay and working conditions. Having failed to ease the public pressure and gain support for his recently announced plan to increase the number of affordable homes, Netanyahu vowed to ""appoint a special team of ministers and experts that will propose a responsible and practical plan to alleviate Israelis' economic burden."" In his speech at the start of Sunday's weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister called for calculated measures that would not jeopardize Israel's growing economy. ""We must avoid irresponsible, hasty and populist steps that are liable to cause the country to deteriorate into the situation of certain European countries, which are on the verge of bankruptcy and large-scale unemployment. I do not think that anyone wants Israel to reach such a situation."" The prime minister agreed with activists' claims that imbalances in the Israeli economy are contributing to the hardships. ""We are all aware of the genuine hardship of the cost-of-living in Israel,"" he said. ""This affects many areas. Some of the claims that are being heard are justified and some are not. We are obligated to deal with the genuine claims and distress. Some of them are the result of distortions in the Israeli economy that have taken root here over many long years."" Meanwhile, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, who took much of the heat for soaring prices, faces administrative difficulties within his office. Finance ministry director general Haim Shani announced his resignation Sunday morning, citing professional disagreements with the minister. ""I, as a finance minister, have a responsibility for Israel to not fall into financial anarchy. We must not abandon the principals of our economy,"" Steinitz said Sunday. Israeli President Shimon Peres also expressed his will to serve as mediator between the activists and the government Sunday. ""The president's residence is open and attentive to the needs of the people. It is my role as a president to listen to the distress and see how I can as a president assist the citizens and the future of the state of Israel,"" Peres said in his meeting with Israeli doctors who are also striking as part of their quest to push for reforms in the health system, including improved wages. Saturday's protests were the latest and largest in a series of organized demonstrations, led by members of Israel's middle class, over the high cost of living. While the majority of demonstrators were in their 20s and 30s, many senior citizens also came out to show their concern. ""When we were young and we left the kibbutz, we had nothing, but we had hope,"" said Miri Gilat. ""Now the young people don't have any hope, and I cannot help them.""","Netanyahu announced he will gather a roundtable to develop a plan .

"(CNN) -- Laurie Fine, the wife of a former Syracuse University assistant basketball coach accused of molesting ball boys, plans to sue ESPN and two of the network's reporters for libel in a federal court, her lawyers said Wednesday. A draft of the lawsuit says sports journalists Mark Schwarz and Arthur Berko ""spitefully destroyed Laurie Fine's reputation in an attempt to capitalize financially in the tragic wake of the Penn State sex abuse scandal."" It says Fine's reputation was ruined by the malicious publication of false and defamatory accusations. In response, ESPN backed its stories. ""The suit is without merit and we stand by our reporting,"" the sports programming network said. Fine broke her months-long silence Wednesday to talk about the accusations against her. ""I'm here today as a wife and a mother who has had to endure the trauma of being smeared in the public as a monster,"" she said at a news conference. ""My life has been destroyed by the defamation I have suffered, and this will last a lifetime."" Fine called the lawsuit the first step to restore her reputation. ""I have never engaged in or condone despicable conduct falsely reported by ESPN,"" she said. ""They have maliciously attacked me in order to attack my husband."" The ESPN reporting has forced her to live in seclusion and impaired her ability to volunteer in the community, she said. ""They should apologize and retract these horrible lies,"" she said. Among the false accusations Fine alleges in the lawsuit are: . â€¢ Creating a space in which children could be sexually molested in secret. â€¢ Witnessing her husband sexually molest children, but not doing anything to stop it. â€¢ Knowingly permitting the sexual molestation of children in her home. Her husband, Bernie Fine, was fired from Syracuse in November after several ball boys came forward and said the basketball coach molested them. Bernie Fine has not been charged with a crime. He has maintained his innocence, saying shortly after the allegations surfaced that they were ""patently false in every aspect."" Bobby Davis and his stepbrother, Mike Lang, who are former Syracuse ball boys, were the first to step forward publicly last year with allegations against Fine. Another man, Zachary Tomaselli, made similar accusations later, filed a lawsuit and then admitted that he made up the story. A prison inmate, Floyd ""David"" VanHooser, also made the same allegations, only to recant them. The draft lawsuit details the Fines' relationship with Davis. ""The Fines mentored Davis when he got in trouble,"" it says. ""Rather than humiliating him in front of Laurie or their other children, Bernie often came home from work, and sternly spoke to him, in private, as if he were his own teenage son. ""Davis was family, and when he messed up, the Fines made sure he learned from his poor decisions, even if that required occasional parental corporal punishment and reprimanding."" It says that the Fines gave Davis money but that he took advantage of their generosity by making up ""countless stories"" to ""gain the Fines' sympathy and justify his requests for money."" When Davis told Laurie Fine that her husband had sexually molested him, the draft says, ""Laurie 'went off' on Davis because Davis finally crossed the line."" ""Bernie assured Laurie that it was just another one of Davis' fabricated stories,"" the draft says. ""Laurie would patiently suffer Davis' vilification of her husband with the hope that Davis would eventually outgrow the lies and his dependency upon her family for financial support."" Laurie Fine made headlines last year when ESPN and the Post-Standard newspaper in Syracuse released details of a 10-year-old taped conversation with Davis that appeared to show she knew about her husband's alleged sexual abuse. In the tape, the woman that ESPN, citing experts, identified as Laurie Fine said she knew ""everything that went on"" with her husband, adding that ""he thinks he's above the law."" ""Bernie has issues ... and you trusted somebody you shouldn't,"" the woman said, speaking to Davis. The woman appears to acknowledge an inappropriate sexual relationship between Davis and Bernie Fine, saying, ""It's just wrong, and you were a kid."" She also said that her husband should ""find (himself) a gay boy, get your rocks off."" The lawsuit refers to that recording as ""an admittedly doctored, substantially inaudible, and entirely speculative tape, which Davis purported to be a recoding of a telephone conversation between he and Laurie in 2002."" ESPN changed the audio quality, produced only portions of the tape and presented it out of context ""such that the tape seriously misleads and misrepresents the conversation that occurred,"" said Lawrence Fisher, Laurie Fine's attorney. Laurie Fine's nephew, Matt Govendo, said at the time that the voice on the tape was his aunt's but that the tape was ""all tampered with."" Last week, a New York State Supreme Court justice dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Syracuse University longtime head basketball coach Jim Boeheim. The suit was filed in December by Davis and Lang. Boeheim initially supported Fine, a longtime friend and colleague, accusing Lang and Davis of fabricating their accusations of Fine's alleged misconduct. The coach later apologized for his comments. Justice Brian DeJoseph of the Onondaga County Supreme Court ruled that the initial statements made to media outlets by Boeheim ""were likely to be an opinion -- a biased, passionate, and defensive point of view of a basketball coach -- rather than objective fact. Thus, plaintiff's defamation claim against Boeheim fails as a matter of law.""","NEW: Laurie Fine wants ESPN to apologize and retract its reporting .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. and Iranian ambassadors to Iraq will meet Tuesday to discuss security issues in the war-torn country, U.S. and Iraqi officials said. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, left, and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Kazemi Qomi, will meet this week. This will be the second meeting between U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Kazemi Qomi. Their May 28 meeting marked the first public and formal talks between U.S. and Iranian representatives since the United States cut off diplomatic relations 27 years ago. U.S. officials have accused Iran of interfering in the U.S.-led war in Iraq by supplying Shiite Muslim militias with weaponry and training, fueling the sectarian warfare U.S. and Iraqi troops are trying to curtail. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose ruling party has close ties to Tehran, said Tuesday's planned meeting would ""strengthen the bridges of trust"" between the two countries. But a senior Bush administration official said, ""We've seen no sign of improvement in Iranian behavior. They still arm, aid and train militants."" Crocker met Sunday in Baghdad with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari in preparation for the meeting, Zebari's office said. ""Ambassador Crocker expressed his satisfaction with the efforts made by the minister to hold this meeting,"" according to a statement from the foreign minister's office. The Bush administration has come under increasing pressure to show signs of progress in Iraq ahead of a mid-September report by Crocker and Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Iraq. The war has become widely unpopular in the United States, and President Bush's fellow Republicans in Congress have had to rely on filibuster tactics to block Democratic-led efforts to start pulling U.S. combat troops out of Iraq. The senior administration official said both Iran and the Sunni Muslim fighters of al Qaeda in Iraq are considered ""accelerants"" of the ongoing fighting, which has claimed more than 3,600 American lives since the 2003 invasion that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. The United States broke off diplomatic ties with Iran in April 1980 in the midst of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy. Iranian students occupied the embassy from November 1979 until January 1981, when they released the remaining 52 hostages. E-mail to a friend .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- In Washington, a lot of the meetings that take place between lawmakers amount to nothing. But recently, there was a get-together that was really something. The participants: Reps. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, and Charles Gonzales, D-Texas, along with Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey. The problem: What this country should do with so-called DREAM'ers, undocumented young people who were brought here by their parents as children and who face the threat of deportation. One proposed solution that didn't go anywhere was the DREAM Act, a bill that politicians passed around like a hot potato for more than a decade. It would offer legal status and a pathway to citizenship to anyone who goes to college or joins the military. The good news is that there was bipartisan support; the last time it was put to a vote, in December 2010, a slew of Senate Democrats voted for it, but so did three Senate Republicans -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Bob Bennett of Utah. The bad news is that there is bipartisan opposition; a slew of Republicans opposed the legislation, but so did five Senate Democrats -- Jon Tester and Max Baucus of Montana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. Clearly we need a new approach. Enter Rubio. The Cuban-American GOP rock star and potential GOP vice presidential nominee is floating the idea of a modified DREAM Act that would keep undocumented immigrant students from being deported by giving them legal status in the form of a student visa followed by a work visa. The idea was originally shared with me about five months ago by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who, along with her colleague, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was eager to find a way to break the stalemate over the DREAM Act and help get these young people out of legal limbo and on with their lives. Now Hutchison and Kyl have faded to the background, and Rubio is shopping the idea. No formal proposal has been released, but that hasn't stopped pundits and politicos from voicing their opinions about the concept. Under the proposal, there is no yellow brick road to citizenship, but nor is there a roadblock. The young people would just have to find their own way there, if they even wanted to be U.S. citizens. Not every immigrant does. You know who does want to give these students automatic citizenship? Democrats, who are salivating over the prospect of perhaps hundreds of thousands of new voters with a grudge against Republicans. And you know who is dead-set against giving them citizenship? Republicans, who want to avoid the ire of these newly minted voters. There's a catch. Democrats may think these kids are adorable, but they don't want to adopt them and become known as the ""illegal immigrant party."" I suspect that's the real reason five Democrats helped kill the DREAM Act. Follow @CNN Opinion on Twitter and at Facebook/CNNOpinion . The fact that Rubio is now attached to the proposal is a mixed blessing. Rubio might have enough leverage within his party to persuade some Republicans who voted against the old DREAM Act to support DREAM Act 2.0. The bad news is that Democrats are afraid of Rubio, and many of them have no interest in supporting any bill that makes the rising star look good. Given all that, I'll bet the Latino ""hangout"" on the DREAM Act was not exactly an event that was officially sanctioned by either party. So what? That's a good thing. This is an encouraging new model. Let's hope we see more of these efforts to informally reach across party lines and forge bipartisan solutions on a variety of public policy issues. Providing legal status to undocumented college students and members of the armed forces is one issue where the partisan lines are blurred and the politics are very complicated. There are no good guys and bad guys, just both parties pushing their own interests without caring about what happens to a bunch of undocumented students. Someone needs to care. It seems these four lawmakers do. What Rubio has in mind might not be perfect, but it's the only entree on the menu. If the Latino Democrats think they can make it better, they should make suggestions. Then both sides should go back to their respective parties and pressure their colleagues to come onboard. It matters to the deliberations that these lawmakers are all Latino. Regardless of party, whether they realize it or not, they have a natural kinship. A Republican like Rubio has a cultural connection to Democrats like Gutierrez, Menendez and Gonzales. That is something to build on. These guys might argue when they talk politics, but at least they can argue in Spanish.

"(CNN) -- That women and girls are singled out during armed conflicts is well documented -- what is less well known is that once hostilities cease the undeclared war on women can continue for years on end. Even though officially the fighting has ended, the proliferation of weapons, a culture of violence and the objectification of women continue to wreak havoc. As a Bosnian women's rights activist put it when she was talking to a group of human rights researchers documenting the horrors meted out in the early 1990s civil war: ""There is no peace time for women"". This simple statement clarified the truth they were failing to grasp -- that for women in particular, the peace accord had brought no peace. Nearly two decades on, hundreds of women still struggle with the effects of rape and other forms of torture frequently facilitated or committed using weapons, without proper access to the medical, psychological and financial assistance they need to rebuild their shattered lives. The perpetrators mostly go unpunished. On March 18, the final negotiations for an arms trade treaty will begin in New York. The world desperately needs the final agreement to ensure that no country or arms dealer will sell weapons, munitions or related equipment to governments, companies or armed groups where there is a substantial risk of those arms and ammunition -- ranging from AK-47s to bombers -- being used for atrocities or violent abuse. Among the challenges to getting an effective arms trade treaty is the simple fact that the USA, Russia, China, the UK and France are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. As such they are charged with maintaining international peace and security, yet they accounted in 2010 for about 60% of the well over $70 billion annual trade in conventional weapons. (Source: TransArms - Research Center for the Logistics of Arms Transfers.) Based on the arms orders that the United States and Russia has already received, but not yet executed and delivered, at the end of a four year-period the total annual global trade in conventional weapons could approach $100 billion, according to TransArms. The five governments would account for more than half that amount. These and other states have been trading for decades in the absence of global controls on the flow of arms and ammunition across borders. Guns and ammunition are supplied to governments, companies and armed groups who often put them into the hands of users who terrorize communities by targeting civilians: women, men and children. Targeting civilians in armed conflict is an intentional act which is a crime under international law. It may be a tactic or even a strategy of government forces or armed groups, and women are often singled out by human rights abusers, criminal gangs and individuals who brandish arms manufactured overseas. Some governments will argue that the targeting of women in war -- including with sexual violence -- is a regrettable but inevitable by-product of armed conflict. It is exactly this attitude that makes these same governments ignore violence against women in peace time. To add insult to injury, despite the U.N. Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security, women are often denied any role in peace negotiations, in monitoring the process of disarming combatants and on deciding how to rebuild society in a manner that promotes peaceful resolution to conflicts. Grave human rights abuses against women and men, whether in conflict situations or not, are already forbidden as a matter of law. For example, the Geneva Conventions and Protocols outlaw specific war crimes, and perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity can be brought to justice under the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court. International human rights law also prohibits specific violations, and governments have a responsibility to take action to stop violence against women regardless of who is perpetrating that violence. It has long been recognized that such crimes can be curbed also by taking away the tools used by perpetrators to commit or facilitate them. A strong and effective global Arms Trade Treaty would be a very significant step towards this. Women the world over need to know that governments will not put profits before human security by allowing weapons to get into the hands of those who would use them to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide or other serious violations of human rights. It sounds so simple. It sounds so right. But far too often profits trump government commitments to upholding international human rights and humanitarian law. As the Bosnian activist would attest, the long-lasting consequences of this greed can be devastating for women in particular. So, for the sake of all the women who live with constant insecurity -- the governments convening in New York in March must do the right thing. Put profits and narrow national interests aside and pave the path to peace and security for women by adopting an arms trade treaty with strong and fair rules for human rights protection for all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Widney Brown.","Once armed conflicts finish, undeclared war on women continues, says Widney Brown .
The proliferation of weapons facilitates acts of rape and torture, she says .

"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from CNN Contributor Bob Greene's new book, ""Late Edition: A Love Story,"" a memoir of his time working at an Ohio newspaper in the 1960s. The localness of what we did down at the paper defined everything. Even as a kid brand-new to the staff and brand-new to the newspaper business, hired to work during summer vacations, I could tell that. Bob Greene recalls a 1967 lesson in manners from Ohio State University football coach Woody Hayes. It was a localness not confined to the geographic scope of our news coverage -- it went without saying that the Columbus, Ohio, Citizen-Journal wasn't about to send its reporters to Africa or France (or even to Kentucky or Indiana). The men and women in the city room arrived at work each day knowing that they weren't going to be assigned to anyplace from where they couldn't drive back to the office by deadline. The localness extended beyond that, though, and infused the very feel of the place. One night in the summer of 1967 the phone on the sports desk rang and I picked it up with the customary: ""Sports!"" The person on the other end said: . ""Now, that's no way to answer a telephone, is it?"" ""Who's calling?"" I said. ""To whom am I speaking?"" the caller said. ""This is Bob Greene,"" I said. ""Now, I've seen your name in the paper,"" the caller said. ""It's Bob Greene Jr., isn't it?"" I had been permitted to write a few sports stories that summer; I used the ""Jr."" at the end of the byline. ""Yes,"" I said. I thought I recognized the voice from somewhere. ""Now, I believe I know your mother and father,"" the caller said. ""Are your parents Robert and Phyllis Greene, from Bexley?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""I know they didn't raise you to answer a phone that way,"" the caller said. ""When you answer a business telephone, the proper way to do it is to tell the caller your name first."" ""All right, sir,"" I said. ""I know your parents are fine people, and I'm sure they taught you good manners,"" the caller said. ""You don't want to disappoint them by giving a bad impression of yourself on the telephone, do you?"" ""No, sir,"" I said. ""Good,"" the caller said. ""Now, this is Woody Hayes. I was calling to speak with Tom Pastorius. Is Tom there, please?"" And, my hands shaking, I connected him with Pastorius, one of the paper's sportswriters. I knew it really was the head coach of the Ohio State University football team because of that phrase early in his lecture to me -- ""To whom am I speaking?"" His grammar was always scrupulous -- no ""Who am I speaking to?"" from Woody Hayes. The localness was all around us. Woody had met my mother and father on a few occasions, he remembered them, and he was setting their son straight. He may have been the most nationally famous person in the community, but he was first and foremost a member of that community -- during all his years as head football coach at Ohio State, Woody kept his home telephone number listed in the Columbus phone book: W.W. Hayes, on Cardiff Road. That made for a lot of late-night crank calls from a lot of insulting or drunken people, but he thought that if he was going to represent the community, then he should be as available as any other man or woman in town. Once, years later, I heard a story -- I'm almost certain that it was Citizen-Journal sportswriter Kaye Kessler who told it. It seemed that very early in Jack Nicklaus's golf career, Nicklaus's father, Charlie, a Columbus pharmacist, was following his son on tour, and Woody Hayes offered to travel with Charlie Nicklaus to keep him company and provide moral support. Apparently at one tournament someone in the gallery kept referring to Nicklaus as ""fat Jack"" -- Nicklaus was a little hefty in those younger days. And, the way I remember the story, either Woody Hayes had to physically restrain Charlie Nicklaus from going after the fan, or Charlie Nicklaus had to restrain Woody. (I have a feeling I know which one was which.) It was all part of the localness. Woody Hayes and Charlie Nicklaus were two Columbus residents on the road to cheer for a local golfer; the fact that the local golfer would become the greatest ever to play the game was incidental. And we -- in the eyes of our readers, and in our own eyes, too -- were, proudly, the local paper. That was all, and everything, we aspired to be. Just like the proud local papers in a thousand other American towns. ""I know they didn't raise you to answer a phone that way,"" Woody said. He thought, by saying it, he was doing me a favor. He was. Excerpted by permission from ""Late Edition: A Love Story,"" published this week by St. Martin's Press.","Bob Greene's new memoir is titled ""Late Edition: A Love Story""

"(CNN) -- Hints emerged Monday that China may terminate its controversial system of labor prison camps this year. The proposal to stop using the system was put forth at a working conference by the country's most senior law enforcement official, Meng Jianzhu, according to a post by the state-run CCTV on its Sina Weibo microblogging account. Meng is the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Politics and Law Commission. The proposal requires the approval of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress-- the country's legislature-- although it is largely a rubber-stamp formality. Opinion: Corruption as China's top priority . The CCTV post was later deleted, as well as a post quoting it by the state-run Xinhua news agency. A post on the topic by the People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, also disappeared on Weibo. However, Xinhua later wrote that the system would be reformed (albeit with no mention of its abolishment) on its English Twitter account, and English and Chinese news websites. Read more: Censorship protest a test for reform-minded China . Under the ""laodong jiaoyang"" or ""re-education through labor"" system, petty offenders, such as thieves, prostitutes and drug abusers, are imprisoned for up to four years in labor camps without a judicial hearing. The United Nations Human Rights Council estimates there are 190,000 inmates in 320 such centers across the country. Critics say the camps, which fall outside of the formal prison system, are often misused to persecute government dissidents, including intellectuals, human rights activists, and followers of banned spiritual groups like the Falun Gong. Two high-profile cases that became public last year generated a massive backlash, forcing the government to address the thorny issue. In one case, a mother was sentenced to 1.5 years in a labor camp for ""disrupting social order"" after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raping her 11-year-old daughter. In another case, a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for retweeting Weibo posts deemed seditious. Recent official sentiment has indicated that reform, if not abolishment of the system, is needed. The camps date back to the 1950s when the new Communist regime sought to silence its enemies to consolidate its power. Read more: Chinese journalists in rare protest against censorship . In October, a senior official in charge of judicial system reform acknowledged that reforms were necessary and underway, according to Xinhua. ""The system was designed to maintain social order, prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code,"" the Xinhua editorial went on to say. ""It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods, however, with the development of society and the legal system, its defects have become more and more evident.""

"(LifeWire) -- The TV no longer sits on a moving box, but she's still using filing cabinets as end tables. Desiree Jacobsen graduated from college years ago, so why does her apartment resemble a dorm room? It's hard to save for the finer things when you've had to shell out money to be in five weddings in one year, three times as maid of honor. Some maids of honor have gone deep into debt rather than disappoint a friend who expects a lot. ""I shop at the Salvation Army quite a bit to save money,"" says Jacobsen, 26, a medical editor in Dallas. Being a bride's maid or matron of honor is a distinction many women cherish. But it doesn't come cheap. It can easily cost a woman $1,000 or more for the honor of standing beside the bride on her big day, according to TheKnot.com, the leading wedding Web site. On top of the traditional expenses of wedding attire, transportation and chipping in for a gift from the bridesmaids, maids of honor can wind up hosting bridal showers, bachelorette parties and even the co-ed Jack and Jill party -- often footing the bill entirely. Expectations are reaching bridezilla proportions, a trend Anna Post, spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute and great-great-granddaughter of the etiquette authority, attributes in part to the extensive coverage of celebrity weddings on television and in style magazines.  Watch etiquette tips on attending wedding events » . Many bridesmaids are left torn between maintaining a friendship and breaking the bank. Tough to say no . When Sarah de Maintenon, a 33-year-old real estate agent in Syracuse, New York, agreed to be her best friend's maid of honor two years ago, the economy was good and houses were selling like hot cakes. But the currently slow real-estate market means that money has become tight as the big day -- scheduled for October -- slowly approaches. ""I seriously just didn't know. I thought it was just a bachelorette party,"" says de Maintenon of the events she was expected to throw and attend. Her distress over the destination wedding sent her seeking advice online. The advice she received was simple, but effective: Talk to her friend and be honest about her situation. ""I contemplated telling her I couldn't do it, but I couldn't break her heart,"" she says. ""I was afraid it would cause an argument ... I didn't want to ruin her wedding day."" Jacobsen hasn't skipped a wedding, but she did once skip the pre-wedding bridal portrait, which she would have had to travel out of town to participate in, because she was short on money and vacation time. ""She was upset with me for a little while, but it quickly blew over because I started planning for her bachelorette party."" When feelings get hurt, Jacobsen says, she tries not to take it personally. ""It's usually because of the stress of the wedding."" Etiquette rules vs. reality . Is all this necessary? Are brides asking too much of their friends? Post says that contrary to popular belief, the bridal shower isn't the maid of honor's obligation. Traditionally, a close friend would throw a bridal shower for the bride, and sometimes that person is also the maid of honor. But expenses can be agreed upon in advance and shared by the entire wedding party. And though there may be multiple parties thrown for the happy couple, Post says, the maid of honor is not required to go. ""That's not true,"" claims Kim Bohnert, a 32-year-old teacher in San Francisco. She's served nine stints as maid of honor and considers herself an expert bridesmaid. She insists that the entire bridal party -- especially the maid of honor -- is expected to attend all parties and shell out for a gift each time. ""It definitely adds up,"" says Melissa Bauer, spokesperson for TheKnot.com. Bauer ticks off some of the major expenses: about $300 for a dress, $50 to $200 for shoes, $40 to $60 for accessories, $50 for a shower gift and another $100 for a wedding gift. Then there are the parties. ""The big thing now is destination bachelorette parties,"" Bauer says. ""Some people might do it local, but regardless, you're [often] footing the cost for the bride [to attend]."" The cost of traveling to an out-of-town party can add several hundred dollars to the tab, Bauer notes -- to say nothing of the cost of traveling to the wedding itself. Going for broke . Whether popular wisdom requires such a commitment or not, there's a very real limit to what women can afford. Bohnert agreed to be her cousin's maid of honor, even though she was maxed out on her credit cards, and the many expenses included a $500 Sae Young Vu dress. ""I'm still in debt because of it,"" she says. Ma'ayan Geller, a part-time student and assistant physical therapist in San Francisco, was glad to hear her friend wanted to be sensitive to the financial constraints of her wedding party. But when Geller, one of the bridesmaids, suggested a cheap Las Vegas package for the bachelorette party, the bride gave her the boot, saying she wasn't being serious enough about her commitment to the wedding. ""I had already bought the dress -- close to $300 -- which was a lot for me at the time,"" Geller, 23, remembers. ""I think it could have been done in a better way."" Geller still attended the wedding, partially because all her friends were there and also because she wanted to support the bride, ""although the friendship kind of ended after that."" Making it work . In Post's experience, a wedding is a collaboration, and the wedding party often tries to find a solution that works for everyone. ""When something difficult arises, I've seen brides put on the brakes rather than force something on someone,"" she says. Jeri Kadison, a bridal coach in New York, says communication is key: Detail expectations early, and if something sounds too expensive, compromise and brainstorm other ideas, she advises. ""It's the bride's responsibility to be compassionate and considerate,"" she says. That strategy worked for de Maintenon. She and her bride talk almost every day. Instead of renting a restaurant, they're having a barbeque. Instead of renting a beach house, they're all staying with a girlfriend. It's also OK to say no, Post says. ""You can decline. Just do it early."" De Maintenon recently declined when one of her best friends asked her to be the maid of honor, and her friend wasn't upset. ""She knows that I'll do anything else to help out in any way."" LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"(CNN) -- We arrived in Mali's capital city, Bamako, on January 22, a four-person emergency assessment team rapidly deployed by International Medical Corps. With violence raging throughout the country as French and Malian forces fought to take back control of areas seized by Islamist rebels earlier this month, we had no time to waste. Fighting had already displaced more than 10,000 people by the time we arrived (an estimated 25,000 to date), adding to the more than 460,000 Malians who fled their homes because of violence in 2012. Even before January 10, more than 2 million Malians were at risk of food insecurity and an estimated 1.5 million at risk of epidemics, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In this dire humanitarian and volatile security context, we immediately began advancing north to reach areas affected by the latest conflict and assess the most urgent humanitarian needs on the ground. Mali, particularly the northern part of the country, poses enormous challenges for organizations seeking to help those who need it. Humanitarian access is extremely limited, making the presence of relief and aid agencies very sparse, despite vast need. We have faced tremendous challenges traveling through conflict-affected areas: strict military checkpoints, impassable roads and rivers, unpredictable security dynamics, and, worst of all, the ever-present possibility of scattered Islamist rebels along the route. But we're working together with local authorities, U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organization partners to gain access to previously unreachable areas and ensure that critical health and nutrition needs are being met. On January 28, local authorities granted our team access to the town of Konna to conduct the first humanitarian assessment there. We had only four hours to get in and out. Konna was the first town captured when armed Islamist rebels who control northern Mali began aggressively moving south on January 10, triggering French military intervention. Beginning with airstrikes on January 11, French and Malian military forces fought intensely against the Islamist rebels in Konna for more than a week, forcing many of the town's residents to flee their homes. French and Malian forces retook Konna from the rebels on January 18. Most of the town's residents had returned by the time we were allowed in to assess critical needs, and life was beginning to return to normal. But there were still many signs of the conflict. The road leading into the town was littered with burned-out pickup trucks and shrapnel. We even found an unexploded bomb in one home we visited, quickly warning the family of 17 to stay clear before reporting the bomb to the French military to be rendered safe. Similar threats of unexploded ordinances and remnants of Islamist rebels will persist throughout Mali, even as military operations begin to wind down. We met with community leaders to discuss Konna's most urgent needs, involving all sectors of the community, including the mayor, women's groups, local health associations and youth groups. We also visited homes to see firsthand the household-level impact of the conflict. Hunger and food insecurity are major concerns in Konna and throughout Mali. Konna's market was closed for a month because of instability in the region, cutting off access to food and compromising many people's livelihoods. The town's school remains closed, but health and nutrition services have started reopening with the support of local NGOs. We're now on our way to Timbuktu, which was just retaken by French and Malian troops. Timbuktu is one of the three northern regions controlled by Islamist rebel groups since an April 2012 coup that effectively split Mali into two. Thousands of displaced families are expected to be returning home in the coming days, likely overwhelming critical services that have been weakened since being cut off from the world 10 months ago. We've heard reports that the rebels looted health clinics, damaging and even destroying some. Many doctors and nurses have fled south or across the border to Mauritania, leaving limited support for the local population. As soon as we gain access to Timbuktu, we'll conduct rapid assessments of its health facilities to determine the most pressing needs before initiating emergency response activities to provide staff, equipment and medication. We'll also assess the town's nutrition and water needs, sharing our findings with U.N. agencies and NGO partners to facilitate a coordinated humanitarian response. After Timbuktu, we'll continue north, heading deep into formerly rebel-held territoryâ€”areas NGOs have been cut off from for monthsâ€”to reach those most in need. To help us help the estimated 4.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Mali, donate to our emergency response fund.

"(CNN) -- Rioting near the northwestern Chinese city of Kashgar on Tuesday left 12 people dead, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. The news agency said that 10 people were killed in riots in the restive Xinjiang province and police shot dead a further two people in the disturbance. The report, which could not be independently verified, gave no details about what could have sparked the violence. It said a group of knife-wielding assailants attacked people in a market in Yecheng county. Chinese authorities have blamed militants of Uighur descent for outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang in recent years. Uighurs are ethnic Turks who are linguistically, culturally and religiously distinct from China's majority Han population. Beijing claims overseas-based militant Uighur groups linked to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement that allegedly trains in Pakistan have been fomenting trouble in the region. The rioting coincides with the opening of a new 3.64 billion yuan ($579 million) highway linking Kashgar to Yecheng which lies 155 miles (258 km) to the south of the city. In December, Chinese authorities killed seven Uighurs in a bid to free two hostages kidnapped in the rural county of Pishan, near Yecheng, in an incident which the Stockholm-based World Uighur Congress disputes. The WUC said the deaths occurred when police opened fire on a demonstration outside a police bureau where Uighurs were protesting a recent security crackdown in Hotan city. Xinjiang was rocked by the worst violence in decades in July 2009 when rioting between Uighurs and Han Chinese left nearly 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in the regional capital Urumqi. The massive security clampdown in the wake of the violence has angered many Uighurs, who make up more than half of the 9 million people that live in the far western region of China, who say police have been behind a series disappearances. Authorities in Xinjiang said last month they plan to recruit 8,000 extra police officers as China strengthens security in the run-up to a major leadership transition later this year.","China's Xinhua news agency reports 12 killed in rioting near Kashgar .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Outspoken Chinese artist Ai Weiwei paid 8.45 million yuan ($1.3 million) for a charge against his wife's company to prevent her from going to jail, he told CNN Tuesday. Ai told CNN that if the tax charge went unpaid then his wife, the legal representative of Fake Cultural Ltd., would have been sent to jail. When news of the tax charges broke earlier this month, there was a huge outpouring of donations from fellow activists and supporters wanting to ease the 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) debt. Ai told CNN that the donations grew to more than 9 million yuan, but he only used a portion of it for this payment, which he hopes will give him the right to an administrative review. Speaking to CNN by phone Tuesday, Ai said he is not optimistic about the possible results of any review. ""We don't expect any justice to come after the administrative review because there was no justice from the beginning when I was taken away,"" he said, referring to his imprisonment in April. The artist was detained on allegations of tax evasion. However, his family and human rights advocates believe that the real reason for his imprisonment is his criticism of the Chinese government. Ai was released on bail in June for his good attitude and medical concerns, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Local authorities held a closed hearing in July on the tax evasion allegations, despite demands for an open hearing from Ai and the company's lawyers. According to the artist, authorities also declined their demand to publish the accounting records and other evidence that lead to the tax evasion charge. Ai told CNN earlier this month he was initially detained and imprisoned on charges of ""subversion of state power,"" but upon his release the charge was changed to tax evasion. ""This is against judicial law, and is unethical. How can a country use this way to try to silence dissidents?"" he asked. ""China always uses tax issues to cover up political issues. If the government keeps taking revenge on its dissidents with the law, it will only lead the country to its opposite side,"" Ai said. Despite having the money to pay off the bond, Ai told CNN that the tax authorities he dealt with made it difficult for he and his wife to fix the situation; refusing to take their house as collateral and even insisting that their money was transferred into a specific account. Speaking to CNN Tuesday, Ai said he remains defiant, crediting his public support. ""But we have to appeal instead of giving up. I'm a public figure. I hope to help everyone in China to realize the reality. People said to me that 'when you're fined, it is like we're fined. That's why we supported you.""""

"(CNN) -- For over 16 years sport has played a crucial role in my life. Over that time I have learned many life lessons on the field of play which have become a part of who I am. My time as an athlete has given me the skill set to do the things that I am doing today. It has taught me discipline, dedication, responsibility, team work, time management, goal setting and most of all the ability to be passionate about the things I love. I was an ""able bodied"" individual with no obstacles in my way, nothing stopping me from competing with my peers. I swam on the varsity high school team for four years and was captain in my senior year. It couldn't get much more ""normal"" than that. Until all of a sudden it wasn't. The winter after I graduated I was left paralyzed and I was no longer what society constitutes as ""normal"". The most frustrating part was that, for me, nothing had changed -- other than the fact that my legs no longer worked. I was still this 5'9"" athletic female with a love for swimming. But the times they are a-changin'. We are approaching a change in the U.S. that could be as significant for generations to come as Title IX has been for these past 30 years. Title IX is a federal civic law in the U.S. which prohibits sex discrimination in education, therefore allowing women to compete in sports. This new change will allow disable student athletes access to sports, something that in my opinion is a no-brainer, something that should have been in place years ago. I didn't have this battle as a high school athlete as it wasn't until college that I went through being involved in sports with a disability. I always think of Abby when I reflect on what the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights is doing by putting these mandates in order. Abby is your typical fun loving, upbeat 11-year-old girl, who has a love for sports and, much like me when I was her age, she loves to swim. Abby is also paralyzed. Four years ago I had the privilege of meeting Abby and her family and she has changed my life. Abby is the reason I am so passionate about being an advocate for disable individuals because children like her should be given the opportunity to have access to all the same things I did when I was an adolescent -- disabled or not. In our society we are so focused on putting people in categories. Racial profiling, economic profiling, religion and even academic ability level. But when we categorize people like this we forget that in essence we are all the same. It is 2013, yet we are fighting for civil rights for disabled individuals, fighting so young adolescents can have access to equal opportunities . Sports are something that every adolescent should have access to -- regardless of gender, regardless of race and regardless of disability. After I was paralyzed I thought my days of sporting competition were over. Less than a year after my injury I went away to school and found myself in Boiling Springs, North Carolina, at Gardner-Webb University. It is a small private NCAA Division One school and my time there changed everything for me. I was given the opportunity to be a part of the team. They accommodated me and gave me equal opportunities, just like every other individual on the team. The head coach, Mike Simpson, didn't treat me differently, he didn't cut me slack because I was disabled. He held the same expectations for me as he did for all my other teammates. He also gave me the opportunity to go back to being a part of a team within a sport that I have loved all my life. I traveled with the team, competed in duel meets and even our conference meet. I was given full access to sport with the expectation that I trained just as hard as everyone else. I am a competitive individual and I have spent the last five years of my life training for competition but sport transcends medals, records and awards. Sport is about what you learn. The family that you find within your team, the sense of belonging you feel, the friendships you build. No child should be denied access to any of those things. As an individual with a disability I can say this; we are not asking for a hand out. We just want opportunity. There are so many incredible stories of athletes who have overcome disabilities, who have battled statistics and society's stereotypes and made a name for themselves. With the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights placing this mandate it is my hope it will raise awareness of sport for individuals with disabilities and open the eyes of disabled adolescents to the opportunities which are out there for them. This directive requires schools to make reasonable modifications to allow disable students equal access to sport. Just because our society labels them as ""disabled"", it doesn't mean they can't showcase their amazing abilities. Some of the greatest athletes in the world have disabilities. It is time we push past stereotypes and truly embrace this necessary change in our education system and society.","Department of Education set to introduce landmark rules on U.S. school sport .

"Paris (CNN) -- The Alexander McQueen fashion house denied Sunday that it is designing the wedding dress of Kate Middleton, who's marrying Britain's Prince William next month. Two representatives of the high-profile design house flatly denied the story in the Sunday Times newspaper. ""This is not true,"" spokeswoman Myriam Coudoux said when CNN asked if McQueen creative director Sarah Burton was designing the dress. Hongyi Huang, the head of press for McQ, the house's contemporary clothing line, also denied the report. Prince William's office told CNN: ""We're saying nothing."" ""We're not commenting on the specific designer for the dress, because Catherine Middleton wishes to keep the designer a secret until the wedding day,"" Clarence House said Sunday. Prince William, the second in line to the British throne, is marrying his college girlfriend Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29. The Sunday Times says Middleton will wear a dress designed by Sarah Burton, the creative director of Alexander McQueen. Both Burton and McQueen chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd flatly deny the story to the Times. But the newspaper claims Middleton was impressed by a wedding dress Burton designed for the daughter of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of Prince Charles. The article does not cite any sources. William is the older son of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth's oldest son and the heir to the throne.

"(CNN) -- Dramatic satellite images show large deposits of sediment in coastal Louisiana, the receiving end of the massive flooding on the Mississippi River. The sediment gush has a down and up side in region known for its seafood and delicate wetlands, a federal official said Friday. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA recently provided the stark imagery of the sediment plumes to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Louisiana to assist them with flood response. See flooding map from USGS . A map on the USGS website allows users to call up the plumes and see flood data collected by government agencies. The opening of the Bonnet Carre spillway caused a sediment plume in Lake Pontchartrain above New Orleans. Another plume resulted from the opening of the Morganza Spillway and flooding on the Atchafalaya River. The third is where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico. ""We live in historic times,"" said Phil Turnipseed, director of the USGS's National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, Louisiana. The tan and brown plumes resulted from millions of gallons of sediment-laden freshwater rushing to the Gulf through spillways, river channels and levees. Wetland seasonal flooding ""is essential to the health of coastal wetland ecosystems,"" according to the USGS. Extreme flooding that has occurred this year has delivered high amounts of sediment and nutrients. The sediment will hurt the oyster harvest in the brackish waters of Lake Pontchartrain, essentially a bay, Turnipseed told CNN. ""All of this is temporary,"" he said. ""Eventually, Pontchartrain will cleanse itself."" Flooding in the Atchafalaya basin has not been as severe as expected after officials opened the Morganza Spillway, but Turnipseed acknowledged it has affected residents. Across Louisiana, officials are still coping with the crisis. The Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness said Thursday that at least 1,230 structures in 13 parishes have been affected by floodwaters. Friday, it said 1,150 National Guardsman continue to be mobilized for the flooding response. For the Atchafalaya wetlands, the flooding is a plus because it will create desperately needed land, Turnipseed said. Gulf Coast hopes for busy Memorial Day . ""If the marsh grasses could sing, they would be singing praises,"" the official said. The sediment pushing through the mouth of the Mississippi is good for flood control, Turnipseed said, ""but it's not a good thing for the ecosystem."" Officials are undergoing the laborious of measuring and analyzing the sediment. Ecologists lament the sediment reaching the gulf, rather than building wetlands, which protect Louisianans from storm surge and support aquatic life. Over the past 80 years, the state has lost coastal wetlands equaling the size of Delaware, federal officials say. ""It's a national tragedy,"" Turnipseed said. ""The wetlands are needed."" The problem is not new. Natural processes and human disturbance, including dredging and pollutants, have taken their toll. Turnipseed on June 2 will present at the state Capitol a map of Louisiana wetland losses and gains from 1932-2010. He hopes the new map will help inform land managers and agencies on marsh restoration. Federal authorities, meanwhile, are in the process of closing portions of the Morganza Spillway as the swollen Mississippi River recedes. The spillway was opened May 14 to prevent the Mississippi from flooding New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Corps of Engineers has closed five of 12 bays, public affairs specialist Ricky Boyett told CNN on Friday afternoon. The Corps said much as 1.2 million gallons (172,000 cubic feet) per second had been pouring through the spillway, which diverted water through the Atchafalaya basin, but that number was down to 120,000 cubic feet per second later in the week. The high water has caused some flooding down the Atchafalaya. But the water levels ""continue to be lower than anticipated"" throughout the basin, Corps spokesman Ken Holder said this week. The river remained about five feet above flood stage Friday afternoon at Bayou Sorrel and about six feet over flood stage at Morgan City, on the approaches to the Gulf. But it was more than five feet lower at the town of Krotz Springs and about two feet below flood stage at Butte LaRose, about 20 miles south of the spillway.","Satellite images show large sediment deposits along Louisiana coast .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Republican-led effort to block President Obama's nominations for top federal jobs led to the 15 recess appointments announced by the White House, Obama's senior adviser said in an interview broadcast Sunday. ""The Republican Party has taken a position where they're going to try and slow and block progress on all fronts, whether it's legislation or appointments,"" David Axelrod told the CNN program ""State of the Union."" Axelrod noted that the previous administration had fewer appointees awaiting Senate confirmation at the same point after taking power. ""We have 77 appointees who have not gotten the [Senate] vote because they have been held up by the Republican Party,"" Axelrod said. ""Some of them are in very sensitive positions -- Treasury, Homeland Security, and boards like the Labor Relations Board ... where there are a huge number of vacancies."" Much of the controversy over Obama's decision to use his authority to make recess appointments focused on Craig Becker, a union lawyer nominated to the National Labor Relations Board. Becker, currently the associate general counsel with the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO, is one of two recess appointees to the board, which oversees relations between unions and employers. The chamber's 41 Republicans asked Obama in a letter last week to refrain from making Becker a recess appointment. Previously, two conservative Democratic senators had joined Republicans in a filibuster of Becker's appointment. Now, Republicans and business groups are criticizing the Becker appointment as circumventing the Senate and bowing to pressure from labor allies. Obama appointment to labor board sparks opposition . Now, Republicans and business groups criticize the Becker appointment as circumventing the Senate and bowing to pressure from labor allies. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that ""Mr. Becker's prolific writings ... suggest a radical view of labor law that flies in the face of established precedent and case law and is far outside the mainstream."" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, complained that consideration of presidential nominees is an important role for the Senate. ""What it's called is checks and balances,"" Alexander, chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, told CNN. ""And what the president has done here is throw fuel on the fire at a time when ... the debate about politics is a very angry debate to begin with."" In a statement announcing the recess appointments, Obama said he needed to act because Republicans were refusing to exercise their legislative responsibility in the interest of scoring political points. ""Most of the men and women whose appointments I am announcing today were approved by Senate committees months ago, yet still await a vote of the Senate,"" Obama said in the statement issued Saturday. ""At a time of economic emergency, two top appointees to the Department of Treasury have been held up for nearly six months. I simply cannot allow partisan politics to stand in the way of the basic functioning of government."" The Constitution gives a president the power to fill vacancies without the Senate's confirmation when the legislative body is in recess. ""The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session,"" states Article II, Section 2. Such appointees can serve without confirmation through the rest of the current session of Congress.

"(CNN) -- The third-grader's legs dangle at times from an overstuffed chair as he answers the questions of two female police officers. His manner and voice are casual, even helpful, but his words are shocking. Police say an 8-year-old boy confessed to murder. Legal analysts say the questioning crossed the line. And so, legal analysts say, were the methods police used to obtain them. By the time the boy was finished talking, say police in St. Johns, Arizona, he'd confessed to a premeditated double murder. The 8-year-old is charged in juvenile court with killing his father, Vincent Romero, 29, along with Tim Romans, 39, a man who rented a room in Romero's home. Police have said the boy confessed to shooting the men. He has not entered a plea. He will be allowed to leave a juvenile jail for 48 hours to spend Thanksgiving with his mother, a judge ruled Wednesday. The furlough will start at noon November 26 and end at noon on November 28, Apache County court administrator Betty Smith told CNN. Legal analysts who spoke with CNN were united in their opinion that the police questioning was improper and that any incriminating statements the boy made shouldn't stand up in court. A review of the tapes shows that the boy's demeanor was more suitable for a session of show-and-tell than for a soul-baring confession as he describes the carnage he saw inside his home. He does not appear to be depressed, scared or sorrowful.  Watch police interrogate the boy » . The body of his father's roommate was sprawled downstairs, he says. He ran through the house, shouting, ""Daaaad! Dad!"" His father was lying dead upstairs. ""There was blood all over his face, I think, and I think I touched it,"" he tells the officers. He showed them how he prodded his father's body with his foot, checking ""to see if he was a little bit alive."" Watch the boy describe the scene » . Then, he says, he sat by his father's body and cried for half an hour. Later, as the police officers' questions become increasingly pointed, the boy says he shot the men. He says he shot his father a second time ""so he wouldn't suffer.""  Watch boy say he shot his ""suffering"" dad » . That statement came, several analysts agreed, long after the camera should have been shut off and the boy advised of his rights to keep silent or consult a lawyer. Even then, they said, it is doubtful a child that young could understand those rights. Nowhere on the tape, which police call a confession, is the boy read his rights. No parent or guardian is present as he speaks. ""The law enforcement conduct in this case is inexplicable: from interrogating a third-grader without the presence of a parent or other adult to releasing an inflammatory videotape before a trial,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst. ""It's important, of course, to protect society from dangerous people of whatever age, but this case has been handled in such a way that seems to disregard the major challenges of dealing with such a young suspect,"" Toobin added. Sunny Hostin, another CNN legal analyst, agrees. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" she said. ""This is never how it's done. This was completely out of bounds.""  Watch why the interrogation troubles Hostin » . A judge in Arizona has issued a gag order prohibiting police and prosecutors from commenting further on the case. Although authorities once planned to try the boy for murder in an adult court, the case has been referred to juvenile court, where the proceedings are less transparent. Still, there's the tape. As the questioning begins, the boy is treated more like a witness than a suspect. One of the officers advises: ""I have to tell you the truth. I can't lie. Debbie can't lie, and you can't lie to us. We're just gong to be talking truth, OK? We're not going to make anything up. We're just going to be honest, OK, even if it's bad stuff, OK? We just need to tell the truth, just us, in this room."" ""I'm comfortable with the way they approached the beginning of the interview,"" said CNN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks, a former homicide detective. But the questions became more confrontational as the interrogation continued. At some point, he said, the boy stopped being a victim or a witness and became a suspect. That's when he should have been read his rights, Brooks said. That's when a parent or legal guardian should have entered the room, he added. He said the turning point on the tape comes when the officer expresses doubt over the boy's story about not being home at the time of the shootings: ""You're sure?"" one officer asks. ""Because I heard something that somebody said that somebody was calling your name and you weren't answering."" At that point, Brooks said, the interview turned into an interrogation. Children are highly suggestible and require different handling, said ""In Session"" anchor Lisa Bloom, who represented sexually abused children as an attorney. Children are eager to please, she said, anxious to give adults the answers the child thinks the adult wants to hear. ""Cases are legion where juveniles have been coerced into making false confessions,"" she said. ""All you have to do with an 8-year-old is make it clear what answer you want."" In this case, the officers made it clear that the boy's initial description of what happened wasn't the answer they were looking for, she added.  Watch Lisa Bloom say interrogators were leading the boy » . Bloom points to other cases in which false confessions were coerced from juveniles. Notable among them, she said, was the case of Michael Crowe, a teen who falsely confessed to killing his sister near San Diego, California. A transient later was convicted in the slaying. In the Crowe case, as in the Arizona case, the police videotaped the statement. Bloom said that should occur in all juvenile cases. Apache County Attorney Christopher Candelaria said the tape was released because it was considered public record. But he did not elaborate on why authorities would consider the police interrogation of an 8-year-old to be public record. Juvenile proceedings usually take place behind closed doors. At the end of the tape, the boy buries his face in his jacket as one officer asks, ""You OK, sweetie?""","NEW: Boy can leave jail next week for 48 hours to spend Thanksgiving with mom .

"(CNN) -- A writer commissioned to help launch a new ""Adventures of Superman"" digital comics series is drawing controversy for the comics' publisher not for his perception of the Man of Steel, but for his perception of marriage -- specifically, his opposition to same-sex marriage. Science fiction writer Orson Scott Card has been commissioned by longtime ""Superman"" publisher DC Comics to write a two-part story launching its new ""Adventures of Superman"" digital series. Card is perhaps best known for the classic 1985 sci-fi novel ""Ender's Game,"" but he also has sparked controversy with his outspoken criticism of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. ""Just because you give legal sanction to a homosexual couple and call their contract a 'marriage' does not make it a marriage,"" Card wrote in a 2004 essay titled ""Homosexual 'Marriage' and Civilization."" The essay concluded, "" ... either civilized people will succeed in establishing a government that protects the family...or the politically correct barbarians will have complete victory over the family -- and, lacking the strong family structure on which civilization depends, our civilization will collapse or fade away."" News that Card would be among writers on the new ""Adventures of Superman"" digital comics prompted marriage-equality group AllOut.org to launch a petition drive aimed at DC Comics. ""By hiring Orson Scott Card despite his anti-gay efforts you are giving him a new platform and supporting his hate,"" reads the petition -- now with nearly 12,000 signatures, according to the group. Card is no stranger to comic-book writing. He has written for Marvel Comics, penning series such as ""Ultimate Iron Man"" and comics based on his own ""Ender's Game"" among others. The new ""Adventures of Superman"" is not DC Comics' long-running, flagship ""Superman"" comic books but an ongoing digital anthology series of short stories about the hero that will be written by various authors. DC Comics, a division of Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, issued a statement Wednesday defending its decision to include Card among the writers. ""As content creators we steadfastly support freedom of expression, however the personal views of individuals associated with DC Comics are just that -- personal views -- and not those of the company itself,"" the statement said. Card declined to comment to CNN. Mitch Cutler, whose store, St. Mark's Comics has been open in New York City's East Village neighborhood for nearly 30 years, seemed to agree. ""Someone did tweet to us about boycotting the series, but since the first day (we opened) we have been committed to carrying everything we can in comics,"" Cutler said. ""I'm sure right now on the shelves there is content I might not necessarily agree with. So while I understand Mr. Card may have advocated things that might upset people, it would be very uncharacteristic of us to refuse to carry something for that reason."" Jermaine Exum who manages Acme Comics in Greensboro, North Carolina -- the city where Card lives -- has a slightly different reason for deciding to carry the comics. ""Our main focus is that other creators are working on this,"" including artists like Jeff Parker who has ties to Acme, Exum said. ""The public is running away with the Orson Scott Card story, but I don't want to short-change these other people working on the series."" Phil Jimenez, an openly gay writer and comic-book artist who has worked on ""Astonishing X-men,"" ""Captain America Corps,"" ""The Amazing Spiderman"" and more, is not OK with the decision, and believes Card's stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage takes away certain people's civil rights. ""I'm encouraging people not to buy his work because when they do they actively support a foully bigoted man who uses his power and influence to affect public policy,"" Jimenez tweeted. Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which has actively campaigned against same-sex marriage efforts and which counts Card as a member of its board of directors, says protesting Card's comics is un-American. ""For a movement that says it's focused on civil rights, it's surprising that supporters of gay marriage want to attack an opposing viewpoint and become violent,"" Brown told CNN. The decision to include Card comes at a time when the world of comics, while sometimes still criticized for over-sexualizing female characters, has moved to make homosexual characters a big part of storylines. In July 2012, in the second issue of ""Earth 2,"" a new series in DC Comics' ""The New 52,"" reimagining of many classic DC characters, Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern is an openly gay man. The series, along with DC's Batwoman, is up for a 2013 Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award. Marvel Comics had its first same-sex wedding in a June 2012 issue of ""Astonishing X-Men"" with superhero Northstar -- the first major comic-book character to come out as gay in 1992 -- marrying his longtime partner, Kyle. CNN's Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley contributed to this report.","Writer Orson Scott Card will pen a new ""Adventures of Superman"" digital comics series .

"(CNN) -- Scotland's Roman Catholic archbishop is contesting accusations of ""inappropriate behavior"" with priests, claims leveled as Cardinal Keith O'Brien prepares to join the conclave that will choose a new pope. British newspaper The Observer reported Sunday that three priests and one former priest have leveled allegations against O'Brien that date back 30 years. The Observer did not recount details of the claims or identify any of O'Brien's accusers, but said one of the priests alleged ""that the cardinal developed an inappropriate relationship with him."" O'Brien did not attend Mass at St. Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh on Sunday, but the Scottish Catholic Media Office told CNN that the cardinal ""contests these claims and is taking legal advice."" His accusers took their complaints to the Vatican representative in Britain and demanded O'Brien's resignation, The Observer reported. At the Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the church, told reporters that Pope Benedict XVI has been informed of the allegations. The Irish-born O'Brien is scheduled to retire on St. Patrick's Day, his 75th birthday. But in a message to the Archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh last Sunday, he said he expected to take part as the College of Cardinals gathers in Rome to pick a successor to Benedict, who has led the worldwide church since 2005. The accusations against O'Brien follow a buzz in Italian media about claims that gay clergy may have made themselves vulnerable to blackmail by male prostitutes, setting off speculation that a brewing scandal may have triggered Benedict's resignation. The Vatican vehemently denied the allegations Saturday, with Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone criticizing a rash of ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories"" as the cardinals prepare for their conclave. Benedict announced his resignation on February 11, saying that at 85, he was too weak to continue his duties. He leaves the papacy on Thursday, becoming the first pope to step down since 1415.

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- Two nongovernmental organizations that worked primarily on promoting democracy abroad were shuttered by the government of the United Arab Emirates this week. The Dubai office of U.S.-based National Democratic Institute was shut down Wednesday, followed by the closure of the Abu Dhabi office of Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, an organization based in Germany, the next day. Both pro-democracy groups saw their offices raided and shut down last year in Egypt. Egyptian authorities accused the organizations of international interference that was stoking continued protests against the current military-led government. According to the NDI, while the organization has a regional office in Dubai, it does not have any programs in the UAE. ""Our office was simply a regional hub which supported programs in places like Qatar and Kuwait,"" said Les Campbell, NDI regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. Campbell said that authorities -- he's not sure from where -- came to their office and announced that NDI's license was canceled, effective immediately. ""While we are disappointed at this turn of events and disturbed by the arbitrary behavior in Dubai, we do not have programs in the UAE, so it has no serious ramifications for our work,"" he said. The German organization, described as a think tank associated with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), reacted with even more surprise. ""We can only react with utter disbelief to the unexpected and sudden developments in Abu Dhabi. We have not been given any viable reasons. ""After the experiences in Egypt, we not only regret this decision. We would see it as an alarming signal if nongovernmental organizations and political foundations are not welcome in the Arab world,"" said Hans-Gert Poettering, head of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung Foundation. UAE officials have not yet commented on the closures. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is in the region, said Saturday she regretted the UAE decision. ""We are ... strong believers in a vibrant civil society, and both NDI and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation office play a key role in supporting NGOs and civil society across the region, and I expect our discussions on this issue to continue."" Meanwhile, press freedom group Reporters Without Borders on Friday condemned the government of the UAE for cracking down on bloggers and other online activists. ""March has seen a wave of arrests, attacks and acts of intimidation. We urge the government to abandon these methods,"" the group said. ""The authorities must stop arresting 'netizens' and bloggers for what they post online and must guarantee their safety."" Human rights groups of late have also stepped up their criticism of the UAE. According to Samer Muscati, Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, at least three online activists have been detained in recent weeks. ""It seems that the government is still frighted by the events transpiring in the Middle East and are trying to do what it takes to keep the Arab Spring from reaching its shore, regardless of how small that possibility might be,"" he said. Unlike many other nations in the region, the UAE was never affected by Arab Spring inspired protests. Nonetheless, the government has been quick to pursue activists who call for reform. Last year, the citizenship of seven activists -- known as UAE 7 -- was revoked by UAE. The seven pro-democracy activists with ties to Islamist groups were found to be a threat to national security. Also last year, five activists were arrested, tried and convicted for publicly insulting top UAE officials, committing acts that pose a threat to state security, undermining public order, opposing the government system and instigating others to break laws. UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan pardoned all five one day after they were sentenced to prison terms. According to Muscati, there was hope that the pardoning of the five activists last year was a signal of change to come, but that has not been he case, he said. ""These recent arrests are just a continuation of attempts by the authorities to silence critics and other dissenting voices,"" said Muscati of Human Rights Watch. Ahmed Mansoor, an engineer and blogger, was one of the five prosecuted activists. ""I strongly disagree and condemn any acts that violate the basic human rights and freedom of opinion and expression,"" Mansoor told CNN. ""The latest arrests and harassment of activists are directly related to the exercising of these basic rights."" Mansoor said the government is worried about the ripple effect of the Arab Spring. ""This crackdown does not help anybody; not the social peace and unity nor the country image in the international level."" Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Abu Dhabi; Frederik Pleitgen reported from Berlin.","United Arab Emirates closes offices of two NGOs .

"Washington (CNN) -- A California slaughterhouse closed after an animal rights group released a video of workers there apparently mistreating animals has been allowed to reopen, U.S. regulators said on Monday. The Agriculture Department said that inspections at Central Valley Meat Co of Hanford continue but the plant has made changes and can resume operations. ""As of this morning, CVM will be allowed to resume processing,"" Aaron Lavalle, a spokesman for the agency's Food Safety and Inspection Service, said in a statement. Lavalle said regulators had concluded an evaluation of an ""extensive corrective action plan"" formulated to address ""recent humane handling violations."" Jane Velez-Mitchell: Slaughterhouse video shows USDA needs to clean up its act . The slaughterhouse was closed on August 19 after an activist working with the group Compassion Over Killing recorded a video purportedly of cattle at the company being repeatedly shot with a bolt gun. Other cattle are seen being prodded to force them to stand up and some are seen hanging from a hind leg while apparently alive. The Agriculture Department told CNN in a statement last week that some of the footage showed ""unacceptable treatment of cattle,"" but did not show ""anything that would compromise food safety."" Lavalle said on Monday that the company has ""committed to a number of corrective actions, including additional humane handling training for employees and safeguards to ensure that only ambulatory animals are processed."" Central Valley Meats has been a major supplier for Agriculture Department programs, providing 21 million pounds of beef in 2011, or nearly 16 percent of the supply. Meat purchased by the agency goes to several programs, including school lunches. The Agriculture Department said its purchases from the company remain suspended until more reviews are completed. Three California congressmen, Devin Nunes, Jeff Denham and Kevin McCarthy, called on Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to reopen the plant.

"(CNN) -- Top Democrats in the House are giving no credence to those looking for a real scandal over a lewd picture that appeared on the Twitter account of New York Congressman Anthony Weiner. California's Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, stuck to her party's main legislative focus Thursday -- ""Medicare, Medicare, Medicare."" When questioned as to whether the situation was turning into a distraction, Pelosi replied ""That's your problem. If that's what's important to you, then that's what you'll report. That's not what's important to us."" Weiner has insisted that he did not post the photo, which shows the lower body of a man wearing underwear. The image appeared briefly on the New York representative's Twitter account Friday night. Weiner says he doesn't know where the picture came from and he believes his account was hacked as a prank. He told reporters Wednesday that he has hired a private firm to investigate. Weiner told CNN Thursday that he intends to ""get back to work doing the job that I'm paid to do."" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said he wanted to go over the facts before offering comments. He said it was a serious issue, and that it is important to maintain privacy. On the other side of the spectrum, Donald Trump, who recently considered a presidential run, weighed in on the issue. He told CNN's Piers Morgan that Weiner is either ""incompetent"" or ""lying."" The conservative blogger who broke the story has been calling for a full investigation of what he describes as either the hacking of a congressman's account or something Weiner wants to hide. Andrew Breitbart runs the conservative website biggovernment.com, which first reported the photo on Weiner's Twitter account. He has told CNN that the case warrants further inquiry by the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police. It was Breitbart who posted the heavily edited and incomplete video of a speech by U.S. Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod last year. The version he placed online suggested that she refused to offer her full help to a white farmer and Sherrod was forced to resign. A full version of the speech showed that Sherrod had assisted the farmer, who later came forward and credited Sherrod with helping save his farm. Sherrod has since filed a civil suit, accusing Breitbart of defamation, false light and infliction of emotional distress, according to a statement issued by the law firm representing her. Breitbart.com is also named as a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, over secretly recorded videos that proved deeply embarrassing to the agency. The video shows two conservative activists, posing as a pimp and prostitute, seeking advice from ACORN workers on setting up a brothel. The videos, which were posted on Breitbart's website, prompted a groundswell of action against the organization, including a limited investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and a slashing of funds from the federal government and several states.","Democratic legislators dismiss questions over Twitter photo .

"(CNN) -- Alabama rode the tide of a commanding halftime lead to beat Notre Dame 42 to 14 to win the BCS National Championship game at Miami Gardens, Florida. The No. 2 Crimson Tide scored on drives of 82, 61 and 80 yards against the top-ranked and undefeated Irish in its first three drives of the game. They added a 71-yard scoring drive with 31 seconds left in the half to take a dominating 28-0 lead. By that time, despite the fact that the half of the game was yet to be played, many commenters on Twitter were jokingly wondering if Notre Dame would come out of the locker room for the second half. The Irish did, but it did not get much better for them. In fact, one of the biggest hits of the game on Alabama's quarterback A.J. McCarron came from his own teammate Barrett Jones. The two teammates disagreed on a play call and had to call a timeout to get it cleared up. McCarron got in his lineman's face and Jones pushed him some three yards back, a feat that Notre Dame could never do throughout the game. Notre Dame also couldn't stop Alabama's running game. Crimson Tide runners Eddie Lacy and T.J. Yeldon both ran for more than 100 yards. Alabama has now won three national titles in the last four years, which had some calling them a dynasty. ""You can call us whatever you want but this was a total team effort,"" McCarron said after the game. Alabama coach Nick Saban did not shy away from the D- word. Saban said it was the team's work ethic that has brought so many victories. ""Because we have a great team we have been able to have a significant amount of success,"" Saban said. The last team to win three national championships in four years was Nebraska in 1994, 1995, and 1997. The '97 championship was split with Michigan. Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Brian Kelly said his team will learn from the loss. ""We are not there yet,"" Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly said. ""Alabama showed us that in the way they played the game. We got a lot of work left to do to get back here.""

"Shanghai (CNN) -- One of the key issues the next generation of China's leaders will have to consider when they take the reins in November is whether to let social media continue to develop as an increasingly important force in shaping government policy. Early signs are strong that Beijing will encourage or at least tolerate the growth of microblogging sites like Sina Weibo, and instant messaging services like Tencent WeChat, which have been allowed to develop relatively unfettered despite their potential to become breeding grounds for critical public debate over social issues. Beijing is quickly realizing these fast-developing social media can be an important way to get public feedback on social issues as China goes through a wide range of growing pains in its transformation from a planned to a more market-oriented economy. Equally important, Beijing also understands that social media can be an important tool for getting out the Communist Party's own message as it tries to show an increasingly restless public it is hearing their concerns. The rise of social media in China has been anything but smooth and tolerant over the last five years, as big names like Facebook and Twitter soared to global prominence on their ability to let millions of people around the world connect and interact in new ways based on factors like personal interests and social background. Both Facebook and Twitter were gaining a nascent foothold in China with their ground-breaking services when an uneasy Beijing abruptly blocked their sites in 2009. People power a sign of times in China's internet age . No official reason was ever given, as is always the case when propaganda officials take such actions; but the timing of the move just before the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown led many to suspect that Beijing was worried the sites could become hotbeds for debate and discussion on a highly sensitive matter that to this day is banned from all Chinese media, both traditional and new. The blockage of both Twitter and Facebook continues to this day, reflecting Beijing's clear unease at letting average Chinese form online communities through sites that are based outside China and therefore don't have to play by the country's strict self-censorship rules. By comparison, Beijing has become more comfortable letting homegrown, China-based sites with names like Weibo, WeChat and Kaixin fill a demand from average Chinese for social networking services over the desktop Internet and increasingly via smartphones. Unlike the big offshore-based names, domestic players, and anyone operating a China-based service for that matter, must follow Beijing's strict self-censorship rules and immediately remove any content banned by central propaganda officials or risk big fines and even closure. The homegrown Chinese services have had to walk a difficult tightrope as they tried to build commercial services while waiting for Beijing to take a clear stance on how much it was willing to tolerate in the world of online public debate. Beijing initially took a line of relative tolerance, only to slam on the brakes periodically when angry debate started getting out of control during discussion of sensitive topics like the high-speed rail crash in Zhejiang province last year that left more than 30 dead and 200 injured. Beijing's growing unease with the situation came to a head in late 2011 when it ordered social networking sites to register all of their users with their real names. China's 'Twitter' introduces contracts to curb rumors . The controversial policy was theoretically designed to limit rumor mongering, but many suspected it was actually a form of intimidation aimed at limiting public debate from people who liked to express their views under the protection of anonymity. But despite its draconian nature, that policy was never strictly enforced as Beijing appeared to ultimately stand aside and let social networking sites implement their own less-drastic measures to limit rumor mongering and other controversial behavior. Around the same time, Beijing also started sending a set of completely opposite signals through traditional state-run media that openly praised the new social media sites. That campaign saw publication of a series of articles praising the sites as a powerful tool for government and other state-controlled agencies to issue regular updates on their activities and get feedback on new initiatives and steps they were taking to address public concerns. This hot-and cold approach probably reflects Beijing's initial lack of understanding of the power of social media, followed by its growing level of comfort as it realizes the medium's potential as a valuable and also controllable tool to understand and address public concerns. While it's too early to say what approach the new leadership will take, the absence of a broader crackdown in the space, a practice often seen at this kind of politically sensitive time, means the current atmosphere of relative tolerance is likely to continue as Beijing learns the importance of accurately gauging public opinion and responding accordingly to people's concerns.","Beijing blows hot and cold on social media and its role as a forum for public debate .

"(CNN) -- The election is over, and it has already become easy to forget the election administration lunacy that plagued many communities this year: long waits for voting, changing legal rules even while the election was under way, misprinted ballots, incorrect instructions given to voters, and various machine breakdowns. When close elections lead to recounts and jurisdictions undergo the legal equivalent of a proctology exam, the remarkable variety of maladies that plague the American electoral system are exposed. But when a candidate's margin of victory exceeds the margin of litigation, we tend, as a nation, to rapidly develop electoral amnesia. We shouldn't need a Bush v. Gore-style heart attack, though, to shock us out of complacency about an election system that fails in its most basic functions. The long lines of frustrated voters that have characterized the last three presidential elections reflect deep problems with our democracy and how we administer it. President Obama acknowledged as much in his acceptance speech when he thanked everyone who went to the polls. ""Whether you voted for the first time, or waited in line for a very long time -- by the way, we have to fix that...,"" he said. He's right. The country needs an election system governed by uniform rules administered with competence and political neutrality. Until we get one, we will continue to trade one series of election problems for another as we stumble toward the next 2000-style disaster. Opinion: Big money lost, but don't be relieved . The first problem is that we let openly partisan state and local officials run elections. Political players, in other words, make the rules and referee the game. A state's chief election official might even be the campaign chair for a candidate in an election she administers. Every other democracy in the world has found some way to avoid this. Partisan election administration may be the most deeply entrenched problem -- and the hardest to change. Anyone who is now a statewide supervisor of elections was either elected or appointed by someone who was elected. The second, also uniquely American, problem is the extreme decentralization of our elections. We have no national election authority: states and counties are in charge of designing ballots, registering voters, adopting balloting technologies, allocating resources such as poll workers and voting machines and conducting the initial canvass of votes. To some extent, this decentralization can counter partisan manipulation at the state level by busting the monopoly one party might have over election administration. But it also leads to geographic variation in the quality of democracy that confronts voters on Election Day. Election administration competes with many other things for attention and money, like schools, police and emergency assistance. And even when resources are not a problem, the sheer randomness of decisions made state by state and county by county lead to marked disparities in the election experience for voters. Carville: GOP routed by reality . Third, even with the best rules and technology, poorly trained volunteer poll workers are often not up to the task. They do yeoman's work for our democracy and their service is largely thankless. But every election year, within hours of polls opening, Internet message boards fill up with tales of workers wrongfully enforcing (or failing to enforce) the law, floundering with technology, or fitfully attempting to navigate the most basic aspects of verifying voter identity and handing out ballots. These combined dangers are further magnified by the fact that we have more democracy than anywhere else in the world. Perhaps even too much. We vote for more offices and on more issues than citizens of any other country. It should come as no surprise, then, that a 10-page ballot in Florida, for example, contributes to massive lines when it is added to the witches' brew of manipulation, variation, and incompetence that define our elections. Perhaps the line in the president's speech was not a throwaway and reflects a real recognition that something must be done, despite dodging a bullet this election. The problems this year may not have determined the outcome of the presidential election, but you can be sure they are affecting the close elections for congressional seats and state and local offices. Even apart from electoral outcomes, though, our system should be seen as an embarrassment each time we try to project our democratic values abroad. We should fix the system now before we have to perform the next autopsy on a national election gone horribly wrong.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new Defense Department report says many civilian contractors working in Kuwait didn't have proper clearances and could have jeopardized the safety of U.S. military personnel and undermined national security. The Defense Department Inspector General said dozens of contractors worked in sensitive positions without security clearances or the official passes they needed. And some of those people, according to the report, were allowed to remain on the job even after inspectors uncovered the security problems. The report says a company called Combat Support Associates (CSA) was awarded the contract in 1999 for what was called Combat Support Services Contract-Kuwait (CSSC-K). The contract was extended and is due to expire at the end of September after costing the government more than $3.3 billion dollars. ""CSSC-K contractor employees occupied sensitive positions such as force protection officers, system administrators, and supply inspectors in Kuwait without obtaining security clearances,"" the report says. The department's inspector general says the company's security office failed to track 21 of 379 employees who were in sensitive positions, such as ammunition supply, and that 11 employees did not have a valid security clearance. In addition there was no information whether some of the employees had a U.S. passport, although U.S. citizenship was required by the contract . ""Additionally, CSA officials allowed 20 employees to remain in sensitive positions without the required security clearance after its internal quality assurance office and DCMA ( the Defense Contract Management Agency, overseeing the contract) officials informed CSA officials that they were in violation of the contract,"" the report says. ""If DCMA and contractor officials do not ensure that all employees have the required security clearances and maintain proper security information, they jeopardize the military mission and threaten the safety and security of the military, civilian, and contractor personnel in Kuwait."" CNN was unable to contact representatives of the contractor. The inspector general's report says the company claims it did not understand the terms of the agreement. ""According to CSA's human resources information system analyst, the Army did not clearly define or designate all sensitive positions; therefore, CSA officials relied on their own department managers to determine which positions required a security clearance,"" the report says. And the report suggests the Army and Pentagon's oversight of the contract may have been lacking. ""If the Army does not ensure that all contractor employees have the required security clearances and maintain proper security information, these employees pose a threat to the military, civilian, and U.S. contractor personnel in Kuwait, as well as to national security,"" the report says .","A new Defense Department report cites a contractor in Kuwait .

Senior officials said the president's broad goal was to seize back the mantle of change by talking about the need for a ""new beginning"" between Democrats and Republicans that can restore trust in Washington. Along these lines, the president was to make what officials described as a passing reference to the special election in Massachusetts but would not have a ""chastened"" tone like Bill Clinton after the 1994 election. Instead, officials said he would use the election defeat as a way to challenge Republicans to meet him halfway on the major issues facing the nation. Officials said he would note that with Republicans now having 41 votes in the Senate, they can't just block everything. The first test will come next week when the Senate is expected to begin debate on a jobs bill. The president was to specifically try to sprinkle the jobs bill with small business and corporate tax cuts to win over some Republican votes and call their bluff if they do not come on board. While jobs and the economy were to make up the bulk of the speech, officials said health care would also figure prominently. But they noted the president would not get too specific on the path forward because key lawmakers want to take a deep breath on the volatile issue while ramping up much more time on the jobs legislation. Beyond jobs and health care, officials said the second tier of the agenda would focus on three primary issues: . -- Financial regulatory reform, which would give the president another chance to press Wall Street to change the rules of the road to prevent another crisis. -- Climate change legislation, where the president would specifically cite the work of lawmakers in both parties trying to broker a compromise. -- Education reform, where the president would push for an increase of up to $4 billion despite lean times for other key parts of his budget. 7 p.m. Excerpts released .

This uncertainty comes days after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar's announcement that the Statue of Liberty is set to reopen to the public by the Fourth of July. Although there is little damage to the museum collection in the Immigration Building, there is significant damage to the infrastructure as a result of the storm, according to the National Park Service. During the storm, water filled the basement of the Immigration Building, and there was also significant damage to mechanical systems and the building's fire suppression system. The National Park Service stated that it is ""working hard to prioritize all the projects needed to reopen and will announce this information as soon as possible."" According to the National Park Service, Salazar stated that repairs to both Ellis Island and Liberty Island could cost as much as $59 million.

"(CNN) -- I hate Super Bowl parties. My wife would prefer that I not open this column with that sentence. ""We'll never be invited to another one,"" she says. Hmm ... I hate Super Bowl parties. Hate them. Oh, I love the Super Bowl. I love Vince Ferragamo and the Los Angeles Rams nearly upsetting the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1980. I love Jack Squirek's walk-into-the-end zone interception of Joe Theismann in 1984. I love Marcus Allen reversing field and William Perry running over the Patriots and Doug Williams shocking the Broncos and Jeff Hostetler filling in for Phil Simms and Steve Young yanking the monkey off his back. Opinion: Who is God backing in the Super Bowl? I absolutely, positively love the Super Bowl. Just not Super Bowl parties. Back when I was a kid, growing up on the mean streets of Mahopac, New York, Super Bowl watching was simple: me, alone, plopped down in front of the television in my den, football tucked beneath my arm, a bowl of pretzels to the side. I didn't want to be bothered; I didn't want to engage. I wanted to watch a football game -- in peace. Still do. But nowadays, Super Bowl parties have joined Christmas Eve dinners and Easter egg hunts as requisite American rituals -- enjoyment be damned. If you're not in a room with a large-screen TV and a bunch of balloons and 40 people complaining about the nacho dip, you're in the wrong place. Well, to hell with that. Nothing ruins the Super Bowl like a Super Bowl party. Or, to be more precise, the people attending a Super Bowl party. Not everyone, of course. But for every shindig thrown, there's guaranteed to be at least one dolt who -- like a ""Terminator"" sent back in time -- is programmed to ruin everything. The non-fan's guide to Super Bowl parties . Here's a quick breakdown: . 1. The Knows-Everything-That's-About-to-Happen Dolt: Four years ago, while watching the Cardinals and Steelers play one of the great Super Bowls in NFL history, I had the misfortune of being in the same room as Myles. I'd once played flag football with Myles and was, well, unimpressed. A short, stout man in his early 40s, he boasted hands of stone and speed of mud but talked as if he were Randy Moss. When I first spotted him at the Super Bowl party I thought, ""Uh, this can't be good."" It wasn't. Myles predicted every play five seconds before the snap -- and was right approximately .00872% of the time. ""Oh, they're gonna run James up the middle here"" -- pass. ""Big Ben needs to throw a long one"" -- screen. Myles didn't just prognosticate. He did so in a r-e-a-l-l-y loud voice. I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. I wanted to dress Myles in a Cowboys jersey and banish him to a bar in Philadelphia. Instead, I sat there, listening as this fool behaved like John Madden on whippets. 2. The Quiet!-the-Commercials-Are-on Dolt: Don't get me started. The Super Bowl is about football. Seriously -- it's about football and two elite teams and runs up the gut and slants and touchdowns and interceptions and field goals. It's not about the Alf puppet, John Oates and Justin Bieber teaming up for a wacky Pepsi commercial. I get it: Commercials are sometimes funny and clever. Fine. But if one more person jabbers on throughout the game, then tells me to ""Shhhh ..."" so he/she can watch the friggin' Clydesdales, I'm losing it. 3. The Long-Suffering-Fan-in-the-Jersey-With-the-Price-Tag-Still-on Dolt: Inevitably, someone will arrive this Sunday wearing a brand new Ray Rice Ravens jersey while talking about ""all the years I've suffered waiting for this day."" ""Can you name five members of the Ravens?"" Ray Rice. ""Good."" Ray Lewis. ""OK."" Jim Flacco. ""Go away."" I'm a fan of the New York Jets. I was born in 1972. Not only have I gone 40 years without my team appearing in the Super Bowl, but I've had to sit through the likes of Blair Thomas, Rich Kotite and JoJo Townsell. In other words -- zip it. 4. The Box Dolt: I can't remember the last time I attended a Super Bowl party where someone failed to pass around a sheet of paper with a bunch of boxes, and everyone was guilted into plunking down $5. Then, throughout the game, someone screams out ""14!"" or ""27!"" and everyone cheers. To this day, I have no remote idea what this means -- only that it irks the living hell out of me. 5. The Drunk Dolt: Not much really needs to be said -- he drinks 12 beers, eats all the nachos, vomits all the nachos on your shoes while screaming, ""Go Astros!"" and is sent home early. Fortunately, this year should be OK. The wife has agreed that we'll stay home, order a pizza and watch Ravens-49ers in the den with our kids. As long as no one talks, I'm golden. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman says he loves the Super Bowl, just hates having to go to a party .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's president is lauding a woman for pardoning a man who blinded and disfigured her in an acid attack, a gesture of forgiveness reflecting the spirit of the Muslim month of Ramadan. ""The act of altruism that occurred is an honor for us and the Iranian nation and caused many to learn a lesson from this move and to change,"" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told acid victim Ameneh Bahrami on Wednesday, the president's office reported on its website. An Iranian court convicted Majid Movahedi in 2008 of pouring a bucket of acid on Bahrami, after she had rejected his unwanted advances for two years. She had asked for retributive justice and the court ruled the attacker should be blinded with acid. A physician was to drop the acid -- under legal supervision -- into Movahedi's eyes on Sunday to punish him for throwing acid in Bahrami's face, but she stopped the punishment minutes before it was carried out. She told CNN two men were instrumental in bringing about her stance: a doctor at a clinic in Spain and Amir Sabouri, an Iranian who helped her get medical attention. Sabouri told her to forgive Movahedi and prove to the world that Iranians are kind and forgiving, she said. She said she stopped the ""eye for an eye"" punishment for her attacker because ""such revenge is not worth it."" This week marked the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan in the Islamic world, and pardons and commuted sentences commonly occur as a show of compassion leading into the holiday. ""Every good that remains in the world is the result of altruism and forgiveness,"" Ahmadinejad said.","The woman's ""act of altruism"" is ""an honor for us,"" the president said .

"(CNN) -- After what it calls a successful first campaign, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is launching a second anti-smoking campaign featuring tips from former smokers. ""They're real-life stories that will save lives and save money, that will have a huge health impact by highlighting the real-life stories of people harmed by tobacco and highlighting the fact that secondhand smoke also kills, also disables, also causes tremendous suffering,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC's director, said Thursday. The ""Tips From Former Smokers"" campaign, which launches Monday, includes ads featuring people such as Tiffany, 35. Tiffany says she was 16 when her mother died from lung cancer, but she also started smoking. She says the thought of not being there for her daughter challenged her to quit. ""I could not take the chance of continuing smoking and not being here for my daughter. I know how much I needed my mom still, and I didn't realize it until I had lost her,"" Tiffany says in the ads. Another ad shows Terrie, 52, who was diagnosed at 40 with oral and throat cancers and had her larynx removed. In a croaking voice, she tells viewers, ""I have a tip for you. Make a video of yourself, before all this happens, read a children's storybook or sing a lullaby. I wish I had. The only voice my grandson's ever heard is this voice."" Quit smoking: Your heart will thank you . A second ad features Tiffany and her daughter, Jaelin. With tears streaming down her face, Jaelin says to her mother, ""And just to think about me not having a mom and having to take care of you, I just can't imagine how anybody can be strong enough to do that ... and I'm very proud of you."" This year's ads also feature members of ethnic groups such as American Indian and Alaskan natives, who were not featured in the first campaign but have higher-than-average smoking rates, according to Frieden. Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, according to the CDC, affecting 8 million people and triggering $200 million a year in health care costs. An estimated 1,200 people die from tobacco use daily. After the first ""Tips"" campaign last year, the number of people calling the quit line increased by 200,000, Frieden said. ""There's very strong scientific evidence that ads like this make a big difference in encouraging people to quit,"" he said, ""and a larger number of people do quit long term because of the ads. That's been well documented internationally as well as nationally."" The CDC also encourages those looking to quit to take advantage of medication that might help them. It doubles or triples the likelihood of success, Frieden said. ""We do these messages, we do these campaigns for one simple reason -- they work,"" Frieden said.

"(CNN) -- An emperor penguin that lost its way from Antarctica more than two months ago was released back into his native Southern Ocean waters Sunday. ""It's an indescribable feeling to see a patient finally set free,"" said Dr. Lisa Argilla, manager of veterinary science at Wellington Zoo, where the bird has been recuperating since New Zealanders discovered it in June on a beach north of the capital city. Argilla said the penguin, nicknamed ""Happy Feet"" after the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins, needed ""some gentle encouragement"" to slide down a ramp off the research vessel that transported it back home. ""But once he hit the water he spared no time in diving off away from the boat and all those 'aliens' who have been looking after him for so long,"" Argilla said in a statement posted on the zoo's website. It's unclear why the penguin apparently swam more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) from Antarctica. Argilla said in June that the bird might have gotten lost in a current, or perhaps its internal radar went awry. The bird was found ""exhausted and hungry"" on Peka Peka beach on New Zealand's Kapiti Coast this summer, according to the zoo. It underwent multiple stomach flushes and an endoscopy at the zoo to rid its stomach of sand it ingested while trying to adapt to the foreign environment. ""In Antarctica, they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate,"" Kate Baker, a spokeswoman for the zoo, said in June. It's possible the bird mistook or tried to substitute the sand for snow or ice, she said. The penguin left the zoo Monday and spent the past six days on the research vessel in a specially designed crate stocked with ice. A satellite tracker and microchip will now allow fans of the bird to follow his adventures in Antarctica at www.nzemperor.com.","""Happy Feet"" was found in June, exhausted and hungry on a New Zealand beach .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China's legislature meets this week to seal a power transfer to new leaders, but don't hold your breath for signs that the new team will ease up on the tough Chinese foreign policy that has ruffled feathers in its neighborhood recently. As the National People's Congress opened in Beijing, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Fu Ying warned that the country had sent an ""important signal"" to the region that it would respond ""decisively"" to provocations on territorial disputes. That means we can expect Beijing to continue with its ""reactive assertiveness"" foreign policy tactic. China has perfected this approach in its ongoing maritime disputes in the South and East China Seas. The approach allows Beijing to use perceived provocations as a chance to change the status quo in its favor -- all the while insisting the other party started the trouble. In Beijing's eyes, it is a means of satisfying domestic pressure for a tougher foreign policy to match its economic might, all while trying to cling to the mantra of peaceful development. But this juggling act does not always work, and a number of countries in the region are giving up on the notion of a peacefully rising China. The prolonged deadlock with Japan over the sovereignty of a few islets offers a vivid example of this approach. In September, the Japanese government bought from a private owner three of the disputed islands -- called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China -- in the East China Sea. Japan says it purchased the islands to prevent the hardline Tokyo mayor from acquiring them and carrying out a plan to build there. Beijing interpreted the move as a betrayal of the two countries' agreement to shelve the dispute, and the subsequent months witnessed a string of Chinese retaliations that have kept tensions in the East China Sea simmering. China's retaliatory measures, termed ""combination punches"" by the state media, ranged from the verbal -- leaders labeling Japan's purchase of the islands a ""farce"" and vowing to ""never yield an inch"" -- to economic pressure, large-scale anti-Japan protests and naval exercises in the East China Sea. But the game-changer came when Beijing declared its territorial baselines around the islands, a move that legally places them under Chinese administration. Once the announcement was made, China began to regularly dispatch law enforcement vessels to patrol waters off the disputed islands, directly challenging Japan's de facto control of the area for the past 40 years. Such is the new normal, claim Chinese officials. But Beijing did not stop there. It sent a reconnaissance flight directly over the disputed islands, and Japan responded by scrambling fighter jets. The Chinese navy and air force have intensified their reconnaissance missions and drills in the East China Sea and, according to Japan, even locked weapons-guiding radar on Japanese military assets, claims China denied. Despite these actions, officials in Beijing have repeatedly stated that Tokyo started all the troubles and must accept full blame. Now, analysts in Beijing claim that a ""Pandora's Box"" has been opened, and there is no going back to the tacit agreement that has kept peace in the East China Sea for decades. Similar heavy-handed action was used against the Philippines in a spat over the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea in April 2012. When Manila maladroitly responded to a fishing run-in by sending a warship, China took the opportunity to strengthen its claim over the disputed shoal by deploying law enforcement vessels to the area, extending its annual unilateral fishing ban to cover the waters around the shoal; quarantining tropical fruit imports from the Philippines and suspending tourism; and roping off the mouth of the lagoon to keep out other fishermen. By maintaining regular law enforcement patrols and preventing Filipino fishermen from entering those waters, China has managed to establish a new status quo in its favor. A similar blueprint was then used in response to a maritime law passed by Vietnam in June 2012 that covered the disputed Spratley and Paracel Islands. Before the ink on the law had dried, China upgraded the administrative status of Sansha City, encompassing a group of disputed islands in the South China Sea, and established a military garrison. The development of Sansha City has continued apace. Following the central government's provision of 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) for the construction of the city, Sansha officials are said to be considering plans to build more ports, open casinos and create an offshore tax haven. By all accounts, new leader Xi Jinping has played a key role in crafting China's response in its maritime disputes and was central to Beijing's response to Japan's island purchase announcement. He was put in charge of a maritime security leading group in mid-2012, then the ""Office to Respond to the Diaoyu Crisis"" in September. After taking control of both the communist party and the military in November, his rhetoric essentially formalized the reactive assertive tactic by repeating the importance of ""peaceful development"" while pledging zero tolerance for those who would harm China's ""sovereignty, security or development interests."" That is not to say that Beijing is necessarily looking for external troubles, as it remains preoccupied with maintaining the momentum of economic development and preventing domestic problems from erupting into potentially destabilizing unrest. But unfortunately, there is little appetite in Beijing for blunting the edge of China's ""reactively assertive"" foreign policy. If anything, opinions are going the other way. As Fu Ying, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, put it: When facing provocations, the Chinese public ""hopes that China will be even more assertive."" If there is any perceived slight, no matter how minor, expect China to pounce. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt.","China has warned it will respond ""decisively"" to provocations on territorial disputes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Thursday that congressional opposition makes the likelihood of closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ""very, very low."" Gates' remarks at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee was one of the clearest signs yet of the dim prospects for carrying out one of President Barack Obama's earliest executive orders: to shutter the facility where the U.S. military has detained suspected terrorists since 2002. ""I think we are in the position, frankly, the prospects for closing Guantanamo, the best I can tell, are very, very low given very broad opposition to doing that here in the Congress,"" Robert Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Asked what the United States would do about holding so-called high-value targets, which presumably would include Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders, Gates responded, ""I think the honest answer to that is, we don't know. ""If we capture them outside the area where we are at war and are not covered by the existing war authorizations, one possibility is for a person to be in the custody of their home government,"" Gates said. ""Another possibility is that we bring them to the United States. Retired Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, Senior Fellow for Military Families United, said in a statement that the admission shows the administration ""is finally realizing that Guantanamo Bay remains the only facility suitable for detaining top al-Qaeda operatives and other terrorists."" ""It is essential to keep GITMO open as a state of the art intelligence collection facility and terrorist detention center,"" said Lippold, who was commander of the USS Cole, the Navy destroyer attacked by a suicide bomber, killing 17 and wouding 37, in October 2000. ""The nation's security is not something that should be subject to guesswork. A plan must be put into place for terrorists who are captured and that plan must start at Guantanamo Bay."" On January 22, 2009, two days after his inauguration, Obama issued an executive order requiring that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility be closed within a year, seemingly fulfilling an oft-made promise during his campaign. But controversy over whether to try the suspected terrorists imprisoned there in federal court or in military commissions brought the issue to a legal and political stalemate. In an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" in December 2010, then-press secretary Robert Gibbs encapsulated the problem from the administration's perspective: ""Well, obviously, there are prohibitions, legislatively, on the transfer of some of the prisoners. Some would be tried in federal courts, as we've seen done in the past. Some would be tried in military commissions, likely spending the rest of their lives in a maximum security prison that nobody, including terrorists, have ever escaped from. And some, regrettably, will have to be indefinitely detained.""

"(CNN) -- Move over Kim Kardashian, your crown as queen of reality TV has been stolen by rednecks. And not just one redneck, but many of them. Hollywood can't get enough redneck culture. Why? Because shows about rednecks are making Hollywood a lot of money. The most popular reality shows on cable no longer star ""beautiful people"" like the Kardashians or ""The Real Housewives."" Nope. Now that title is held by the likes of the men from A&E's ""Duck Dynasty,"" who make duck calls for hunters and look like a ZZ Top cover band. Also sharing that crown is 7-year-old Alana Thompson, better known as ""Honey Boo Boo."" She has coined expressions like, ""You'd better Redneckognize."" Her show even featured a visit to the ""Redneck Games,"" which her mother described as, ""a lot like the Olympics but with a lot of missing teeth and butt cracks showing."" Then there's History Channel's smash hit, ""Swamp People,"" which features alligator hunters in the Louisiana bayou. Also, don't forget National Geographic's ""Rocket City Rednecks"" and MTV's new show, ""Buckwild,"" which stars West Virginian teens and has been dubbed the ""Jersey Shore of Appalachia."" A quick look at the ratings for these programs makes it clear why the networks are red hot for rednecks. The third season of ""Duck Dynasty"" premiered on February 27 and the episode set the record for the highest rated show in the history of A&E. Amazingly, the premiere actually beat ""American Idol"" and ""Modern Family"" that night in the coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Add to that, just last week, ""Duck Dynasty"" held four of the top 20 spots on all of cable, while ""Swamp People"" came in as the 14th highest rated cable show. Comedian Jeff Foxworthy once joked: ""You may be a redneck if your lifetime goal is to own a fireworks stand."" But now that line might more accurately be revised to, ""You may be a redneck if your goal is to have a hit reality TV show."" What makes Hollywood's current love affair with redneck culture so intriguing is that it has demonized these folks for years. Hollywood has portrayed rednecks almost exclusively via a parade of inbreeds, morons and bigots. The film ""Deliverance"" is the most famous over-the-top example of this trend. There are also lighter redneck caricatures such as those in ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" and ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The list goes on. When Hollywood hasn't been demonizing rednecks, it has simply been dismissing them as being part of the ""flyover"" people who live between New York and Los Angeles. Some people in the South are understandably not happy with these new reality shows because they may be propagating negative stereotypes. In December, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia called on MTV to cancel ""Buckwild"" for fear it would present ""shameful behavior"" and advance negative stereotypes about people from his state. Object all you want, but the TV executives truly don't care. How can I say this? I'm from New Jersey, where we were subjected to an onslaught of similar reality shows. ""Jersey Shore,"" ""Jersey Couture"" and ""Jerseylicious"" are our equivalent of the horsemen of the apocalypse. ""Jersey Shore"" didn't end because New Jersey residents complained about the negative depiction, especially of Italian-Americans. (I'm half Italian so I was keenly aware of this issue.) No, the shows ended when America got bored with seeing people covered in self-tanner get drunk and hook up in a hot tub or punch each other in a Seaside Beach bar. With the redneck shows, there is a silver lining that was absent with ""Jersey Shore."" Most of us have never seen rednecks be themselves. We have only seen Hollywood's interpretation. So while I'm sure there are things that ""Honey Boo Boo"" says or does that make some cringe, there are also real moments with her and her family that are endearing. In the ""Swamp People"" episodes I've watched, the hunters are portrayed as resourceful people trying to outwit their hunting opponents. With ""Duck Dynasty,"" I'll be honest, I truly have no idea what the fascination is, but I'm sure many from other parts of the country asked the same thing about ""Jersey Shore."" In time, redneck reality shows will pass. A new group of Americans will become the focus of Hollywood's reality show factory. I'm not sure who that will be but I'm confident that before the reality show craze ends, every profession, race and culture in the United States will get their 15 minutes of fame. But as long as redneck shows get ratings, Hollywood will keep pumping them out. To them, it's not about the ""red"" of the people's neck, it's only about the green. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Shows about rednecks are making Hollywood a lot of money .
Obeidallah: For years, Hollywood has demonized rednecks in movies, TV shows .
He says now the networks like shows such as ""Duck Dynasty,"" which gets high ratings .

"(CNN) -- It's an itch he just hasn't been able to scratch. More than 54 years after he announced the success of Fidel Castro in the Cuban revolution, Larry King still hasn't been able to interview him. ""The day Castro marched into Havana, I was on the air in Miami doing my morning show and I made the announcement,"" King told Ismael Cala in an interview for the ""Cala"" talk show on CNN en Español. Just two years ago, King was in Cuba to try to get that elusive Castro interview, but the Cuban leader remains the only major figure he hasn't interviewed, he said. ""Forget politics, he has run a country for 50 years, he's a successful revolutionary, an intriguing person,"" said King about why he remains fascinated. One top interview he did secure -- with the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in 2009 -- came back into focus recently with Chavez's death. ""What's funny is that he spoke perfect English off air, but once the interview started, we had an interpreter,"" King said. ""He wanted to talk in his native language."" King -- the last person to interview Chavez on CNN -- recalls Chavez being easy to be around and engaging, even remembering him as a hugger and singer. ""He was a conflicted person. An enigma. Yes, he was against capitalism, but he helped a lot of people, especially in the Northeast (of the U.S.). When there was a shortage of oil, he gave a lot of free oil to that area."" Cala and King also talked about King's web-based show, ""Larry King Now,"" that's been on Oratv.com and distributed by Hulu.com since July last year, and his backer -- Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. ""Carlos Slim has become a good friend of mine,"" said King. ""He invited me to Mexico to speak at an event about three years ago, and it turns out he had been watching me for years. Now, we work together."" ""It's nice to have the richest man in the world be my partner,"" King added. ""He's very good at standing aside and letting us do it."" (According to Forbes magazine, Slim is the world's richest person with a net worth of $69 billion, having made his fortune in the telecommunications industry.) Cala took the opportunity to tell King in person how much of an impression he'd left on him when he was a young man in Cuba 15 years ago. ""When I first saw you, I was in Cuba and not knowing what my future would be,"" Cala said. ""And, now, I'm sitting here and interviewing you. So, dreams come true."" Cala even paid homage to his hero in his wardrobe choice for the interview, greeting King wearing a matching button-down shirt, tie and signature black suspenders. Since King lived in Miami for 20 years, some might find it odd that he never learned Spanish. ""I don't have a linguistic ear. I never picked it up,"" King said. But he said he still loves the language and music. ""I've always had Latin flavor."" The interview was done in English and will be dubbed into Spanish for the CNN en Español show to air on Monday, March 25, at 9 p.m. ET.","CNN en Español's Ismael Cala interviews Larry King .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A pre-teen me once learned how to slow dance to ""Surfer Girl."" Picture a middle school auditorium circa 1987. I was that retainer-wearing girl at the school dance, clumsily shuffling along to the Beach Boys classic with a nervous boy about a full arms-length away from me. It was an awkward moment, yet my heart still flutters when I hear those harmonies. So when I learned CNN's Talk Asia had booked the Beach Boys for an interview in Hong Kong, I jumped at the chance to interview Al Jardine, Mike Love and Brian Wilson. Blog: News Stream . They're currently on their 50th anniversary tour around the world. Dennis and Carl Wilson passed away long ago, but the band includes three original members -- Al, Mike and Brian -- as well as David Marks and Bruce Johnston, who joined the band in 1965. On tour, they're serenading fans with favorites like ""California Girls"" and ""Surfin' USA,"" as well as a delightfully fresh new single, ""That's Why God Made the Radio."" Although their new song is about a technology the band is nostalgic about, the Beach Boys are not stuck in the past. Incredibly, after half a century of recording and performing, they are not a tribute band to their 20-something selves. They're still crafting those richly complex harmonic sounds. They're still hitting all those notes. And they're still capturing the sweet, adolescent purity of ""Surfer Girl."" ""Surfer Girl,"" released in 1963, marked Wilson's emergence as a producer. He tells me, ""I wanted to do something original that was inspired by the Four Freshmen. When Michael and the guys came to my house one day, I learned how to arrange the chords. 'Surfer Girl' was the first song I ever learned how to make harmonies to a song."" Three years later, Wilson would produce ""Good Vibrations"" -- considered by Rolling Stone magazine as his ""ultimate triumph as a producer, and one of the most innovative pop hits of the Sixties."" ""The night we cut the vocals was one of the highlights of my life,"" says Wilson. ""It was a departure from anything we've ever done before."" The Beach Boys did the background orchestration in five different studios. Wilson tells me the production took little more than a month. Not so fast, claims Jardine: ""We were re-doing things endlessly until they were perfect because of him, 'Mr. Perfectionist' (pointing at Wilson) here. So it took more like six months!"" ""Good Vibrations"" is a multi-layered pop symphony with nearly everything thrown in -- sleigh bells, cello, harpsichord, even a theremin -- one of the earliest electronic instruments. As Wilson puts it, ""My brother Carl said, 'Why don't you use a theremin?' I said, 'What for?' And he goes, 'I don't know.' ""I came up with the 'Uooooooooooooooo' (he mimics the theremin sound). It was a scary record actually. It was a good scary."" Like a roller coaster, ""Good Vibrations"" twists and turns like a joyride of sound. And the boys all agree, it is their masterpiece. ""They are all masterpieces,"" says Love of the Beach Boys' full playlist. ""But the one that is commercially successful and brilliant musically... is 'Good Vibrations.'"" Half a century on, the Beach Boys are still creating new music that captures the emotional thrills of youth. ""We feel these emotions as if we were kids,"" says Jardine. ""We still have them inside of us."" Love adds, ""The harmony is timeless... as long as you can get those notes and create those sounds together, then there is a timeless factor."" When the interview wraps, Wilson is the first to rip off his microphone. He kindly agrees to pose for a photo with me, and -- after a handshake -- leaves the room. Love and Jardine then take to a small nearby stage and strike up an impromptu version of ""California Girls"" (with Al on bass and Mike doing vocals). Johnston then appears out of nowhere to play the piano. And then it hits me, I'm being serenaded by The Beach Boys. And inside, I'm screaming like a giddy 12 year old. But where was Wilson? ""Off to a buffet somewhere,"" quips Love with a smile. And why not? He has to feed the muse.","Kristie Lu Stout talks to the Beach Boys in an interview for CNN's Talk Asia in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong is fast becoming the Fort Knox of ivory. As one of the chief gateways to mainland China -- the world's largest market for ivory, according to animal welfare groups -- Hong Kong has seized tons of what Chinese collectors call ""white gold."" In the last six months alone, more than six tons of elephant ivory worth close to $HK50 million ($US6.5 million) was confiscated in Hong Kong. In one shipment alone, Hong Kong authorities seized 3.8 tons of tusks, equivalent to one-sixth of the total illegal ivory confiscated worldwide last year. Where this ivory is stored in Hong Kong is a closely guarded secret. ""For security reasons, we are not in a position to disclose further details of the keeping premises and the seized items,"" a spokesman for Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department told CNN. With a black market price of almost $3,000 a kilogram, Hong Kong's authorities are taking no chances. ""The keeping premises are equipped with adequate security measures such as security guards and CCTV surveillance,"" he said. But high-profile thefts in Zambia and Botswana have highlighted the security headache and the drain on resources that ivory stockpiles pose for countries. ""For many countries where ivory is detected entering the country illegally and seizures take place, especially involving large amounts of ivory, there is the very real possibility, given its current high value and the expense involved with maintaining security, of it finding its way onto the market,"" said Dr Naomi Doak, the Greater Mekong Program Coordinator for the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC. ""A number of countries have come out and acknowledged that they have lost ivory from stockpiles,"" she added. Part of the problem, she said, was that countries are only required by international agreements on animal trade to report the weight rather than the number of tusks confiscated. ""If (countries) have to provide detailed records including the number of pieces as well as the weight of individual items, it makes it easier to verify and also allows more information to be used in analysis such as transportation trends,"" she said. Scientists have begun a program of mapping poaching hotspots by analyzing DNA from seized tusks. For Grace Ge Gabriel, regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, stockpiles are an invaluable resource in creating a crime database. ""There is a lab that has been set up in the University of Washington in the U.S. where they have already constructed a map of African elephant DNA which will help them pinpoint which country the ivory came from and where the poaching hotspots are,"" she told CNN. Gabriel said that more often than not, poaching is repeated in the same areas. Information of this type helps law enforcers to choke off the trade at source. While the Hong Kong stockpile is among the best protected in the region, and authorities have been quick to cooperate with the DNA database program, Gabriel said stockpiles in general present a risk. ""We feel that confiscated ivory requires a lot of capacity to keep it in a secure location and leaving it in these places will always tempt people to get their hands on it."" According to the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES) which wrapped up in Bangkok this week, a large amount of confiscated African ivory goes missing every year. ""The size of ivory stockpiles in many countries in and outside Africa, and their possible contribution to the illegal ivory supply chain, remains another important gap in the current understanding of the dynamics of the illegal ivory trade,"" a report unveiled at CITES -- entitled ""Elephants in the Dust, The African Elephant Crisis"" -- stated. ""This gap could be substantially narrowed through mandatory, regular inventorying,"" it said. ""Forensic techniques may help to establish the extent to which ivory in illegal trade is derived from poaching or was leaked from official stockpiles."" The report said the number of large-scale seizures of ivory (more than 800kgs) destined for Asia had more than doubled since 2009, reaching an all-time high in 2011. Illegal ivory trade activity has more than doubled since 2007 and is now over three times larger than it was in 1998, the report said. The report also said that highly-organized criminal networks operate with relative impunity to move large shipments of ivory to markets in Asia as a result of weak governance and collusive corruption at all levels. While ivory has since 1989 been on Appendix I of CITES -- which outlaws its international trade -- critics blame a one-off sale of ivory stockpiled in Africa to China and Japan in 2008 for the latest spike in illegal ivory trading. As elephant numbers increased following the ban, CITES officials agreed to the sale of 68 tons of ivory from stockpiles in the hope that regulated ivory would flood the market, putting further pressure on poached ivory. The paper trail set up by the Chinese government to cover the newly regulated ivory products became the perfect cover for illegal traders. A flurry of false documentation branded poached ivory legal for trade and elephants have been slaughtered in greater numbers than ever. In one case reported by the Environmental Investigation Agency, the employees of a major Chinese ivory distributor were able to register and legalize 'new', or illegal ivory, simply by declaring to provincial customs authorities that they had forgotten to register ivory before the ban, but wanted to ""register it now."" According to CITES figures, the number of slain elephants in Africa was estimated at 17,000 in 2011, 7.5% of the continent's elephant population. Conservation groups say nothing short of a complete ban will halt poaching. Meanwhile, alternatives such as mammoth ivory -- legal because the mammoth has been extinct for more then 4,500 years -- has done little to stem the poaching, claim experts, instead fueling demand for ivory products. A report on the mammoth ivory trade commissioned by Care for the Wild in 2010 found that buyers of mammoth ivory were sometimes undiscriminating about the provenance of the piece. ""Some buyers of mammoth ivory items may notice that the quality of elephant ivory is usually superior for larger pieces and may switch to elephant ivory objects, which might encourage more elephant poaching,"" the report said. ""If mammoth ivory objects were to be introduced into Africa, businessmen might try to use them as a cover for their illegal elephant ivory objects; small items can be difficult to distinguish."" In Hong Kong, one of the main hubs for Russia's $20m-a-year mammoth tusk industry, finding mammoth tusks that are large enough to sculpt is becoming increasingly difficult. ""(Fossickers) can only work in summer because the tundra in Russia is frozen for the rest of the year and even then they're having to dig deeper to get the larger tusks,"" said one Hong Kong trader who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity surrounding all ivory trade. ""It seems like all the bigger, easy-to-get pieces have already been extracted."" Despite the legality of the mammoth tusk industry, he said people still come into his shop on Hong Kong's fine arts and antiques strip on Hollywood Road asking to buy elephant ivory. ""Many times, many times (people ask for ivory). Do they know it's illegal? Some do, some don't,"" he said. Conservation groups have now targeted what they call the ""gang of eight"" nations at the center of the illegal ivory trade -- Kenya, Thailand, Uganda, Tanzania, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines and China. Tom de Meulenaer, a senior CITES official, said the convention's ruling committee had ""run out of patience"" over the ivory issue and last week it moved to toughen up action against the worst offending countries. At its final session in Bangkok, CITES delegates approved a decision to demand an action plan from the so-called ""gang of eight"" to reduce the trade in ivory within 12 months. If these countries do not meet these targets, delegates said, they would likely be hit with sanctions barring their own legal wildlife and plant trades. TRAFFIC's elephant and rhino expert Tom Milliken said it was time for countries on ivory trade routes to produce blueprints for curbing the ivory trade. ""We've seen trade in illegal ivory double since 2007 and the illegal killing of elephants double since 2005. We're really at the highest levels of illegal killings and illegal trade in two decades,"" Milliken told CNN. ""There is a general sense that things are beginning to spin out of control."" He said that while Chinese demand was driving the trade due to its increased economic power and its history of ivory consumption, no other country was doing more in terms of making seizures. ""Unfortunately, it's just not yet registering a deterrent effect,"" he said.","Hong Kong has amassed a stockpile of tons of seized illegal ivory .

"(CNN) -- It paid to be a ""Lost"" fan Tuesday night. That is, it paid $150. Four of the six numbers drawn in the estimated $380 million Mega Millions lottery matched the numbers immortalized by the Lost character Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes, who hit a $114 million jackpot off them -- only to be haunted by the same numbers in later episodes. Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number). Hurley's numbers were 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. Unnerved watchers of the hit television show must have been left wondering whether the Dharma Initiative had a hand in the drawing. If you played Hurley's numbers, you won $150, according to a payout table on the Mega Millions website, though the same table noted that fixed prizes such as the $150 one ""may be paid on a pari-mutuel basis and (be) lower than"" that amount.

"(CNN) -- The mass deaths of thousands of red-winged blackbirds in Arkansas was caused by ""blunt force trauma,"" according to a new report by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Laboratory tests were conducted on 13 of the birds that were part of the group that flew into buildings and died in a neighborhood in Beebe, Arkansas, 40 miles northeast of Little Rock. ""The tests ruled out bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, pesticides and avicides (chemicals used to kill birds) as causes of death,"" the commission said in a statement. These results confirmed preliminary tests that were conducted after the incident. The tests revealed hemorrhaging ""consistent with blunt trauma,"" according to the report released Wednesday. ""In most instances, such traumatic injuries in wild birds are due to flying into stationary objects such as trees, houses, windows, power lines, towers, etc."" Officials say as many as 5,000 birds died in the incident. This incident came several days before another mass death of animals. In that incident, 450 miles south of Beebe, some 500 red-winged blackbirds, starlings and sparrows were found dead. Also that same week, about 50 dead birds were found on a street in Sweden. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.","As many as 5,000 birds fell out of the sky in Beebe, Arkansas .

"(CNN) -- As North Koreans face an uncertain future without Kim Jong Il, the world's attention now turns to his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, whom the ruling Workers' Party has dubbed the ""great successor."" ""Kim Jong Un's leadership provides a sure guarantee for creditably carrying to completion the revolutionary cause ... through generations,"" the party said. But the younger Kim remains a mystery. Even his age is uncertain to most of the outside world; Kim Jong Un is believed to be in his late 20s. The first formal mention of his name in official state communications came just over a year ago, in October 2010, when he was promoted to the rank of four-star general just before a rare meeting of the country's ruling party. Kim Jong Un is said to have a fondness for James Bond and basketball star Michael Jordan. He is believed to have studied in Switzerland and is thought to have English, German and possibly French language skills. Joao Micaelo, who went to school in Switzerland, believes Kim Jong Un was one of his classmates between 1998 and 2001. ""He was a normal guy like me,"" interested in sports, movies and computers, Micaelo said last year. ""He was competitive at sports. He didn't like to lose, like any of us."" Micaelo said his classmate played basketball and had basketball games on his PlayStation. ""The whole world for him was just basketball all the time,"" Micaelo said. Micaelo said he shared a desk with the North Korean. One day, Micaelo said, the young man, who went by the name Pak Un told his friend, ""I am the son of the leader of North Korea."" Micaelo said he doesn't know what to expect from Kim as a leader. ""I can just say what I know: Un, when he was 16, he was a good guy,"" Micaelo said. ""So, I don't think he would do something bad. But I don't know what he's been like in the last nine years."" At one point, Kim Jong Il's eldest son, Kim Jung Nam, was considered the top candidate to succeed his father before he fell out of favor after he got caught trying to sneak a trip to Tokyo Disneyland using a forged passport. In an interview with Japan's TV Asahi last year, the oldest son said he opposed the ""hereditary succession for three generations."" However, he added, ""I would like my younger brother to do his best for the people of North Korea and their true wealth."" A CNN analysis of more than 50 U.S. diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks suggest that Kim Jung Il was always closest to his youngest son. One from 2009 cites the memoirs of the elder Kim's former Japanese chef, Kenji Fujimoto, who said the leader ""adored Kim Jong-un for resembling himself, both in image and in personality."" Another analyst described Kim Jong-un as ""a bold and big-hearted person."" According to another cable from June 2009, Kim Jong Un emerged as the front-runner to succeed his father that year when he began working as acting chairman of the National Defense Commission ""to support his ailing father"" according to a cable from June that year. South Korean observers noted at the time that ""'Young master' is a nickname that the Great General has begun using for his third son."" But Kim Jong Un is simply ""not ready"" to rule, said Victor Cha, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an expert on North Korea. ""This is the most opaque regime that is a nuclear weapons state, and now they have a leadership vacuum in which a kid is basically trying to run the country,"" Cha said. ""So it's not a good situation at all."" His father began grooming him for the job only three years ago after suffering a stroke. In contrast, Kim Jong Il himself was groomed over a period of 14 years before taking the reins from his father, Kim Il Sung, in 1994. Though Kim Jong Un can boast an array of titles, it's unclear whether he actually has any decision-making authority. ""I think it's premature to conclude that Kim Jong Un will make all the shots,"" said Han Park, director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia. ""Kim Jong Un is not going to be expected, nor is he qualified, to make tough decisions. But the party system is there, and the decision-making mechanism that has been established by Kim Jong Il will continue. And therefore the succession process -- even in intermediate terms -- should be smooth,"" Park said. It is likely that Kim Jong Un's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, will rule behind the scenes as Kim Jong Un trains on the job, the global intelligence firm Stratfor said. Kim Jong Il delayed choosing a successor from among his sons to avoid allowing anyone to build up their own support base independent of their father, Stratfor said in its analysis. In recent months, Kim Jong Un was tied to the disastrous effort to revalue the North Korean currency, RAND's Bruce Bennett, an Asia analyst who has worked with the U.S. Department of Defense, as well as South Korean and Japanese militaries. That effort led to protests -- unusual for the closed country -- and food shortages as people took to bartering in absence of available currency. So now, the world waits to see where the young man may steer his country -- and how North Korea will interact on the global stage in years to come. ""No one has any idea of what comes next,"" Cha said. ""We are in unknown territory.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Prosecutors decided there's not enough evidence against Too Short to prosecute him him on a felony drug charge made against him a week ago. Los Angeles Police arrested the West Coast rapper for meth possession and driving under the influence of alcohol on a Hollywood street during a traffic stop last Wednesday. The Los Angeles district attorney dropped the meth charge against Todd Anthony Shaw -- that's the 46-year-old rapper's real name -- but sent the drunken driving charge to the city attorney for possible prosecution, district attorney spokeswoman Jane Robison said Wednesday. Too Short's manager David Weintraub acknowledged to CNN that Short's breath test at the scene tested ""0.01 above the limit in California."" ""As for drugs- we call bull,"" Weintraub said. ""Short was diligently searched and cuffed prior to being placed in the disgustingly filthy patrol car. Ask yourself, how did the police not find the drugs on the initial search but only after they brought Short to the precinct?"" The patrol car ""smelled like vomit and was littered with remnants from prior arrests of the evening,"" he said. ""Any assertion that Short was carrying powder is ridiculous! Every rap fan knows Short's into weed!"" He tried to run away after blowing into the intoxication meter, Officer Cleon Joseph told CNN last week. ""He didn't get very far at all."" His manager said there was a reason for that.

"(EW.com) -- You know you've reached the summer box office doldrums when not a single new wide release is able to break $7 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Such was the case this weekend, when the top 12 movies grossed a cumulative $83.4 million, which makes this the least attended frame at the box office since December 9-11, 2011, when the top 12 films earned just $67.8 million. Once again, ""The Expendables 2"" led the chart, dropping 53 percent from its opening frame to $13.5 million -- the lowest total for a No. 1 movie since that aforementioned December frame when ""New Year's Eve"" topped the chart with a sad $13.0 million. After 10 days, ""The Expendables 2,"" which carries a reported $100 million budget, has grossed $52.3 million and is running well behind the total of the original ""Expendables,"" which had grossed $65.4 million at the same point in its run. The Lionsgate action entry may finish with just under $80 million. In second place, Universal's $125 million sequel ""The Bourne Legacy"" slid by 46 percent in its third weekend to $9.3 million, which lifted its total to $85.5 million. The spy thriller, which has Jeremy Renner taking over leading man duties from Matt Damon, will not be able to match the $121.7 million domestic cume of the original ""Bourne Identity,"" which debuted in June 2002. Legacy looks like it will have to settle for about $105 million. Focus Features' ""ParaNorman"" finished in third place with $8.6 million. The creepy stop-motion 'toon dipped 39 percent and has now earned $28.3 million after two weekends. The 2009 flick ""Coraline,"" which, like ""ParaNorman,"" was also produced by Laika Entertainment, had earned $35 million at the same point in its run, and that film finished with $75.3 million domestically. ""ParaNorman,"" for which Focus did not provide budget information (though it likely cost about the same as Coraline â€” $60 million) may climb to about $60-65 million. 'New Normal': Utah station won't air it . Warner Bros.' political comedy ""The Campaign"" held solid in its third weekend, declining 43 percent to $7.4 million. The Will Ferrell/Zack Galifinakis collaboration has earned $64.5 million total. Two other holdovers finished close behind. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" fell 35 percent to $7.2 million, which lifts its total to $422.2 million. It will surpass ""The Lion King"" to become the tenth highest-grossing film of all time this week. Close behind this week, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" dropped 34 percent to $7.1 million, giving Disney's $25 million family drama a 12-day total of $27.1 million. Way back in seventh place was the first of this weekend's new releases, the Joseph Gordon-Levitt bike messenger thriller ""Premium Rush,"" which could only pedal $6.3 million worth of tickets from 2,225 theaters. Sony's $32 million action film, which was moved from January to August late last year earned a ""B"" CinemaScore grade. The misfire still did better than its fellow newcomers. Open Road's aggressively marketed comedy ""Hit & Run,"" which stars Kristen Bell, Dax Shepard, and Bradley Cooper, bombed in tenth place with $4.7 million from a whopping 2,870 theaters. Audiences issued the film a dismal ""C+"" CinemaScore grade. Warner Bros.' $17 million horror entry ""The Apparition"" found just $3 million (enough for 12th place) despite the presence of two mega-franchise stars: ""Twilight's"" Ashley Greene and Harry Potter's Tom Felton. This performance was expected, as the film was given almost no promotion and played in only 810 theaters. On a frame filled with lackluster holdovers and fizzling newcomers, the biggest story this weekend is certainly the breakout performance of conservative documentary ""2016: Obama's America,"" which expanded from 169 to 1,091 theaters and grossed an impressive $6.2 million -- a 401 percent increase from its previous frame. Neil Armstrong: Celeb tributes on Twitter . The $2.5 million indie, distributed by Rocky Mountain Pictures, has enjoyed increasing per theater averages over the last two weekends (read a more in-depth analysis about the film here), and although its per theater average decreased slightly from $7,365 to $5,718 this weekend (this was all but expected given the massive jump in theaters), it still notched the highest per theater average in the Top 20. ""2016"" has earned $9.1 million after seven weekends, making it the highest grossing conservative documentary ever, above ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed,"" which grossed $7.7 million in 2008. While the film has already earned more than most documentaries could ever dream of earning (Weintein's much-publicized doc Bully grossed $3.5 million), its gross doesn't yet compare to Michael Moore's liberal doc ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" which grossed $119.2 million in 2004, George W. Bush's re-election year. Keep in mind that film had a major studio (Lionsgate) and marketing campaign behind it, and it opened in 868 theaters. 2016 opened in one theater -- in Houston -- and had to rely on word-of-mouth and talk radio promotions before its national ad campaign kicked off two weeks ago. With the Republican National Convention right around the corner, and the heightened awareness that ""2016's"" box office performance this weekend will bring, it's likely that the anti-Obama documentary will stick around at the box office as word-of-mouth about its existence continues to spread. While it would be downright shocking for the film to climb as high as ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" -- and, to be clear, I think that scenario is very unlikely -- at this point, there's no telling how much it will earn. Stay tuned. Two other tidbits: Last weekend's runner-up, ""Sparkle,"" plummeted 64 percent to 11th place with $4.2 million. After 10 days, the Whitney Houston drama has grossed a paltry $18.9 million. In limited release, Mike Birbiglia's ""Sleepwalk With Me"" broke the house record at the IFC Center, pulling in $65,000. A press release for the film boasts that this is a ""Record Breaking Opening Weekend."" What record did it break, you ask? According to the release, the film scored ""the highest per-screen debut for an American non-animated film from a first-time filmmaker."" Of course. 1. The Expendables 2 -- $13.5 million . 2.

"Knoxville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Heart-wrenching cries echo through the halls of the neonatal intensive care unit at East Tennessee Children's Hospital. Nearly half of the newborn babies in the hospital's NICU are suffering from prescription drug withdrawal. For over a year, the Knoxville hospital has been dealing with a dramatic increase in the number of newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS, which is the withdrawal process a newborn baby goes through after in utero exposure to certain medications. ""When I first got into neonatology the most common problem -- and still the most common problem -- that we take care of is premature babies or babies with respiratory distress,"" said neonatology director Dr. John Buchheit, a 17-year veteran at Children's. ""But I had no idea that we would be seeing this issue, to this degree."" Narcotics used during pregnancy pass through the placenta to the baby. Once the baby is born, he or she no longer has access to the drugs and will likely go through withdrawal. According to Buchheit, opioids -- like oxycodone -- are the worst offenders for the babies suffering from NAS at his hospital. Between 55% and 94% of babies exposed to opioids prior to birth exhibit signs of withdrawal, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The babies are easily agitated and cry constantly, and many cannot be near sound and light. Other symptoms can include a distinct, high-pitched cry, tightening of the muscles and seizures. While prescription drug abuse is a problem in nearly every neighborhood in America, it is particularly epidemic in Tennessee, which ranks among the top states in the overuse of prescription pain medications. Study: Every hour, a baby is born with NAS . A recent Tennessee health department survey found that about a third of pregnant women in state treatment programs are addicted to prescription pain meds. As a result, the number of babies born with NAS at East Tennessee Children's Hospital doubled from 2010 to 2011. This epidemic is tearing apart families in eastern Tennessee, according to Department of Children's Services Attorney Susan Kovac. ""In Knox County, we're drowning,"" she said. ""We've seen the number of children in foster care increase by almost 50% over the last few years, and that's just the tip of the iceberg because we're trying to keep the children out of foster care. We've got lots and lots of relatives who are raising drug-exposed infants."" State caseworkers are called in to handle the worst cases of babies suffering from NAS. ""We come and talk to the mom and try to find out, what's the level of her abuse, what's the level of her addiction, what can we do to get her clean so that she can be in a position to take care of her baby,"" Kovac explained. Since the epidemic is relatively new, there is no national protocol on how to treat NAS. East Tennessee Children's Hospital focuses its treatment on two areas: environmental and medicinal. Last year, the hospital created a wing of private rooms that is quieter, darker and easier to control for the massive influx of babies suffering from drug withdrawal. The hospital also trains volunteers, called cuddlers, to hold and comfort the babies. Bob Woodruff, a retired marketing professor and grandfather, spends six hours a week giving these babies a little extra love. ""It's tremendously rewarding to take a stressed baby and work with that baby until that baby is feeling better or sleeping,"" Woodruff said. ""It also makes the job of the nurses a lot easier. It's a lot easier for them to come into a room and deal with a calm baby, rather than a crying baby. So I feel like I'm really helping the nurses, as well as helping the babies."" In addition to improving their environment, the hospital has also developed a successful drug treatment program for these babies, according to pharmacist Terry King. ""When I first arrived, we were treating the babies and stabilizing them on methadone and then discharging them to have outpatient treatment,"" he said. ""Then we decided that probably wasn't the safest and most effective way to treat them. So we decided to switch to the morphine."" Treatments are individualized based on the severity of withdrawal and babies are given small doses of morphine every three hours with feedings. Over the following weeks, doses are gradually decreased to wean babies off the drugs. Since adopting the morphine protocol, the average hospital stay for these infants has decreased by several days, now averaging 24 days. As East Tennessee Children's Hospital continues to treat these defenseless drug-dependent babies and chip away at the underlying causes of drug abuse through education and proper medical care, Buchheit admits that the future for these newborns with NAS is uncertain. ""There is no doubt that they are at an increased risk for problems with their learning and development throughout their childhood, and problems with behavior once they reach school age,"" he said. In the meantime, the hospital has become a pioneer in the treatment of babies with NAS. Other states are turning to them for guidance. ""This problem is faced all over the country ... and people are interested in what we're doing because we know it's a safe, successful plan to administer,"" King said. ""The process is complex to wean these babies and we think that what we've developed has helped make the complex, simpler.""","Tennessee ranks among the top states dealing with prescription drug abuse .

"GALVESTON, Texas (CNN) -- As Galveston's leaders on Monday repeatedly urged its residents to stay away, people who never left tried to make the best of their muggy, tree-strewn, powerless city. iReporter Carlos Ortega says there's ""not an inch that isn't damaged"" in his Galveston, Texas, neighborhood. Amy Reid and her neighbors found a good use for all the frozen dinners that had piled up over weeks in their freezers, pooling them as some kind of high-sodium feast they might have to subsist on for a long time. As of Monday night, there was only one convenience store open in Galveston and one was lucky to find beef jerky and fruit roll-ups on the shelves. Reid and her new friends cooked on a BBQ and slept on her porch, choosing to suffer the bugs rather than spend a restless night in a sauna-hot house. Her home, hoisted on stilts, was not flooded. ""We've got a whole group of people along the block,"" she said. ""One guy down here has a generator so he charges our phones up and our laptops up."" DVDs on a laptop pass the long wait before Galveston is up and running again. City manager Steve LeBlanc said people like Reid who remain in Galveston should leave. There's not enough clean drinking water to serve the needs of the 15,000 to 20,000 people who stayed on the island, he said Monday, and there would be a ""downward spiral if everybody started coming back."" The city's resources are ""stretched to the max,"" and it could be a month before electricity is restored. The cleanup will be massive, he said, and the city is ""unsafe.""

But Sarah Allen returned to her Houston home Monday, finding it in relatively good shape. Her carpeting was wet from leaks near a sliding glass door, but her apartment had not flooded. She, her boyfriend and six other people rode out Hurricane Ike at a friend's house. ""Lots of trees are down in people's apartments,"" she said. ""The covered parking lot has a metal roof and some of it has fallen on cars. Some was rolled up."" About 150,000 of the 220,000 residents who evacuated ahead of the storm were still out of their homes Monday, said Judge Ed Emmett, chief executive of Harris County, which includes Houston. City officials did not lift a boil-water order as expected Monday afternoon, saying water in one location was being retested. Power has been restored to at least 500,000 customers in the Houston area, according to the Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, but another 1.5 million people in the state still have no electricity.

She and her husband relied on a battery-powered radio for information and loaded their refrigerator with ice before the storm. ""Everything in there stayed pretty cool,"" she said.

The wait outside her regular grocery store was a half-hour so the couple went to a CVS pharmacy and stocked up on items they said they would probably never eat like canned mixed nuts and chicken broth. iReport.com: Shattered Houston buildings . Davidson did have the one most desired and scarce of goods -- gasoline. At least 14 Texas refineries closed in the hours before the hurricane hit, taking away more than 20 percent of the nation's oil capacity, The Associated Press reported. Across the nation, gas prices soared for the third straight day, jumping a full dollar at some gas stations. Arguments broke out at gas stations and tensions were high everywhere. Thousands of people remained in shelters, wondering what homes they had to return to. Others waited in line to get water, ice and food at 60 distribution sites the Federal Emergency Management Agency had established across Texas. Perhaps the most dire area of the state was Bolivar Peninsula, a resort on Galveston Bay where entire neighborhoods were destroyed. A rescue team on Monday saved 60 people who were stranded there among homes leveled to their foundations. On Sunday, a Galveston County sheriff's official said three bodies were pulled from storm wreckage in Port Bolivar. Galveston residents had been warned as Ike approached the Texas coast to leave or face ""certain death"" from its 12- to 15-foot storm surge. iReport.com: Facing the deadly storm . ""Sometimes the aftermath of the storm is worse than the storm itself,"" Galveston Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said. ""There's nothing to come here for right now. ... Please leave.""

"(CNN) -- Jakadrien Turner has arrived back in Texas, eight months after she was mistakenly deported to Colombia, the pilot and a flight attendant on a Dallas-bound flight told CNN. The 15-year-old girl was the last person off the plane Friday evening, according to CNN's Jason Morris, who was on the flight. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport police officers escorted her off the aircraft. Turner wound up being deported to Bogota, Colombia, in May 2011 after U.S. authorities last year mistook the girl, an apparent teenage runaway who lacked identification, for a Colombian national. The Colombian Institute for Family Welfare confirmed Thursday that Turner was then in its custody, is pregnant and entered the country as an adult. The institute said that Colombian authorities learned a month ago that this female may in fact be a 15-year-old American citizen, after which she was placed in a protection program there. She left Colombia at 10:30 a.m. Friday, according to U.S. State Department spokesman William Ostick, who noted that the U.S. Embassy in Bogota worked closely with Colombian officials as well as authorities in Texas to bring Turner's case to a resolution. The girl who called herself Tika Cortez . ""It's a giant step. I'm relieved, but I won't be completely relieved until I get her in my arms again,"" the girl's mother said. ""A weight has definitely been lifted."" Johnisa Turner has not yet talked with her daughter, who ran away from home in the fall of 2010, but said she is relieved to know she is located. So, too, is the girl's grandmother Lorene Turner, who said U.S. Embassy officials called with the news that her granddaughter would be turned over to U.S. officials. ""When I heard those words, I didn't hear nothing else. I flipped out. I can't wait,"" she said. After the girl went missing, the family tracked her to Houston, where she worked at a music club under a different name. They tried to get help from authorities there, to no avail. They later learned she was in Colombia, partying and smoking marijuana, and a detective told them she was pregnant. Jakadrien's family is still demanding to know why immigration authorities deported the teen -- a U.S. citizen with no knowledge of Spanish -- and why they simply took her at her word when she gave them a fake name. The family's attorney, Ray Jackson, told CNN on Friday the family believes the girl's civil rights were violated when authorities allowed her to be deported. He said that lawsuits against the agencies who dealt with her case are in the works, he said. ""Somewhere the ball was dropped,"" Jackson said. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency maintains she was arrested in Houston for theft and told them she was an adult from Colombia. The agency says authorities believed her story because she maintained her false identity throughout the process. They handed her over to an immigration judge, who ordered her removed from the country. ""At no time during these criminal proceedings was her identity determined to be false,"" the agency says. It says criminal database searches and biometric verification revealed no information to invalidate her claims. Jackson says it doesn't make sense, explaining that the immigration agency took her fingerprints but failed to match them to the name she gave. The agency says it is taking the allegations very seriously and is ""fully and immediately investigating the matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of the case."" Pictures of the teen taken in Colombia showed her sitting on men's laps smoking marijuana, her grandmother said. But she appeared to be reaching out for help, she said, listing on Facebook the names of everyone at parties, perhaps so she could be traced. Her family's lawyer says he doesn't believe that the girl was trying to fake her way out of the United States by adopting a false identity throughout the process. ""I don't buy that she had the wherewithal to be able to bamboozle the government,"" Jackson says. ""You know, kids are scared when they get around authorities. ... To think that you could bamboozle them to create a new identity, it just doesn't make sense."" Colombia's foreign ministry said Thursday it was investigating what sort of verification its consulate in Texas requested before giving the girl an expedited provisional passport as part of deportation proceedings, as well as how she got work authorization for training at a call center as part of the government's ""Welcome Home"" program. Attorneys with the program made a sworn declaration in front of a notary pointing to ""inexact information"" that allowed her to receive work papers, the foreign ministry said. ""Those lawyers are no longer providing services to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic walked on to the court in a Darth Vader mask -- but it was the world No. 1 elect who was spooked after crashing out of the Paris Masters in his opening match. The Serbian tennis star, who is known for his pre-match antics, suffered a Halloween horror show as he lost 0-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 to Sam Querrey in the second-round clash. Federer to surrender world No. 1 ranking . The U.S. player, ranked 23rd, hit 18 aces on his way to grinding out victory in two hours, meaning Andy Murray is the highest-ranked player left in a field weakened by the absence of current No. 1 Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Murray secured his place in the next round following a comfortable 7-5 6-3 win over Paul-Henri Mathieu of France and will now face Poland's Jerzy Janowicz. At least Djokovic will now have a sufficient recovery period ahead of the World Tour Finals, which begin in London on Monday -- when he officially returns to the top of the rankings due to Federer's decision not to defend his Paris title. ""I knew the main problems would be my energy, it wasn't there during the second set. I really felt my level drop,"" Djokovic said. ""I struggled every game, but on the brighter side I have time to rest. I've been through a really difficult period this last few weeks. There have been a lot of things on my mind, some things happened. ""I have a couple of days now to rest. I've had to face some things a bit unusual for me, but when you lose a match you move on and go to the last tournament of the year."" Djokovic beats Murray in classic Shanghai final . Querrey, who will next play either Canadian 14th seed Milos Raonic or Frenchman Jeremy Chardy, was relieved to recover after losing the first eight games of the match. ""It was a little embarrassing. I walked over to my girlfriend and my chiropractor and I said, 'I hope I can get two games in this set.' ""Once I got the two games I kind of settled down. I was like, 'Okay, that's all I want.' But then I got rolling and got more confidence and started serving better and being a little more aggressive."" While Djokovic is assured of his place in the eight-man London line-up, his compatriot Janko Tipsarevic is still fighting to earn one of the remaining two berths at the season finale. Tipsarevic defeated Dutchman Igor Sijsling 6-4 7-6 (7-0) to ensure his passage to the third round, where he will face Argentine ninth seed Juan Monaco -- who can potentially qualify if he reaches the final, depending on other players' results. However, Richard Gasquet's hopes of making it to London ended when the the French 12th seed lost to big-serving South African Kevin Anderson in three sets. Elsewhere, Juan Martin Del Potro eased past Colombia's Alejandro Falla 6-2 6-2 to set up a third round clash with France's Michael Llodra. Llodra ovecame 10th seed John Isner 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to end the American's hopes of making it through to London. Nicolas Almagro will take on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third round after he overcame fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos 7-6 (7-1) 6-7 (4-7) 6-3.

"(EW.com) -- This weekend, The Croods proved that cave people have more pop culture appeal than just Geico commercials. The $135 million film, which features vocal performances by Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, and Ryan Reynolds, bashed up a strong $44.7 million in its first three days — the second best debut of 2013 behind Oz's $79.1 million bow. The colorful family film was produced by DreamWorks Animation, whose last film, Rise of the Guardians, severely underperformed and forced the company to take an $87 million write-down. Thus, The Croods' success (for reference, Rise opened with just $23.7 million on its way to a $103.2 million domestic finish) is vindicating for the Jeffrey-Katzenberg-owned studio. For distributor Fox, who inked a five-year distribution deal with DreamWorks Animation last year, The Croods is poised to become a massive success. The film opened in the same range as 2012′s Ice Age: Continental Drift ($46.7 million) and higher than the studio's 2011 release, Rio, which began its flight with $39.2 million. With an ""A"" CinemaScore and Easter/Spring Break ahead for many young school-goers — plus the fact that there are literally no family or animated films hitting theaters until Epic on May 24 — The Croods could evolve into a box office mammoth. A $200 million domestic finish wouldn't surprise me one bit. Internationally, The Croods proved equally appealing, bowing with $63.3 million for a sizzling $108 million global total after its first three days. In second, FilmDistrict's White House thriller Olympus Has Fallen scored an impressive $30.5 million from 3,098 theaters, making its debut the best action start of 2013 — ahead of A Good Day to Die Hard, which took in only $24.8 million in its first weekend. Olympus, which stars Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman, cost Millennium Films $70 million to produce, but with an ""A-"" CinemaScore, the presidential thriller may enjoy better-than-expected legs. Interestingly, Olympus isn't the only White House action movie hitting theaters in 2013. Sony's Channing Tatum/Jamie Foxx vehicle White House Down is currently slated for a June 28 release. Olympus arrives on the heels of numerous older-male-targeting action flops like Bullet to the Head, Parker, and The Last Stand, which makes its success all the more impressive. FilmDistrict did manage to reach men, who made up 53 percent of the opening weekend audience, with television ads on Spike, History, ESPN, Comedy Central, Discovery, The Walking Dead, NCAA tournament coverage, and Fox's Sunday animation block, but it's also telling that women comprised 47 percent of the audience. According to exit polling, crowds were 73 percent above the age of 25. The film also marks a return-to-form for leading man Butler, whose last three wide releases, Chasing Mavericks ($6 million total), Playing for Keeps ($13.1 million), and Movie 43 ($8.8 million), have all badly flopped. Olympus Has Fallen's strong opening weekend is Butler's career second-best behind his breakout 300, which bowed with $70.9 million in 2007. Down two spots to third place, Disney's $215 million Sam Raimi-directed adventure Oz The Great and Powerful fell 47 percent to $22 million in its third weekend, lifting its total to $177.6 million overall. Worldwide, the film has earned $356.4 million, though international receipts ($178.8 million) haven't been as robust as most were expecting. Halle Berry's schlocky thriller The Call dropped 49 percent in its second weekend to $8.7 million, giving it a respectable $30.9 million ten-day total. The $13 million production, distributed by Sony's division TriStar, has now earned more than the last film starring Berry in a leading role, Cloud Atlas, which tanked with only $27.8 million against a $100 million budget. Rounding out the Top 5 was the Tina Fey/Paul Rudd comedy Admission, which only earned $6.4 million from 2,160 theaters in its first weekend. Audiences rejected the Focus Features film, which fortunately cost just $13 million to produce. Admission marks the first real bomb for Fey, who previously found success with Mean Girls ($86.1 million), Baby Mama ($60.5 million), and Date Night ($98.7 million) — all sharper, edgier comedies than this. For Rudd, on the other hand, Admission is the fourth bomb out of his five last releases. Though the actor's previous film, This is 40, quietly blossomed into a mid-level hit at the holiday box office with $67.5 million, his other recent efforts all began in the same sad range as Admission. 2010′s How Do You Know ($7.5 million debut, $30.2 million finish), 2011′s Our Idiot Brother ($7 million debut, $24.8 million finsh), and 2012′s Wanderlust ($6.5 million debut, $17.5 million finish) each hurt his box office credibility. Rudd tends to fare better in dude-movies like Role Models, I Love You Man, and Dinner For Shmucks, which each earned about $70 million domestically. 1. The Croods -- $44.6 million . 2. Olympus Has Fallen -- $30.5 million . 3. Oz The Great and Powerful -- $22 million . 4. The Call -- $8.7 million . 5. Admission -- $6.4 million . 6. Spring Breakers -- $5 million . In sixth place, the Disney-girls-gone-bad film Spring Breakers found $5 million from 1,102 theaters. The A24 release has garnered massive publicity thanks to the allure of seeing onetime Disney starlets like Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens (who, granted, didn't have a squeaky clean reputation) traipsing about in bikinis while wielding guns, but the deeply strange R-rated art piece, which also stars James Franco, confounded many young moviegoers this weekend, and word-of-mouth is destined to squash Spring Breakers' hopes of mainstream success. Still, the film cost only $2 million to produce, and it should ultimately become a profitable venture for the fledgling studio. Way, way further down the chart, Lindsay Lohan's latest, InAPPropriate Comedy, which was directed by ShamWow shiller Vince Offer, had one of the worst debuts of the year.

"(CNN) -- Four grand slam finals, four heartbreaking defeats. Andy Murray was in danger of becoming the ""nearly man"" of men's tennis -- and despite his public brave face, it was taking its toll. ""Physically we go through a lot,"" the 25-year-old told CNN ahead of next week's ATP World Tour Finals. ""So sometimes I questioned whether it was worth it because I had lost a lot of close matches and hadn't quite got to where I wanted to get to."" July's defeat at Wimbledon, his home grand slam, was hard to take. Tears flowed after the final as he addressed the crowd. But just four weeks later, his revenge victory over longtime nemesis Roger Federer on the famous grass courts earned him the gold medal at the Olympics -- and in September Murray became the first British male player to win a major since Fred Perry in 1936 when he lifted the U.S. Open. Murray crashes out in Paris as ATP finals line-up is completed . His older brother and occasional doubles partner Jamie says that New York final was the defining moment in Andy's career. ""I guess maybe it closed some of the doubts, I guess maybe in himself, but especially in the rest of the tennis world and in the media,"" he told CNN. ""He's finally got a grand slam now and hopefully that'll be the start of many to come."" Neil Harman, tennis correspondent for the Times of London, has followed Murray's career from the start and knew only too well the self-imposed pressure and self doubt that plagued the Scot, who has now won nearly $24 million in prize money on the ATP Tour. ""I can only pay tribute to his dedication to keep going, this is a tremendous affirmation of his qualities. It means everything to him,"" Harman told CNN. Murray's London 2012 success against a man who had beaten him in three grand slam finals, and his later silver medal alongside Laura Robson in the mixed doubles, was made sweeter by his overwhelming support from a patriotic, flag waving home crowd. ""I'd probably say the Olympics was a highlight -- not just the match but the whole two weeks of the Olympics were just unbelievable,"" he said. ""I love sport, so as a sports fan it was great to be part of that and I love watching all the other sports whilst the tennis was on and then to win a gold medal and then a silver in the mixed was great. I really, really enjoyed it."" The man credited with helping Murray take the final step from nearly man to big-time winner is coach Ivan Lendl, appointed at the turn of this year with just that in mind. Harman said it had been a ""brave move"" as former world No. 1 Lendl had little formal coaching, but ""the proof of the pudding is in the results."" In what may prove to be a good omen for Murray, Czech-born legend Lendl lost his first four grand slam finals before going on to win eight. ""I'm not saying I will go on to achieve anything like that but he always wanted to keep improving,"" Murray said. ""He worked incredibly hard. He would really do anything in terms of his training and his practice. ""That's what I will look to tap into over the next couple of years, how to, after reaching a certain goal, how to reset your goals and how to keep getting better. "" Murray will be seeking to emulate one of his best friends on the tour, Novak Djokovic -- who will be the year-end world No. 1 for the second season in a row no matter what happens in London at the eight-man season finale. The Serbian was effusive in his praise of Murray, who he first played at the age of 11, following his final defeat at Flushing Meadows. ""It is obviously nice to hear that from him, he made his big real breakthrough last year -- he had one of the best years ever on the tour so he has helped inspire me in a way to keep trying to get better and believing that you can get to the top,"" Murray said. Murray's heroics earned him a rapturous welcome in his hometown of Dunblane, scene of a 1996 mass shooting at the primary school which he attended. A lone gunman, Thomas Hamilton, killed 17 people before taking his own life. Murray, eight at the time, survived by hiding in a classroom. He has revealed since that his mother Judy once gave Hamilton a lift in their car while he was sat in the back. A stunned community united in their grief and shock but now revel in the achievements of Andy and his brother, who has won a mixed doubles title at Wimbledon. ""I think Dunblane's only maybe 9,000 people and it's very close-knit, especially after the bad experiences that have happened in the town in the past,"" Jamie said. ""I think for what Andy's done the last few years of his career has really put a more positive light on the town and everyone's so behind him."" The pair have enjoyed success as a doubles partnership, claiming two ATP Tour titles, but losing in the first round of this year's Olympic competition. Jamie has always relished the experience. ""To be able to play high-level sport with your brother is always a cool thing to do, it's pretty unique as well."" It's a standing joke between them that Jamie is the only one to claim a Wimbledon title -- he won with Jelena Jankovic in 2007 -- but with Andy desperate to add to his grand slam tally it's perhaps only a matter of time before that changes.","Andy Murray says he struggled with confidence after high-profile defeats .

"(CNN) -- Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillard said Tuesday she believes Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II dies. Gillard said the country has a ""deep affection"" for Queen Elizabeth, but that she favors moving Australia toward a republic. ""What I would like to see as prime minister is that we work our way through to an agreement on a model for the republic, but I think that the appropriate time for this nation to move to being a republic is when we see the monarch change,"" Gillard said at a news conference. ""Obviously I'm hoping for Queen Elizabeth that she lives a long and happy life, and having watched her mother I think there's every chance that she will live a long and happy life, but I think that's probably the appropriate point for a transition to a republic."" Australia is currently a constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as its head of state. Gillard made the comments on the campaign trail ahead of Saturday's general election, in which she faces a challenge from opposition leader Tony Abbott. Abbott said Tuesday he believes the current system of government is a good one. ""This republican cause has been with us for a long time, but the Australian people have demonstrated themselves to be remarkably attached to institutions that work,"" he said Tuesday. ""I think that our existing constitutional arrangements have worked well in the past. I see no reason whatsoever why they can't continue to work well in the future. So while there may very well be further episodes of republicanism in this country, I am far from certain that, at least in our lifetimes, there is likely to be any significant change."" Abbott, of the Liberal Party, headed Australians for Constitutional Monarchy for two years before entering Parliament. Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd as leader of Australia's Labor Party, and prime minister, in June. She had been Rudd's deputy prime minister, but Labor Party members of Parliament voted her into the top job as Rudd's public approval declined.","NEW: Opposition leader says the country's current system of government is good .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hal David's last songwriting project was a reunion with two people with whom he had some of his greatest success starting 50 years ago: Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwick, according to Warwick's representative. David, who wrote the lyrics to many of Warwick's biggest hits, died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles from complications of a stroke, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers said Saturday. He was 91. ""I feel as if I have lost another family member, but knowing I will always have him with me each time I sing the lyrics written for me by him will continue to bring me a sense of him being with me always,"" Warwick said Sunday in a statement to CNN. Warwick was a 21-year-old songstress backing up the Drifters in a New York recording session in 1962 when David and Bacharach -- who began collaborating on pop tunes five years earlier -- fell in love with her voice. She became the most prolific interpreter of David and Bacharach songs, starting with ""Don't Make Me Over,"" released in November 1962. Other 1960s classics from the team include ""Walk On By,"" ""Message to Michael,"" ""Alfie,"" ""I Say a Little Prayer"" and ""Do You Know the Way to San Jose?"" David and Bacharach, who parted ways as regular collaborators in the 1970s, came together recently to write several new songs for Warwick's 50th anniversary album, Warwick's rep said. ""Dionne, Now"" is set for release in October. David started working with Bacharach in the late 1950s on tunes recorded by artists including Perry Como, Gene Pitney, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, Frank Sinatra, the Carpenters, Barbra Streisand and Warwick. In May, President Barack Obama and the first lady hosted a concert honoring Bacharach and David as part of the ""In Performance at the White House"" series. Herb Alpert, who sang and played trumpet on David and Bacharach's chart-topping pop hit ""This Guy's in Love With You"" in 1968, called David ""a gentleman genius, whose lyrics touch the soul."" ""As a lyric writer, Hal was simple, concise and poetic -- conveying volumes of meaning in fewest possible words and always in service to the music,"" said ASCAP President and Chairman Paul Williams. ""It is no wonder that so many of his lyrics have become part of our everyday vocabulary and his songs ... the backdrop of our lives."" Singer Smokey Robinson on Saturday said David was one of his songwriting idols when he was growing up. ""I hope that the music world will join together in celebrating the life of one of our greatest composers ever,"" Robinson said in a statement Saturday. ""I will really miss my friend but I will celebrate his life and he will live on-and-on through his incredible musical contribution."" Lyricist Carole Bayer Sager, who also worked extensively with then-husband Burt Bacharach, said David made Bacharach's melodies seem ""effortless."" David was president of ASCAP from 1980 till 1986. The Recording Academy called David an ""exquisite lyricist"" whose work has left a ""lasting impact on our culture."" He was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents who had immigrated from Austria. He studied journalism at New York University before joining the military during World War II. Returning to New York after the war, he began working with songwriters he met at the famous Brill Building, which at the time was the center of the city's song industry, ASCAP said. It was his collaboration with Bacharach that proved the most fruitful. They were some of the first to work with Warwick when she was a young vocalist. They also helped Herb Alpert reach No. 1 with ""This Guy's in Love With You"" and wrote The Carpenters' No. 1 hit ""(They Long to Be) Close to You."" British invasion stars like Springfield and Sandie Shaw sought the pair's talents in the 1960s, and they got Tom Jones into the Top 10 with ""What's New Pussycat."" The pair's accomplishments extended to stage and screen as well. They wrote scores and themes for 1960s films including ""Alfie"" and ""Casino Royale."" Their ""Raindrops"" tune was written for ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and reached No. 1. They wrote the score for the musical ""Promises, Promises,"" which was nominated for a Tony Award and won a Grammy for Best Cast Album of the Year in 1970. David parted ways with Bacharach in the early 1970s, but he went on to work with other composers, including Albert Hammond -- with whom he wrote ""To All the Girls I've Loved Before."" His first wife, Anne, died in 1987. He is survived by his wife, Eunice; two sons, three grandchildren, and two stepsons. David's older brother Mack, who died in 1991, was also a famous songwriter who wrote such hits as ""La Vie en Rose,"" ""Candy,"" and ""Bibiddi-Bobbidi-Boo."" CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Dionne Warwick was the most prolific interpreter of David and Bacharach songs .

"Washington (CNN) -- Both the Federal Aviation Administration and the independent National Transportation Safety Board are investigating an aborted landing by a plane carrying first lady Michelle Obama because it was too close to a military plane ahead, officials announced Wednesday. Neither plane was in danger in the incident Monday at Andrews Air Force Base, according to both agencies. ""We consider any incident like this a serious incident,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in confirming the FAA review. ""It's under investigation, we will get to the bottom of what happened and how it happened, and obviously make sure it doesn't happen again."" Later Wednesday, the FAA said in a statement it will now require supervisory oversight in monitoring flights transporting the vice president or first lady. Such supervision is currently required in monitoring flights carrying the president, the FAA said. LaHood emphasized that the first lady was never in any danger and said he had yet to hear from either Michelle Obama or the president about it. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed Wednesday that Jill Biden, the vice president's wife, also was on the plane as she and the first lady returned from a series of media events supporting military families. The NTSB also is launching a probe into Monday's incident, which occurred ""after an air traffic controller had sequenced it too close to another military plane,"" the agency said in a statement. According to the NTSB statement, the plane transporting the first lady -- the military version of a Boeing 737 -- ""was directed to abort its landing attempt after the required minimum separation between it and a C-17 military aircraft that was landing ahead of it was compromised."" It said the incident involved FAA air traffic controllers at the Potomac TRACON regional radar facility in Virginia and the Andrews tower in Maryland. The planes -- which were both trying to land -- were three miles apart, when they are supposed to be five miles apart, a senior administration official told CNN. The official added it was believed to be an air traffic controller mistake. Asked why the separation rules governing plane landings were not followed, LaHood said: ""That's what we'll figure out in the investigation."" The FAA said in a statement controllers at the Air Force base instructed an incoming Boeing 737 to perform a ""go around"" ""because the plane did not have the required amount of separation"" behind the military plane. ""The aircraft were never in any danger,"" the agency said. The landing was briefly aborted and the plane carrying the first lady had to circle, according to the senior administration official. Obama's plane, known as a C-40, was part of the Air National Guard, not the regular Air Force fleet used by VIPs at Andrews, said Maj. Michelle Lai of the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base. The FAA did not want Obama's plane to be caught in the ""jet wash"" of the C-17 as it landed, Lai said, referring to air turbulence trailing in the wake of the plane's jet engines. ""It's important to know the FAA made the right call and at no time was the first lady's life in danger,"" Lai said. When the Potomac TRACON radar facility handed off the plane to the Andrews Air Force Base tower, the planes were three miles apart, a government official told CNN. ""Both facilities knew how far apart they were"" at the time of the hand-off, the official said. But the official declined to say why the hand-off occurred. The TRACON could have slowed Obama's plane down or order it to turn earlier, the official said. Why that wasn't done is under investigation, but ""it was a controlled situation,"" the government official said. CNN's Ed Henry, Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","FAA increases supervision of flights carrying the vice president, first lady .

"(CNN) -- The business of saving lives can happen in the most unassuming of places: In the corner of a nondescript, dingy building in an unnamed West Coast city, in a small office that can barely fit four desks. Here, trained counselors take the calls of young people in crisis and those who worry about them. It's the kind of place where the mere act of talking can eclipse the tragic, where people work to keep headlines -- like the story of Rutgers student Tyler Clementi -- from ever happening. Welcome to one of the two national call centers for The Trevor Lifeline, America's only 24/7 crisis and suicide prevention hot line for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youths. The lifeline is a cornerstone of The Trevor Project, a broader nonprofit dedicated to promoting acceptance of LGBTQ youths and to preventing suicides. Between this center and another on the East Coast -- at least one is open at all times -- about 30,000 calls are fielded each year. They come from young people struggling with who they are and those who feel desperately alone. They are from kids who've been kicked out of their homes and those whose friends have rejected them. They are from students being tormented by text messages and, at times, those who are poised with a bottle of pills or a gun. Anti-bullying resources for parents and teachers . And they are from mothers like Angela Wedel, who dialed the lifeline when her love for her son just wasn't enough. Garrett Wedel, 16, was only 12 when he came out. He says he was too young to even imagine that parents might turn their backs on a child. Fortunately, his didn't. Even with his family's acceptance, he kept to himself the stories about bullying. A couple of times, though, he couldn't hide the depths of his pain. He'd broken down and talked about ending his life, but in those cases, he could be soothed, and that seemed enough. Opinion: Being bullied is hell, but life gets better . One time, though, was different. The family was on a ski trip during Garrett's freshman year in high school. He'd confessed by text his feelings for a close friend and had told the boy he liked him. The return call that he got, the one in which that boy told Garrett he could not be trusted and they could not be friends anymore, made him crumble. Angela didn't know what had happened, but she saw him race to his bedroom, and she followed. ""He was basically on the bed in the fetal position just crying and saying how much he hated life, didn't want to live, didn't want to go back to school,"" she says, remembering that evening two and a half years ago and peering at her son beside her. ""He was just crying so hard ... and I could only comfort him so much. I held him. And that's when I remembered that a friend had given me the number for The Trevor Project."" She'd stored that number in her phone, just in case she ever needed it. Now she dialed. ""At that point I was out of resources,"" she says. ""I was in a panic. I was frantic ... I couldn't just keep saying 'I love you, I support you' and move on."" The Trevor Project doesn't publicize where the two call centers are to protect their 160 volunteer counselors, all of whom receive at least 40 to 50 hours of training before they take on shifts. Nor does it allow for outsiders to listen in on calls. But even a short glimpse into the West Coast call center helps one imagine what happened next. Wearing a headset, prepared with questions to assess risk, a counselor answered. ""A calming voice was on the other end,"" Angela remembers. ""I talked to the gentleman on the phone, and he asked to speak to Garrett."" Her son spoke to the counselor for close to an hour. All the while, she was by his side, her arms wrapped around him, doing all she could. ""When I first heard the voice, I was just very relieved,"" Garrett says, before adding what he remembers being told. "" 'Calm down, Garrett. Everything's going to be OK. Please don't do anything. Can't we just talk for a little more?' And I think that really helped me ... it really calmed me down."" In a corner of the small call center office sits a short bookshelf crammed with titles including ""Out in All Directions: Almanac of Gay and Lesbian America,"" ""The Meaning of Matthew: My Son's Murder in Laramie, and a World Transformed"" and ""Free to Be ... You and Me."" Posted on bulletin boards are talking points, lists of resources, contact numbers to use in case of emergency. The lifeline has a psychiatrist on call at all times. After Garrett finished speaking to the counselor, who encouraged him to call anytime, he handed the phone back to Angela. The counselor then gave her resources, names and numbers, she says, and ""he kind of gave me the strength and path to go down to get the help we needed."" He also gave her the reassurance that her son was not in the imminent danger she feared. ""We were still able to reach him and get through to him and talk to him,"" she says. ""I knew he needed help, but I didn't know how to give it to him. And that's where The Trevor Project was able to help me."" Teen's coming out triggers bullying . In the time since that call, Garrett says he's become more able to reach out to others. He won't hesitate to speak with the counselors at school, and he's found friends he trusts. This doesn't mean, though, that the comments he hears in school or the looks he catches don't affect him anymore. ""They still sting the same way,"" he says. ""But I developed a support system."" And in those tough moments when those around him aren't available, or if he needs a different ear, he knows where to turn. Programmed in his phone is a number he can always call. To reach the Trevor Lifeline, call 866-4-U-TREVOR.","A friend's rejection made Garrett Wedel crumble and left him saying he didn't want to live .

"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (CNN) -- Sewage-lined streets, crumbling concrete homes and jagged sheets of metal are in stark contrast to the formally dressed man standing proudly in the middle of it all. His name is Daniel Etienne. He grimaces into a Cuban cigar and happily sports two pairs of designer sunglasses; one straddling his eyes, the other tucked into his suit. He is a loyal and unapologetic member of ""Les Sapeurs."" In this Kinshasa neighborhood, eight of them strut the congested streets, decked out in a wide-array of name brands; from Gucci and Christian Dior to G-Star and Yohji Yamamoto. Three-piece suits, shiny black leather shoes and flashy accessories are all part of an eccentric dress code -- and demeanor to match. ""I could use that money to help with the war that is happening in the East but [they're] so expensive it might hurt people's feelings,"" says Papa Griffes, of his pricey threads. See also: Arise magazine: Africa's fashion bible . He describes himself as the ""supreme commander of Les Sapeurs"" or ""Sap"" for short. While he wouldn't admit to the actual cost, some Saps boast of spending $5,000 on a single suit. But in a country with one of the highest poverty levels in the world, how is a trend like this even possible or accepted? Part of the performance put on by Sapeurs is showmanship, smoke and mirrors. Papa Griffes is actually a shoemaker and designer by trade so he stitches up and repairs each member's look. His crew dresses up together just once a week, meeting first at Griffes's shoe-repair shack in the parking lot of a local bar before stepping out. It's also typical for Sapeurs to trade their expensive clothes with each other to keep up an appearance of affluence. Still, the Sapeur following has cultural significance beyond the facade of fabric. Born out of gradual economic improvements leading up to independence, both the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its confusingly named neighbor, the Republic of the Congo, broke free of Belgium and France's colonial grip respectively in 1960. The capitals of Kinshasa and Brazzaville on opposing sides of the Congo River became centers for a new African francophone elite, flying to Paris and returning to show off sophisticated garments. For the first time in the modern era, the Congolese were empowered after decades of brutality and economic subjugation enforced by foreigners. Papa Wemba, the famous singer credited with popularizing the Sapeur look with his group Viva La Musica, says inspiration partly came from his parents who took great pride in dressing up on Sundays back in the '60s, ""always well put together, always looking very smart."" See also: African designers in the spotlight . Things changed in the DRC shortly after independence, when Joseph Mabutu assumed power, renamed the country Zaire and implemented a strict non-Western dress code. Papa Wemba wanted to challenging the status quo -- not vocally, but visually. So he devised the acronym SAPE, roughly translated from French to mean ""the Society of Atmosphere-setters and Elegant People."" By dressing up his band in the SAPE style, the adoring Congolese crowds soon followed suit -- literally. Since then, Sapeur swagger and the freedom of expression it represents have attracted legions of followers in central Africa and beyond. By now they've earned an increasingly visible status in popular culture; Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni profiled them in his book ""Gentlemen of Bacongo,"" The Wall Street Journal anointed them ""the most unlikely fashionistas."" They pop up in music videos and in the book ""History of the Congo,"" the Saps are included in great detail. They are an important part of the Congolese story. Papa Wemba invited CNN to one of his musical performances in Kinshasa being attended by Papa Griffes and company and it became obvious how serious this movement is today. A dapperly dressed Sapeur from a competing clique danced with a woman in front of Papa Griffes and afterward flung open his cape -- yes, cape -- kicking-off a fashion face-off. What followed were multiple poses on the dance floor as each Sapeur defended his reputation. Labels were revealed, heads flung high and jackets swung around. In a country torn apart by colonialism, corruption, civil war and poverty, these men have found something refreshing in which they can take great pride. They've also devised a sort-of entertaining conflict resolution that requires buttons instead of bullets, belts instead of bombs. In a very real way, we could all learn something from these special Congolese standouts: honor history, keep conflict resolution peaceful and never tell anyone how much you really paid for your fancy clothes.","""Les Sapeurs"" are a unique group of fashionistas who strut the streets of Kinshasa .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is ""delighted"" that she will become a great-grandmother for the first time, Buckingham Palace said Friday. Peter Phillips, the 11th in line to the throne, is expecting a baby with his Canadian-born wife, Autumn, later this year, the palace said. ""Peter and Autumn Phillips are delighted to confirm they are expecting a baby in December,"" the palace said in a statement. ""The queen and the duke of Edinburgh, as well as Autumn's family, have been informed and are delighted with the news.""

"(EW.com) -- David Bowie is full of surprises. A few weeks ago, he announced that his first new album in 10 years was imminent. Though ""The Next Day"" wasn't due to hit stores until Tuesday, March 12, the album is currently streaming on iTunes in its entirety. The official EW review of David Bowie's The Next Day is below, and a version of it will be appearing in the magazine on newsstands next Friday, March 8. Early in his career, David Bowie realized that reinvention came naturally to him, and soon the spirit of change became his prime persona. Through all of his alternate guises — space alien, drugged-out cartoon, machine-obsessed private detective, guy who just discovered the Pixies — he's maintained a spectacularly consistent inconsistency, and while not all of it has worked, at least we always knew that another character was following right behind. For the last decade, however, his chief guise has been Invisible Man. Following turn-of-the-last-century releases Heathen and Reality (which found him reuniting with classic-era producer Tony Visconti), he suddenly disappeared, cutting short a tour, ignoring music, and making only occasional appearances amidst rumors of failing health so persistent that the Flaming Lips recorded a song called ""Is David Bowie Dying?"" In the meantime, pop stars like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé got rich crafting their own evil twins and countless bands co-opted Bowie's fashionable bohemian androgyny. 25 Albums We Can't Wait To Hear . Now he's returned to look back at a lifetime of looking forward. ""The Next Day,"" his 26th album, finds Bowie very much alive and vacillating between forward-looking restlessness and outright nostalgia. Day takes the idea of returning to past experiments and exposes them to gamma radiation, speeding up the evolution process across 14 tracks. And like a judicious parent, he treats his most high-profile projects equally, paying homage to all their quirks and foibles: The album-opening title track sounds like a return to Station to Station, single ""Where Are We Now?"" wallows in Low-era melancholy, and ""Boss of Me"" is a gospel-glam strut in the spirit of Aladdin Sane's ""Watch That Man."" Visconti drops in a bevy of sonic retrospective winks, making it easy to spot references and also to re-edit: If you dig the end-of-the-world dirges from Lodger, you'll adore ""You Feel So Lonely You Could Die,"" but if you never got over Space Oddity's psychedelic folk, you can jettison all but ""I'd Rather Be High"" from iTunes. David Bowie drops new single, announces first album in ten years . A few tracks lack clear antecedents (see: the Jack White-aping ""You Will Set the World on Fire""), and some simply lack cohesion, or at least enough melody to anchor them. But Day is also an excellent reminder that Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke, and the lunatic who sang Christmas songs with Bing Crosby have all been coexisting in the same brain for decades. Now that all of his alter-egos have settled down, he can finally get on with the business of being David Bowie — auteur, bon vivant, and eternally, rock's most gorgeous space alien. B . Best Tracks .

"(CNN) -- ""Nice guys finish last"" is a mantra often preached in sport and business. Where golf is concerned, it would seem ""nice guys"" finish second. And they even manage to smile. Adam Scott and In-Kyung Kim both won plenty of admirers for their sportsmanship and grace during two of the sport's blue riband major tournaments this year. The only drawback was, all that praise came after agonizing defeats. For Scott, an Australian ranked sixth in the men's game who has long been tipped for major success, July's British Open tested his ability to swallow the bitter pills so often served up on golf's greens and fairways. He held a four-shot lead going into the final round, but bogeyed the last four holes and handed the title to veteran South African Ernie Els. His capitulation followed in the tradition of his compatriot Greg Norman, one of the greatest golfers of the 1980s and early '90s -- but a player who famously ""choked"" on several big occasions. ""I think the emotions shown in golf are different to other sports,"" the 32-year-old Scott told CNN when asked about how he was able to remain dignified in the face of abject disappointment at Royal Lytham and St. Annes. He congratulated Els with a brave if rueful smile and carried out his duties to face the seemingly endless stream of media requests. ""It has always been referred to as a gentleman's game, but I think it has got more to do with how you're brought up and your influences,"" Scott said. ""I certainly feel like my parents have brought me up well, but also I had good role models that I looked up to as a kid. ""Certainly Greg Norman, I saw him win hundreds of tournaments and lose some big ones, but I think he handled himself well in those situations too, so like you do when you're a kid you always try to mimic those you look up to."" Norman won his first major in 1986, a decade after turning professional. However, that year he led all four majors going into the final round, but came away with just a British Open victory -- his first of two Claret Jugs. The ""Great White Shark"" was runner-up at no less than seven major tournaments. Scott, who tied for second at last year's Masters, collapsed over his putter at Royal Lytham after blowing his biggest chance yet of a breakthrough win. ""I think I was a little numb from shock that I might have lost,"" he explained. ""I felt like I played like a winner the whole week and even with a couple of mistakes coming in it didn't feel horrendous out on the course. ""There is only one shot I was really, really disappointed with and that was the shot into the 17th green. I wasn't really in that much trouble on the last few holes other than the 17th where I was in the long grass. ""That ends up putting me in quite an awkward position to close the tournament. That is probably the one shot I would like to take over again. But other than that I don't think I would do anything different."" Kim, known as ""I.K.,"" is one of a troop of promising female golfing talents emerging from Asia. The South Korean looked set to announce her arrival on the world stage when she was stood over a one-foot putt at the 18th to win her first major at the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April. The ball rolled around the lip of the cup but refused to sink, coming to a stop outside of the hole. Somehow Kim had missed and, in a cruel coincidence, she was forced into a playoff with compatriot Yoo Sun-Young which she duly lost. ""I was disappointed right after it happened,"" the 24-year-old told CNN. ""I get this question a lot ... I am competitive, but from my point of view you can't really attach your emotion to a result. It is something you can't control."" Separating her emotions from her golf is something Kim has worked on throughout her career, using a mental coach to help her hone her craft. ""All we can control is the process and how hard we work, which we do every day,"" the world No. 18 explained. ""I feel like I worked really hard through that tournament and I stayed with my process and everything was good. I moved on."" These techniques involve learning to appreciate the good and the bad. ""To smile more often, to enjoy,"" Kim said. ""I sometimes forget what I can control and what I can't -- they remind me."" Kim's ability to perform in golf's most pressurized situations has been called into question. The playoff at the Kraft Nabisco Championship was the third of her career, and her third defeat. ""I've always been really bummed out after the 18th hole and gone into the playoff without preparing,"" Kim said. ""That is something I have been working on, to control emotion after whatever happened. ""After you have finished it is tough to go and do a playoff, there is nothing you can think about before. That is something I have to work on."" It has been two and a half years since Kim last won an event, the Lorena Ochoa Invitational in November 2010. Kim picked up a cool $220,000 for winning the tournament in Guadalajara, and she chose to donate all of it to charity. ""I like competition, but it is just a different feeling helping someone,"" said Kim, who has earned more than $5 million since turning pro in 2007. ""I feel like I can help by playing golf. ""Without a lot of good people around me I wouldn't be able to do it, so I'm fortunate and I wanted to share the win. I always dreamed about helping other people and I had an opportunity."" Like Kim, Scott is also without a win in 2012. The Adelaide native still has the chance to address that -- this week he lines up at the $7 million WGC-HSBC Champions event in China, then goes to Singapore before returning home for two of Australia's biggest tournaments. ""Playing at home is a big deal for me, I certainly want to perform,"" said Scott, who has earned more than $28 million on the U.S. PGA Tour. ""I'm also quite motivated because I feel like I've played a lot of good golf this year to not have a win and I'd really like to finish the year off by winning one, or two or more of these tournaments. ""I still view (the British Open) as the highlight of my year. To play so well, that's what I've been trying so long to do in majors, and finally it has happened. ""I didn't come out as a champion, but if I can repeat that kind of preparation and play then I'm sure if give myself another chance I'm going to win a major or two."" Kim has won three times on the LPGA Tour, and once on the European Ladies' circuit, but is cautious about her chances of ending her title drought. ""Golf is a mystery,"" she said ahead of this week's Mizuno Classic in Japan. ""Nobody knows how to play this game perfectly and I don't think anyone has ever done it. You play four rounds every week and it is very hard to keep that momentum going. ""You have to do a lot of work, it might come out this weekend, you never know. I'll do my best, there are things I need to improve but there are things I'm doing well. ""You want to win, but it's difficult, being reminded it has been two years since you won! It's not easy, but for me I work really hard. I'm very happy with everything, so hopefully I can win more tournaments by the end of this year.""","Adam Scott and I.K.

"(CNN) -- Just 38 days separated the lowest moment in Serena Williams' 2012 season, and the undisputed highlight. After a crushing first round defeat at the French Open to world No. 111 Virginie Razzano in May the 31-year-old was so distraught she didn't leave the house for two days. But just over a month later Williams was hoisting her fifth Wimbledon title -- her 14th grand slam singles win -- a triumph she hadn't thought possible after a blood clot on her lung nearly ended her career prematurely. It proved the catalyst for an all conquering end to the season, as Serena won every major title on offer, including two Olympic gold medals, in the singles and in the doubles with sister Venus, the U.S. Open and the season-ending WTA championships. It prompted many to isolate that decimating defeat in Paris as the kick start her season needed but speaking to CNN's Open Court show, Serena offered a different explanation. ""I think that for me the turning point was in April,"" she said. ""I had decided that I wanted to play better, and I told my dad, 'I want to play, for the rest of my career, I want to play better, I want to be focused and what are we going to do about it?' ""Then for me to lose in Paris was completely disappointing. I was completely shattered, I was really sad, and I didn't leave my house for two days."" That self doubt resurfaced during the final at Wimbledon, in front of a packed Centre Court. Having breezed through the opening set against Agnieszka Radwanska, competing in her maiden grand slam final, the Pole fought back to take the second set 7-5, sparking a mini meltdown in Williams. ""I lost the second set, I panicked and then after that I thought, 'I'm never going to win another grand slam, I'm going to be stuck at 13 for the rest of my life',"" she said. ""I should have been happy the last time I won Wimbledon, and then when I was in the hospital I thought I wouldn't even play tennis again, so to have that opportunity from going from that low, from the bottom to the top, it was probably the highlight of my year."" Li Na recently compared taking on Serena to playing a wall -- everything comes back. But Serena concedes her outward demeanor -- stalking the court in such intimidating, predatory fashion -- is sometimes a shield to what is really going on inside. ""I don't look at me being great or me being good,"" she explained. ""I just am a player and I know I'm good at tennis. And I get nervous, I get apprehensive, I have all those feelings. ""I do (hide them). I'm a good actress. But I have all those emotions and feelings, which I think is completely normal. And then sometimes, I think really what helps me is I'm really strong mentally, so it helps me get through it."" If that was Serena's individual highlight of the year there is no doubt as to the collective one. After a long absence from the women's Tour due to a foot injury and the subsequent blood clot on her lung, Serena returned to action for the first time in nearly a year at Eastbourne in June 2011. But within three months of her comeback there was more bad news for the Williams sisters as Venus was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome -- an autoimmune disorder that causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels. It would be February before she returned to the Tour full time but, just like Serena, her form was patchy -- until Wimbledon arrived. Undeniably, the famous environs of SW19 propel both Venus and Serena to a higher plane. On the same day Serena secured the singles title, the Williams sisters took their fifth doubles crown at the All England Club -- a sign their stranglehold on the women's game is far from over. But it was the success they shared just a few weeks later at the Olympics on the same showpiece court that meant most to Serena. ""Venus and I went through so much, her finding out about her Sjogren's disease and myself with my near-death experience in the hospital, and to share that moment on the podium and holding that gold medal was, was amazing."" The pair enjoyed their most recent Games experience so much they confirmed to CNN they'd be sticking around to defend their title at Rio in 2016. And when they both say they enjoy each other's success as much as their own it isn't hard to believe, especially when Serena talks of her sister's first Tour victory in two years at the Luxembourg Open in October. ""Venus winning after two years is great,"" Serena said. ""She's been through even more than I've been through. ""And so she's been working really hard, and I see it, I see her work really hard, and go through things that no athlete should go through and continue to play professional sport. I'm in awe of her, really."" Just as both sisters revel in the delight when the other wins, so they share the despair when the other loses. Serena added: ""I can watch her in person, but I can't watch (on television). When she played her semifinal (in Luxembourg) I was so nervous, she lost the first set and she was up, and I felt like she should have won. ""I was angry, I was angry at everybody around me, I couldn't be normal. So yeah, like when she wins, I win, I feel the same way, and when she loses, oh, I lose. I feel that loss."" Though there are 15 months between the sisters there is no doubt their watertight relationship has helped them as players throughout their career. Serena likens their bond to that of twins. ""She's done so much for me. I think one of the hardest jobs in the world is to be an older sister. And I think Venus is an amazing older sister, she was a great role model for me, and we feel each other -- I can talk to her. ""She knows exactly how I feel about so many different issues, and I love it. I love having that relationship.""","Serena Williams tells CNN how her 2012 season went from disaster to triumph .

"(CNN) -- Bird populations native to several areas of the globe are in decline, with some teetering on the brink of extinction, according to a multi-agency report, the first of its kind, released Thursday. The Western meadowlark is an endangered bird species, according to a new report. But some other species are thriving, according to the ""State of the Birds"" report, which credited conservation programs and waterfowl management initiatives that it said can serve as a model in other areas. ""Every U.S. habitat harbors birds in need of conservation,"" said the report, issued by the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology in conjunction with federal agencies and other organizations. ""Hawaiian birds and ocean birds appear most at risk, with populations in danger of collapse if immediate conservation measures are not implemented."" Of the more than 800 species of birds in the United States, 67 are federally listed as endangered or threatened, the report said. Another 184 are ""species of conservation concern"" because they have small distribution, are facing high threats or have a declining population. Hawaiian birds, particularly, are in crisis, the report said. More than one-third of all U.S. bird species are in Hawaii. However, 71 species have gone extinct since the islands were colonized about 300 A.D., and 10 more species have not been seen in the past 40 years, contributing to fears they, too, have died out. Grassland and arid-land birds are showing the most rapid declines over the last four decades, while forest birds are also declining, the report said. ""Just as they were when Rachel Carson published 'Silent Spring' nearly 50 years ago, birds today are a bellwether of the health of land, water and ecosystems,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Thursday in a statement on the report. ""From shorebirds in New England to warblers in Michigan to songbirds in Hawaii, we are seeing disturbing downward population trends that should set off environmental alarm bells. We must work together now to ensure we never hear the deafening silence in our forests, fields and backyards that Rachel Carson warned us about."" The declines can be traced to a variety of factors, depending on a bird's particular habitat. But the causes most frequently cited in the report are agriculture, climate change, development and energy, and invasive species. For instance, some of the nation's fastest-growing cities -- Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; and San Diego, California -- are located in arid lands, the report said. ""Unplanned and sprawling urban development is by far the greatest threat to arid lands."" In addition, invasive non-native plants have been introduced into the area, which can fuel wildfires and destroy native plants. Bird species of concern in arid lands include the elf owl, Bendire's and LeConte's thrashers and the gilded flicker, the report said. Some, such as the California condor, are already listed as endangered or threatened. In the grasslands, intensified agricultural practices have hurt bird populations, according to the report. ""Pastures cannot support many birds if overgrazed, burned too frequently or burned at the beginning of the nesting season or the end of the grass-growing season."" Also, public lands and parks are mowed too frequently and the grass kept too short to provide a habitat for birds, the reports said. Grassland birds showing marked population declines include the mountain plover, Eastern and Western meadowlarks, short-eared owls and Northern bobwhites. In the forest, some species are doing well, but roughly one-third of forest-breeding bird species are showing decline. The same is true for arctic and alpine birds, where 38 percent of the 85 species are of conservation concern, the report said. Game birds are also struggling. Of 19 resident game bird species, 47 percent are species of conservation concern, and two species are federally endangered, according to the report. The greatest hope for long-term management of game birds, however, lies in Farm Bill programs that retire millions of acres of land used for heavy agriculture, the report said. Along the coast and in the ocean, bird populations have been hurt by overfishing, pollution and climate change, among other factors, the report said. Each section of the report contains at least one ""reason for hope."" The California condor, for instance, has been reintroduced to some areas, and the bird's numbers are growing. Urban birds, such as the American robin, hummingbirds, sparrows and woodpeckers, show a ""steady, strong increase"" in the last 40 years. ""A surprising number of native birds have adapted to life around humans,"" the report said. ""... The wide variety of native birds that thrive in urban areas underscores the importance of these artificial habitats to the survival of many bird populations."" Wetland bird populations remain below historic levels, but ""management and conservation measures have contributed to increases of many wetland birds, including hunted waterfowl."" Research shows that wetland bird species began to increase in the late 1970s, ""coinciding with major policy shifts from draining to protecting wetlands,"" the report said. ""Dramatic increases in many wetland generalist species, as well as arctic-nesting geese and cavity-nesting ducks, contribute to this overall trend."" ""These results emphasize that investment in wetlands contribution has paid huge dividends,"" said Kenneth Rosenberg, director of Conservation Science at the Cornell Lab or Ornithology. ""Now we need to invest similarly in other neglected habitats where birds are undergoing the steepest declines."" Taking action now -- particularly in the area of habitat loss -- can help reverse the declining trend seen in some species, according to the report. ""The number and scope of severe threats to birds is daunting, but implementing solutions immediately and widely will pay off in benefits to society, the economy and the health of our environment."" It calls for measures such as increased monitoring of bird populations, stricter protection laws, more incentives, sustainable fishing practices and widespread education. ""Citizen science plays a critical role in monitoring and understanding the threats to these birds and their habitats, and only citizen involvement can help address them,"" said Greg Butcher, conservation director for the National Audubon Society. ""Conservation action can only make a real difference when concerned people support the kind of vital habitat restoration and protection measures this report explores.""","Report: Bird populations native to several areas of the globe are in decline .

"LAWRENCE, Kansas (CNN) -- It started with a sore throat. Then her chest was burning. Arielle Spiridigliozzi is one of 350 students who have contracted H1N1 at the University of Kansas. University of Kansas freshman Arielle Spiridigliozzi said she thought her symptoms were signs of allergies, or maybe even a sinus infection. It couldn't be H1N1, she thought. But it was. ""I mean, I'd never, ever guessed that coming into freshman year I would get the friggin' swine flu,"" Spiridigliozzi said. Now she accessorizes her royal blue T-shirt with a mask. A stuffy nose, body aches, fever and coughing make up the litany of symptoms, Spiridigliozzi, 18, and her roommate, Kaitlyn Perry, 18, said they have suffered. For more than a day, the girls have been stuck in their suite, on what they call ""lockdown.""  Watch more about life on ""lockdown"" » . University officials have asked the girls to stay in their dorm suite to limit exposure to other students. The school provides door-to-door delivery from the campus dining hall, giving the girls one less reason to have to leave their immediate four walls. Spiridigliozzi has abided by the the university's request, worried that she could infect another. But she doesn't understand how she ended up in this situation in the first place. ""We took all the necessary precautions. Like, we really did. It wasn't like I was licking the handlebars of the bus or anything,"" she said. ""I was hand sanitizing. I was being very careful. I don't know how this happened."" But she only has to look to her roommates for an answer, as illness has rapidly made its way through her suite. When Perry became ill it struck her suddenly. While shopping, she came down with a fever and started feeling like she didn't have the strength to stand, she said. Perry's flu hasn't been confirmed as an H1N1 strain, but a third roommate, the first to get sick, they said, was diagnosed with H1N1. Then a fourth roommate got sick, illustrative of a spreading flu pattern the girls said is obvious from the empty seats in classes. The university estimates about 340 students, or 1 percent of the student body, have flu they suspect is H1N1, said Patricia Denning, medical chief of staff at Watkins Health Center. The number of cases could be higher if students were not seeking care from campus doctors and nurses, she added. She said she has not heard of any students being hospitalized because of the flu. Vaccines are unlikely to help much this year, because supplies are not expected until late October and require about five weeks from the first inoculation -- two are required -- before they become effective. So, to make life easier for the sick, the school's medical center has distributed what it calls a ""flu kit,"" which includes a mask and a home-care instruction sheet, Denning said. The tip sheet borrows from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's information on H1N1. It says to drink lots of fluids, eat three small meals a day and get plenty of rest, Denning said. ""And so it just goes through simple common-sense things that we all know we need to do that sometimes, when mothers and dads aren't around to remind them, this will help remind them,"" she said. Spiridigliozzi and Perry will get to wander outdoors again once their fevers have dissipated for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications, they said. They are eager to get back to their normal lives. Spiridigliozzi is tired of the soup and Jell-O, and Perry looks forward to playing Frisbee again. ""So boring"" is how Spiridigliozzi described their isolation. With all this free time, at least the freshmen -- on campus for only two weeks -- aren't falling too far behind in their school work. ""I got all my homework done,"" Perry said. ""Yeah, I've gotten all my homework done for the next two weeks, probably,"" added Spiridigliozzi. CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.","Spread of H1N1 among roommates illustrates how quickly virus jumps around .

"(CNN) -- Johan Bruyneel has become the first victim of a United States government investigation into Lance Armstrong and doping. Armstrong was part of ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,"" the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Wednesday in releasing more than 1,000 pages of evidence in the case. Evidence of Armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says . Bruyneel, who was a close confidante of Armstrong during his seven Tour de France wins, has left his post as general manager of RadioShack by mutual agreement. Bruyneel was named in the USADA report which alleged that he was involved in helping Armstrong organize doping within the US Postal Team. ""From this day on, Johan Bruyneel will no longer act in the position of general manager of cycling team RadioShack Nissan Trek,"" a statement said on the team's website. But Bruyneel says he is disappointed with the way he has been treated and says the USADA may have harmed his chances of a fair trial. ""I am surprised and extremely disappointed that USADA released information in the public domain relating to their pending case against me before I had been given any opportunity to review the evidence and provide my defence against it,"" he told AFP. ""I still hope to be able to defend myself in a forum free from bias, although I now fear that USADA's calculated action may have irreversibly prejudiced my case. ""It is a troubling facet of USADA's approach to this case that it appears not to respect basic principles such as the right to be heard and the presumption of innocence."" The Belgian was Armstrong's team manager when the Texan won his seven tour victories between 1999-2005. Lance Armstrong's legacy may withstand accusations . He also worked alongside Armstrong in 2009 and 20010 following his three-and-a-half year spell away from cycling. Bruyneel along with team doctor Pedro Celaya and team trainer Jose ""Pepe"" Marti will all receive a hearing before an independent judge to fight the charges following the report. Bruyneel's departure comes after RadioShack rider Fabian Cancellara claimed he was close to leaving the team following the report. ""Johan's name is cited 129 times in the report,"" Cancellara was quoted as saying by the Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. ""I don't know if I can still work with Johan. We'll see what happens next. I want to know what happened.""","Bruyneel leaves role as general manager of RadioShack following USADA report .

"London (CNN) -- London's Sunday Times is considering suing Lance Armstrong over a libel case he brought against the newspaper over doping allegations which resulted in a costly payout. The potential legal action follows a report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency which said it had uncovered ""overwhelming evidence"" that Armstrong had participated in and helped run the U.S. Postal Service cycling team's doping program. A spokeswoman for the Sunday Times confirmed that it is ""considering taking action to recover money spent on a libel case Armstrong brought and to pursue him for fraud."" The libel case involved a 2004 Sunday Times article which referenced a 2003 book, ""L.A. Confidentiel -- Les Secrets de Lance Armstrong."" Published in France by two journalists, one of them Sunday Times sports reporter David Walsh, the book dealt with doping allegations against Armstrong. The newspaper settled with Armstrong in June 2006 after the High Court ruled the article would be interpreted as meaning Armstrong was a ""fraud, a cheat and a liar,"" the UK Press Gazette, an industry journal, reported at the time. A statement at the time from Schillings, the law firm acting for Armstrong, said: ""The Sunday Times has confirmed to Mr. Armstrong that it never intended to accuse him of being guilty of taking any performance enhancing drugs and sincerely apologized for any such impression. Mr. Armstrong has always vigorously opposed drugs in sport and appreciates The Sunday Times efforts to also address the problem."" The USADA report released Wednesday, with more than 1,000 pages of evidence, said Armstrong was part of ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" Former team members were among 26 witnesses who testified to the USADA as part of its investigation into doping by Armstrong and other riders on the team. On his Twitter feed, sports reporter Walsh welcomed the USADA report, saying: ""It is ALL there... entire report plus all affidavits. No man or woman of sane mind can now never doubt what went on."" Armstrong has consistently denied doping accusations, and his lawyer called the USADA probe a ""witch hunt"" Wednesday. But the cyclist has stopped contesting the allegations, and he faces being stripped of his titles. Armstrong decided to give up fighting the agency's investigation in August, after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit he had filed seeking to stop the probe. CNN's Per Nyberg and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Armstrong sued London's Sunday Times newspaper for libel over a 2004 article .

"Berlin (CNN) -- As the number of German farms closed because of possibly contaminated animal feed grew Friday, authorities said they had filed criminal charges against the company at the heart of the country's tainted egg scandal. The company, Harles and Jentzsch, apparently knew for months that fatty acid it was delivering to animal-feed makers was . contaminated with dioxin, said Christian Seifert, a spokesman for the agricultural ministry in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein said. Criminal charges have been filed against the company, Seifert said, ""because they did not immediately inform"" the agricultural ministry that dioxin levels surpassed the allowed amount. Authorities allege that the company sold about 3,000 tons of contaminated fatty acids to dozens of companies making animal feed across Germany. The country's government has quarantined more than 4,700 pig and poultry farms. Harles and Jentzsch laboratory tests from March 2010 showed they exceeded the ceiling level for dioxin, he said. ""At that point they had to stop delivering this product and immediately inform the authorities. They did not do either,"" Seifert said. Government officials learned of the higher concentrations of dioxin in December, he said. Several attempts to reach Harles and Jentzsch for comment were unsuccessful. Police raided the company's offices Wednesday and confiscated documents, but arrested no one, the state prosecutor's office in Schleswig-Holstein told CNN. Dioxin levels in the final feed product were diluted and likely did not exceed allowed amounts, Seifert said. ""Of course that is no excuse. The conduct is still wrong,"" he said. Agricultural ministry investigators are continuing lab tests of samples taken from the company's premises, he said. The 4,709 farms shut down include not only chicken and other poultry, but also pig farms, said Pierre Vetter, a spokesman for Germany's Ministry for Agriculture and Consumer Protection. State authorities are quarantining all farms that received animal feed from companies affected, regardless of whether there is proof that the feed was contaminated, the ministry's website said. ""The state authorities are right to quarantine products -- eggs and meat -- that may have been exposed to contaminated feed, even if there is no concrete scientific evidence in all cases,"" German Agriculture and Consumer Protection Minister Ilse Aigner said in a statement. About 130,000 possibly contaminated eggs were exported from a company in Germany to a food company in the Netherlands, where they were to be used in industrial food production, said Holger Eichele, a spokesman for Germany's Ministry for Agriculture and Consumer Protection. The UK Food Standards Agency said a pasteurized mixture including some of the contaminated eggs was distributed in the UK. ""The mixing of the eggs will have diluted the levels of dioxins and they are not thought to be a risk to health,"" the agency said in a statement. Dioxins are a family of toxic chemicals that share a similar chemical structure and have been characterized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as likely human carcinogens. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","A government spokesman says a company knew its fatty acid was contaminated with dioxin .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- It hits you just a few steps past the Hamas checkpoint, at the sounds and sight of a mule-pulled cart passing by: To enter Gaza is to step back in time. Also front and center: the question of whether hate will ever give way to peace. In the city square, there's a giant billboard celebrating the Hamas militant wing that carries out attacks in Israel. Nearby, posters paying tribute to men Hamas calls ""martyrs"" but who by most any other definition would be called terrorists. Obama: 'Peace is possible,' but see the world as Palestinians do . Opinion: Obama goes over Netanyahu's head to the Israeli people . Poverty is everywhere, as is rundown housing. Seeing the mules and horses pulling carts side by side on roads with mostly beat-up cars is a back to the future experience. Yet step behind one factory gate and you come to the realization Gaza doesn't have to be so bleak. The Pepsi bottling franchise has been in Gaza nearly 50 years, founded by Hammam al Yazji's grandfather. It bottles 7Up, Pepsi, and, on this day, an orange soda popular in the Arab world, Mirinda. After blocks and blocks of blight, watching the bottling line is an impressive sight. But it is also evidence of the price Gaza pays for Israel's anger at Hamas. Al Yazji doesn't like getting caught up in the political debates. But he does note that men with jobs are less likely to get caught up in violence and terror. In its heyday, the factory had 600 workers. Now there are about 300, many of them working only part time. ""We've actually got five lines and used to have three shifts a day,"" al Yazji told CNN during a factory tour this week. ""Now we've got only one shift like three days a week."" Production is down because the plant can no longer ship products to and through Israel. And costs are up because of the same economic isolation: The factory used to send a tanker truck to the Israeli border to buy cO2 that is critical to soda production. Now it pays five times as much for gas smuggled into Gaza from Egypt. Al Yazji blames Israel. ""They just want to control Gaza,"" he said. ""They want to control people. They want to control the economy. They want to control everything."" Welcome to the great Palestinian divide. President Barack Obama took note of this Thursday, while in Ramallah to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas and the Fatah movement he leads run the West Bank; Gaza is run by Hamas. Obama paid tribute to the stronger economy in the West Bank and said it ""stands in stark contrast to the misery and depression so many Palestinians continue to confront in Gaza."" Ramallah is hardly a boomtown, but it is a galaxy apart from Gaza. Walking through Ramallah and Gaza, political differences become real . The outdoor produce market is busy, coffee shops are packed with students and young professionals, luxury cars are not uncommon, and ATMs from nine Arab banks sit side by side to compete for business at the entrance to a Ramallah shopping mall. Sam Bahour is a businessman and consultant who helped build the mall. Sure, he says, Ramallah is better than Gaza. But he said that is far from good enough. And like al Yazji in Gaza, Bahour blames Israel. ""Israel has now had the leisure to pick and choose how much restriction it puts on the various Palestinian areas,"" Bahour said. ""But that doesn't mean Ramallah isn't under military occupation. We very much are in a cage, and around this cage is either Israeli settlements or military checkpoints."" Palestinians see Israeli 'growth' as roadblock . Bahour lives in Ramallah but was raised in Youngstown, Ohio. He is an American citizen who twice cast an absentee ballot for Obama, but he believes the presidential visit here now is a mistake. Opinion: Obama's Israel trip is about legacy . ""Coming and going without bringing any kind of political movement is emboldening Israel,"" he said. ""And emboldening Israel with this new right wing government means more settlements, means more potential collapse for Palestinian society."" Back in Gaza, Khre Ajjor prefers not to talk politics, but says he wishes the economics of peace would take hold. Ajjor owns a furniture factory within eyeshot of the Gaza-Israel border and can point out the gate through which not too long ago his products were shipped to Israel. Now Israel won't allow it and the border industrial park is a wasteland. Once home to about 100 factories and warehouses, locals say it now just has five in daily operation. To pass through is to see mostly abandoned or shuttered buildings in a bleak no-man's land under the watchful gaze of Israeli surveillance balloons. Ajjor once operated in three buildings; he rents two now to the United Nations. Ask Ajjor if he blames Israel, and he notes that he speaks fluent Hebrew, and shows CNN company stationery in Hebrew, to make it easier to do business with his former Israeli customers. Sure, he says Israel shares responsibility. But he says Hamas does, too. And the Palestinian Authority. He had 150 workers before Hamas came to power in Gaza; just 20 now. The price, he says, of mistrust and hate.","Gaza, a Palestinian territory, is controlled by Hamas .

"(CNN) -- When the holidays bring heartache instead of joy, I think they do so because they stand as an unforgiving yardstick against which we measure our losses and troubles. If no one reminds us, we can sometimes overlook the fact that loved ones are gone, or that our lives are filled with painful conflict in exactly the intimate areas that should be sources of strength and comfort for us. But then along come the holidays, imposing upon us once again a template for what happiness and interpersonal success is expected to look like. It can be hard to measure up. It is far easier to overlook the death of loved ones when you don't have to stare across the holiday table at their empty places. It is far easier to pretend that family trauma or conflict don't exist when you are far away and on your own. But the holidays force us to either return to painful family interactions or to fully own our isolation and spend the season alone. It is a terrible choice. I've treated many patients over the years who reliably became depressed during the holidays out of dread of having to interact with their families. On the other hand, the silence of Christmas morning on one's own carries its own unique pain. I never cease to be amazed at how often both emotional well-being and mental illness hinge on how we negotiate these types of impossible choices. Because the choices really are often insoluble and the losses are often so actual, we in the mental health professions frequently try to find ""a third way"" to help people cope. In the end, these ""third way"" approaches usually come down to helping people reframe their issues so they that seem less hopeless and painful. Or we provide people with medications such as antidepressants to make their brains and bodies less reactive to stress. Or we do both. Reframing . I've given many interviews over the years regarding strategies for helping people cope emotionally with the holidays. For people truly overwhelmed, I often recommend exploring ways to neutralize Christmas negativity by changing how they approach the holidays. For example, if someone develops a major depression every year before or after going home to see her family, I encourage her to explore what would happen if she abandoned this painful pattern and instead proactively planned a Christmas vacation somewhere beyond the reach of her memories and holiday associations that generate symptoms of depression. Sometimes this type of strategy works beautifully. Often other family members are equally miserable and join the exodus, providing strength in numbers. Sometimes the person's absence leads the family to re-evaluate itself and change in positive ways. But sometimes, the attempt to flee Christmas is met with such anger and guilt production from the family that the patient actually ends up doing worse. Everyone's holiday situation is unique. This type of approach toward reframing Christmas follows what I sometimes call the ""who says"" rule. Many times we torture ourselves with ideas of how things should be, or would be if we were somehow smarter, richer, different. To which I often ask, ""Who says?"" ""Who says things have to be the way you think they should be?"" ""Who says you have to suffer over a painful fantasy of what you think Christmas ought to be?"" We cling tightly to our fantasies -- good and bad. But sometimes when we can loosen their grip on us, we can see new possibilities for how to be at peace with our lives and find a little joy. Medications . This holiday season I've been thinking a lot about Christmas 1987, because it was four days later, on December 29, that fluoxetine, better known by its brand name Prozac, received FDA approval for use in the United States. The approval of Prozac launched one of history's greatest run of ""third way"" approaches to trauma and loss. With Prozac came a growing belief that medicines might hold promise as the ultimate solution, not just to clinical depression, but perhaps to heartache more generally. Having once believed this myself, I find that now, 25 years later, I am far more cautious in my appraisal of what the coming of Prozac actually meant for the world's emotional well-being. I've seen repeatedly with my own eyes how modern antidepressants like Prozac can help depressed people get their lives back. And I've seen people who had struggled with negative thoughts and feelings for years find that they were different -- and more successful -- with the addition of an antidepressant in their lives. But in the last several years it has become increasingly clear that antidepressants are not, and probably will never be, a cure-all for heartache, in any of its forms clinical or mundane. For one thing, our best current data suggest that antidepressants only work adequately for 40% to 60% of depressed people, with the percentages varying depending on what one thinks of as ""adequate."" More recent evidence suggests that antidepressants can actually worsen depressive symptoms in a sizable minority of people who take them. Perhaps this shouldn't surprise us. Chemotherapeutic agents that increase the probability of surviving cancer also increase the risk of developing a second cancer in the future. And yet despite this fact, and despite the dread we feel at the mere mention of the word ""chemotherapy,"" most of us embrace chemotherapeutic treatment when diagnosed with cancer, understanding that despite the manifold limitations and horrendous side effects, it's the best that we've got. Perhaps the most concerning recent debate in the antidepressant literature revolves around the question of whether taking these medications increases the risk of having a depression relapse when the antidepressant is discontinued. This issue is complex and hotly debated. But if the weight of the evidence eventually suggests that antidepressants carry this risk it will further complicate the clinician's task. Still, as with chemotherapy, they're the best that we've got. Finding more solutions . This year, with Christmas upon us, I am more convinced than ever that we who work clinically or conduct research in the realm of mental health must redouble our efforts to find new and better ""third ways"" to help deal, not just with clinical depression, but also with the ubiquitous heartache and anxiety that are so prevalent in the modern world. Although I personally research biological approaches to treating depression, I suspect that part of our movement forward will come from better integrating older ways of wisdom into our treatment protocols. Many wisdom traditions point toward the same thing -- that full healing requires not just reframing or biology, but an inner transformation that embraces suffering itself as a means of escape from our suffering.

"Washington (CNN) -- John Brennan joined the CIA as a young man after responding to a newspaper want ad. Now, at 57, he could become its next director. President Barack Obama on Monday nominated Brennan, his chief counterterrorism adviser, to lead the CIA, praising his pick as someone already closely connected to the agency and willing to fight on its behalf. ""John knows what our national security demands: intelligence that provides policymakers with the facts, strong, analytic insights and a keen understanding of a dynamic world,"" Obama said at the White House. Brennan worked for the CIA for more than two decades and has been Obama's assistant for counterterrorism and homeland security since 2009. In that role, Obama said, Brennan worked closely with many government agencies. The results were clear, the president said. ""More al Qaeda leaders and commanders have been removed from the battlefield than at any time since 9/11."" Brennan has shaped the White House's strategy to aggressively pursue suspected terrorists -- dramatically escalating the use of armed unmanned aircraft, often referred to as drones -- and to kill them in the ungoverned territories of Pakistan and in Yemen. Brennan: Drone attacks are legal, ethical . He was also intimately involved in the run-up to the raid on the Osama bin Laden compound in May 2011. ""John is legendary even in the White House for working hard,"" Obama said. ""He is one of the hardest working public servants I have ever seen."" In recent years, Brennan has become well-known in Washington as the public face of the White House's counterterrorism policies. Now, if the Senate confirms his nomination, he'll head an agency where many employees work behind the scenes. Brennan praised the often anonymous work of CIA staffers Monday and pledged to do everything he can to support them. ""If confirmed as director I will make it my mission to make sure that the CIA has the tools it needs to keep our nation safe and that its work always reflect the liberties, the freedoms and the values that we hold so dear,"" Brennan told reporters shortly after Obama tapped him for the job. Obama announced Brennan's nomination Monday at the same time he tapped former Sen. Chuck Hagel to become defense secretary. Both men, he said, ""have dedicated their lives to protecting our country."" If the Senate confirms Brennan's the nomination, he will replace retired Gen. David Petraeus, who stepped down from his job as CIA director in November amid revelations that he had engaged in an extramarital affair with his biographer. Petraeus resigned on November 9 as the FBI investigated whether his biographer, Paula Broadwell, had inappropriate access to classified information. Read more: Who's in, who's out of cabinet . Michael Morell, a career intelligence officer who was serving as the spy agency's deputy director, has been acting CIA director since Petraeus' resignation. In a message to colleagues, Morrell said he looked forward to welcoming Brennan back to the CIA. ""Those of you who know John can attest to his intellect, expertise, and prodigious work ethic. I have had the privilege of working with him for the better part of two decades, and I know him to be a public servant of the highest integrity. We have worked literally hundreds of tough issues together, and I have found that his approach always begins and ends with the question, 'What is the right thing to do here?'"" he wrote. After the 2008 election, Brennan was touted as a shoo-in for CIA director, but attacks from critics who claimed he supported the Bush administration's policy of harsh interrogations prompted him to drop out of consideration for the job. Returning to the CIA would be a homecoming of sorts for Brennan, who spent 25 years there, developing a deep knowledge of the Mideast and fluency in Arabic. ""He knows what the president wants from his intelligence community,"" said Bill Harlow, a former senior CIA official. ""And he also knows how to deliver it from having worked at the agency. ... There'll be no learning curve for him."" After the nomination was announced, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he hoped the Senate would give both Brennan and Hagel ""a fair and constructive confirmation process."" Debate over the drone program and Brennan's position on CIA interrogations could make for some rough moments during his hearings. Concerns about his past work at the CIA began to simmer again on Monday, with the American Civil Liberties Union calling on lawmakers to investigate whether Brennan had been involved in torture, abuse or secret prisons during his past tenure at the CIA during the administration of President George W. Bush. Opinion: John Brennan, Obama's drone warrior . ""This nomination is too important to proceed without the Senate first knowing what happened during Brennan's tenures at the CIA and the White House, and whether all of his conduct was within the law,"" Laura W. Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington Legislative Office, said in a statement. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he planned to examine Brennan's record closely. ""I appreciate John Brennan's long record of service to our nation,"" McCain said in a statement, ""but I have many questions and concerns about his nomination to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, especially what role he played in the so-called enhanced interrogation programs while serving at the CIA during the last administration, as well as his public defense of those programs."" Even as she praised his record, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said she planned to raise the CIA detention and interrogation issue with Brennan. The fact that Brennan is coming from the West Wing and has frequently talked about the president's views on camera could make him political fodder, said Frances Fragos Townsend, CNN's national security contributor. ""He's got to expect that (Capitol) Hill is going to treat him as a political person who is fair game now, rightly or wrongly,"" she said. On Monday, Brennan said he was prepared to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and field their questions. ""While the intelligence profession oftentimes demands secrecy,"" he said, ""it is critically important that there be a full and open discourse on intelligence matters with the appropriate elected representatives of the American people."" Compared to Hagel, reaction to Brennan nomination muted . CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported in Atlanta; Pam Benson in Washington. CNN's John Berman, Jill Dougherty, Devon Sayers and Jim Acosta also contributed to this report.","NEW: The acting director says he looks forward to welcoming John Brennan back to the CIA .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Is Marco Rubio auditioning for vice president -- or secretary of State? The Florida senator -- a Republican Party rock star who has been entrusted with the Herculean task of pulling the GOP out of the hole that it has dug with Latino voters because of harsh rhetoric on immigration -- delivered a substantive speech on U.S. foreign policy Wednesday at the Brookings Institution. It was an ambitious subject choice. At the moment, Rubio could read the Miami-Dade phone book and he'd get his share of media attention. A speech like this suggests he's trying to prove something -- or perhaps prove himself worthy of all the attention he is already receiving. As for the speech itself, Rubio's message was right on target. He stressed the idea that the United States remains what former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the world's indispensable nation. ""On the most difficult transnational challenges of our time,"" Rubio asked, ""who will lead if we do not? The answer, at least today, is that no other nation or organization is willing or able to do so."" You would think that, for some folks in my profession, Rubio is the indispensable politician. What would we do without him? Any story involving him is bound to get a lot of attention. As speculation builds that presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney has his eye on the charismatic 40-year-old Cuban-American as a possible running mate, political observers want to learn everything they can about him. Some of what we're learning could be embarrassing to Rubio, like the tidbit that surfaced this week about his maternal grandfather. The story appears in a forthcoming and unauthorized biography of the senator by Manuel Roig-Franzia of the Washington Post. Rubio was born to Cuban exiles in Miami in 1971, and so he's automatically a U.S. citizen. But, according to excerpts from the book, which is due out in June, his grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, entered the United States without a visa in 1962 and spent the next few years in legal limbo while pleading for leniency from U.S. immigration officials. Finally, Garcia was ordered to leave the United States. Normally, this kind of family history would hardly be worth mentioning. And, while I expect that some right-wing talk show hosts will suggest that the reason the media is mentioning it now is to try to sour conservatives on Rubio, that's really not what's going on here. Conservatives aren't likely to hold Rubio accountable for the actions of his grandfather. This story is important because it drives a wedge between Rubio and the voters he is supposed to be able to deliver to the Republican Party. When you're a Cuban-American politician who is being put forth by your party to help get votes from Latino voters -- the majority of whom are Mexican or Mexican-American -- things can get complicated. When it comes to immigrating to the United States, Cubans get preferred status. Thanks to the Cuban Adjustment Act, which was enacted in 1966 -- or four years after Rubio's grandfather came to the United States -- Cuban refugees who flee the Island and reach the U.S. shoreline have a clear path to legal residency and eventual citizenship. Mexican immigrants aren't so fortunate. So when Cuban-Americans do what Rubio has done since arriving in the Senate 16 months ago and take a hardline against illegal immigration, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have been known to cringe. After all, that's easy for them to say. Last year, Rubio came under criticism from fellow Latinos for getting wrong the year that his parents came to United States. It turned out that they left Cuba before Castro took power, making them immigrants and not refugees. So here we have one more thing that Mexicans and Mexican-Americans can use against Rubio to try to take him down a peg or two. They'll gladly remind him that he's no better than they are, and that while some of their ancestors may have come to this country illegally, so did at least one of his. As bad as this relationship has been, it's about to get worse because of ""grandpa-gate."" Stories like this make Rubio damaged goods and less useful in luring Latinos to the Republican ticket. That being the case, his vice presidential stock has to be plummeting. What good does it do the ticket for Rubio to be popular with whites and Cuban-Americans? Republicans are likely to get the majority of those votes anyway. His value is all wrapped up in how well he plays with Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. And right now, the answer is ""not well."" Marco Rubio on the GOP ticket? I wouldn't bet on it. Say, maybe secretary of State would be a good consolation prize after all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Marco Rubio is considered a rising star among Republicans .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli security officials on Tuesday started the process of evacuating some 150 Jewish residents from their homes at the West Bank settlement of Beit El. The Israeli government vowed to evacuate the Ulpana neighborhood by July 1 after the Israeli Supreme Court ruled last year that the settlers' houses were built on privately owned Palestinian land. Fifteen of the neighborhood's 30 families were moved to a nearby temporary neighborhood. The evacuation process is due to be completed by the end of this week, the Israeli Defense Ministry said. The decision to go ahead with the move was initially met with fierce resistance from the settler movement. Earlier this month a West Bank mosque was vandalized and partially set on fire. Graffiti sprayed outside the walls of the mosque read ""Ulpana War"" and ""Price Tag."" ""Price tag"" is a term frequently used by radical Israeli settlers to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts, or as retribution for attacks by Palestinians. Three weeks ago, residents of the settlement set off on a two-day march from the controversial neighborhood to the Israeli Knesset parliamentary building in Jerusalem and called for a bill which would bypass the court's decision and legalize their homes. In an effort to satisfy the settlement residents, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a plan to build 300 new housing units in a separate area of Beit El. Following negotiations with the Israeli government, the residents eventually agreed to leave their homes without resistance. An additional 550 units are to be built in other settlements in the West Bank. Harbi Ibrahim Mustafa Hassan, the Palestinian owner of the land, told CNN he was extremely moved by the decision of the Israeli court: ""I felt very excited, just like finding a few million dollars on the street. The land for me was almost lost. My lawyers were very faithful and encouraged us to keep going. It took five years to get our land back."" Hassan said he did feel sympathy for the settlers as well. ""As a human being I feel sorry for them, but they have done something wrong. You talk about democracy, right? The right of ownership is a principle in democracy, the right of speech is a principle in democracy, and this is my land."" Josh Hantman, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense, told CNN the deal with the settlers was reached through great effort and numerous coordinations with the leaders of the local community. ""We believe that preparation is paying off. It is a delicate, sensitive and complicated relocation process. However the courts have spoken and the Ministry of Defense is committed to upholding the rule of law."" The highly contentious issue of Israeli construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- land the Palestinians seek for a future state -- is one of the main sticking points preventing the resumption of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.","Israeli government says settlers will be gone by Sunday from an area in Beit El .

"(CNN) -- Soaring temperatures and strong winds have combined to create a ""catastrophic"" fire threat across the southeast Australian state of New South Wales. Residents have been warned to remain vigilant as temperatures rise towards a predicted high of 43 degrees (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in the state capital of Sydney. In some areas of the state, winds of more than 70 kilometers an hour (43 mph) were threatening to fan the flames of fires already burning. However, a change in wind direction had caused temperatures in certain parts of the state to fall, offering some relief. A ""catastrophic"" fire risk has been declared in four areas of NSW, although the risk across 90% of the state is ""severe"" or above. A ""catastrophic"" warning carries the risk of significant loss of life and the destruction of many homes, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS). ""I cannot say it more plainly: the risk is real and potentially deadly. People need to act now,"" the service's Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. The ""catastrophic"" fire threat had led many to fear a repeat of ""Black Saturday"" in 2009, when soaring temperatures and high winds fanned the flames of a series of bushfires across the state of Victoria, leaving 173 people dead and 500 injured, and destroying thousands of homes. On Tuesday afternoon, the Australian government announced that the state fire service would be granted access to Defence Force bases, fuel and personnel as part of the federal government disaster response plan. Earlier, Prime Minister Julia Gillard warned it was ""dangerous"" day and urged people to ""stay focused."" ""The word catastrophic is being used for good reason,"" Gillard told CNN affiliate the Seven Network. ""It is very important that people keep themselves safe, that they listen to local authorities and local warnings."" Total fire bans were place in the states of NSW, Victoria and across the whole of Tasmania, the southern island state ravaged by fire in recent days. On Tuesday afternoon, more than 130 fires were burning throughout NSW, with over 40 of those yet to be controlled, according to NSW RFS. There were no reports of any homes having being destroyed but authorities warned that the dry, hot conditions were expected to stretch into the night. ""It's a long way ahead -- we've got a lot of daylight left and a lot of nighttime left under these conditions,"" Fitzsimmons said. Thousands of firefighters were battling blazes on the ground, and more than 40 aircraft and 250 fire trucks had been deployed, a fire service spokeswoman said. Thousands more firefighters were on standby in high risk areas, including 21 ""strike teams,"" each consisting of five tankers to assist local brigades. The fire service said it was relying on people to report fires in their areas, but that surveillance flights were also monitoring the landscape for smoke and flames. Authorities said residents and tourists had responded well to early warnings to abandon properties under threat. ""If you are in a bushfire risk area -- if you are an at risk location, leaving early is the safest option,"" Fitzsimmons said. Record high temperatures and the delayed state of the Australian monsoon season have created a tinderbox out of large swathes of bush and scrub land across the state. The last four months of 2012 were ""abnormally hot"" across Australia, according to the Australian Bureau of Meterology. Average maximum temperatures were the highest since records began in 1910. In the first days of the new year, extreme heat contributed to the spread of fires across Tasmania. Firefighters are still on alert, tackling a number of blazes, as residents who were in the path of the earlier fires returned to the charred rubble of their homes. More than 100 properties were destroyed or damaged, though authorities warn more may be at risk. Rescue workers are continuing to search for human remains as around 100 people have still not contacted friends or family, according to Tasmania police. ""It's vitally important that all people who were in the area at the time, and are OK, self-register their details with the National Registration and Inquiry Service operated by the Red Cross,"" said Acting Deputy Commissioner Donna Adams. Meanwhile, police have charged a 31-year-old man for allegedly causing one of the worst of the fires by leaving a campfire unattended that was not completely extinguished.","NEW: Federal government steps in with fuel, personnel to help NSW fire effort .

"(CNN) -- Before luxury yachting was the preserve of Russian tycoons and Silicon Valley moguls, it was only the world's wealthiest royals who built palaces on the sea. There have been and continue to be a fleet of imperial yachts used to transport royals, from Russian czars to princes of Monaco, in the opulent fashion to which they are accustomed. ""Britannia"" There are probably few finer examples of a regal leisure boat than ""Her Majesty's Yacht (HMY) Britannia,"" built in 1953 for Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. Now decommissioned and on display in Edinburgh, Scotland, the vast and lavishly designed ""HMY Britannia"" has sailed over one million miles during 44 years of service and in the course of 968 official royal visits. Once described by Queen Elizabeth as ""the one place where I can truly relax,"" the royal yacht, built to many of the queen's specifications, boasts huge dining rooms adorned with gifts and curiosities from around the world, including a whale rib found by her husband on a beach. In addition, there's a sun lounge with furniture chosen by the queen and a garage built to house the royal Rolls-Royce. Sir Winston Churchill, Boris Yeltsin, Rajiv Gandhi and Nelson Mandela are among the famous names who have joined the queen on board over the years, but ""HMY Britannia"" was also deployed for more private and romantic occasions. As Kate and William add the finishing touches to their wedding plans, they may well feel a pang of regret that ""Britannia"" is no longer in service. Four royal honeymoons took place on board, including Prince Charles and Princess Diana's 16-day trip in the Mediterranean. ""Dubai"" Today, the undisputed champion of royal vessels belongs to Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, whose $300 million mega-yacht is christened -- somewhat unimaginatively -- ""Dubai."" Measuring 524 feet long, it's the world's second-largest yacht, eclipsed only by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich's suitably named ""Eclipse."" Three elevators and one vast open glass stairway serve its multitude of decks which, aside from the gold-finished, jewel-encrusted VIP guestrooms and appropriately palatial master bedrooms, contain a squash room, spa, banquet hall and cinema. And did we mention the helicopter pad up top? In keeping with the fantasy-flavored extravagance of ""Dubai,"" the yacht is moored year-round on the artificial ""Logo Island,"" situated next to the country's emblematic, man-made archipelago ""Palm Islands"" -- built from one billion cubic meters of rock and sand. ""Standart"" If you thought that Abramovich and his fellow billionaires were the first of their countrymen to build ultra-ostentatious pleasure boats, then think again. The Russian imperial yacht ""Standart,"" built according to the specifications of Emperor Alexander III and his son Nicholas, was the largest imperial yacht on the oceans during the late 19th and early 20th century. Completed in 1895, the opulent vessel was 401 feet long -- about the length of a soccer pitch -- colossal even by today's immodest standards. Indeed, ""Standart"" was a veritable floating palace, adorned with mahogany-paneled drawing rooms, formal salons with polished floors, brass fittings, crystal chandeliers and velvet drapes. The czar's private study was furnished in dark leather and elegant wooden furniture, while the czarina's drawing room and boudoir were bedecked in her favorite English chintz. The imperial yacht even had its own chapel for the private use of the family. However, Russia's largest royal yacht was also her last. After the revolution in 1917, the ship was stripped of all its elegance, renamed ""Vosemnadtsate Martza"" and refitted as a drab, gray minelayer for service in the Soviet Navy. The boat was scrapped at Tallinn in Estonia in 1963. ""M/Y Grace"" Decked out with a Jacuzzi, sea kayaks, snorkeling gear and wetsuits, ""M/Y Grace"" is one of the few specially tailored yachts fit to chart the delicate waters surrounding the Galapagos Islands. The boat's regal past is only hinted at in its name. ""M/Y Grace,"" as the vessel is now known, was once the royal yacht of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco. When American actress Grace Kelly married the prince of Monaco, the couple were extensively pictured honeymooning on this exquisite 147-foot-long yacht, given to them as a wedding gift by prominent Greek shipping merchant Aristotle Onassis. The boat was captured on boundless newsreels as cameras and reporters followed Kelly on her last voyage from the United States to her new home in what was then styled ""the wedding of the century."" The couple left the day after the ceremony to cruise the coasts of Corsica and Sardinia. ""K/S Norge"" The K/S Norge is one of the last active royal yachts in Europe, belonging to Herald V, King of Norway. Built in 1937 by Camper and Nicholson, the oldest leisure marine company in the world, the boat was originally owned by British aviation pioneer Sir Thomas Sopwith -- who had given it over to the UK's Royal Navy to serve as a convoy escort vessel during World War II. In July 1947, the ship was purchased by the people of Norway as a present to the much beloved King Haakon VII for his 75th birthday. The royal yacht was renamed ""Norge,"" the Norwegian word for Norway. Still used today for state visits abroad, the classically shaped yacht is also employed as a base for the king when he competes in international yacht races.","Magisterial mega-yachts have ferried royals around the world .

"(CNN) -- In his first visit to Israel and the West Bank since assuming the White House, President Barack Obama ventures into a region of the world whose politics are layered and complex. As he meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama will address problems on many levels, including his chilly relationship with Netanyahu, Iran's growing nuclear threat, Syria's possible use of chemical arms and the elusive prospect of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The to-do list is ambitious. Obama isn't expected to unveil a major peace plan, but the four-day visit will help define the two-term president's legacy in the Mideast. 1. Repairing personal politics . Netanyahu and Obama sometimes have been at odds. Netanyahu was perceived by the Israeli left as supporting Obama's opponent, Mitt Romney, in last fall's election. Netanyahu's administration also was perceived as slighting the Obama administration when Israel issued permits for settlement building while Vice President Joe Biden was visiting in 2010. For Obama's part, an open mike in 2011 caught his complaining about having to deal with Netanyahu, and Obama didn't meet with the Israeli leader when he visited the United States last fall. Obama cited a scheduling conflict. At the opening news conference Wednesday, both men were demonstrably friendly in exchanging handshakes. Israeli president: No doubt Obama has Israel's back . 2. Iran's nuclear program . Netanyahu pressed Obama last year to draw a red line on Iran's expanding nuclear program. Obama indicates he has wiggle room before Iran's nuclear capacity crosses a line, and he is expected to urge Israel to give diplomacy more time. While open to that idea, Netanyahu adds that diplomacy has yet to deter Iran and will press Obama on committing to military options against Iran. Obama said Wednesday there was still time for a diplomatic resolution to the situation, but added that each country has to make ""the awesome decision to engage in any kind of military action"" for itself. 3. Syrian civil war . As Obama began the trip in Israel, he reiterated his warning to Syria's government that it would be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons ""or their transfer to terrorists."" The warning comes amid allegations by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and rebels that each used chemical weapons in recent fighting. ""We intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened,"" Obama told reporters Wednesday during a joint news conference in Jerusalem with Netanyahu. Doubts expressed over chemical weapons claims in Syria . The president said he was ""deeply skeptical"" of Syrian government claims that the opposition had used chemical weapons. Obama has previously said Syria's use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line."" ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime -- but also to other players on the ground -- that a red line for us is, we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,"" he told reporters. ""That would change my calculus; that would change my equation."" 4. Peace between Israel and Palestinians . Expectations are zero that Obama will broker peace between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who have yet to return to the negotiating table. Still, Obama will visit Ramallah in the West Bank and meet with Abbas and Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad -- if only to highlight the distance that remains for a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. 5. Beyond the visit . After Obama visits Israel, the West Bank and then Jordan, new Secretary of State John Kerry will likely remain behind in Israel and meet with Netanyahu on Saturday, a senior State Department official told CNN. Kerry would review the results of Obama's visit and discuss the next steps on key issues, the senior official said. Such a follow-up strategy would mark Kerry's first foray into Mideast peace issues -- and could advance any success Obama achieves during his maiden visit to Jerusalem and the West Bank.

"(CNN) -- Bahrain's highest court on Monday upheld the verdicts against 13 activists convicted of plotting to overthrow the government for their role in pro-democracy demonstrations sparked by the success of popular Arab Spring uprisings. The country's highest appeals court took just minutes to rule on the appeal of the 13 people, who received sentences between five years and life, said attorney Mohsin Alawi, who represents three of the 13.

They were arrested for their roles in anti-government demonstrations in 2011 as the Arab Spring movement swept across the region. Demonstrations in Bahrain failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In November 2011, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report critical of authorities' reactions to the protests, which began in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.

Amnesty International has called the convictions of the activists an outrage and urged Bahrain to overturn the sentences. It slammed the decision Monday, saying it ""is further proof of how the country's justice system simply cannot be relied on."" The government has defended its judicial procedures and decisions, saying it provided fair trials. It has pointed out that Amnesty International was one of the international entities that attended the trial. Alawi's clients Abdul Jalil al-Mudad, Muhammed al-Muqdad and Abdul Wahhab Husain received life sentences, he said.","Bahrain's highest appeals court took just minutes to rule, an attorney says .

"(CNN) -- Presidential hopeful Herman Cain told a newspaper Thursday that he never told his wife about another woman he befriended 13 years ago and helped out financially. In an editorial board meeting with the New Hampshire Union Leader, Cain said he repeatedly gave Ginger White money to help her with ""month-to-month bills and expenses."" However, he denied a sexual affair, as White alleges. Cain also said he was considering dropping out of the race, but for now was continuing to meet all campaign commitments. The statement in the videotaped interview was his most definitive to date that he might end his campaign. Cain later told Sean Hannity of Fox News that he will make a decision before Monday. On Wednesday night, Cain told reporters in Ohio that he had discussed White's allegations with his wife, but was waiting until he could speak face-to-face with Gloria Cain on Friday before making any decision about his campaign. He said in the Thursday interview that his wife's feelings, as well as the reaction from supporters and donors, would be important factors in deciding whether to stay in the race. ""Yes, getting out is an option,"" Cain said in the interview, which lasted almost an hour. The allegation of an extramarital affair, following accusations of sexual harassment from other women, has seriously damaged Cain's presidential bid. Once a surprise front-runner in the race, he has plunged in the polls since initial allegations of sexual harassment emerged in October. Cain told staffers this week he was reassessing his campaign in the wake of White's allegation of an affair, and he acknowledged to reporters Wednesday that her account had led to a drop in campaign contributions. On Thursday, Cain provided new details on his relationship with White, including the revelation that his wife had no knowledge of what he called a friendship dating back years and his financial help for the woman. Gloria Cain ""did not know that we were friends until she (White) came out with this story"" on Monday, Cain said, later adding: ""My wife did not know about it, and that was the revelation. My wife found out about it when she (White) went public with it."" Cain also repeated his insistence that he and White were no more than friends. He had previously denied any sexual relationship with White. Asked about reports of text messages he had exchanged with White, Cain confirmed that the woman had sent him about 70 such messages between October 22 and November 18 including some ""asking for financial assistance."" ""She was out of work and had trouble paying her bills and I had known her as a friend,"" Cain said, adding: ""She wasn't the only friend who I had helped in these tough economic times, and so her messages to me were relating to 'need money for rent' or whatever the case may be. I don't remember all the specifics."" Cain said he gave White money, but refused to divulge how much. ""My wife now knows,"" Cain said. ""My wife and I have talked about it and I have explained it to her. My wife understands that I'm a soft-hearted, giving person."" Saying that no questions would have been raised if the story involved giving money to a needy male friend, Cain added that his wife ""is comfortable with the explanation that I told her."" Cain's attorney, Lin Wood, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on Thursday that White has provided no proof of an affair or associated financial receipts. He claimed his client has been a victim of unproven allegations and that the media should be asking tough questions of White. Referring to five women who have made allegations against Cain, Morgan asked Wood if it was stretching credulity to suggest that all ""of these woman are simply fantasies."" ""Let me suggest to you that five lies do not make one truth,"" Wood replied. ""When you talk about the importance of character ... let's look at it from the perspective of that candidate's entire career and life. Don't judge people's character based on accusations made in the media that have not been proven with facts and, in fact, have been clearly denied by the candidate."" The attorney said it was improper to answer specifics about the friendship and financial arrangements between Cain and White. ""I am not going to relegate the political process into a Jerry Springer show,"" he said. Cain told Hannity he is going to ""re-establish"" his character and get to the bottom of the circumstances of the allegations against him. ""I send checks to a lot of people. I help a lot of people,"" Cain said. ""That in itself is not proof. So the other allegation in terms of it being a 13-year physical relationship, that is her words against my word."" Cain said Wednesday night that Friday will be the first opportunity to sit down with his wife and ""walk through this"" with his family. On Thursday, an official with Cain's Iowa campaign staff said the candidate's chief of staff met with the four-person Iowa team to emphasize that the election drive was moving forward. ""Mark Block, Herman Cain's chief of staff and chief operating officer, just left a meeting at the Iowa headquarters with all four Iowa staffers,"" said a statement by Lisa Lockwood, the communications director of Friends of Herman Cain's Iowa staff. ""The emphatic message is that the campaign is full steam ahead. Herman Cain is in it to win it. He always has been and that has not changed."" The Iowa caucuses, the first formal test of the primary season, are scheduled for January 3. Two women -- Sharon Bialek and Karen Kraushaar -- have accused Cain of sexually harassing them in the 1990s while he was head of the National Restaurant Association. Two other women also have said Cain sexually harassed them while they worked at the association, but they have declined to be identified. This week, White told the media that she had an off-and-on affair with Cain for about 13 years, which she described as ""very casual."" In the interview Thursday, Cain speculated that political opponents might be paying White to make the allegations. ""Running for president is a very dirty game,"" he said, repeating: ""It's a dirty game."" Cain also said he would drop out of the race if his wife asked him to, but quickly added that she wouldn't. Gloria Cain rarely makes public appearances or statements. Earlier this month, she spoke to Fox News, calling the sexual-harassment allegations ""unfounded."" In a fund-raising letter Tuesday night after White spoke to the media about the alleged relationship, Cain wrote that ""a troubled Atlanta businesswoman used national media outlets to promulgate a fabricated, unsubstantiated story about a 13-year affair with me. I am writing you today to assure you that this woman's story is completely false."" On Wednesday morning White responded, ""It's very disappointing that he would call me troubled."" ""I'm only here to state the truth and what's happened in the past,"" she said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" She acknowledged that Cain has given her money. ""I've received gifts and money for the last 2 1/2 years consistently,"" she said, adding that he did not ask for anything in return. She and Cain were in touch until last week, when there were leaks about the relationship and members of the media began to call her cell phone and family members, White said. White said she came forward to share her side of the story. ""I can't imagine waking up one morning and deciding to come out with this if this was not true,"" she told ABC. ""This has been a very difficult situation for myself, for my family, and it's nothing that I am proud of."" ""So far I have been absolutely humiliated, embarrassed,"" she said. White said she had not saved receipts and notes throughout the affair because she never planned to make the relationship public. But, she said, Cain took her on several trips, including to a boxing match in Las Vegas. ""I can't make this stuff up,"" she said. Asked whether his recent texts to her included requests that she not come forward, she replied, ""Absolutely not. The funny thing about Herman Cain is, never in a million years did he probably think that I would speak out on this. And honestly speaking, I never wanted to."" White acknowledged that she has been sued for libel by a former business partner. ""There were disputes and disagreements"" with the partner and the experience became emotional, she said, acknowledging that she had made mistakes. White said she thought the situation had been resolved. Asked whether she believes Cain should end his campaign, White responded, ""That's something he has to decide for himself."" CNN's Tom Cohen, Alan Silverleib, Josh Levs, Ashley Killough, Kevin Bohn, Gloria Borger, Peter Hamby, Wolf Blitzer and John King contributed to this report.","NEW: Media should be asking tough questions of accuser, Cain's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- A French soldier was killed during a clash with Islamist fighters early Wednesday in northern Mali, the French Defense Ministry said. Four French soldiers have been killed in Mali since the beginning of France's military intervention there in January. Interactive: Africa's rocky road to democracy . Islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA.

"(CNN) -- Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque? Probably not. But this question is now being asked not only by dentists, but also by archaeologists. As a molecular archaeologist, I research the origins and evolution of human disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient peoples. By extracting DNA from ancient human bones, we can reconstruct the human genome at different times in the past and look for differences that might be related to adaptations, risk factors, or inherited diseases. The aim is to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of the human body so that we can better manage and improve our health in the future. But this only tells us half of the story. Many of today's most important health challenges are not caused by simple mutations in the human genome, but result from a complex interplay between genetic variation, diet, microbes and parasites, and our own immune response. Diseases and disorders such as periodontitis, heart disease, allergies, diabetes and irritable bowel syndrome, among others, have a strong evolutionary component directly related to the fact that we live in a very different environment than the one in which our bodies evolved. To better understand these diseases, we need to move past studies of the human genome alone toward a more holistic approach that takes into account human health in the past. But how do we do this, and, most importantly, where can we obtain this information?Skeletons are ubiquitous and preserve for long periods of time. Of course, all of the soft tissues have decomposed. The skeleton alone gives us limited information. Mummies are another option, but they are very limited in number and geographical distribution. In the case of Egyptian mummies, they have had all their internal organs removed. Coprolites, or fossilized human feces, which can be found in dry caves, can provide detailed information about diet and intestinal disease. But they are generally quite rare. Ted.com: Carl Schoonover: How to look inside the brain . To tackle this problem, I put together an international team of researchers in Switzerland, Denmark, and Britain to investigate a largely ignored and little-studied type of fossilized dental plaque that has recently shown promise in microscopy studies. Its technical name is dental calculus, but many people know it by the term, tartar. It is a partially mineralized accretion of bacterial gunk and food debris that build up on teeth over time. At an average dental cleaning you may have about 10-30 mg removed, but in eras before modern dentistry, as much as 600 mg could build up on the teeth over a lifetime. Dental calculus fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton and can persist for tens of thousands of years. It is abundant in eras before dental hygiene, and it is ubiquitous. It is found in every human population, and it is even found among Neanderthals and animals. Previously, microscopy studies had identified all sorts of things entrapped within ancient dental calculus, including plant microfossils (pollen, starches, phytoliths and fibers) and a diverse array of bacterial cells. Our team is taking this research a step further to ask whether we can also recover DNA and proteins that can tell us more about the health status and diets of ancient humans. Ted.com: Louise Leakey digs for humanity's origins . What we have found so far is that we can identify many bacterial species that inhabited the mouth and nasal passages, immunological proteins associated with inflammation and infection, and biomolecular indicators of foods that were consumed. Interestingly, we have also found bacteria that inhabit the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, thereby granting us virtual access to the previously inaccessible and long decomposed respiratory and digestive systems. Thus, the fossilized plaque can tell us about diet, immunity and pathogens not just in the mouth but throughout the body. Ted.com :Alan Russell on regenerating our bodies . By applying advanced DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus, we can begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet, infection and immunity that occurred thousands of years ago. This allows us to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease, right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens, and it can teach us about how pathogens evolve and why they continue to make us sick. Our research is ongoing, and we expect to recover even more health and dietary information as we continue to refine our methodology and investigate a broader range of ancient populations. As final food for thought, I urge you to think twice the next time you brush your teeth. Your mouth is full of valuable information. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christina Warinner.","Christina Warinner: Dental plaque contains valuable information .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Today's technology could extract enough untapped natural gas, frozen in Alaska's North Slope, to heat millions of homes for years, federal officials announced Wednesday. A U.S. Geological Survey study says there is much natural gas to be tapped from frozen areas in Alaska. An estimated 85.4 trillion cubic feet of ""undiscovered, technically recoverable gas"" is frozen in the state's North Slope region, according to a U.S. Geological Survey study released by the Interior Department. The deposits could heat more than 100 million homes for a decade, the study says. ""The assessment points to a truly significant potential for natural gas hydrates to contribute to the energy mix of the United States and the world,"" said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. ""This study also brings us closer to realizing the potential of this clean-burning natural gas resource."" However, the study warned that further research is needed to determine the long-term impacts of the natural gas hydrates -- essentially methane gas trapped in ice. While natural gas is a fossil fuel that emits carbon dioxide, tapping into the gas hydrates assessed in the study is not expected to affect global warming, said Brenda Pierce, coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program. ""There is some near-surface gas hydrate,"" she said Wednesday. But, ""these are fairly deeper and fairly well-buffered by the sediment and strata above."" The natural gas released from the depositing would go straight into a pipeline, not the atmosphere, she said. While the existence of frozen natural gas deposits -- especially in the Arctic region -- has been known for years, the USGS study is the first estimate of recoverable natural gas hydrates with current technology. The North Slope natural gas hydrates make up 11.5 percent of the volume of gas within all other undiscovered, technically recoverable gas resources in the United States -- frozen or not, the USGS estimated. Separately, in August, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the former GOP vice presidential candidate, signed a bill allowing TransCanada Alaska to build a 1,715-mile natural gas pipeline from the North Slope's Prudhoe Bay to Alberta, Canada. During the McCain-Palin campaign, Palin's success in finalizing plans for a gas line was a benchmark that her supporters said represented her ability to work across party lines. In the study released Wednesday, researchers suggest extracting the natural gas hydrates with ""depressurization"" -- a method that involves changing the ice into gas and water at the surface. The study area extends from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska on the west and through the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the east. The latter is a 19 million-acre strip in northeastern Alaska, where oil exploration has long been prohibited by Congress. USGS Director Mark Myers said the gas hydrates research has been going on for more than 25 years. ""This is especially important now that a growing body of evidence indicates that concentrated gas hydrate accumulations ... such as those in Northern Alaska, can be produced with existing technology,"" he said. CNN's Samira Simone contributed to this report.","U.S. Geological Survey study looks at recovering natural gas deposits .

"Taipei, Taiwan (CNN) -- The sweet fragrance of a thousand sticks of burning incense curls into reverent smoke clouds on this lucky night of the new moon. We are inside Taipei's oldest temple, Mengjia Longshan Temple, deeply immersed in the history and traditions of this chaotic, modern city in Taiwan. On the first and 15th night of each lunar month, Buddhists, Taoists and worshipers of the ancient goddess of the sea, Matsu, gather here to pray, bring food and flowers and share the wonders of their faiths. It has been the same here twice a month, almost every month, for 274 years. Immigrants from China's Fujian province built this ornate temple in 1738 during the Qing Dynasty. It has been damaged by earthquakes, storms and war but restored numerous times. It is exquisite. As with many East Asian temples, it has three decorated gates, one inside the next. In the first courtyard is a waterfall, a point of ablution that recalls the water wells outside mosques, the baptismal waters of Christianity and even more ancient, the washing spring at the base of Greece's great Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Carved, richly painted dragons guard the entrances. Inside the main chamber is an explosion of brilliant color. Tonight, there are the people -- hundreds of them, from every section and class of this society. They hold incense between their clasped hands or with their hands open flat and pressed against one another in front of their chest or against their forehead, facing toward an altar or a richly decorated table, bowing and praying. When they are finished, they place the incense into huge gold pots, many decorated with religious figurines. Some set bright candles alight on massive candelabra. The ceilings are rich with gold. On the walls hang signs with ancient poetry. Long tables are filled with food, which those who have brought it later eat to imbibe the blessings the food has absorbed. Everywhere there are flowers, thousands of flowers. Just outside are the teeming streets of Taipei -- the bustle of the Longshan Temple metro station, the chaotic tastes of the Huahsi night market, the strange sights of Snake Alley, and the overwhelming crowds and commercialism of the Ximending shopping district. Beyond the horizon, the mainland's missiles -- said to number in the hundreds -- poised to arrive in just seven minutes. But inside Mengjia Longshan Temple, all that curls away. For the hundreds of believers who gather here, for these few minutes, on this night of luck and wonder, there is just the Path, reverent peace and a connection with history that stays with the visitor long after the next morning dawns. Location: No. 211 Guangzhou Street, Wanhua District, Taipei City . Hours: 6:00 a.m.-10:20 p.m. Admission: Free . Getting there: Driving the circuitous streets of inner-city Taipei is not for the faint-hearted, and parking can be challenge. Instead, take the MTR (subway) to Longshan Temple Station. The temple is across the street. Alternately, take the MTR to Wanhua Station. The temple is about four blocks north.","A visit to Taipei's Longshan Temple on a lucky night provides a cultural window .

"(RollingStone.com) -- For the past 20 years, a large Guns N' Roses poster advertising the band's first tour of England has been hanging in Steven Adler's living room. ""Every time I have to go to the bathroom I have to walk past it,"" says the former Guns N' Roses drummer. ""I'd always see it and say to myself, 'One day we're gonna reunite! We're gonna do it! We're too good of a team not to do this again.'"" When he returned to Los Angeles this past April after Axl Rose's no-show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Adler's attitude started to change. ""Now I walk past it and I say to myself, 'I'm so glad I was a part of that,'"" he says. ""'That was a great and exciting time of my life.' It's nice to appreciate it, but I'm no longer angry and pining for a reunion. I'm not angry about it anymore. It's flushed out of my system."" Right around the time it was becoming clear that Guns N' Roses weren't going to reform at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Adler broke up his band Adler's Appetite. They had spent the past decade touring the world playing a set devoted to Guns N' Roses classics. ""I told the guys I wanted to do something that was relevant,"" he says. ""We played every village around the world. I'm not talking cities or towns. We played every village. It was time to move on."" Adler's Appetite played their final gig on New Year's Eve, and just weeks later, Adler began jamming with singer Jacob Bunton, guitarist Lonny Paul and bassist Johnny Martin. ""It was like God brought them to me,"" says Adler. ""It's just been f***ing magic."" The new group dubbed themselves Adler, and they cut their debut LP, Back From the Dead, in a matter of weeks. Album Premiere: Steven Adler shares joy on 'Back From the Dead' Slash came into the studio at one point to play guitar on ""Just Don't Ask."" ""For me to be a part of Slash's life, I had to get my life together,"" says Adler. ""Slash was proud of me for how I was able to take care of myself. It was so nice to be living in the present with him. The whole thing was like a dream come true."" Adler says he's been sober since 2008. ""I work at it every day,"" he explains. ""I used to wake up in the morning and say, 'Oh, God.' Now I wake up in the morning and look forward to life. I work out every morning with my guitarist."" As viewers of VH1's ""Celebrity Rehab"" and ""Sober House"" well know, Adler's road to recovery was extremely rocky. Many have criticized the Dr. Drew show for being exploitative and, in the wake of the deaths of participants Mike Starr, Jeff Conway and Joey Kovar, wondered whether it should be pulled off the air. Adler has no such feelings. ""It was the best thing I ever did for myself,"" he says. ""Having the treatment on TV made it easier because the camera doesn't lie. You try to bulls**t your way out of things, but then you watch yourself on camera and you see the truth . . . When you're doing drugs you think you're 10 feet tall and beautiful. But you can't be in denial when there's a video camera in your face."" For now, Adler is focused entirely on his new band's first tour. They plan on spending much of the next year playing around the entire globe, and their set will consist almost entirely of new material. ""Out of respect for the fans, we will probably do two Guns N' Roses songs,"" he says. ""We'll probably do 'Sweet Child O'Mine' and 'Mr. Brownstone.' But beyond that it's all about this band, though in certain countries we're gonna have to play more than two. We're going to do some dates with Duff McKagan's band Loaded in South America, but I don't think I'm supposed to talk about that yet."" After the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, Adler voiced tremendous frustration with Axl Rose, calling him an ""a**hole"" and pledged never to talk about him in public again. Now, he says, ""I'm not angry with Axl anymore. I love him and I feel blessed that I got to work with him and achieve what I achieved with him. I guess time does heal all wounds."" Adler also regrets labeling the current lineup of Guns N' Roses ""scabs."" ""I shouldn't have said that,"" he says. ""I've grown up and matured. Holy crap! I've matured in the six months since we last spoke!"" See original story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Steven Adler says life is good for him now .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Iran broke international law by not disclosing sooner its recently revealed uranium enrichment site, the head of the United Nation's nuclear watchdog agency said. IAEA's Mohamed El Baradei says he does not think Iran has an ongoing nuclear weapons program. But the U.N. does not have credible evidence that Iran has an operational nuclear weapons program, Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday. ""Iran has been on the wrong side of the law in so far as to inform the agency at an earlier date,"" ElBaradei told CNN's sister station in India, CNN-IBN. ""Iran was supposed to inform us on the day it was decided to construct the facility. They have not done that."" Still, he said, ""I do not think based on what we see that Iran has an ongoing nuclear weapons program.""  Watch uproar over Iran's nuclear ambitions » . Iran has previously denied breaking the law. ""According to the [IAEA's] current governing rules, there was no urgency in reporting anything about this installation and we could have not announced it, but we did so on order to contribute to trust-building and transparency and we did so much sooner than the required time,"" Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Iranian Atomic Energy Agency, said Sunday. ElBaradei's comments came ahead of an expected meeting Thursday between Iran's nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, and representatives of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members, plus Germany. The meeting is scheduled to take place in Geneva, Switzerland. Last week, Iran wrote a letter to the IAEA revealing the existence of the facility. The admission prompted U.S. President Obama and the leaders of Britain and France to chide the Islamic republic publicly and threaten further sanctions. Iran claims its nuclear enrichment program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses the country of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. The facility is located on a military base near the city of Qom, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Tehran, and is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges, according to the officials and the IAEA. That is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor, but sufficient to manufacture bomb-making material, according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter. Iran has said there is no nuclear material at the site. It announced Tuesday it will allow the IAEA to inspect the facility but did not offer a timetable. ""But we need to go and impress on him that we need to go, our inspector needs to go and inspect the facility and establish the facts, to discuss with them,"" ElBaradei said.","IAEA claims Iran failed to disclose existence of second nuclear facility .

"(CNN) -- Modern technology has made campaigning much easier in some ways. It's now possible to raise millions in small donations through the Internet, host Facebook town halls and galvanize millions of supporters through Twitter. An ad can be released on YouTube and attract enough media coverage to make it worthwhile without spending a dime on TV time. Technology is also a double-edged sword that's made campaigning more complicated. A candidate's every word can now be captured by modern technology and live in e-perpetuity. There is no such thing as wiping the slate clean after the primary. Candidates should be read their Miranda Rights before beginning a campaign. Anything they say can and will be used against them. How can Mitt Romney contend with some of the things he said during the primary campaign which will come back to haunt him in the general election? He needs to gracefully pivot. Nowhere is this more true than in his outreach efforts with Hispanics. Romney cannot Hispander (blatant pandering to Hispanics, usually involving mariachi music and merciless butchering of the Spanish language). He cannot flip-flop on immigration (again). He's fought the flip-flopper label for years, and neither the right that still doesn't entirely trust him nor the left that is salivating to defeat him will let him get away with a drastic change of position. Romney desperately needs to improve his numbers with Latinos. Polls show Romney trailing by as much as an unbelievable 50 percentage points behind President Obama with Hispanic voters. In 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain won 31% of the Latino vote. It cost him states like Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Utah. Unless Romney gets close to 40% of the Latino vote, he can kiss the White House goodbye. Polls also show that immigration is not the most important issue for Latinos. Like other Americans, we are most concerned about the economy. Still, immigration does set a tone. If Latinos perceive a candidate as anti-immigrant, it can turn them off, period. So, what's Romney to do? He can't erase the things he's said on immigration. Despite his campaign's efforts, they can't make supporters (or an adviser) like Kris Kobach disappear, and he is as radioactive as Kryptonite in the Latino community. However, all's not lost. From now until Election Day, when Romney gets asked an immigration question, he needs to start and finish by reminding Latinos that Obama promised, without caveats, to get immigration reform passed in his first year in office. Navarrette: Why Marco Rubio can't save the GOP . For many Latinos, a person's word is sacred. Romney should unequivocally say that Obama broke his word and dramatically increased deportation rates, causing family separation. He should sound angry and indignant about it. Romney needs to go from playing defense to playing offense on immigration. Hispanics are disillusioned with Obama. He too is vulnerable on the issue but only if Romney exploits that weakness. Romney has to remain staunchly anti-amnesty and pro-border security but at the same time sound sympathetic and understanding of the desperation of people who often risk their lives crossing a border so they can put food on their family's table. He needs to talk about the benefits of immigration and how the richness of our diversity has made us a stronger country. If Romney can neutralize the immigration issue by moderating his tone, giving more nuanced answers and taking the offensive against Obama, then he can focus on other issues. Hispanics are an aspirational people. We seek opportunities to provide a better life to our children. Romney should take every chance to remind Latinos that we have been disproportionately affected by the bad economy. As a group, Hispanics have suffered some of the highest unemployment, foreclosure and poverty rates. If Latinos are asked whether they are better off than four years ago, the answer is ""No, seÃ±or."" Romney is also going to have to put the time and resources into Hispanic outreach. If he expects to make up the lost ground, Hispanics cannot be an afterthought. His campaign needs to wake up and go to sleep every night thinking of the Latino vote. They'd be well served to embrace and deploy strong surrogates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Raul Labrador. They speak the language not only literally but culturally. Latinos want to be courted. Obama has accepted speaking invitations to the NALEO and La Raza conferences. Romney needs to do the same, pronto, and he needs to make it count by delivering memorable speeches. Come Election Day, I don't know whether Romney is going to do better with Hispanics than the polls indicate or if Obama is going to do worse. Romney needs a lot of both to happen if he wants to move into la Casa Blanca. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ana Navarro.","Ana Navarro: Polls show Mitt Romney way behind Barack Obama among Latinos .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a new medal Wednesday to honor the families of British service personnel killed while serving their country. The Elizabeth Cross may be given to family members of service personnel who have died since 1948. The Elizabeth Cross will be given to the next of kin of armed forces personnel killed on operations or as a result of terrorism ""as a mark of national recognition for their loss,"" the Defense Ministry said. It is the first time the name of a reigning monarch has been given to a new award since the queen's father, King George VI, instituted the George Cross in 1940. That medal recognizes acts of bravery of both civilians and military personnel. The most prestigious medal, the Victoria Cross, was introduced by Queen Victoria in 1856 for acts of gallantry by the armed forces. ""This seems to me a right and proper way of showing our enduring debt to those who are killed while actively protecting what is most dear to us all,"" the queen said in a message to the armed forces. ""The solemn dignity which we attach to the names of those who have fallen is deeply ingrained in our national character. As a people, we accord this ultimate sacrifice the highest honor and respect."" The Elizabeth Cross is a sterling silver emblem in the shape of a cross over a wreath. In the center is the queen's monogram, EIIR, which stands for Elizabeth II Regina, or Queen Elizabeth II. At each of the four tips of the cross are floral symbols: a rose for England, a thistle for Scotland, a shamrock for Northern Ireland, and a daffodil for Wales. The reverse of the cross will be engraved with the name of the person who died. The name will also be written on a scroll signed by the queen, to be given to family members along with the medal, the Defense Ministry said. The award may be given to family members of all service personnel who have died since 1948. Charles Mosely, the former editor in chief of Debrett's, an authority on etiquette, said the Elizabeth Cross is a good way to recognize the sacrifice made by members of the military and their families. ""It seems very praiseworthy and very overdue,"" he said. It makes sense for the medal to be named after the reigning monarch, he said, because she is head of the armed forces. ""They have personal allegiance to the sovereign, a personal loyalty,"" he said.","Elizabeth Cross for next of kin of armed forces personnel killed on operations .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- For Marco Rubio, life was simpler when it was tea time all the time. When he was gunning for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Florida, the former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives aggressively courted the state's conservative Tea Party activists. That strategy worked. Rubio was suddenly a Tea Party favorite. His stunning rise in the polls forced Florida's more moderate governor, Charlie Crist, to bolt the GOP primary to run as an independent. But the race is now more complicated, with Rubio competing in a three-way battle royal against both Crist and the Democratic nominee, South Florida Rep. Kendrick Meek. Rubio's grass-roots campaign has put together a team of high-powered Washington and Texas-based GOP consultants. Over the summer, this son of Cuban exiles distanced himself from Tea Partiers on one of the conservative movement's key issues, Arizona's tough anti-illegal immigration law. ""The original law allowed for racial profiling. I don't think they intended that. I don't believe they did. But the original language in that law allowed for racial and ethnic profiling. And they changed that, to their credit, a week later. They passed a bill that changed that,"" Rubio said. Still, Rubio doesn't want even the amended Arizona legislation to become the law of the land. ""I don't think the Arizona bill should serve as a model for the rest of the country,"" he added. In an interview with CNN, Rubio blamed both parties for the nation's problems and said he plans to be his own man if elected to the Senate. ""I represent the things I stand for,"" Rubio said. Tea Party activists in Florida still support Rubio. But one of the movement's leaders, South Florida Tea Party Chairman Everett Wilkinson, says he will be watching Rubio's moves closely. ""When you send a politician to Washington, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,"" Wilkinson said. One of the biggest worries among Tea Partiers is that Rubio will be another Scott Brown. The Massachusetts Republican had the backing of the Tea Party in his race to replace the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. But as a senator, Brown has shown his own independent streak and has voted on occasion with the Democrats. Not to fear, says Rubio, who is set to speak at a Tea Party rally in Florida later this month. But the 39-year-old Republican nominee has good reason to consider a move to the political middle in this swing state. Crist's new ads tout the governor as a fresh independent voice, forcing both Rubio and Meek to defend their respective political bases. That's created a fascinating sideshow in this three-ring political circus: an alliance of sorts between the Tea Party-backed Rubio and Meek. Nearly every day, both the Rubio and Meek campaigns send out e-mails blasting Crist. One of Meek's e-mails showcases a recent newspaper editorial in Florida that slammed Crist as a ""campaign chameleon."" ""Charlie Crist is trying to be indefinable in this race. And that has an expiration date on it. And that date has come and passed,"" Meek said in an interview with CNN. Crist declined to be interviewed for this story. ""I think people deserve to know what the next U.S. senator from Florida is going to be about,"" Rubio said. ""The last thing we need in Florida is a political opportunist.""","Marco Rubio's rise in the polls was fueled partly by Tea Party activists .

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden kicks off a two-day swing Wednesday through the eastern edge of the must-win battleground state of Ohio, an area that President Barack Obama is unlikely to visit this election year. And while the vice president apologized to the president last week for seemingly jumping the gun on the issue of same-sex marriage, this trip is an illustration of just how valuable Biden is for Obama as he bids for a second term in the White House. ""As much as political insiders joke about Joe Biden, he's indispensable to the Obama ticket,"" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. According to the Obama re-election campaign, the vice president will travel to Ohio's Mahoning and Ohio valleys ""to highlight the impact of President Obama's efforts to strengthen the region's manufacturing and auto industries, as well as bolster middle-class security for Ohio's workers."" The campaign says Biden will speak at an advanced manufacturing facility in Youngstown and at a Chevrolet dealership in Martins Ferry. The general manger of the dealership, Joe Staffilino II, says he's ""really surprised"" that the vice president is dropping by and that people in the area ""are real excited about the visit."" It's not an area friendly to Obama, said Paul Beck, professor of political science at The Ohio State University. ""These are areas of traditional Democratic strength, steel working areas, areas with a lot of working class Democrats from the old days. President Obama has not played well there,"" Beck explained. Obama was soundly defeated by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton in southeast and eastern Ohio in the Democratic presidential primary in March 2008, and while he won the state by five points over Sen. John McCain in the general election that November, he didn't perform as well in the eastern edge of the state. ""Part of the problem is that these tend to be more conservative Democrats. For some of them his race may be an issue, probably not among the younger ones but among some of the older voters. These tend to be depressed areas, with a lot of job loss over the past couple of decades. There are deeply entrenched pockets of unemployment and economic distress,"" Beck added. Biden grew up in Scranton, in neighboring Pennsylvania, an area that's also witnessed tough times in the past few decades. ""These are places where I think Joe Biden has particular appeal, as a kind of traditional Democrat of the old school. He comes from a part of Pennsylvania that's very much like the eastern part of Ohio. I think he can really connect with voters there in a way which President Obama cannot,"" Beck said. The president's been to Ohio 21 times since taking office. But only two of those trips took him through the state's eastern edge. But it's not just Obama -- presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was edged out by former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania in much of the region in the March GOP primary. Santorum gave his primary night speech in the Ohio River valley city of Steubenville. Beck predicted that Romney will likely not ""be able to connect with (eastern Ohio voters) well either"" ahead of the November election. Which is why Biden may come in so handy in blue-collar areas in eastern Ohio, western and central Pennsylvania, and in parts of Michigan. ""His working-class honesty cuts through all the political bull in Washington. He grounds Obama in the real world. In blue-collar swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, Joe Biden is a tremendous asset to Obama who, at times, makes voters feel like he is president of the elite, for the elite, and by the elite,"" added Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney's 2008 nomination bid, but who stayed neutral in this year's battle for the GOP nomination. Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala agrees. ""Unlike Mitt Romney, Joe Biden can talk to middle-class people without an interpreter. Even though he's traveled the globe and is one of the most powerful people in the world, he's still Joe -- a middle-class guy from Scranton. ""Biden's ability to connect with working families is one of the Obama campaign's greatest assets. I bet they'll be seeing a lot of him in the next six months,"" said Begala, who was a top adviser in the Clinton White House and who now is a senior adviser to Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. But some Republicans disagree about Biden's value to the Democratic ticket.""It speaks to President Obama's vulnerability that the campaign has to rely on Vice President Biden to campaign in key states like Ohio because Obama can't identify with voters. Between his infamous gaffes and his liberal positions on the free market and our nation's debt, having Biden on the stump carries its own set of risks,"" Republican National Committee press secretary Kirsten Kukowski told CNN. Biden's been in the spotlight recently for his comments a week and a half ago on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" that he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with legal same-sex marriages, a position that the president had yet to take. Obama was forced to speed up his timetable on the issue and come out with his own comments approving the unions three days later. Some political pundits said that Biden was a liability to the president, while others pointed to the argument that running mates rarely matter in the race for the White House. ""Sure, people vote for the top of the ticket, but this election will likely turn on who can build an economy for the middle class,"" Begala said. ""If that's the question, Biden is a big part of the answer."" ""If I were Biden, I would keep Obama on my ticket,"" Castellanos said.

"(CNN) -- Gazprom is the world's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas -- and Russia's most powerful company. Gazprom's current chief executive, Alexey Miller. It controls 20 percent of the world's natural gas reserves and operates the world's largest gas distribution network -- approximately 157,000 kilometers of pipelines covering an area from Europe to the Far East, according to its Web site. Gazprom exports energy to 32 countries and provides around 25 percent of the European Union's gas supplies. Last month it reported an 85 percent increase in net profits to $20.8 billion for the first six months of 2008. In 2007 it reported annual profits totaling nearly $61 billion. In 2008 the Financial Times placed it fourth on its list of the world's top 500 corporations, as ranked by market capitalization. Formed in 1989 to replace the Soviet Ministry of the Gas Industry, Gazprom is closely tied to the Russian government, which owns a controlling 50 percent stake in the company. Current Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is a former Gazprom chairman. In recent years, an increasingly confident Moscow has used Gazprom to assert its authority over Russia's former sphere of influence by offering heavily subsidized gas to ex-Soviet countries such as Ukraine and Belarus. But that policy has led to disputes as Gazprom has then sought to raise prices. Gazprom last week switched off gas supplies to Ukraine for the second time in two years in a row over payments and Kiev's rejection of a proposal which would have increased the cost of gas to $250 per 1,000 cubic meter. Instead Gazprom said Ukraine would have to pay the full market rate of $418 dollars per 1,000 cubic meter. Other countries including Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Romania, Greece and Turkey have complained that their gas supplies have also been affected at the height of demand as winter temperatures dip well below freezing in many places.","Russia's Gazprom one of world's most powerful energy companies .

"(CNN) -- Paris Saint-Germain's list of honors are modest compared to the achievements of Europe's top football clubs, but what the French side lacks in history is made up for in ambition. Since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in May 2011, significant steps have been taken, on and off the pitch, to make sure PSG can challenge for major titles -- and new manager Carlo Ancelotti is under no illusions about what is expected of him. ""This club does not have a big history like Milan, like other clubs like Manchester United, like Real Madrid, like Barcelona,"" the 52-year-old, who replaced Antoine Kombouare in December, told CNN. ""The aim is to reach that kind of level."" Formed in 1970 as a merger between Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain, PSG's last Ligue 1 crown -- and only second overall -- came in 1994. Can Qatari cash make PSG a football force? That was followed two years later by a European Cup Winners' Cup triumph but, added to a collection of domestic knockout competition trophies, the haul falls well short of what new PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi expects. Ancelotti has won Europe's top club competition as both player and coach with AC Milan, and is well aware of Al-Khelaifi's vision for PSG and the need for him to deliver Champions League football to the Parc des Princes next season. ""His objective is very clear,"" the former Chelsea manager said. ""To build a good image of the club, to build one of the top clubs in Europe. ""He wants my experience, my knowledge to help the club and the team to improve quickly. He has a fantastic passion for football and he knows everything."" Putting the pride back into PSG . PSG's spending spree so far includes the signing of Argentina playmaker Javier Pastore for a record French transfer fee. The club targeted superstar David Beckham and Argentina forward Carlos Tevez in December and January but both players ended up staying at their respective teams, Los Angeles Galaxy and Manchester City. Milan striker Alexandre Pato was another to turn down PSG's advances, but he and fellow Brazil star Kaka of Real Madrid may yet move to Paris when the transfer window reopens in July. ""In the summer I think the market will be more open,"" Ancelotti said. ""We will have more possibilities as compared to January but I think all the players can come. ""The club tried to reach an agreement with Beckham but I was not here. I was not involved in this thing and I think they were very close; Beckham (said he might) come here but at the end decided to stay in Los Angeles to play with Galaxy. Cash for cups? Qatar's influence . ""Tevez was a different thing because Tevez's first choice was Milan, but he had a problem with Milan. The second choice was PSG but we didn't find an agreement economical with him and we were not able to buy for this reason."" Ancelotti's appointment at PSG has also seen him reunited with Leonardo, who he managed in two separate spells at Milan. Leonardo also spent time working above Ancelotti at the San Siro after being appointed Milan's technical director in 2008. ""I have a good experience because he was my player in Milan and he was my boss in Milan at the same time. So I have a very good relationship,"" the former Italy international said. ""But I think that one of the reasons I am here is because Leonardo knows me very well and knows what kind of a job I can do, so I think when we met for the first time I think we were agreed on everything.""","PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti says the club wants to rival Barcelona and Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- A 6.8-magnitude earthquake  struck Friday off the coast of Alaska, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The Geological Survey initially measured a 7.1-magnitude quake, but later downgraded it slightly. It was 22 miles deep, the Survey reported. The earthquake occurred 120 miles east-southeast of Atka, Alaska, in a sparsely populated part of the Aleutian Islands known as the Fox Islands. The epicenter was 1,030 miles west southwest of Anchorage, the Geological Survey said. It prompted a brief tsunami warning for coastal areas of Alaska, from Unimak Pass, Alaska to Amchitka Pass, Alaska, the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said. That warning was later cancelled. No destructive tsunami happened -- and no tsunami danger exists along the coasts of Alaska, Canada or the U.S. West Coast, the center said. The quake similarly posed no risk of a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. A 7.2-magnitude earthquake occurred in almost the same spot in June, according to the Geological Survey.","NEW: The U.S. Geological Survey now says the quake had a 6.8 magnitude .

"(CNN) -- At 9:40 a.m. on December 14, America's attention was turned to Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were gunned down in an elementary school. The nation was grief-stricken. President Barack Obama arrived two days later operating as consoler-in-chief, and the dialogue immediately commenced on what steps should be taken to prevent another Newtown. Shortly after 9 p.m. on December 27, Chicago police found the body of Nathaniel T. Jackson outside a convenience store, marking the 500th homicide of the year in the Windy City, most of them due to gun violence. As far as I know, no pictures of Jackson were shown on national TV. Flowers and teddy bears didn't populate the scene. His death has largely been ignored by the national media, except for the basic acknowledgment that he represented the city's 500th homicide. Think about this for a moment. Our world stopped in the wake of the Newtown massacre, and rightfully so. Those killed, including the gunman's mother, were innocent victims, gunned down by a madman. But in Chicago alone, residents have experienced the equivalent of 19 Newtowns this year. And we move about our daily lives as if Jackson's murder doesn't mean a thing. It is because of this that I've been angered to watch TV, listen to radio and follow these senseless, emotional and one-dimensional debates about gun control in the United States. Newtown and Aurora and Chicago didn't happen just because of guns. There were conditions that preceded these heinous acts that deserve our attention. Instead, the tragedy has allowed the usual suspects to declaim from one side or the other. It's either pro-Second Amendment or restrict guns. Very little else has broken through to put this gun violence epidemic into the proper context. Opinion: Freedom Group, a gunmaker ripe for an ethical takeover . Dr. Cornel West and Rush Limbaugh sounded stunningly similar notes by suggesting that because the victims of other gun violence didn't look like the Newtown victims, the national media essentially didn't care. I personally know West has tried to address the issue; nothing tells me Limbaugh really cares other than to score a point against ""the liberal media."" That's a reasonable issue to confront and analyze, but it's not the only one. Mental illness has been discussed, but it has been a distant second to the loud voices championing a ban on assault weapons, background checks or closing gun show loopholes. Very few media sources have done extensive reporting on mental illness budgets in their cities and states. Yet we can't examine Newtown without dealing with ""stand your ground"" laws in Florida and other states. We can't say reinstate the assault weapons ban and not talk about whether strict gun control laws actually work. The gun violence issue is multilayered. Access to guns is one thing; what we do with guns is another. We take solace in the FBI saying overall crime is down, but according to GunPolicy.org, 14,159 people were victims of homicide in 2010. It is true that most people who possess guns don't go around shooting people. But the thousands of homicides due to guns should be alarming to anyone, even the most ardent Second Amendment advocate. Opinion: Our dad didn't let evil get the last word . If we are going to keep saying, ""let's have a conversation,"" then by God let's do it. Right now, we are seeing advocates against guns and for guns try to score points and demonize one another. That's not a conversation. It's an exercise in futility. Issues such as education, poverty, income disparities, anger, violent video games and images, and many others must be looked at if we want to come to grips with America's deadly infatuation with guns. Again, not everything is a direct cause. But any psychologist will tell you that a variety of factors lead to someone killing one person or 20. For my media brothers and sisters, we have done a weak job at making this conversation broad and in-depth. We can't give it short shrift and think that a seven-minute panel will do the trick. We can't put so much attention on Newtown and ignore Chicago. It's not just about what happens in Washington, but also in state houses, commissioners' courts and city halls across the land. If we continue at this rate, Newtown will be an afterthought, thus becoming another missed opportunity to address a major epidemic in America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Hundreds of people have been killed by guns this year in Chicago, says Roland Martin .

"(CNN) -- Whenever someone has lived a solid and productive life, the pastor at his or her funeral may turn to Matthew 25:21 to offer a few words the good Lord may utter as the person's spirit ascends to heaven: ""Well done, good and faithful servant!"" In the pantheon of civil rights organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference stands tall as one of the greatest groups ever to advance the cause of civil rights, helping bring the hatred and bigotry of Jim Crow to its knees. From its marches and protests to its negotiations with political and business leaders and its efficient work with other civil rights groups, the SCLC's work has been legendary. Yet 55 years after its co-founding by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it is an organization that makes headlines today more for infighting among members and the revolving door that its top leadership positions have become -- all while crucial social justice issues continue to fester for African-Americans and others. Whether we want to admit it or not, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference has been devoid of a Christian spirit for a long time. It is leading nothing and doing nothing. The fact that I'm writing these words may be painful to civil rights stalwarts (and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity brothers of mine) like longtime activists the Rev. Joseph Lowery and the Rev. C.T. Vivian, but sometimes the truth hurts. On Monday, the SCLC is set to announce that former CEO Charles Steele is returning to helm the organization he served as president from 2004 to 2009. In the four years since he left, the SCLC has gone through four leaders, including the Rev. Bernice King, who, in a strange debacle, was chosen as CEO in 2010, but never assumed the post after a conflict with the board. Her cousin Isaac Farris, a nephew of Dr. King, was chosen to lead the group about a year ago, but he was replaced. In the past several years we have seen split factions among the board, leading to competing board meetings; the doors to the headquarters being chained to keep others out; even arguments at board meetings where some members nearly came to blows. This is nothing but drama, mess, childish antics or whatever you want to call it. It is a severe stain on the life and legacy of King and the many others who stood with him during the darkest hours. When your group is known more for fighting among its leaders than fighting racism, sexism and inequality, you serve no real purpose. One of Steele's accomplishments when he took over the first time was building the organization a national headquarters that the group owned. He did so, debt-free -- but who cares about a building when an organization has no mission and no relevance? Who really cares if the organization's leaders proclaim a desire to be solvent when the SCLC has lost its soul? I've meet Charles Steele and we've had many discussions. He's an honorable man. But the issue here isn't who is the leader. Instead, it's a group of people on the board of directors who aren't leading the group anywhere but further into the grave. I'll be perfectly honest: The SCLC has been persona non grata on the media platforms I have that reach millions of African-Americans. Booking someone from the group on my Sunday morning news show on a black cable network, TV One, or my daily news segment on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, a syndicated radio show with a huge black audience, would be a waste of time. Why am I going to waste valuable time advancing the latest initiative from the SCLC when it's likely to go nowhere due to constant infighting? The list of issues the SCLC could be addressing is vast, from the scourge of inner-city violence that continues to take away another generation of black kids, to a high school dropout rate that is shameful. If the SCLC wants to get back to basics and play a crucial role in the 21st century, Steele is going to have to rid the group of the spirit of dissension that is running through its veins. He is going to have to show a new generation of pastors across the country that aligning with the SCLC has value other than raising their blood pressure. As a Christian, I desire the best outcome for the SCLC. But frankly, I have no faith that the organization has put its past drama behind it.. And until it can prove to me and others that it wants to be taken seriously, the SCLC will be just like the Congress for Racial Equality or the now-defunct Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- groups that had their glory days during a different era, and saw them end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Southern Christian Leadership Conference a towering civil rights group .
But, he says, it's been riven by infighting in recent years that has hurt its ability to do its work .
He says incoming CEO is promising, but squabbling board of directors detracts .

"(CNN) -- Travel warnings from the U.S. Department of State didn't stop Faith Hentschel, 65, from venturing to Iran this May to visit the rustic sites in ancient Persepolis and the colorful bazaars in Tehran. A photo of Khaju Bridge in Isfahan, Iran, taken by an American traveler. ""I had no idea what to expect,"" said Hentschel, who spent two weeks in Iran after booking the trip through a private tour operator and applying for a visa. ""I was stunned with the friendliness of all the Iranian people. That alone makes me want to go back."" Iran is still a relatively rare destination for Americans, creating a niche market for only a handful of tour operators across the nation that organize group trips for travelers once or twice a year. And with news of the arrest of three American backpackers, along with the June election riots and government crackdown, Iran may be an even harder sell, some travel companies said. ""It really depends on the political climate and the perception of Iran,"" said Mike McDonnell, who operates the site BestIranTravel.com in San Francisco, California. The site books trips for non-Iranian travelers interested in visiting. His site saw a decline in booking travel to Iran this summer. ""It's already really hard to get to Iran in the first place."" Officials at the U.S. Department of State say travel warnings have been implemented on Iran since the hostage crisis in 1979, when militants captured 52 American diplomats and staff. The Americans were held for 444 days. Since then, the two countries have had no diplomatic relations. U.S. passports are valid for travel to Iran and visas are required to enter the country, according to the State Department Web site. Going with an organized tour group is the easiest way to attain a visa. Travelers who do visit Iran run the risk of being denied entry, U.S. officials say. In some cases, Iranian officials have prevented American citizens, academics, scientists and journalists from leaving the country, and even detained, interrogated and imprisoned some on unknown or various charges, the Web site said. ""It's made well-known that the destination [Iran] could be perilous for American citizens,"" said Darby Holladay, spokesman at the State Department. Last week, three Americans were detained after crossing into northern Iran during a hiking trip. The two men and one woman, said to be seasoned travelers, began their trip in Turkey and went into Iraq before crossing the unmarked border into Iran. The U.S. State Department and the Australian and British government warn against traveling into the border zones. ""Obviously, we are concerned,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday to reporters. ""We want this matter brought to a resolution as soon as possible."" Mudhafer Mohammed, owner of the Miwan Hotel, told CNN that the hikers said they had come to the area because they heard it was safe. Mohammed said he tried to discourage them from going to Ahmed Awa, a popular tourist destination in the northern Kurdish region of Iraq. ""I told them, 'Don't go there because it is unsafe for you because you're American and Ahmed Awa is very close to the Iranian border,' "" Mohammed told CNN. It is unclear whether the three wandered into Iran accidentally or intentionally entered the country. Pauline Frommer, creator of the Pauline Frommer's Travel Guides, said it's  safer when visiting countries in conflict to use travel companies and tour operators that rely on local accommodations and guides. She warned against staying in big hotel chains, which have been targets in recent terrorist attacks in Indonesia and India. ""When it's an iffy destination, it's always a good idea to try and travel under the radar,"" she said. ""You don't want to be a target."" Despite worries about safety, demand for visiting Iran has grown in recent years. Last May, travel writer Rick Steves shot a 10-day video of his visit to Iran in a one-hour special that launched on PBS. The project cleared up misconceptions about Iran and sparked Americans' interest in traveling there, travel experts said. At Geographic Expeditions, a luxury travel company that organizes trips to Iran, the number of participants doubled from 25 in 2007 to 50 in 2008. Spiekermann Travel Service, Inc., one of the oldest travel agencies that specializes in Iranian travel, has booked more than 350 tours to the country since it began operating there in 1995. ""My path is known,"" said Ihab Zaki, owner of Spiekermann, which is based in Michigan. He said he began offering tours after he visited the country himself and was awed by its history and art. ""We send all our paperwork to local governments and they know we are coming. I don't let my people roam around in the middle of nowhere. It's very safe."" But the recent uncertainty in Iran has caused interest to wane. Spiekermann's bi-annual trips to Iran, limited to 14 travelers, usually sell out. But only four have signed up for the fall trip. Far Horizons Archaeological & Cultural Trips, Inc. in San Anselmo, California planned a second trip to Iran for October after their first trip in May sold out. But owner Mary Dell Lucas said the trip maybe be canceled because travelers are withdrawing. ""What's happening most recently is scaring people,"" she said. ""Those three Americans made a mistake, but with us, it's very different. We are taking a group, and we are invited."" Lucas' firm and other tour companies say they take precautions.  Participants are required to abide by Iranian law, which means women must dress conservatively and cover their heads with scarves. A professor and a local guide, who are familiar with the country, accompany the American travelers. Barbara Bailey, a 73-year-old from rural Ohio, went on a two-week vacation to Iran last April with a tour group. Her favorite part of the trip was talking to the Iranian women at the local restaurants. ""I went because nobody has really been before, and I know they have a wonderful history,"" Bailey said. ""If you can get past the government, the people there are great."" If travelers can't afford to spend between $6,000 and $10,000 on organized excursions of  two or three weeks and decide to backpack, they still need to follow the rules, said Jon Dorn, editor in chief of Backpackers Magazine. ""If you're going to a place that's not like America, then do your homework on what's appropriate,"" said Dorn. Backpackers Magazine, an online and print publication specializing in backpacking, hiking and travel, reaches 2.5 million readers in the U.S. Dave Stevenson, who oversees the Web site www.travel-security-and-safety.com, said hikers should be equipped with GPS systems, satellite or cell phones and maps when traveling in border areas, especially in conflict zones. They should also notify relatives back home where they are hiking abroad. ""The world is a big place,"" Stevenson said, ""And there are always plenty of places to hike that aren't dangerous or war zones."" CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Three American hikers were detained last week by Iranian officials .

"(CNN) -- Who doesn't go a bit giddy at the sight of a castle? The good news is that you don't have to head to Europe for honest-to-goodness castles of the Cinderella variety—we have plenty right here in our own backyard. Railroad barons commissioned most of these estates, but at least one housed a legitimate king and queen (bet you didn't know this country had its own history of royalty!). Each is an engineering wonder in its own right, with some even constructed out of old-world castles that were shipped across the ocean. And each is open to tours should you decide to make a trip (a select few will even let you spend the night). Read this and you might just discover a side of America you never knew existed.

Like a modern-day Frankenstein's castle on Massachusetts's rocky Atlantic shore, Abbadia Mare (Abbey by the Sea) served as both home and laboratory for prolific inventor John Hayes Hammond Jr. after it was completed in 1929. Hammond is largely credited as the ""Father of the Radio Control,"" as in tanks and planes and remote-controlled cars. He was also a lover of medieval art, and the castle was designed to showcase his collection. The building itself is a blend of 15th-, 16th- and 18th-century styles, including a great hall with elaborate rose windows and pipe organ plus a courtyard featuring a two-story meat market/wine merchant's house brought over from southern France.

The goal was to enhance the prestige of modern Hawaii in a kind of Victorian-era keeping up with the Joneses. (The palace had electricity and a telephone even before the White House.) Stone-faced with plenty of koa wood inside, the two-floor American Florentine-style building includes a throne room, grand hall and private suites, including the upstairs room where the queen was imprisoned for five months following the 1895 coup. Today, concerted efforts are underway to find artifacts and furniture (like the king's ebony and gilt bedroom set) that were auctioned off by the post-coup Provisional Government. 364 South King St., Honolulu, HI, 808/522-0832, iolanipalace.org.

Thousands of handcrafted ceramic tiles were inset throughout, including Mercer's own Moravian-style tiles plus Persian, Chinese, Spanish and Dutch productions he collected. Today, the 60-acre Bucks County estate serves as a museum to pre-industrial life, with 900 American and European prints at Fonthill and even more artifacts (like a whale boat and Conestoga wagon) in its sister building, the Mercer Museum, a fun house-like six-story castle in its own right.

"Washington (CNN) -- At the Council on Foreign relations this week, Sen. Marco Rubio talked tough on the international hotspot of the day, Syria. ""It's time to act now. I don't want to score political points on this issue, I want to see it resolved,"" Rubio told Time Magazine's Rick Stengel, the event's moderator. Rubio says he doesn't want to score political points, but like it or not -- every move he makes these days is viewed through one prism: a potential vice presidential pick for Mitt Romney. For many Republicans, Rubio is prime running mate material -- a fresh-faced, telegenic tea party favorite from Florida, a key battleground state. And he is, of course, Hispanic -- a fast-growing ethnic group in the United States, a group Democrats dominated in presidential elections over the past four decades. The impact of the 'Latino vote' beyond Texas . In 2008, only 31% of Latinos voted for Sen. John McCain. Nearly 7 in 10 voted for then-Sen. Barack Obama. The best a GOP presidential candidate has ever done with Hispanics was George W. Bush in 2004, and he got just 44% of the group's vote. A fair number of Republican strategists say that if Romney were to pick a Latino running mate, it could bridge the huge gap. ""Republicans need about 40% of the Hispanic vote to be competitive nationally,"" said GOP strategist Leslie Sanchez. ""To add a candidate who happens to be of Hispanic descent is incredibly important, not only because it shows the party can be inclusive, but open-minded Latino independent voters will really see this is a reason to take a second look at the Republican party."" What Latinos want from candidates? Respect . How about Martinez or Sandoval? Two other Hispanic Republicans who are generating VP buzz are New Mexico Gov. Susanna Martinez and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. Martinez is a gun-toting conservative and the first Latina governor in U.S. history, but she has actually clashed with fellow Hispanics in New Mexico because she wants to reverse a state law allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers licenses. ""Giving licenses to people who are here illegally is wrong and overwhelmingly unpopular,"" Martinez has argued. Sandoval is a budget-cutting, government-shrinking Republican, but he favors abortion rights, which could be a drawback as a GOP running mate. And though he's Latino, he doesn't speak Spanish. Why older Latinos matter in election . Alberto Gonzales, the first Latino U.S. attorney general, says a Hispanic at the top of the ticket may help lure Latino voters, but not a No.2. ""I don't think it would make that much of a difference,"" Gonzales told CNN. Alberto Gonzales: Economic policies will discourage Hispanics, not voter ID laws . Experience is key, Gonzales said. Rubio, Martinez and Sandoval all were elected to their posts a little more than 18 months ago. ""I think Governor Romney is better suited looking for someone to join him on the ticket who could be president on Day One,"" Gonzales said. Still, a Romney source points out to CNN that some states may be so close on Election Day that a Latino running mate could make the difference. It's not just states with well-known Latino populations like New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada that matter. Battleground states such as North Carolina and Virginia, where the Latino populations doubled in the past 10 years, could decide the next president. One enormous challenge in picking a Latino running mate is that Hispanic-Americans are very diverse. Rubio is Cuban-American. Martinez is Mexican-American. In the Latino community -- each poses risks for potential culture clashes. Two-thirds of Hispanics in the United States are of Mexican descent, and a much smaller percentage, about 4%, are Cuban. ""It's very different. It's coming from different countries, different languages. It doesn't mean we're going to be monolithic or vote together,"" said Sanchez, the GOP strategist. Some Latino politicians and strategists argue that Hispanics are a natural constituency for the GOP -- not the Democratic party. Many Latino voters tend to be fiscally and socially conservative, they say. 'Sleeping giant' Latino vote yet to awaken . The need for outreach . Sanchez, like other Republican strategists, said the source of the decades-old GOP problem among Hispanic voters is that the party historically did little to no outreach. That has changed in recent years, but the fight has hampered efforts over immigration reform, which many Hispanic voters perceive as anti-Latino. Romney's stance on illegal immigration during the GOP primary battle turned particularly strident, which Republican Latino strategists worry won't exactly pull voters to the GOP. While GOP Hispanics such as Gonzales and Sanchez disagree over whether a Latino running mate would really help Romney with Latino voters, they do agree it would be, when it comes to inclusiveness, an extremely important gesture. And it may help Republicans with Latinos in the long run. ""If Governor Romney makes a decision that one of the people you mentioned should be with him on the ticket, and if Governor Romney were to win in November, I mean there would be a great deal of pride in the Hispanic community in having that person being in that position,"" said Gonzales.","Beyond Marco Rubio, other Latinos could be Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick .
Govs. Susanna Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada are possibilities .
Republican presidential candidates have historically had bad luck courting Latinos ."
"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, people thought that swarming creatures such as fish, bees and locusts communicated their movements by ""thought transference,"" or telepathy. Thanks in part to the work of Princeton ecologist Iain Couzin, now we know better. Couzin's lab is using computer-vision technology and even the Xbox's motion-sensing camera, called Kinect, to try to get a grip on how these creatures maintain their individually but also function so gracefully as a collective. ""Computer vision has been very important to us. This is where you program a computer to see the world for us,"" he said in an interview last year at PopTech, a science, technology and big-ideas conference held in Camden, Maine. Among the lab's most surprising discoveries: Locusts in the western Sahara Desert swarm because they're trying to not to be eaten by their cannibalistic buddies. ""We just discovered by accident that the locusts were trying to eat each other,"" he said. ""So when it looks like a cooperative swarm, in actual fact it's a selfish, sort of cannibalistic horde. Everyone is trying to eat everyone else and trying to avoid being eaten."" Using tools like Kinect, Couzin's team is able to collect a much more detailed data set about how various organisms behave, which in turn makes it easier to figure out what they're doing and why. What's Next: In Mauritania, sunny with a chance of locusts . All this may be interesting enough in the abstract (Couzin said he's been fascinated by swarming organisms since he was a young boy). But it's also a matter of life and death. Locust swarms are blamed for countless deaths in West African countries including Mauritania, which Couzin visited to conduct some of his research. The swarms buzz across the desert, chewing up all of the crops and vegetation in their paths. On Tuesday, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization said in a news release that locust swarms were threatening pastures and crops in Niger and Mali. Research about how and why the locusts swarm could lead scientists to be able to forecast locust swarms just like they would a weather event such as a tornado or hurricane. ""Why this is important is that we can now build better predictive models and computational models of where swarms may break out,"" Couzin said. ""So that could be very helpful for control measures."" Genetically modified mosquitoes fight dengue fever .","Researcher uses Xbox and computer vision to study swarming behavior .

"Roseville, Michigan (CNN) -- Authorities might find out Tuesday whether a body was buried under a shed in Roseville, Michigan. They just won't know whether it's missing Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa or not. Two soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban Detroit community of Roseville last week after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried on the property a day after Hoffa disappeared in 1975. The samples were taken from beneath a storage shed and sent to a lab at Michigan State University for tests to determine the presence of human remains. The hope had been to get the findings back sometime Monday. But in a press release issued Monday afternoon, Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said he'd been told that, while testing had begun, ""the results of those tests will not be available until early (Tuesday) morning."" What police do know is that the samples that were unearthed didn't contain any ""discernible remains,"" such as bones, body parts or other evidence, according to Berlin. The search of the Roseville property is the latest in an on-again, off-again search for Hoffa, whose disappearance 35 years ago captured the public imagination. Hoffa, then 62, was last seen on July 30, 1975, outside the Detroit-area Machus Red Fox restaurant. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Genovese crime family figure Anthony Provenzano, who was also a chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey. Giacalone died in 1982; Provenzano died in 1988 in prison. The tipster, a former gambler, once did business with a man tied to Giacalone, said Dan Moldea, author of ""The Hoffa Wars."" Moldea said he first spoke to the tipster in March and then sent him to police. Vanished Hoffa still fascinates after almost 40 years . Despite those links, Moldea said it seems unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site, in full view of the neighborhood. And if a body had been buried there, little would remain, he said. The lab tests being conducted on the soil samples will be able to determine if human remains were buried at the site, but will not identify them, Berlin said. If human remains are discovered, investigators would have to return for a more complete excavation, he said. Even so, Berlin doubts any possible human remains discovered at the house would be those of Hoffa. ""It would be great if it was, because I would like to bring closure to his family and the tens of thousands of Teamsters that idolize this man, and just the southeast of Michigan,"" Berlin said. ""This is kind of like an open wound that won't go away. Every couple of years this happens, and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it."" But Berlin said the ""time line doesn't really add up."" Hoffa was of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway. He was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on condition he not attempt to get back into the union movement before 1980. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Police and the FBI have searched for Hoffa intermittently. In September 2001, the FBI found DNA that linked Hoffa to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance. In 2004, authorities removed floorboards from a Detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003. Two years later, the FBI razed a horse barn in Michigan following what it called ""a fairly credible lead."" Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: Tests results on soil samples are expected back Tuesday, a police chief says .

"(CNN) -- When Malala Yousufzai was shot for demanding that Pakistani girls receive an education, the world took notice. But the din from the 15 year-old's assassination attempt by the Taliban resonated perhaps most loudly for people like Nadia Malik, the co-founder of the Global Partnership for Women and Girls. ""After the reality of what happened settled in, it only emphasized how important our mission is,"" Malik said. In January 2012, the Global Partnership for Women and Girls was formed to promote the educational and economic advancement of Muslim women and girls. The fund is a special project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors and has funded pilot projects in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Senegal and the Palestinian territories. Malik's mission with the Global Partnership for Women and Girls is a simple concept with complex realities. The philanthropy supports Muslim women and girls and their communities by investing in strategic and innovative nongovernmental organizations. The fund tries to accomplish this goal in societies where there is no level playing field for women. ""According to data from the Pew Research Center, Muslims represent 22% of the world's population,"" Malik said. ""Yet Muslim-majority countries only contribute 11.2% to global GDP. There are more than 800 million Muslim women and girls in the world who represent an eighth of the world's population, but gender disparities contribute to the gap in global GDP."" But Malik says the Global Partnership for Women and Girls knows that the approach in Muslim societies needs to be sensitive to the local culture in order to work. In Afghanistan, the group partners with the Noor Educational and Capacity Development Organization to train 100 imams and 25 active female leaders to address women's rights across madrassas, or religious schools, in the war-ravaged country. The program is changing the way women are perceived. Malik describes an incident after one of the Friday sermons when an elderly man spoke out, clearly moved by the experience. ""He said, 'I have committed all sorts of violence against my daughters. I have received walwar (bride price) for them. I stopped them from getting an education. I forced their marriages. They are suffering every day because of my wrongs. Why were these imams not talking on these issues before?' "" Malik says that reaction is evidence that the program is working. ""Men are very much a part of the solution. Without engaging men and boys in some aspect of our work, the sustainability of the varied projects could be adversely impacted,"" she said. ""This training effort is an important step in dispelling the myths of human rights in Islam and combating domestic violence."" The project, in partnership with he Noor Educational and Capacity Development Organization, is also a Clinton Global Initiative Commitment. Director Jamila Afghani says the program is its own kind of revolution because religious leaders once known for oppressing women now use the words of the Quran to promote fairness for them. ""These imams then have to work with other imams and preach the issue of women rights during the Jumma Khutbas (Friday sermons) to the public attending the prayers, so by this way we could reach thousands of people both male and female,"" Afghani wrote in an e-mail. A similar project in neighboring Pakistan is also under way. Teacher training in female madrassas in Pakistan was broadened to include subjects such as math, science, history, gender equality, non-violence and human rights. Malik said this project was particularly successful because the local tribal leaders believed in its importance. ""We know how important it is to work within the local communities to address these challenges and opportunities in a way that is non-threatening to their environment. GPWG believes that these challenges are global but the solutions are indeed local,"" Malik said. The fact that these programs are occurring in regions plagued by conflict is not lost on organizers who say the prospect of gender equality promotes peace. ""Peace and prosperity abroad means peace and prosperity for all of us in America,"" Malik said. ""It's in our national interest to invest in women and girls.""","Malala's shooting reinforces program's mission .

"London (CNN) -- Police launched a murder investigation Tuesday after a woman's body was found on Queen Elizabeth II's estate in Sandringham, in the English county of Norfolk. Officers were alerted Sunday by a member of the public who found the remains while walking in the woods by the village of Anmer, near the town of King's Lynn, Norfolk police said. Police said the area had been sealed off while forensic investigations are carried out. An autopsy conducted Tuesday revealed the remains were of a young woman and had been at the site for between one and four months, police said. The pathologist ""believes it is highly unlikely the death was through natural causes,"" the police statement said. ""There is no evidence of accidental injury, damage due to firearms or bladed weapon."" Police should have a DNA profile within the next 24 hours, the statement added. Investigators said they would be looking at cold cases as part of the probe. Sandringham House, at the heart of the 20,000-acre rural estate, is where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas. It's been the private home of four generations of British monarchs since 1862, and is one of two private residences used by the queen. Part of the estate is a 600-acre country park open to the public. A Buckingham Palace spokesman told CNN Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip ""are in residence at Sandringham from mid-December to the end of January. ""It is a private residence, we cannot confirm whether or not the queen has been informed or not,"" the spokesman said, referring to the murder investigation. Prince Philip has been recuperating at Sandringham since he was released from the hospital a week ago after having a coronary stent implanted. He attended a service at the church on the estate Monday. Sandringham House and its gardens are open to the public from April to November. CNN's Alexander Felton and Max Foster contributed to this report.","NEW: Police say the young woman's body has been at the site for between 1 and 4 months .

"(CNN) -- The world now knows that the remains of Richard III -- the final Plantagenet king of England who fell at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 -- were under a parking lot. By most accounts, the dead monarch's corpse was unceremoniously carried back to nearby Leicester and buried at the church of the Greyfriars, where it was lost for more than 500 years. The odds that archaeologists might recover Richard III's remains more than a half millennium later were exceptionally slim. After DNA testing and further analysis, the University of Leicester Archaeological Services was able to confirm beyond a reasonable doubt that the skeleton indeed was that of Richard III. Archaeologists rarely search for individuals, let alone lost monarchs, and the Leicester excavation was focused on analyzing the medieval friary at which Richard III was rumored to be buried. Nevertheless, archaeologists share the popular curiosity about famous personalities and the larger stories their lives and mortal remains might tell. If we are excavating missing people from Richard III's past, then we should start with the remains of the so-called ""Princes in the Tower"" -- that is, his nephews Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury. Richard III: Is this the face that launched 1,000 myths? The princes were held in the Tower of London and likely murdered around 1483 at Richard III's command. Their rumored remains now rest under Westminster Abbey, and a survey of the remains in 1933 found two youth's partial skeletons with a random mix of animal bones. DNA analysis alone is not enough to seal this case, however, and any conclusion would neither incriminate Richard III nor prove his innocence, so such a study would mostly be a public curiosity. Amelia Earhart's plane went down in the Pacific in 1937, unleashing decades of curiosity about the fate of Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan. Earhart has long been viewed as a symbol of bravery and feminism, and after intensive but unsuccessful efforts to locate her in 1937, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery attempted to find Earhart in the late 1980s. Enlisting archaeologist Tom King, a shoe was recovered in a location with circumstantial evidence of Earhart's plane, but nothing substantial has turned up. An interesting archaeological mystery is the disappearance of the Roanoke colony from contemporary North Carolina in 1587. An English crew left the Roanoke colony that August with plans to return the following year, but by the time the English returned in 1590, the settlement was empty. The missing colonists might have been wiped out by indigenous neighbors, captured by those neighbors or joined those native communities. An archaeological investigation by East Carolina University recovered some 16th century material culture, including a ring linked to a colonist. But shoreline erosion removed much of the archaeological evidence associated with the colony. DNA testing has also been conducted with the argument that the colony became part of the neighboring indigenous groups. Nevertheless, there's been no satisfying evidence to resolve precisely what happened to the Roanoke colony. Few historical figures inspire as much curiosity as Genghis Khan, the military leader and empire builder who unified the disparate groups scattered across present-day Mongolia. When he died in 1227, Genghis Khan was buried in an exceptionally well-concealed, unmarked tomb whose location had become a mystery a century later. A 2003 study suggested that nearly 8% of the men living in the former Mongol Empire share a genetic lineage that was likely descended from Khan and his male relatives. Eight centuries later, Khan's lost tomb would shed light on the ritual practices associated with one of history's most powerful empires and its best-known leader. As we continue to be captivated by the dramatic discovery of Richard III's remains, we should keep in mind that it's just one piece of material culture from a complex site that tells a story that will reach well beyond the mere hunt for a monarch's grave. What the excavation reveals about medieval warfare, life among the wealthiest 15th century people and everyday life in a late medieval friary could be even more compelling. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul R. Mullins.","Paul Mullins: The odds of discovering Richard III's remains were exceptionally slim .

"(CNN) -- In the next five years, there are likely to be as many mobile cellular subscriptions as there are people on this planet. By 2020, pundits predict more than 50 billion connected devices. With seven billion people's needs to serve, information and communications technologies (ICTs) represent the single most powerful channel we have ever had to reach out to others, wherever they may live, whatever their circumstances. They also represent our best hope of accelerating progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the target date of 2015. Can Africa reach its 2015 MDGs? If countries embrace the unique power of mobile broadband technology, I believe many have a good chance. The eight MDGs cannot be separated. If you combat disease, you also reduce child mortality; if you give every child a primary education, you promote gender equality. It is because these goals are interlinked that broadband is so important. If we classify the MDGs into three broad areas -- education, health, and the environment -- we see that mobile broadband has a key role to play in each. Read more: Phone journalism gives a voice to India's rural poor . It offers a solution for providing education in under-served areas. Around 90% of children in the developing world are enrolled in primary school, but in some regions -- notably sub-Saharan Africa -- up to 30% of children drop out before their final primary year. Broadband can better engage children, equipping them with valuable ICT skills and opening a window on the world's information resources, in a multitude of languages. Technology can transform healthcare. From simple SMS reminders for vaccinations or anti-retroviral treatments, to grassroots information gathering on demographics and diseases, to mobile information repositories for personal health records, cellphones are becoming a key cornerstone of health programs in a growing number of African countries. Every year, more than half a million women die as a result of complications in pregnancy and childbirth. The tragedy is that the majority of these deaths are preventable -- yet in Africa, fewer than half of all births are attended by a midwife or skilled health worker. While there is no substitute for the physical presence of a healthcare professional, broadband is helping train community field workers, while providing expectant mothers and their extended families with simple advice that protects health -- and lives. The MDG on ensuring environmental sustainability spans a wide range of targets, from the provision of safe drinking water and basic sanitation, to protecting biodiversity and improving the lives of slum-dwellers. In many of these areas, broadband will be a vital link. For example, so-called ""smart"" electricity grids make it easier for locally generated electricity (including from renewable sources) to be integrated, stored and shared as demand fluctuates. Broadband can also help local farmers and fishermen by delivering weather forecasts directly to their mobile phones and providing information on sustainable farming techniques. Read more: Mobiles of future will get under our skin . The way we work is also being changed by broadband. Innovative projects are improving the lives of slum-dwellers -- for example in Kenya -- through providing access to employment and training. Last year at ITU Telecom World 2011, the International Telecommunication Union awarded a prize to a young entrepreneur who developed an education platform for working children, enabling them to use smartphones to improve their literacy, numeracy and general knowledge while they travel to work on public transport vehicles equipped with low-cost WiFi repeaters. Broadband gives small businesses the opportunity to broaden their customer base and reduce their overheads through e-commerce platforms. And it will support advanced financial services for consumers, building on the outstanding success of the mPesa mobile banking model, an excellent example of innovation coming directly out of Africa to solve African problems. The eighth and final MDG is ""developing a global partnership for development."" It is, perhaps, the most fundamental of all the goals, because it enables progress towards all the other goals. Developing such a partnership is a basic element of our work at ITU. Because we understand the incredible potential of broadband, we launched the Broadband Commission for Digital Development to help move broadband to the top of the political agenda. This multi-stakeholder commission comprises over 50 top-level global leaders, and has defined a vision for accelerating the deployment of broadband networks worldwide. It has also established four critical targets that we believe all countries should to strive to attain by 2015: . Target 1: Making broadband policy universal. By 2015, all countries should have a national broadband plan or strategy or include broadband in their universal access/service definitions. Target 2: Making broadband affordable. By 2015, entry-level broadband services should cost less than 5% of average monthly income. Target 3: Connecting homes to broadband. By 2015, 40% of households in developing countries should have internet access. Target 4: Getting people online. By 2015, internet user penetration should reach 60% worldwide, 50% in developing countries and 15% in least-developed countries. We have only three years to go. But it is highly significant that among all the MDG targets the most advanced is the one involving ICTs. Let's capitalize on that and use Africa's near-ubiquitous mobile coverage to break old infrastructure bottlenecks and short-circuit the traditional development cycle. Ubiquitous mobile broadband is a big idea whose time has come.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Manchester United and Liverpool fans dream of the arrival of superstar players ahead of a new campaign, but it seems the spending power of both Englsih giants could be on the wane. Liverpool co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks took over the club in February 2007 . Both Rafa Benitez and Alex Ferguson have bemoaned the extravagance of the transfer market recently, with the United boss even going so far as to suggest he will not make anymore signings despite the transfer window remaining open until August 31. This despite having recently recouped a world record fee of $130m for the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo from Old Trafford. So what are the reasons behind the new culture of prudence at the top of the English Premier League? Well, it seems the cost of refinancing debt could significantly have curbed both clubs' spending power according to industry experts. Financial prudence will be the watchword for the majority of the English Premier League in the transfer market as clubs look to consolidate their financial position in a move that could see a shift of power in Europe to Spain's La Liga. It seems the Glazer family owners of United will not sanction anywhere near that amount of previous seasons for new players according to Professor Rogan Taylor at the University of Liverpool's Football Industry Group. How do you feel about United and Liverpool's debt situation? Sound Off below . The Americans' takeover of the Red Devils placed the club in $1.1 billion of debt, according to the holding companies' accounts of 2009; a situation that requires careful management. ""The refinancing at Manchester United is structured in a very complex way but ultimately the economic difficulties now mean that there will be a reduction in Alex Ferguson's transfer budget,"" he told CNN. ""Although some of the funds from the Ronaldo transfer will go back into the club's coffers there will be a tightening of the purse strings which will seriously impact on United's capacity to go after the top players. ""Certainly, Ferguson would have wanted a top-class replacement for Ronaldo but with the need to keep the debt in order and -- being unable to compete with Real Madrid and Manchester City -- the funds available and the pool of players from which they can sign is a lot smaller.""  Liverpool's situation is even more acute as American co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks, through their company Kop Holdings, struggle to secure the finances to fund the club's proposed new stadium. A deal to refinance their $570m Royal Bank of Scotland loan appears to have been secured, but the long-term sustainability of the idea used to purchase Liverpool is serious under question. Professor Taylor added: ""The whole model on which Hicks and Gillett bought Liverpool is flawed and Rafael Benitez may have to sell Javier Mascherano or Xabi Alonso before he can go out and spend during the close season. ""Even then there is no certainty he will get the whole amount from the sale of either of those players back in the transfer kitty so it promises to be a difficult period for Liverpool as obviously expectation has been raised following last season's second-place finish. ""The need to refinance the debt remains key to the American owners remaining in control of the club so that will be their priority -- at the expense of matters on the pitch."" Jon Keen deputy chairman of the Football Supporters Federation, and an expert in the field of club governance and ownership, admitted the situation at both clubs will stir up further resentment among fans towards their owners. ""The current refinancing situation in the top-flight is like a financial house cards which could come crashing down at any time,"" he told CNN. ""We have already seen a situation unravel with the banking system which has angered a lot of people and something similar could well happen with football in the near future. ""Ultimately fans want to see money raised from sales of players either put back into the transfer pot or levied against their own costs of attending matches, not simply servicing huge amounts of debt as is the case with Manchester United and Liverpool at the moment. ""There needs to be a reality check about the way these clubs are operating. Certainly, I think the current economic climate will drastically reduce the spending power of clubs in the Premier League with the exception perhaps of Manchester City."" Of course, this contrasts with Spain's Real Madrid who have recently splashed almost $300m on Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema -- and are not finished yet if president Florentino Perez is to be believed. The construction magnate and his powerful board are able to wield influence with banks and allow Real to secure credit on favorable terms which, combined with a lucrative domestic television rights deal, puts them in a stronger financial position. Ultimately this appears to have precipitated a shift away from the English Premier League to La Liga for the world's best players as Spain becomes the preferred destination of choice. Whether Real can convert this into a challenge to the recent English domination of the UEFA Champions League on the pitch remains to be seen.","Refinancing has left Manchester United and Liverpool short of transfer funds .

"(CNN) -- Some of the most iconic films ever made have used the ocean as their backdrop. Whether it's to highlight the romance of a moment, the isolation felt by characters or intense drama, filmmakers often turn to the seaside to help illustrate their story. Here is a list of some of the best seaside locations featured on the silver screen. THAILAND -- ""THE BEACH"" Leonardo Dicaprio's character goes on a journey to find a secret idyllic Thai beach, where a sort of utopian society exists. For this filmmakers searched for paradise, eventually finding it near Phuket on the main beach of Phi Phi Leh Island, Hat Maya. Environmentalists voiced their opposition to using the beach during filming following concerns the area would be damaged. However production went ahead and since the release of ""The Beach"" Phi Phi Leh island has become a popular tourist destination for travelers wanting to experience utopia too. ITALY -- ""THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY"" Positano was used as the inspiration for the fictional port of Mongibello in ""The Talented Mr Ripley"". The stunning seaside town is set in the cliffs of Italy's Amalfi Coast and provided the stylish surroundings for the film, starring some of Hollywood's biggest names including Cate Blanchett, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law. Just a few hours south of Rome, Positano attracts Europe's rich and famous, eager to enjoy its fine dining restaurants and top hotels. HAWAII -- ""BLUE HAWAII"" Elvis Presley was no stranger to Hawaii. Three of his films were shot on the islands, none more famous or successful than the 1961 hit ""Blue Hawaii"". Set in the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Kauai, the film highlighted the beauty of the area, with Presley playing a former Army officer-turned tour guide in the musical. SPAIN -- ""DIE ANOTHER DAY"" It's one of the most iconic scenes of the modern James Bond franchise: a bikini-clad Halle Berry emerges out of the water, meeting 007 himself. The encounter is set in Cuba however makers of ""Die Another Day"" in fact shot the scene in CÃ¡diz, Spain. The historical coastal city is one of the oldest settlements in Western Europe. JAMAICA -- ""THE BLUE LAGOON"" ""The Blue Lagoon"" was shot in Port Antonino, Jamaica and on the privately owned island, Nanuya Levu, in Fiji in the South Pacific. The film tells the story of a young girl and boy being marooned on a desert island. It caused controversy at the time because of nude scenes which featured a teenage Brooke Shields.","Environmentalists were worried Thai beach Phi Phi Leh would be damaged during filming of ""The Beach""

"(CNN) -- Senegalese-born Marieme Jamme is at the forefront of the technology revolution that is slowly transforming Africa. As chief executive of Spot One Global Solutions, a UK-based company that helps information technology organizations gain a foothold in emerging markets, she encourages global investment in African IT infrastructure. Armed with a strong desire to help Africa realize its potential, Jamme is outspoken about what the continent needs and how she can help. ""I bring the skills to make sure they understand the only way we can develop our continent is to just be normal and to be who we are and work very hard rather than just putting all this power behind it and hiding behind powers, because it doesn't make any sense,"" she says. See also: 10 African tech voices to follow on Twitter . Jamme is also a regular international speaker, a blogger and the co-founder of Africa Gathering, a global platform that brings together entrepreneurs and experts to exchange ideas about Africa's development -- all part of her efforts to keep the African narrative relevant and positive. ""I kind of like protect Africa when people talk bad about the continent,"" Jamme says. ""I try to bring good narratives about Africa now because I see something different in the continent."" Born in Senegal into privilege, Jamme describes herself as a ""lost girl"" while growing up. A rebellious spirit, she wanted to succeed in life relying solely on her efforts and not on her family's connections. ""I am a rebel, because I had to completely dismiss my identity. I had to refuse my status as an aristocrat to be just a normal person, because I didn't believe in that,"" she says. In 1992, she moved to France after her father's death. There, she worked in restaurants and took on cleaning jobs to fund her studies. ""I fought all the way to be where I am today,"" she says. ""I was very eager to go and find my own identity -- I was very interested in technology and that's what I wanted to do, so that's where I am."" See also: Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . Passionate about Africa and technology, Jamme has found it necessary to set up base outside her continent, making England her new home today. She says she can achieve more by not living in Africa where gender barriers still hamper many women from realizing their potential. ""I'm free in London, I can make decisions,"" she says. ""I go to Africa twice a month, so I'm very aware of what's happening in the continent...but I think as an African woman, as a Senegalese-born, if I wanted to make an impact in my continent I have to have a freedom to do that. I have to have a freedom to write. I have to have a freedom to talk, to speak, to mention what's happening in my continent."" See also: Africa's 'father of technology' on sparking a tech revolution . In recent years, a rise in the usage of mobile phones coupled with the emergence of a thriving tech scene, has helped to improve lives and bring people together across Africa. While Jamme praises the power of technology, she is also quick to sound a note of caution. ""I think now we really need to be cautious on how mobile phone is affecting the continent right now and really make sure we scrutinize all these big organizations going into Africa,"" she says. ""And we need to be careful in Africa, because Africa now is a destination for investment. People are interested in the continent -- 10 years when I used to talk about Africa nobody cares about it, but now everybody want to get into the continent because it's booming."" Underwater cables bring faster internet to West Africa . For Jamme, the critical issue is to make sure that the continent's young population gets good education so that they can find jobs and create opportunities that will make the most out of this technology boom. ""We need to make sure there's a way of building, having infrastructures in Africa, making sure the youth are getting educated,"" she says. Read more: In numbers: The life of an African child . For the last five years, Jamme has also started mentoring young Africans, helping them to set up their businesses and teaching them how to strategize and sell their ideas. She says she finds great satisfaction in being able to help her continent by shaping the lives of young people and giving them the confidence to compete on the global stage. ""I'm very proud I've got an identity as an African woman and I think my voice is being listened around the world,"" she says. ""The very simple thing we do is changing the continent. I think now we're influencing governments in Africa, we're working with many organizations to reshape the narratives about Africa.

"(CNN) -- It was an ordinary day just before Halloween. I had arrived home after picking up my 3-year-old daughter from school when I heard my phone ringing. I missed the first call from my father-in-law. He called right back. I knew what he was calling about. I took the phone to my wife, Sara, and let her take the call. About 10 seconds into the conversation, she crumbled into a heap on the floor. Fighting cancer with mustaches . The test results were back. My father-in-law had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. We had feared this was going to come. He had shown some worrisome symptoms for a while, but nothing really prepares you for that moment. We cried, and I supported my wife the best I could. We talked about how we could help, being that we live in Atlanta and my in-laws live just outside Chicago. Would we move? Would we take time off from work? Would we pay for a nurse to help him recover? What will his treatment be? How will it affect him? Will it make him better? A few hours after being introduced to my father-in-law almost six years ago, I joined his family in riding in Chicago Critical Mass. Several thousand fellow cyclists had taken to rush hour in downtown Chicago to demonstrate that ""we are traffic, too."" The cops shut the event down after a while. There I was, looking at the man who I knew would be my father-in-law, lifting his bicycle above his head, shouting ""F*** the police!"" I loved him instantly. The one thing I do know about his diagnosis: We will approach it with the same bluntness, energy and ""stick-it-to-the-man"" mentality that he has taken to every other challenge he's had. He is due to have surgery soon, and the prognosis looks hopeful. I know this attitude will stand him in good stead for a full recovery. When we got that fateful phone call, I realized that we were only a couple of days away from Movember, the month when ""Mo-Bros"" everywhere join forces to grow ridiculous-looking mustaches in the name of raising awareness and funds for men's health issues, specifically prostate and testicular cancer initiatives. It was a concept that seemed to fit perfectly. So I rummaged around the bathroom drawer for my long-lost razor. The last time I was completely bereft of facial hair was the night my daughter was born nearly four years ago. We were living in Amsterdam at the time, and after 24 hours or so at the hospital, we were the proud parents of a 6-pound baby girl. As my wife and our new bundle of joy slept, I rushed home to collect clothes for Sara and other sundries that had been forgotten in the rush to the hospital. I thought I would do the decent thing and clean myself up a bit before returning to the hospital in the morning. A shower and a shave, I thought. But I was so tired at that point that I didn't realize I had left the guard off my electric razor. Beard ... gone. I didn't recognize the person underneath. I've had facial hair ever since, and it really felt strange to shave it off again for Movember. It made me think about that night at the hospital and reminded me of the new sense of responsibility I felt to my daughter and wife. This time, that sense of responsibility comes from a different place. This time I feel an obligation to stand with my father-in-law, to support and honor him in the best and only way I know how. When people stop me at work and ask me why I shaved my beard off, I have a great excuse to talk about him and the type of man he is. It never fails to give me a spring in my step and a great sense of confidence, purpose and camaraderie. Ultimately, I think that's what Movember is all about.","Stewart Scott-Curran: Movember is a conversation starter about men's health .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- The name of the Facebook page matches the personality of its administrator: Courage for Tamaulipas. Tamaulipas is the northeastern Mexican state that borders Texas, a diverse place whose reputation is overshadowed by violence carried out by rival drug cartels. Under threats from the drug gangs, many media outlets make the choice to self-censor and not cover the violence. But reporting violence is precisely what Courage for Tamaulipas does. The Facebook page, which has reported on the region's violence for more than a year, will remain active despite a bounty put on the administrator, presumably by a cartel. In an interview with CNNMexico, the blogger says he will continue to post complaints, even though there is now a price for uncovering his identity: 600,000 pesos, or about $46,000. The threat surfaced in recent weeks with fliers offering a reward for information on the identity of the administrator or his family. ""I think what is happening to me is the least relevant thing that is happening in my state,"" the blogger said. ""There are hundreds of families waiting for their missing ones, who at their moment of filing complaints were filled with fear by authorities who told them to assume they are dead."" Tamaulipas has one of the highest levels of violence in Mexico. It is among the states with the highest levels of homicide, extortion and kidnapping, according to official statistics. ""The criminals truly think that they are in the right and that everyone else should obey them,"" the blogger said. ""They think that crime is a job and causing damage is a right."" Criminals lower their profile . The violence in Tamaulipas persists, despite the reduction in the intensity of shootouts between groups, the administrator said. ""(Organized crime) has only lowered its profile. It carries out its activities like always, kidnapping, executing, disappearing people, terrorizing,"" he said. ""What has declined in the past years are the illegal roadblocks and the very large shootouts, but the criminal control remains the same, or stronger."" The administration of former President Felipe Calderon, who left office in 2012, attributed the violence in Tamaulipas to a turf war between the Gulf cartel and the Zetas cartel over control of drug smuggling routes to the United States. To combat them, in 2010 he launched an operation that sent additional security forces to Tamaulipas and the neighboring Nuevo Leon state. The threat . The offers of reward money in exchange for information about Courage for Tamaulipas first surfaced between February 8 and 10. During those days, anonymous fliers began to circulate in Ciudad Victoria -- the capital -- and the border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo. The administrator published a photo of one of the fliers and affirmed that he would not be stopped because the public values his work. ""As long as I have collaborators, even if it is only one person, I will continue doing what is in my reach to provide evidence of the situation we are living,"" he said. The government's response . It was not until this week that the blogger received support from local and federal authorities, though some officials had expressed their support for him individually. The state general attorney's office said it does not have any information about the fliers threatening Courage for Tamaulipas. The agency added that it does not have a protocol for protecting residents in situations like this because it is the first of its kind. The precedents . A survey by Freedom House of Mexican journalists and bloggers showed that 96% of respondents know a colleague who has been attacked. The organization surveyed 102 journalists in 20 Mexican states. Freedom House published a report, Digital and Mobile Security for Mexican Journalists and Bloggers, which cites a September 2011 incident where two people were found hanging from a bridge in Nuevo Laredo. ""A message left near the bodies warned that the same thing could happen to any internet user who crossed that criminal organization. Those murders were followed by the killing of a journalist using the nickname ""la Nena de Laredo"" who had posted entries against criminal activity on Nuevo Laredo en Vivo, a social media forum,"" the report said. Following these crimes, the administrator of Courage for Tamaulipas published a message condemning the incidents and affirming that ""innumerable"" citizens continue to resist against organized crime's grip.","Fliers offer a reward for information on the identify of a Mexican blogger .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- The ability to work inside a fish tank is not high on most people's wish lists when it comes to buying a new smartphone. But at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, several major manufacturers were putting the waterproof credentials of their devices ahead of more conventional selling points such as processor power. While some handset manufacturers are looking at more effective rubber seals to protect devices for unexpected dunks and spills, high-tech companies are also springing up offering nano-coating technology as alternative protection. Liquipel, based in southern California, announced at Mobile World Congress that it was expanding its operations to Australia, Brazil and China. The company encourages mobile owners to send their devices through the post so they can be coated with what it describes as a ""revolutionary water shield."" Company President Danny McPhail said: ""You won't want to go swimming with it, but in the event it does come into contact with water, you'll be protected. ""Talking in the rain, texting in the shower, and playing Angry Birds in the shower is all possible."" He said devices are placed into a machine which draws in the proprietary liquid formulation as a dry vapor, coating the device inside and out. British company P2i, a few stands away at Mobile World Congress, uses a similar process, but works directly with manufacturers, rather than consumers. Read more: Phones poised to replace money . Its technology was originally developed by Britain's Ministry of Defence to help protect soldiers from both rain and chemical attack.

Dr Steven Coulsen, chief technology officer for P2i, said: ""this is fast becoming a must-have technology. People expect to have this protection when they buy a device off the shelf.""

Panasonic was also using the waterproof credentials of its new Eluga smartphone as a major selling point at Mobile World Congress. Meanwhile, at the other end of the technology scale, South Korean company DiCAPac was in Barcelona looking for distributors for its colorful, low-tech plastic phone cases. Spokesman Myeonghwan Yeom said: ""Not every manufacturer has waterproof phones, and this is so easy to use. It means you can take your phone to the beach or water park and continue taking photos. ""You can also take photos under water, and none of the major phone manufacturers have worked out how to do that yet.""","Waterproof phones generate interest at mobile phone expo in Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- A cache of e-mails leaked to CNN is giving extraordinary insight into the life of Syria's first family during the regime's move to crush a now-yearlong civilian uprising. The e-mails were obtained by CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" from a source in the region after the e-mail accounts were hacked. They appear to shed light on a family often occupied with YouTube videos and shopping while the brutal crackdown continued, and they also apparently reveal some of Iran's influence over Syria's president. Just before Bashar al-Assad delivered a speech January 10, an aide apparently e-mailed him, saying a political adviser to the Iranian ambassador was encouraging al-Assad to use ""strong and violent"" language. In that speech, al-Assad then promised to strike the opposition with an ""iron fist."" There are also e-mails from a man named Hosein Mortada, who -- according to his Facebook page -- is the Damascus bureau chief for two Iranian news networks. Mortada twice offers advice to the president's aide, who passes it on to al-Assad. On Christmas Eve, Mortada apparently wrote to an al-Assad aide that al Qaeda should not be blamed for a recent attack. ""I even received calls from Iran and Hezbollah, being the director of several Iranian and Lebanese channels, and they advised me NOT to even mention al Qaeda being behind the incident ... because this would be a serious tactical media error,"" Mortada wrote, according to the e-mail. December 24 was the day Syrian troops began their onslaught on the Baba Amr neighborhood in Homs, according to activists. The next day, an apparent e-mail from Mortada said his ""friends"" in the city reported armed people in front of every door were threatening residents and forcing them to protest. The next day, with Arab League monitors on the ground in Syria, Mortada apparently e-mailed the same aide that Syrian supporters needed to make sure opposition members did not turn out in large numbers in public. ""We need to take control of public squares during this period,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, groups affiliated with us will fill the squares ... so we don't leave them open for others, since the opposition is getting ready to move with the presence of the monitors. In this case, we will block their way and (prevent them) from reaching any square."" CNN has tried to reach Mortada to ask about the authenticity of the e-mails but so far has received no response. However, Iran's state-run Press TV reported Mortada denied the correspondence, and accused Western media of making up the story. ""I am only a journalist and head of Press TV and al-Alam news channels offices in Damascus,"" he was quoted as saying. The monitors stayed in Syria for several weeks, visiting various cities and towns as they tried to assess whether the government was upholding its commitment to end the crackdown. Shortly after the monitors' arrival in late December, an apparently amused al-Assad sent one of his closest advisers a YouTube video that mocked a theory the regime had hidden tanks during the monitors' visit. ""Check out this video on YouTube,"" al-Assad wrote on December 29, according to the e-mail. The reply in English: ""Hahahahahahaha, OMG!!! This is amazing!"" Some of the most interesting insights in the al-Assad e-mails are personal. In November, as the Syrian military ramped up its attack on Homs, first lady Asma al-Assad seemed more concerned with the latest ""Harry Potter"" DVD, apparently asking a friend to bring the movie when she comes for a visit. The first lady in the past year also seems to have spent much of her time online shopping for expensive jewelry, art, and furniture, and e-mailing boutiques in London and Paris. In one e-mail exchange with an art dealer in London, Asma al-Assad, apparently using a false name, inquires about six artworks that all feature butterflies. The dealer responds that the works cost between Â£5,000 and Â£10,500 ($7,800 and $16,500). The art inquiry was sent October 28, the same day Syrian protesters staged a massive demonstration in the city of Hama, in which they called for an end to al-Assad's rule. On February 3 -- the same day opposition activists reported more than 200 killed in the ""Homs massacre,"" and a day before the U.N. Security Council was scheduled to meet on Syria -- the first lady apparently e-mails a friend asking whether she should reserve Christian Louboutin shoes costing as much as $7,000 a pair. ""These are really iconic pieces for Spring and some fabulous styles,"" the e-mail says. Two days later, mortars and rockets rained down on Homs after the Security Council failed to pass a resolution aimed at stemming the violence. That same day, President al-Assad apparently e-mailed his wife the lyrics and audio file to a song by U.S. country singer Blake Shelton with the words, ""God gave me you for the ups and downs/God gave me you for the days of doubt."" One of al-Assad's advisers apparently sent an e-mail containing a picture of a woman wearing only a G-string and a bra. Other e-mails contain suggestions for al-Assad's speeches and indicate further influence by Iran. Al-Assad should use ""emotional"" language about pro-Syrian ""martyrs,"" wrote a female aide named Hadeel, who said she consulted with a number of people, including a political adviser to the Iranian ambassador. He should ""send a huge invitation to the families of the martyrs so it seems like a celebration,"" the e-mail said, and ""have one of the widows of the martyrs make a strong statement on behalf of the families."" In a December 1 e-mail, Hadeel urged al-Assad to use tough language in his speeches. ""Threaten Israel and show our power as a country and a people in case our security is threatened (standing in the face of anyone who wants evil for Syria -- pointing ... at our real enemy),"" she writes. ""Just like you said in your first speech, if a war is imposed on us, we welcome it."" She said al-Assad looked good in a military uniform during a speech and signed off by saying, ""I am going to the movies."" One e-mail claims to have duped CNN into reporting the words of a fake pro-Syrian commentator. The woman says she created a fake username on Facebook and wrote a commentary that she said later appeared on the air. An e-mail sent by the president to himself contains talking points for an interview he gave to Barbara Walters on the U.S. TV network ABC in early December. He sent the e-mail January 17; there is no information on who sent the original message or why he re-sent it weeks later. Al-Assad was to briefly mention government reforms, the e-mail said, but not go into detail because ""Americans are too stupid to understand details."" ""It would be worth mentioning how ur personality has been attacked and praised in the last decade according to the media,"" goes the e-mail, written in English. ""At one point u were viewed as a hero and in other times u were the 'bad guy.' Americans love these kinds of things and get convinced by it."" Whoever wrote the e-mail ended by saying, ""Thank you. U are amazing!"" More fawning from his al-Assad's inner circle came in another e-mail, with the sender writing in English, ""I never met an amazing person like u... i get so proud when people meet u and go tell the world how amazing ur. Miss u."" Amid the violence, it appears not even close friends could persuade al-Assad to step down. ""It seems like its getting worse rather than better -- is that the case, or is it the media? What is the long-term plan?"" wrote the daughter of Qatar's emir to the first lady, according to an e-mail from August. ""It seems like there needs to be an exit strategy."" She made a similar suggestion later that month. ""From what I see there's so many innocent lives being lost. There's still an opportunity for transfer of power, transition without risking a lot,"" she wrote, according to the e-mail. ""It's a natural time to address the nation with the intention of stepping down. The lives lost cannot be retrieved, but there's still a chance to keep a positive image."" Months later, she suggested exile in Doha. Journalist Samya Ayish and CNN's Tracy Doueiry, Salma Abdelaziz, Saad Abedine, Hamdi Alkhshali, Yasmin Amir, Roba Alhenawi and John Vause contributed to this report.","The e-mails were leaked to CNN by a source in the region .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to negotiating with the Taliban, it's always one step forward, two steps back. Despite several serious rounds of violence this week, including the assassination of a top peace negotiator, the United States will continue to try to negotiate with the Taliban, experts say. Afghanistan has been violent for a long time, they argue. This week just brought more of the same. ""[The United States] has been fighting for nearly 11 years, and we've already said we're not leaving until 2014,"" said C. Christine Fair, a Georgetown University Center for Peace and Security Studies professor who has worked in and studied the region for years. ""Talking is not only our best option, it's our only option,"" she said. ""We should expect that it will be accompanied by violence."" The peace process has come in fits and bursts over the past year. When former Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced last June that the U.S. was in preliminary talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan, the idea was controversial. Many observers were skeptical that the Taliban would ever deal. Since then, the concept of negotiations has become more and more the norm. President Barack Obama touted it in his recent surprise visit to Afghanistan on the one-year anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden. Yet months into the talks, it's murky as to who is involved and what, exactly, each party wants. In March, the Taliban said it would not be setting up a diplomatic office in Qatar to negotiate with Americans, blaming their decision on the United States' ""alternating and ever-changing position"" on Afghanistan. At the time, preliminary talks with what the Taliban called ""the occupying enemy"" had already begun over the exchange of prisoners, the group said. Assassinated on the way to work . Observers remind that the peace process is still relatively new considering the protracted war, and all new and difficult enterprises have bumps in the road. In Afghanistan, that cliche is relative. There ""weren't great hopes right now for peace talks at the moment in any case,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution who specializes in defense and foreign policy. On Sunday, Taliban interlocutor Moulavi Arsala Rahmani was killed when a gunman drove up to his car while Rahmani was stuck in traffic on his way to work in Kabul. He was a member of the High Peace Council, which was created by President Hamid Karzai and heartily endorsed by the Pentagon. The HPC is tasked with reaching out to insurgents and ex-Taliban who live in Kabul under government protection. Rahmani was considered a moderate Taliban, someone who could bring other Taliban members to the negotiating table. The Taliban announced recently that peace council members would be targets of its spring offensive, but a Taliban spokesman said Sunday that the group did not kill Rahmani. Regardless, his death marked the second such high-level negotiator to be killed since last fall when HPC Chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghan president, was killed in a suicide bombing. The biggest danger Rahmani's assassination might have, O'Hanlon said, would be to scare future Taliban defectors from talking with the West and allies, he said. Riaz Mohammad Khan, the former foreign secretary of Pakistan, agrees. ""These things are unfortunate but can be expected,"" he said. ""On the more positive side, I don't think recent violence suggests a strength in the Taliban forces. I think we'll come understand what is happening in Afghanistan as reflective of their weakness. It gives the Afghan people a chance also to show that they won't be beaten down. It gives them a chance to stick with peace talks."" More ""green on blue"" killings . Violence this week went beyond Rahmani's death. A blast at a crowded market in northern Afghanistan killed nine civilians on Monday. Two more NATO troops were also killed over the weekend, bringing the total NATO death toll to eight in just a few days time. The two troops killed Sunday are believed to be victims of so-called ""green on blue"" attacks in which Afghan security forces turn on their fellow soldiers. Distrust between allied soldiers and Afghan soldiers appears to be at an all-time high. This year's string of scandals -- the Quran burnings at Bagram Air Base, photos of U.S. soldiers posing with body parts of alleged insurgents and crimes such as the Kandahar massacre -- has seriously frayed relations among the soldiers who must work side-by-side. An experienced Pakistani ambassador to China, the European Union, Belgium and other countries, Khan suspects the recent violence could actually help rally the Afghan army. ""If the U.S. chooses to hold back and continue giving control to Afghan soldiers, as it appears to be doing, I see this [positively]. If they pull back and act on suspicion and fear, then it won't turn out well for anyone,"" he said. At least 23 individuals wearing an Afghan army or police uniform have shot and killed a NATO-affiliated soldier this year, according to the Department of Defense. It's unclear whether some who have attacked NATO soldiers are actually Afghan soldiers or just in disguise. Handing over more territory . Meanwhile, the Taliban has demonstrated that it has plenty of fight. The earlier allied surge in the country, especially southern Afghanistan, appeared to force the Taliban to adopt new tactics such as relying on roadside bombs and suicide attacks. In the past year, insurgent attacks overall have decreased some 22%, and in some parts of southern Afghanistan by much more, according to coalition figures. Civilian casualties rose to their highest level last year since 2001, CNN reported. By the middle of this week, officials announced that another large swathe of Afghanistan territory would be handed over to local authorities, giving them control of about 75% of the country. Among the most striking areas that would fall under Afghan control is the city of Kandahar, a former Taliban stronghold, and several mountainous areas of Afghanistan, which make for excellent hiding places for insurgents. 2014 is an election year for Afghanistan. Results could drastically change the atmosphere for peace talks, Fair said. On Sunday, Obama and other world leaders gather at the NATO summit in Chicago, where the future of Afghanistan will be the No. 1 topic. The meeting will include Karzai, NATO allies and International Security Assistance Force contributors, among others. The Afghan constitution prohibits Karzai from running another term. There haven't been any candidates who've emerged as viable to take his place so far, much less any that have appeared to align their platforms with Western goals.","A man thought to be able to bring Taliban to the negotiating table was killed this week .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Workers digging through the rubble of what were offices at Mexico's state-run oil giant have found more victims, raising the death toll from last week's blast to 35. Pemex, the oil monopoly, on Sunday confirmed the figure, which was above the 33 reported killed earlier. More than 100 people were injured; two people remain missing. Pemex, the powerful but much-criticized state oil company, has said it's not clear what caused the blast, which took place Thursday at an administrative building in the Pemex office complex in Mexico City. Authorities have said investigations are under way to determine whether the explosion was the result of an accident, negligence, or an attack. ""People were screaming. ... You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground,"" said Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, an attorney for the Pemex comptroller's office, who was in a courtyard outside the building at the time of the blast. Paramedics quickly arrived and started pulling people from the debris. Thousands of people work at the Pemex headquarters, which includes a 54-story building that is nearly 700 feet tall. The annex where the explosion happened is adjacent to the tower. Mexican oil giant chief won't speculate on cause of deadly blast .

"Quito, Ecuador (CNN) -- Ecuadorian law prohibits polling firms from releasing data in the 10 days before Sunday's presidential election, but unless something surprising happens, incumbent Rafael Correa can expect to win re-election. Earlier this month, four of the country's major polling firms gave Correa a more-than-comfortable margin over his seven challengers. To avoid a runoff, the winner of the election must obtain at least 40% of the vote and more than 10 points' difference from the runner-up. Correa is poised to meet both those criteria. From abroad, the leftist president is often characterized as a disciple of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Indeed, the U.S.-trained economist has created his own ""Citizens' Revolution,"" a socialist-oriented economic program with some similarities to what Chavez has done in Venezuela . Correa has been criticized by press freedom groups for his government's aggressive legal battles against media outlets unfriendly to him. At the same time, Ecuador is housing Julian Assange in its embassy in London, and Correa has offered him asylum. Yet, domestically, Correa's social and economic programs have made him a popular president. He enjoys an approval rating of nearly 85%, according to a December survey by pollster Perfiles de Opiniones. Ecuadorians will elect the president and vice president, 137 legislators in the National Assembly and five members of the Andean Parliament. Correa's closest challenger is Guillermo Lasso Mendoza, who ran on a platform promising lower taxes and the privatization of state media companies. Lasso complained that the short electoral campaign period allowed in Ecuador -- 42 days -- gives an unfair advantage to the incumbent. ""This has been an uneven campaign, but we have given our strongest effort to share our proposal full of hope,"" Lasso said at his campaign closing. In his last campaign event, Correa warned of a return to what he said were corrupt leaders who looked after themselves at the expense of the public. Ecuador, the smallest of the Andean countries, is known for its oil production and tourism. Since Correa became president, he has aligned himself with other countries in the region who reject the influence of the United States. Correa assumed the presidency in 2007 and under a new constitution ran again and won the presidency in 2009. If re-elected, Correa would serve until 2017. The possibility of 10 years under Correa's leadership is a contrast with the political landscape in Ecuador before he became president. The country had seven presidents in the 10-year span 1996 and 2006. Correa's administration has stabilized Ecuador, but more must be done, political analyst Hernan Reyes said. ""We're living in a moment of transition,"" Reyes said, adding that six years of Correa's presidency have not been enough time to completely shift away from the neoliberal economic model of his predecessors. ""I think Correa has succeeded in making the economy dynamic through state investment in public works (and) social projects. This has created an increase in employment rates. Unemployment and underemployment has fallen."" According to the World Bank, the percentage of the population living in poverty dipped from 36.1% in 2007 to 28.6% in 2011. School enrollment is higher than the average in Latin America and the gross domestic product of the oil-based economy has risen $20 billion since Correa took office. Other experts are wary of what they say are Correa's authoritarian tendencies. ""Unfortunately, this government, despite its social and economic successes, institutions have been weakened and there is a control over everything by the executive,"" political analyst Ana Maria Correa said. Journalist Andres Lopez reported from Quito and CNN's Mariano Castillo from Atlanta.","Ecuadorians will go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president .
President Rafael Correa had a sizable lead according to latest polls .
Correa's leftist policies make him popular at home ."
"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- No one saw Marissa Mayer's appointment as the new CEO of Yahoo coming. I certainly didn't! However this is great news for women in tech. Her appointment has sparked a lot of debate as she becomes the 20th current female CEO of a fortune 500 company. Read more: Baidu boss: China helps women succeed at work . According to Mayer ""women in the workplace and women in technology will be key drivers of global competitiveness and innovation in the future."" I truly believe that. Then again, maybe I am biased.

African women can be key power players and the continent's tech scene is a burning star but there are very few women at the forefront of that supernova.

There is also Juliana Rotich, a prolific blogger and another co-founder of Ushahidi. Read more: Women! Embrace your inner geek . I am not sure when it all began, but some time in the past, some genius decided that women didn't have the aptitude for technical things. Most of us have come quite far from that, but why does it still feel like tech is a scary place for African women? I think it's time women in Africa stop looking at technology as something that men do. It's not a man's world. Every time I explain the type of journalism I do, people ask ""but isn't that for technical people, like guys?"" Tech doesn't belong to guys and these interesting African women are proving it. Women like Rapelang Rabana, co-founder of Yeigo Communications, a mobile VoIP company that was integrated into the Telfree group. Rabana is now the Global Head of Research and Development at Telfree. She was also called a tech pioneer by South Africa's Minister of communication at a conference aimed at promoting technology in Africa. Then there is Barbara Mallinson, who thought in a world where Facebook is king it was necessary to have a safe social network for young people that could double as an education tool. Her company Obami is an e-learning and communications platform for schools. It's not just a world of founders and entrepreneurs. There are power players heading up big corporations or country arms of multinational organizations. I find Juliet Ehimuan Google country manager for Nigeria fascinating.

"(CNN) -- Jakarta has always had a rich and fruitful relationship with the sea. A trade gateway linking east and west, the modern city can still show travelers glimpses of its long maritime history. Now the Indonesian capital, it was initially settled as the port of Sunda Kelapa by the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda around the fifth century and was designed to develop a vibrant sea trade for the realm. The ""coconut of Sunda"" (the port's name translated from Sundanese) soon flourished and attracted the attention of other maritime-invested nations including the Portuguese, Dutch and British. To this day, you can still see the influence of the Dutch colonialists in the architecture of many of the buildings in the old city. Today, Indonesia is an independent republic that has become a melting pot of cultures and people. Nicknamed by travelers as the ""Big Durian"" (a pungent-smelling but sweet-tasting local fruit), the modern metropolis of Jakarta is a swelteringly smoggy city bursting at the seams with people. Watch: Jakarta's maritime history . Its moniker is probably a good description of the city. It may not be everyone's idea of a typical vacation spot -- some portions of the city are grungy, dilapidated streets with scruffy slums. But underneath the seemingly overpopulated, polluted exterior lies a vibrant city rich in history and eclectic tourism options. Here are our top picks for tourists wanting to sample Jakarta's maritime heritage. Often missed by vacationers, the historic harbor of Sunda Kelapa sits at the mouth of the Ciliwung River. The original settlement is a fantastic insight into the city's history and is home to what is said to be the world's last wind-powered seafaring trade fleet. Walk amongst the traditional pinisi ships -- simple but sturdy wooden vessels -- that once provided trade from Indonesia to Europe and Africa. Climb up Syahbandar Tower and gaze upon the beautiful views from the top. Literally meaning ""Fish Market"" in Bahasa Indonesia (the country's native tongue), Pasar Ikan sits at the end of Sunda Kelapa harbor. Although the market now sells all types of wares, Indonesian fishermen still gather here daily to sell their catch. The best time to visit and join locals purchasing the best goods is in the morning before it gets too hot and the smell of fish becomes overwhelming. In numbers: The world's shipping industry . Nearby, you can also see traditional kampung houses (dwellings on stilts) where local families live. Don't be shy and say hello to the incredibly friendly and welcoming folks that reside next to the market. A short distance from Pasar Ikan are several repurposed Dutch East India Company warehouses, which now operate as Museum Bahari. Today, the museum lets you step back in time through the country's nautical past and emphasizes how important the sea still is to the economy of present-day Indonesia. On display are beautifully decorated fishing boats and pinisi schooners as well as shipbuilding tools and explanations of Indonesian folklore and maritime traditions. Steering away from the old harbor, visit the Kota Tua (Old Batavia) area. In the 16th century, the Dutch settled in Indonesia -- renaming Jakarta ""Batavia"" -- after seeing a high demand for the country's spices. It is in the popular Kota district that tourists can see the influence left by Indonesia's former colonists. The buildings surrounding Fatahillah Square have distinct Dutch facades and architectural elements. Stroll down roads lined with stalls, street acts and tourists to visit the Jakarta History Museum, Wayang (Puppet) Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts and Ceramics. Outside the Jakarta Historical Museum sits Si Jagur -- a disused Portuguese cannon that is believed to bring fertility to women who touch it. And a few blocks west of Fatahillah Square is the Great Canal, with its historical Dutch drawbridge, Jembatan Pasar Ayam, rising over the waterway. No longer operational, in the past the drawbridge was built to connect the Dutch and British forts stationed on each side of the canal. Finally, end your visit to Jakarta by visiting the National Monument (known locally as ""Monas"") in the center of Merdeka Square. It was erected in the 1960s as a tribute to Indonesian independence and today stands as a reminder of Jakarta's vibrant and multicultural history.","Jakarta boasts a vibrant maritime history because of its location along the spice route .

"(CNN) -- Waving and cheering like survivors of some kind of disaster, 200 guests of a Hong Kong business hotel who were confined for a week due to a swine flu scare left the building Friday. The guests and hotel employees were kept in the Metropark Hotel for a week. Businessmen, families and tourists marched out of the Metropark Hotel in the Wanchai bar district at 8:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET) Friday when the quarantine was lifted. None of them had the H1N1 virus, as swine flu is technically called, but health authorities imposed the lockdown May 1 after another hotel guest from Mexico was diagnosed with the disease. Dragging luggage and carrying purses and backpacks, they were applauded and cheered by hotel workers and local officials, who formed what looked like a receiving line to send them off. ""I am very happy!"" one man shouted as he left.  Watch more about the guests' release » . Throngs of photographers and reporters stood behind metal barricades to capture images of their departure. The worst part of their confinement? ""The food. And no wine!"" said a French woman. Several of the departing guests were headed to the airport but, surprisingly, the majority took up the government's offer of free accommodation at two other hotels so they could see the city they never got to visit. The quarantine was imposed more than a week ago after the 25-year-old guest from Mexico tested positive for swine flu. Hong Kong health officials -- unwilling to see a repeat of the SARS epidemic in 2004 that killed nearly 300 people -- placed the hotel on lockdown.  Images from a British hotel guest » . Coincidentally the Mexican patient was released from the Princess Margaret Hospital Friday, nearly an hour after the guests who had been quarantined at the hotel, a hospital spokesman said. Deputy Director of Home Affairs Adeline Wong said in a statement that after a final medical check, hotel guests would be given medical certificates allowing them to travel. But the hotel is not open for business as usual after their departure. The building will be closed for intense cleaning and disinfecting, according to Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health Dr. York Chow. About 100 hotel staff members were also confined to the premises due to the quarantine. During that time, many guests stayed cocooned in their tiny rooms, flipping through channels on the television or staying connected with their work colleagues via Internet chats. They all had to take a 10-day dose of anti-viral medication. None tested positive for the virus. With no pool to lounge by and just one restaurant to pick from, guests milled about in the lobby to pick up food or get their temperatures taken once a day. ""We go down to the lobby for food and then back to the room to eat your food,"" Leslie Carr, a British man, said Thursday. Outside, bars and clubs lay only a short walk away. But police in face masks guarded the doors, barring exit, as packs of reporters and camera crews peered through the hotel's glass windows. CNN's Pauline Chiou and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","200 guests of Hong Kong hotel freed after being confined a week due to swine flu .

"(CNN) -- It started with a trickle. It ended with a dream washed away by an unstoppable tidal wave. A sheepish grin and a prayer to the famous Manchester weather was the idea, instead it was left to cunning and subterfuge. On came the sprinklers. The water flowed like a stream onto the Old Trafford field; the grass disappeared beneath a rapidly growing quagmire. Bienvenidos a Manchester. This was one way Manchester United manager Matt Busby welcomed the great and good of Real Madrid. Having watched his side suffer a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of their 1957 European Cup semifinal, Busby was taking no chances. The fearsome five of Alfredo Di Stefano, Francisco Gento, Enrique Mateos, Hector Rial and Frenchman Raymond Kopa had unleashed an unstoppable force against United in the opening game in Spain showing the kind of skills and cutting edge of which not much had been seen on British shores since the ""Mighty Magyars"" demolished England at Wembley in 1953. This time, Busby had other ideas. Soak the pitch, make it a mud bath and watch his ""Babes"" use their northern grit to emerge victorious. It was supposed to be foolproof. And he may have even succeeded, but for one prying camera. Real protest . ""The second leg was almost never played,"" author of ""Forever a Babe: Growing up with Manchester United,"" Tom Clare told CNN. ""Busby had ordered that the playing pitch be soaked by water sprinklers as he thought that Madrid would not be used to, or like playing on a heavy surface. ""Unfortunately, a newspaper photographer from the Daily Mirror took a picture which showed there to be large pools of water lying on the surface of the pitch. ""Of course the water had not soaked in, but when the Madrid people saw the pictures on the morning of the game -- they threatened not to play unless the sprinklers were turned off."" So when Cristiano Ronaldo of Real and United's Wayne Rooney lock horns in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie on Wednesday in Madrid, they will evoke memories of that fateful April day in 1957. Real to face United in Champions League . That 1957 match had it all -- gamesmanship, a bog-like pitch, diving, Los Galacticos, suspicious officials and a ""hatchet man'"" of an emergency loan signing. There was even a Manchester United manager remonstrating with the referee over timekeeping. Perhaps the game wasn't so different 56 years ago, after all. ""The better team won and should have won more easily one thought for the simple reason that it was the only one with an organized forward line,"" said the Manchester Guardian newspaper in its match report. The Daily Express was even more scathing of United's performance, pulling no punches in its headline: ""Arrogant Busby Babes Laze and Lose."" ""Streetwise"" When the Spaniards arrived at Old Trafford on Thursday April 25, 65,000 hopeful and expectant supporters turned out to see whether the ""Babes"" could hit the headlines for the right reasons. ""As a 12-year-old schoolboy, the whole event was magical and sometimes very bewildering,"" United supporter John White told CNN. ""For starters, our English game was a very much more physical contact game than our European cousins played. ""We could not understand their propensity to fall over so readily -- yes, sad to say, even the great virtuosos of that sparkling Madrid side that won the European Cup five times in a row were not above developing an attack of the 'personal wobbles' when it was convenient."" Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United: Which is the biggest club? Just as it is now, some 56 years later, Real was the richest club in the European game and scoured the world over for the most talented players. United's team contained just two players -- Ray Wood and Tommy Taylor -- who had commanded a fee, with the club hamstrung in terms of finance following the Second World War, forcing it to nurture talent from the famous Academy, which former chairman James Gibson had founded during the club's financial struggles. The ""Babes"" had already proved to be the most talented side of their generation within the domestic game but their lack of experience was cruelly exposed against a ""streetwise"" Real. ""Nobody in England was aware about just how good Real Madrid was at the time,"" said Clare, who was at Old Trafford as a youngster that day. ""However, despite their fantastic lineup, United's 'Babes' were a match for them -- apart from experience. ""That was the difference between the two teams. There was a big difference in the average age between the teams -- United's was 22 and Real's was 29,"" added Clare. Blunt the blade . The contest, according to the editorial in the Manchester Guardian, would rest on whether United could ""blunt the edge of the sharpest club attack in Europe."" Busby's team had overturned a two-goal deficit in the quarterfinal, winning 3-0 at home to Athletic Bilbao after losing 5-3 in the first leg in Spain. In Dennis Viollet and Tommy Taylor, United had two forwards who had already terrorized defenses across the continent, plundering goals for fun. But it was young winger David Pegg who had caused Real the most problems in the first leg, causing the Spaniards to take Manuel Torres on loan in place of Jose Becerril. Torres, considered to be one of the hardest men in Spanish football at the time, was given the task of nullifying the threat posed by the 21-year-old winger. The man who saved Manchester United -- twice . It did the trick, too. With Pegg nullified, the attacking prowess of the great Di Stefano, the technically supreme Kopa and the effervescent Rial, Real were far too strong, even with the mud bath of a pitch. The presence of Di Stefano, the European Footballer of the Year in 1957 and 1959, was an almighty treat for those packed inside Old Trafford. It led to the Manchester Guardian heaping praise on one of the most talented players of his generations, comparing him to legendary orchestra conductors of the day -- Thomas Beecham and John Barbirolli. ""That Di Stefano's colleagues should play instinctively up to him is no more surprising than that an orchestra should play up to Beecham or Barbirolli,"" it read. ""He preserves the balance and dictates the tempo in the same way. His rewards are said to be fabulous."" Unstoppable tidal wave . With Di Stefano to the fore, Madrid roared into a two-goal lead within the opening 33 minutes thanks to goals from Kopa and Rial to extend its advantage to 5-1 on aggregate. Having played three league games in six days in the lead up to the tie, United soon grew frustrated despite goals from Taylor and Bobby Charlton leveling the score on the day. Constant fouling and a number of offenses left referee Leo Horn claiming after the match that ""there must have been 50 or 60 infringements."" ""The game itself was not a great spectacle,"" Clare recalled. ""Madrid feigned injury, wasted time whenever they could, kicked the ball away into the crowd when United were awarded free-kicks. ""It was really frustrating as back then, you never ever saw those kind of things happen."" Real's style certainly left its impact, with Duncan Edwards telling the media the experience was ""damn rough,"" while United captain Roger Byrne claimed the Spaniards ""lacked sportsmanship."" A raucous Old Trafford crowd booed the visiting players mercilessly at the final outcome, leading Daily Express journalist Desmond Hackett to write how he had ""never felt so ashamed of an English soccer crowd in all my life."" Hackett was left mesmerized by Real and Di Stefano in particular, writing how ""we were left without words to use for that odd man out among the continentals, Alfredo Di Stefano from the Argentine."" What had started as a trickle of optimism had been left submerged by the unstoppable tidal wave of Real's attacking prowess. Breaking the stranglehold . While Real would go on to win the nascent competition for the second year in a row, defeating Fiorentina of Italy in the final, United finished the season as English league champions before losing to Aston Villa in the FA Cup final in front of nearly 100,000 at Wembley. Champions League final tickets reduced . Real went on to win the first five editions of the competition, but United's fortunes were left ruined among the wreckage of the 1958 Munich Air Disaster. Of the 11 players which lined up against Real, six perished in the accident on February 6 when the plane carrying players, staff, journalists and supporters crashed in a blizzard while trying to take off at the third attempt from Munich airport. Byrne, Eddie Colman, Edwards, Pegg, Taylor and Liam Whelan all lost their lives alongside fellow teammates Mark Jones and Geoff Bent. In all, 23 of the 44 passengers lost their lives, while several players and manager Busby suffered physical and mental trauma. It would be 10 years until United met Real again, with just two players in Charlton and Bill Foulkes, both Munich survivors, remaining from the team which had lost out in the previous meeting. On that occasion, inspired by the mercurial talent of George Best, United triumphed, winning 1-0 at home before securing a 3-3 draw in Madrid. Busby's team would go on to lift the trophy at Wembley after defeating Eusebio's Benfica 4-1, just 10 years after the nightmare of Munich. Whether United would have challenged Real's dominance of European football during the 1950s remains a hypothetical question. Real signed one of the greatest players to have ever stepped onto a football field in the shape of Hungary's Ferenc Puskas in 1958 and saw off all comers until a Bela Guttmann-inspired Benfica broke the stranglehold in 1961. Benfica and 'the curse of Bela Guttmann' ""Would the Madrid team have remained so dominant in Europe had Munich not happened? I don't think that they would,"" said Clare. ""I think that United were on course to win the European Cup in 1958. They were such a young vibrant team, who had gained their first season of experience in Europe and had learned a lot from it. ""There was also much more strength in depth at Old Trafford than there was in Madrid. ""People forget that in season 1958-59, just months after the tragedy, United's patched-up young team finished runners-up in Division One to champions Wolves -- that was some achievement.""","Manchester United take on Real Madrid in the European Champions League this week .

"(CNN) -- A New York newspaper removed an interactive map from its website following a public outcry over the revealing of names and addresses of handgun permit holders in Westchester and Rockland counties, the publisher said Friday. The newspaper last month defended the online information culled from public records, but The Journal News publisher Janet Hasson on Friday said the map had served its purpose. The database was published in the wake of the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were killed. The gunman, 20, had earlier killed his mother in their home; he killed himself after the school rampage. ""Today The Journal News has removed the permit data from lohud.com,"" Hasson said in a public letter on the website. The newspaper wasn't caving to public pressure, and the decision wasn't an acknowledgment that it made a mistake, Hasson said. In fact, she said, many community members applauded publication of the permit data. ""Our decision to do so is not a concession to critics that no value was served by the posting of the map in the first place,"" Hasson said. ""Nor is our decision made because we were intimidated by those who threatened the safety of our staffers. We know our business is a controversial one, and we do not cower,"" Hasson said. After map published, blogger posts journalists' address . ""But the database has been public for 27 days and we believe those who wanted to view it have done so already. As well, with the passage of time, the data will become outdated and inaccurate,"" she said. Hasson acknowledged a legislative climate in New York that favors making private any information about gun permits. ""As a news organization, we are constantly defending the public's right to know,"" she said. ""But we are not deaf to voices who have said that new rules should be set for gun permit data."" The online map allowed readers to zoom in on red dots that indicated which residents were licensed to own pistols or revolvers. Blue dots indicated permit holders who ""have purchased a firearm or updated the information on a permit in the past five years."" The published data outraged many gun permit holders and privacy advocates, who posted angry comments online. Some threatened to cancel their subscriptions or boycott the publication. At the time, Hasson defended the decision. ""One of our roles is to report publicly available information on timely issues, even when unpopular. We knew publication of the database (as well as the accompanying article providing context) would be controversial, but we felt sharing information about gun permits in our area was important in the aftermath of the Newtown shootings,"" she said last month. On Friday, the newspaper pledged to continue ""to report aggressively"" on gun ownership and will press its request for data from Putnam County and additional information from Westchester and Rockland counties once it's released publicly. ""And we will keep a snapshot of our map--with all its red dots-- on our website to remind the community that guns are a fact of life we should never forget,"" Hasson wrote.

"(CNN) -- Charles Denton ""Tex"" Watson, one of the chief participants in the Manson Family murders, will stay in prison at least another five years, the California Board of Parole Hearings announced Wednesday. Watson, 65, was denied parole for the 16th time, the board said, and will not be considered again until 2016. Watson was convicted of seven counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in a two-day killing spree that occurred in Los Angeles in the summer of 1969. Five people, including actress Sharon Tate, were killed at Tate's residence the night of August 9, 1969, by Watson and fellow Manson Family members Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel. The following night, restaurant owner Leno La Bianca and his wife, Rosemary, were slain in their home by Watson, Atkins, Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, accompanied this time by group leader Charles Manson. All five received the death penalty, but the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment after a California court decision abolished capital punishment. Watson has been housed at Mule Creek State Prison since 1993, according to the parole board.","Charles Denton ""Tex"" Watson was up for parole for the 16th time .

"Chicago (CNN) -- The teenager who police say shot and killed Chicago honor student Hadiya Pendleton was on probation for unlawful use of a firearm, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said Monday night. Michael Ward, 18, and Kenneth Williams, 20, were each charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder, McCarthy told reporters. They were also charged with two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. They will make their first appearance in court on Tuesday morning. Ward confessed to shooting Hadiya and two others in late January in a case of mistaken identity, McCarthy said. Police said Ward and Williams were gang members seeking revenge against the people who had shot Williams in July -- men against whom Williams had refused to press charges when police arrested them. He and Ward thought they had spotted members of a rival gang at the park when police said Ward sneaked up on Hadiya and her friends and began shooting. Williams was the getaway driver, the superintendent said. McCarthy said Ward was sentenced to two years' probation in January 2012 for unlawful use of a firearm. ""This has to stop. Gun offenders have to do significant jail time,"" McCarthy said. ""Criminals have to be held accountable. And there has to be a certainty of punishment when we arrest somebody with an illegal firearm."" The charges come 12 days after Hadiya was shot to death at a park in what her godfather, Damon Stuart, described as an ""ideal community"" on Chicago's South Side. Police said that there were no substantive tips as to the shooter's identity, but once they had a description of the car, they linked it to a traffic stop that occurred several days before the killing. That description and interviews with parolees led them to Ward and Williams. McCarthy said Ward surrendered on Saturday night without a struggle, but Williams tried to escape. No weapon was recovered, he said. Hadiya's was killed a week after she performed at one of the events surrounding Obama's second inauguration. Shatira Wilks, one of Hadiya's cousins, said the family was elated that the suspects were in jail. ""However there is no level of comfort -- not long-term comfort -- and we are still miserable,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""(Hadiya) is the face of every parent's dream child. Hadiya had so many different things awaiting her in life. She was a wonderful, wonderful kid. My little cousin really was an angel."" She said Hadiya was hanging out with a volleyball team -- a group of girls and one boy -- when she was killed. The killing -- which occurred in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood near the Obamas' Chicago home -- drew the first couple's attention. First lady Michelle Obama attended Hadiya's funeral Saturday, and her husband wrote a note to Hadiya's family that was printed on the funeral program: ""We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence."" Hadiya's parents are in Washington to attend the State of the Union address, McCarthy said. Hadiya, who often urged friends to stay away from gangs, was an honor student and band majorette at King College Prep School. Her slaying -- the 42nd in the city this year -- also highlighted the problem of gun violence in Chicago. More than 500 people were fatally shot in 2012. McCarthy reiterated his call for minimum sentences for gun crimes and mandatory background checks. ""Michael Ward would not have been on the street of New York City to commit this act,"" the impassioned superintendent said. ""This is not about gun control. This is about the criminal justice system being designed to prevent gun violence."" Huge gaps in that system must be closed, he said, mentioning sentencing guidelines and universal background checks for gun buyers. ""But in my book, one of the bigger things is (a) requirement to report the loss, theft or transfer of firearms,"" he said. He hoped Hadiya's case would be a turning point in the gun laws debate, and he apologized for his rant. ""I get a little emotional,"" he said. ""Because it's true.""","NEW: Cousin says family is happy to hear of arrests but still grieving loss .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- An explosion rocked the offices of Mexico's state oil company Thursday, killing at least 25 people and injuring 101, Mexico's interior minister said. Dozens of people were trapped in the building after the explosion, Foro TV reported. It was unclear how many of them had been pulled to safety, or whether anyone remained stuck inside late Thursday, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters. More than five hours after the blast, rescuers had pulled at least one survivor from the rubble, Mexico's president said in a Twitter post. Crews were still searching Thursday night for people who could be trapped in the Pemex office complex, which includes one of the city's tallest skyscrapers. Watch: Office explosion rocks Mexico City . The explosion occurred in a basement and collapsed two floors of a building adjacent to the well-known tower, said Carlos Javier Rodriguez Jurado, one of the first paramedics to arrive at the scene. The explosion tore through the building ""from the inside out,"" he said, and rescuers found many people trapped. Six hours after the explosion, Rodriguez said people were likely still stuck in the rubble. It was unclear what caused the blast, and Mexico's attorney general's office is investigating, Pemex said in a statement. A large plume of smoke rose near the building after the explosion around 4 p.m. Thursday, and emergency crews swarmed the scene. ""People were screaming. ... You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground,"" said Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, an attorney for the Pemex comptroller's office, who was in a courtyard outside the building at the time of the blast. Paramedics quickly arrived and started pulling bodies from the rubble. Are you there? Send us your photos, videos. ""Entering the building, we smelled a strong odor of gas,"" said Christopher Rangel, a paramedic and firefighter. Outside the building, frantic family members searched for loved ones, and shaken witnesses described the explosion. Mario Guzman said he was on the 10th floor of the tower when he felt ""a very strong blow."" ""We felt like the whole building was going to collapse,"" he told CNNMexico. Images from the scene showed emergency rescue teams carrying people on stretchers. Authorities said helicopters carried some of the wounded to hospitals. At least 14 people were hospitalized with injuries, and two of them were in serious condition, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto surveyed the damage Thursday night, along with Osorio Chong and Mexico City's mayor. Pena Nieto cautioned against speculating over what caused the blast, and said authorities would be closely investigating. Thousands of people work at the Pemex headquarters, which includes a 54-story building that is nearly 700 feet tall. The explosion occurred in an annex building just to the east of the tower, Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said. Officials evacuated the complex and operations will cease there until further notice, the company said. The state oil company's director, who was on a business trip in South Korea this week, said in a Twitter post that he would return to Mexico immediately. ""We will get to the bottom of the causes in close coordination with the authorities,"" Pemex Director General Emilio Lozoya Austin said. ""At this time, attending to the injured is the priority."" Federal troops and rescue dogs were aiding in search efforts late Thursday night. As they combed through the rubble, a Pemex executive's cell phone rang, Rangel said. A man on the other end of the line said he was still trapped, and started to describe his location to rescuers. ""Unfortunately, we lost communication with him,"" Rangel said. When they called back, his phone didn't ring. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Krupskaia Alis reported from Mexico City. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"Acapulco, Mexico (CNN) -- Arrests could come as early as this week in the alleged rape of six Spanish tourists in Acapulco, the lead investigator in the case told CNN on Wednesday. Mexican authorities have identified the suspects and are monitoring them, said Marcos Juarez. Fifty investigators were working the case. The six women were among 14 people victimized by hooded gunmen who burst into a beach bungalow in the resort town before dawn Monday. There are seven suspects between the ages of 20 and 30, Juarez said. In addition to the rapes, the men stole cell phones, iPads and tennis shoes from the victims, investigators said. Investigators believe that the victims bought drugs from one or more of the suspects a day or two earlier, and that the victims knew the suspects, Juarez said. The Spanish nationals range from 20 to 34 years of age and are under the protection of Mexican authorities in Mexico City. Rape casein Mexican resort city puts violence back in the spotlight . Seven men who were with the group were tied up with cell phone cables and bikini straps while the gunmen assaulted the six women, officials said. A seventh woman, a Mexican, was spared because of her nationality, Guerrero state Attorney General Martha Garzon said in a radio interview. ""She has said that she identified herself to the men and asked them not to rape her,"" Garzon told Radio Formula. ""And they told her that she had 'passed the test' by being Mexican, and from that point they don't touch her."" The gunmen's motive was robbery and ""to have some fun,"" as they saw it, Garzon said. They do not appear to be a part of organized crime, officials said. Military checkpoints have been set up to apprehend the suspects. As they sift through evidence, investigators have cordoned off the area around the bungalow, which is in an open area of Playa Encantada that has limited security in Playa Encantada. Last year, the city of Acapulco attracted half a million tourists -- most of them Mexicans. Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Spanish tourists received consular aid after the incident. The U.S. State Department says ""resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the levels of drug-related violence and crime reported in the border region and in areas along major trafficking routes."" But the agency adds that resort city bars, including those in Acapulco, can be ""havens for drug dealers and petty criminals.""

"(CNN) -- A day after an explosion rocked its offices in Mexico City, Mexico's state-run oil giant Pemex says it's too early to speculate on the cause of the deadly blast. At least 33 people -- mostly women -- were killed in the explosion, Pemex chief Emilio Lozoya said at a news conference Friday. More than 100 were injured, including 52 who remain hospitalized. Watch: Blast rocks Mexico City . Lozoya was asked if he believed Pemex, the powerful but often criticized state oil monopoly, was the target of a bombing, but he declined to speculate. Experts from Mexico and abroad are investigating the scene to determine the cause, he said. Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam similarly refused to rule out possibilities. ""We have experts in everything, absolutely everything,"" he told reporters, adding that investigations are under way to determine whether the blast was the result of an accident or an attack. Some witnesses have reported smelling a strong odor of gas after the blast. It is a complicated investigation that ""cannot be explained in a few hours,"" Lozoya said. The priority, Lozoya said, is providing support to the victims' families and rescuing anyone who may remain trapped. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited victims in the hospital Friday, offering condolences and promising help. The explosion happened Thursday afternoon at an administrative building in the Pemex office complex. ""People were screaming. ... You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground,"" said Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, an attorney for the Pemex comptroller's office, who was in a courtyard outside the building at the time of the blast. Paramedics quickly arrived and started pulling people from the rubble. Thousands of people work at the Pemex headquarters, which includes a 54-story building that is nearly 700 feet tall. The annex where the explosion happened is adjacent to the tower. The oil company's production capabilities have not been harmed, and operations and oil production will continue Friday as normal, Lozoya said. Employees at the Pemex annex said that the basement of the building, where he explosion is believed to have originated, housed a water treatment facility, storage areas and archives. The first floor, which also was heavily damaged, is where the company's human resources team worked. One employee, Silvia Hernandez, recounted how she was finishing up her workday at another building and standing in line to clock out when she heard a blast. ""I saw the explosion of glass, people bleeding; it was something very shocking,"" she said. ""I can't say more because the memory makes me nervous. I was terrified, anxious."" A bridge that connected her building with the annex collapsed, likely trapping employees, she said. Another employee, who declined to give his name for fear of retribution, spoke about his failed attempt to locate his brother within the rubble. The man smoked cigarette after cigarette in the predawn hours of Friday as he waited at the medical examiner's office to claim his brother's body. More than 100 relatives waited outside the offices with him. The man said he was among the employees who began rescue efforts in the immediate aftermath of the explosion. He knew his brother worked in the human resources area, which had been damaged, so the man covered his face with a rag and ran there to search for him. The man said he removed debris and helped rescue others, but never reached his brother. By then, professional rescuers arrived and took over the job of looking for survivors.

"(CNN) -- A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas has approved a request from the Los Angeles Police Department to turn over audiotapes that may develop new clues about unsolved killings involving followers of notorious murderer Charles Manson. The tapes are about eight hours of recordings between convicted murderer Charles Denton ""Tex"" Watson and his attorney from 1969, Bill Boyd of McKinney, Texas, whose law firm is the debtor in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the same state, court papers said. Watson was convicted along with three other members of the so-called Manson family in the grisly 1969 murders of five people, including eight-months pregnant movie actress Sharon Tate. According to court documents, Watson waived his attorney-client privilege to the tapes in 1976, and his attorney received partial payment for his legal fees when he gave a copy of the tapes to Chaplain Raymond G. Hoekstra, who subsequently wrote a book, ""Will You Die for Me: The Man Who Killed for Charles Manson Tells His Own Story."" In March, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck wrote the U.S. court trustee asking for the original recordings. The judge approved the request on Tuesday. ""The LAPD has information that Mr. Watson discussed additional unsolved murders committed by followers of Charles Manson,"" said a letter signed by Beck and Lt. Yana Horvatich, acting commanding officer of the robbery-homicide division. Beck's letter is dated March 19, seven days after Watson asked that all legal material relating to his case be turned over to his nephew, Brian Patton, of Rowlett, Texas, according to court papers. ""One last thing: I want to thank you for hunting me down. I'm so glad these documents didn't get in the wrong hands,"" Watson wrote in a March 12 letter to a U.S. court trustee asking that he forward the legal materials to Patton. In November, Watson, 66, convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder, was denied parole for the 16th time and will be considered again in 2016, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In March, Manson, 77, who is serving a life sentence for nine murders and who led his family of followers in a murder spree in 1969, was denied parole for the 12th time and will be up for parole again 15 years from now, when he would be 92.","A federal bankruptcy judge gives audiotapes to the LAPD in its probe of unsolved murders .

"(CNN) -- Something about the Facebook privacy hoax has gotten people to click ""share."" First, the faux copyright legalese spread like wildfire across the social networking site. Many users recently found their news feeds awash with postings suggesting that the users who displayed them would get extra copyright and privacy protection. Then came the predictable backlash, as Internet users rushed in to debunk this latest theory. Even still, some people kept posting the message and it continued to spread on Tuesday morning. Facebook has issued a statement saying the text posts are a hoax: ""Anyone who uses Facebook owns and controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms. They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been."" This meme is similar to a previous scheme years ago that suggested website owners place protective text on their pages, says the hoax-debunking site Snopes.com. While many Facebook and Twitter posts snickered about the hubbub, concerns about online privacy linger. ""It may have been a hoax, but it did not hurt!"" wrote one Facebook user. There are questions, too. In a world of social media dominated by complex terms of use and sometimes-fuzzy privacy arrangements, could some Facebook users have taken solace in the possibility of having some bit of extra control over their data, even if it was a hoax? Or, is this an issue of social media literacy? Perhaps more needs to be done to educate people about telling a hoax from something that is real. We'd like to know what you think about the hoax.

"(CNN) -- Maybe this iPhone 5 ""purple haze"" issue isn't such a big deal after all. In the few weeks that the phone has been on the market, a number of users have grumbled about a purplish glow appearing in their photos when the lens is angled toward the sun. Because no detail about Apple is too trivial to go unreported by the tech press, their complaints were magnified throughout the blogosphere. But Consumer Reports said Wednesday that this effect is not unusual. The respected product-review publication tested the iPhone 5 and found that it is ""no more prone to purple hazing on photos shot into a bright light source than its predecessor or than several Android phones with fine cameras."" The iPhone 5's purple-haze effect was no more pronounced than with the iPhone 4S or two Android-based smartphones, the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, when tested those under the same conditions, Consumer Reports said. ""All camera lenses, even those made for expensive SLRs, can yield lens flare, which is produced by scattered reflections inside the lens from a bright light source,"" Consumer Reports added. ""How much flare appears in an image depends on how you orient the lens."" Apple said basically the same thing in a recent post on its website and suggested that iPhone users angle the camera or shield the lens with their hand to keep bright light from shining into photos taken with the phone. ""Some expensive advanced cameras, and even many point-and-shoots, have special lens coatings that can limit or eliminate such flare, and possibly associated colored haze. So can attaching a shading hood around the lens's edge,"" Consumer Reports said. ""But smartphones' cameras are designed differently, so it's typically more difficult for manufacturers to minimize flare in them."" Perhaps this will put an end to the purple-haze saga, and iPhone 5 users can go back to griping about the new Apple maps.","Consumer Reports says the ""purple haze"" effect on iPhone 5 photos is not unusual .

"(CNN) -- ""Saturday Night Live"" has added a little perspective to users' gripes about the new iPhone. In a biting sketch on Saturday's episode, Christina Applegate hosts a fake talk show in which three tech bloggers voice complaints about the iPhone 5: Its new maps are glitchy, its camera takes purple-tinged photos, its casing scratches too easily, and so on. Then Applegate reveals -- surprise! -- three other guests: ""workers"" from factories in China that manufacture Apple's phones and other consumer electronics under allegedly inhumane conditions. ""It takes you to wrong place?"" says a factory worker played by ""SNL"" cast member Fred Armisen in response to a complaint about Apple's buggy mobile maps. ""You want Starbucks, it takes you to Dunkin' Donuts? That must be so hard for you."" This ""First World problem"" sarcasm, spoken in over-the-top fake Chinese accents, continues after another blogger mentions apps loading slowly on the new phone. ""Oh, Twitter real slow? You can't read Kardashian tweet about handbag?"" says another worker. ""My brother have handbag, too. He lose hand, keep in bag until he can afford to reattach."" (There's no mention by name of Foxconn, the controversial Taiwanese manufacturer whose China factories produce the phones. A series of suicides by workers at Foxconn's plants have raised questions about living and working conditions there.) On ""SNL,"" the three bloggers grow more apologetic and uncomfortable until the skit ends with Applegate inviting the Chinese workers to complain about an American product.

"(Ars Technica) -- After months of rumor roundups and speculation, Apple's iPad mini has finally been announced—and the 7-inch tablet market has just heated up. This growing product category now has more to offer than Android devices with differing UI skins and varying components—or that BlackBerry PlayBook that's not selling too hot. That's not to say that Apple's entrance into the mini-tablet game is solely what's fueling the fire. Up until now, only the first-generation Kindle Fire and the recently launched Google Nexus 7 were considered worthy buys. Add the iPad mini to the mix, and this particular product category has a little more steam. But not everyone wants a $329 iPad mini, and there are certainly other 7-inch tablets that are worthy options. Or not, depending on your specific needs. To help you out, we've put together this roundup of 7-inch tablets that are slated to arrive soon or are already available for purchase. If you're the ""TL;DR"" type, scroll down to the bottom and check out the comparison chart for a quick cheat sheet. Google Nexus 7 . Google's flagship Nexus 7 tablet has done well by our standards and it's quite a deal at $200. Built on the internals of the Asus Memo 370, the tablet has a 1280×800 IPS display with 226ppi, a 1.3GHz Tegra 3 quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, up to 16GB of internal storage (with a rumored 32GB model on its way), and a 1.3MP front-facing camera. It also comes with a stock version of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, and because it's Google-backed, it's ensured that it will be supported for future Android updates. Our benchmarks show that it's one of the speediest 7-inch tablets currently available. Kindle Fire HD . The first iteration of the Kindle Fire did exceedingly well, but its successor has left a bit to be desired. The Kindle Fire HD, priced at $199 (or $214 for the ad-free version), comes with a 1.3GHz dual-core OMAP-4460 processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 1280×800 display—the same resolution as Google's Nexus 7. It comes preloaded with Amazon's Appstore, which has limited offerings compared to the Google Play store, and it runs a custom version of Ice Cream Sandwich, an Android version behind its major competitors. This device is best suited for those who devour e-books or are especially invested in the Amazon ecosystem. Nook HD . Barnes & Noble is slated to update its Nook tablet this holiday season; the device will be available for preorder for $199 beginning November 1. The Nook HD includes a 1440×900 resolution and a 243ppi display—putting it within a stone's throw of the 4G iPad's 264ppi Retina display—and is fueled by a 1.2GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 processor. Like the Kindle Fire HD, it will also come with its own skinned version of Ice Cream Sandwich, and will be best suited for committed consumers of the Barnes and Noble e-book store. However, it's important to note that unlike Amazon's Kindle Fire HD, Barnes and Noble's Nook HD will not require the extra $15 to enjoy it without advertisements. Acer Iconia Tab A110 . Acer isn't new to the tablet game. Its Iconia Tab series includes the 10.1-inch A500 and A700 tablets, but the A110 marks the company's second foray into the 7-inch product category. The A110 will come with a Tegra 3 processor and run Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, though it will be limited to a 1024×600 display—a major fumble in a tablet world overrun by competing devices with higher resolution displays. It also features a microSD expansion slot and micro-HDMI, but for $229—one of the more costly of the 7-inch tablets in this roundup—the A110 will need to offer a lot more than expandable storage to stay a player in the game. iPad Mini . The iPad now comes in a 7.9-inch ""mini"" flavor, which makes it one of the largest of the mini-tablets. It's got all the aesthetics of its 9.7-inch counterpart, though it's limited by its non-Retina 1024×768 display. The iPad mini is also incredibly thin—just 7.2mm thin, 23% thinner than the iPad. If you're already a faithful Apple user, you won't have to leave the ecosystem. It comes in different flavors (16GB for $329, 32GB for $429, and 64GB for $519), so onboard storage isn't an issue, and you can purchase an LTE-capable model for $130 more—a feature that a majority of the tablets featured in this round-up do not offer. But the $329 base price is significantly higher than the competition, and the 1024x768 display resolution isn't much better than the Acer Iconia and pales in comparison to that of the Nook HD's 1440x900 and the 1280x800 Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD.

"(CNN) -- James Holmes called a University of Colorado switchboard nine minutes before he allegedly opened fire at a movie theater in a Denver suburb on July 20, public defender Tamara Brady said in court Thursday. The number can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, she said. Holmes, 24, is accused of opening fire during a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. He has been charged with murder and attempted murder and faces two weapons charges. On Thursday, Holmes appeared before a packed court hearing, which included survivors of the shooting. Dr. Lynne Fenton, his psychiatrist, testified that her contact with Holmes ended on June 11, and that she later contacted campus police because she was ""so concerned"" about what happened during that last meeting, though she declined to elaborate. Colorado shooting victims' families criticize relief charity . Officials said Holmes mailed a notebook to her before the shooting, though it's not clear whether its contents will be considered admissible in court. Fenton testified that Holmes' defense team contacted her after the shooting and asked that she send the notebook back to Holmes via them. In 2011, the University of Iowa rejected Holmes' graduate application, with one official saying ""Do NOT offer admissions under any circumstances,"" according to documents obtained by CNN. A second university official agreed not to make the recommendation for Holmes' admittance. The suspected gunman was a doctoral candidate studying neuroscience at the University of Colorado's Anschutz campus in Aurora. But he was ""denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor,"" according to court documents. Subsequently, Holmes ""started the process to voluntarily withdraw from his graduate studies program."" The University of Colorado said this month that it hired a former U.S. attorney to conduct an independent review into how the school handled Holmes. Holmes said earlier that he wanted to study ""the primary source of all things, our own minds,"" according to a personal statement he submitted as part of a graduate studies application at the University of Illinois. The application included the statement, professional references and test scores. Prosecutors: Theater shooting suspect told classmate he wanted to kill people . The documents were released by the university, where Holmes applied to the neuroscience department before later opting to attend the University of Colorado. While the documents do little to answer questions about the suspect's possible motive, they offer insight into Holmes as a student and his aspirations to study the human brain. In the statement, Holmes wrote that he has long been ""fascinated by the complexities of long lost thought seemingly arising out of nowhere into stream of awareness."" ""These fascinations likely stemmed from my interest in puzzles and paradoxes as an adolescent and continued through my curiosity in academic research,"" he wrote in the statement, submitted in early 2011. He titled his resume ""aspiring scientist."" Holmes was described as taking ""an active role in his education, and brings a great amount of intellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom,"" according to a letter of reference that appeared to be from one of his former professors.

"(CNN) -- There are slews of apps and websites to help you make the most of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the two mondo-consumerist U.S. holidays. But Pinterest, the out-of-nowhere social network that became wildly popular this year, may offer some of the freshest approaches to online gift-giving this season. ""This holiday shopping season will mark a turning point for Pinterest,"" Julia Boorstin wrote on a CNBC blog. ""The social scrapbooking platform valued at $1.5 billion isn't making money itself yet. But it's been helping retailers connect with customers since it launched a year and a half ago, and now it's actively trying to help brands cash in. And this all-important shopping season companies are increasingly using it to drive online sales."" Here are five ways you can pin yourself to a more productive (and gift-filled) holiday. (Oh, and if you don't know what Pinterest is, read this before proceeding.) 1. Create a secret wish list: On November 8, Pinterest updated its site to allow users to create up to three private pin boards. You could use one of these to pin images of products that you'd like to receive during the holiday season, and then you could share that page with a couple of relatives. Since posts on Pinterest link back to the website where you found the image you're sharing, it makes it easy for Mom or Dad to find exactly the item you're looking for. The downside: This exercise in ""give me this!"" pinning could be a turn-off for family members who want to be more creative -- or for people who have only a vague idea of what gifts they would like to receive. ""Whatever you pin appears to refer to specific brands, colors, or size, even if that's not what you intended,"" writes Jill Duffy for PC Mag. ""Pinterest works wonderfully for sharing images of the exact tennis racquet you want, but isn't as good for convincing your family that any old tube socks will do."" 2. Pin boards with gift ideas for others: If narcissism isn't your thing, you could use private Pinterest boards to make visual lists of the gifts you'd like to buy for friends or family members. Since Pinterest allows only three private boards per user, it might be smarter to make one board with gift ideas for everyone on your list. Download a browser extension for Pinterest that lets you share a photo to your board in a couple clicks. ""This is one time I wish Pinterest offered more than three boards, as having one for each person on your holiday list could be most useful,"" writes Scott Kleinberg for the Chicago Tribune. ""And if Santa uses Pinterest, this could change everything we know about making the list and checking it twice."" Using Pinterest's mobile app, you could take these lists with you to the store. Or, of course, you could go all Cyber Monday on it and buy the goods online. 3. Get ""30 Days of Pinspiration"": In a blog post on Tuesday, Pinterest announced a guide to the holidays called ""30 Days of Pinspiration"" (not ""perspiration,"" but we know you were thinking it, too). It works sort of like an online Advent calendar. Over the next month, the company will unveil ""a series of holiday boards from people, businesses, non-profit organizations, celebrities, and more,"" it says. ""From what to cook and how to decorate to ways to give back and health tips for the new year, there's a little something for everyone."" Day 1: Thanksgiving traditions from Katie Couric. Follow the project at this site: http://holidays.pinterest.com. 4. Follow tastemakers and stores: Conveniently enough, Pinterest announced November 14 that it would allow business to create Pinterest pages. Before that, the company's terms of use prohibited a business to use the site for profit. The switch seems to be effective for websites. In a blog post, Pinterest said that Allrecipes, a cooking site, saw 50,000 recipes and 139 mililon impressions in a three-month trial period. Several retailers have set up Pinterest pages in time for the holidays. Among them: Gap, Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Shopbop and Etsy. Many of these pages highlight women's apparel and accessories, which makes sense since most of Pinterest's users are female. But there are dude-specific boards too, including Dudepins and Manteresting. The Verge and Mashable, technology-focused websites, also have a robust set of gadget boards that may help you shop for that tech-head on your list. 5. Snoop on family members: Finally, and maybe this is an obvious one, but if your family members are active on Pinterest (or Twitter or Facebook), you could snoop through the products they've posted about to get ideas for gifts that may be appropriate. If your loved ones aren't freaked out by this invasion of their public-private life, they may thank you for it later.

"(CNN) -- As they move from their early teens to their late teens, kids no longer want to be pals with Mom and Dad. Teenage boys are much less likely than girls to initiate conversations with their parents. And moms baby their sons. Not exactly news flashes, you say? But we're not talking about real life here, exactly. We're talking about Facebook. The world's largest social network released new data Thursday about how parents and their children interact online. But the findings, from Facebook's data science team, also illustrate how personal interactions on Facebook can mirror those in the so-called real world.

Here are the highlights of what Facebook found: . Who friends whom: More than 65% of friendships between 13-year-olds and their parents are initiated by the child. But the older the teenager gets, the less likely he or she is to be the one sending the friend request. By the time kids are in their early to mid-20s, their parents are initiating friend requests with them 60% of the time. As kids grow into their 30s and 40s, however, they begin friending their parents more often again. ""This overall trend follows the rough arc of children seeking distance from their parents as they prepare to leave the nest, and then gradually gravitating back as they accomplish their own milestones in life,"" says the blog post. The secret online life of my sixth grader . Who talks to whom: Moms and dads initiate parent-child conversations more often than their teenage kids. For daughters, this imbalance evens out by the time they hit 30 and are messaging their parents as often as they receive messages in return. Sons, however, however, take twice as long -- until age 60 -- to come around. What they say: The data team studied hundreds of thousands of public Facebook messages between parents and children to identify the words and phrases that appeared most often. Based on the results, Mom and Dad are very proud of their kids. Among the most common phrases from parents: ""I'm so proud, ""all my heart,"" ""well done,"" ""proud of you"" and ""call me."" Moms and dads use language much differently when messaging with sons, though.

"(Time) -- Facebook has started to roll out a new version of its Messenger app for Android that only requires a name and a phone number, not an actual Facebook account, to sign up. Although the new Facebook Messenger app is only available in a handful of countries for now--Australia, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Venezuela--it will eventually roll out to the United States and elsewhere, allowing users to chat with their phone contacts even if they're not using Facebook. This news has set the tech world atwitter with proclamations that the new Messenger is an assault on the lowly text message (including one such proclamation from Facebook itself). It's a nice thought, at least. Given that a single text to your neighbor can cost more than a data transmission from Mars, who wouldn't relish the idea of wireless carriers getting their comeuppance? In reality, though, standard SMS has a lot going for it, and will likely weather all kinds of assaults, especially one from Facebook. For one thing, Facebook Messenger faces the same adoption hurdle as other Internet-based messaging apps like WhatsApp and Viber: It requires a conscious decision not to use traditional SMS. With Facebook Messenger, you must first consider whether the recipient has Facebook installed, and is set up to receive notifications for new messages. Then, you must commit to using the Messenger app instead of your phone's built-in SMS functionality. Once you do that, the conversation is locked into Facebook unless you have one of the select Android phones that can integrate regular text messages. That's a lot to consider compared to the standard SMS, which is guaranteed to reach and alert the recipient as long as you have the right phone number. To truly threaten the text message, Facebook Messenger needs the kind of tight smartphone integration found in Apple's iMessage, which automatically replaces standard text messages between any two iPhone users. That's not really possible unless Facebook starts making its own smartphones. In lieu of tighter smartphone integration, Facebook simply has to compete with similar services that are already well-established. As Boy Genius Report points out, competitor WhatsApp is already a Top 5 messaging app in 141 countries and handles 10 billion messages per day. (Compare that to 7.8 trillion regular text messages sent in 2011, according to Portio Research, for an average of 21 billion messages per day.) Competition is good, but in this case it means users will be fragmented across multiple services that can't talk to one another. Ideally, these competing services would somehow find a way to work with each other, so a Facebook user could send a message to someone who uses Whatsapp or Viber. It sounds crazy, but considering that wireless carriers found a way to make it work with SMS, tech companies should be able to figure out a solution. I acknowledge that the need for SMS alternatives is more desperate outside the United States, where the price per message can be cost-prohibitive. But in the land of all-you-can-eat messaging, if you really need to reach someone, SMS remains the most reliable option, and Facebook Messenger only poses a minor threat. &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

"(CNN) -- A smartphone app has been launched to help save an Australian indigenous language that is in danger of disappearing. Its creators say the The Ma! Iwaidja free mobile phone app is the first phone app for an Australian indigenous language and aims to prevent the extinction of the Iwaidja language -- one of Australia's 100 endangered languages. It is spoken by less than 200 people on Croker Island, off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia. The app contains a 1,500-entry Iwaidja-English dictionary and a 450-entry phrase book that users can update. ""There has been an enthusiastic uptake of mobile phone technology in indigenous communities in Australia, so the idea is to capitalize on that,"" says linguist Bruce Birch, coordinator of the Minjilang Endangered Languages Publication project, which developed the app. ""People have their phones with them most of the time, the app is incredibly easy to use, and this allows data collection to happen spontaneously, opportunistically,"" he says. The school on Croker island has eight iPads with the app installed and the island's community store sells smartphones. The next phase of the project involves creating an online database with a web interface so that users can share entries they create. The team is also creating a new Iwaidja Dictionary app, which will focus on recording a range of information orally, allowing the user to avoid typing, Birch adds. ""We believe the tools we are developing will exponentially increase the involvement of the Indigenous people whose languages are threatened, without the need for difficult-to-attain levels of computer literacy,"" Birch says. Read related: Your smartphone is a pain in the neck . He is already working on apps for other endangered aboriginal languages. A phrase book app for Mawng and Kunwinjku will be available by early next year. An empty app is also in the pipeline, allowing people to collect data on any language. Until now endangered aboriginal languages were recorded in the presence of a linguist and selected native speakers with recording equipment, Birch says. Now, with the easy-to-operate app, indigenous people whose languages are threatened can record and upload languages at their own pace and at times which suit them, he says, without requiring the presence of a specialist holding a microphone. ""What we have found over the years is that one-way resources do not have much impact, especially on younger generations of speakers,"" Birch says. He adds: ""The ability provided by the tools we are developing to easily create, record and share language, images, and video, at the same time as building sustainable databases for future use, involves and empowers speakers of indigenous languages in a way which has not been possible before.""

In 2012 smartphone penetration in Australia shot up 40% to 52% of the population, making it the fourth-highest penetration in the world, after Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Norway, according a Google report. And Australia is currently among the top 30 countries in the world to generate revenue in the Apple App Store for iPhone, according to analysts Distimo. Ma! Iwaidja is just one example of a recent explosion in unusual smartphone apps developed for Australians. Those living Down Under can now use their phones to find the nearest lavatory, get rescued from earthquake rubble and even know how much sunscreen to wear. The National Public Toilet Map provides directions to the nearest five toilets to a user's location. The app was created as a project of the National Continence Management Strategy, funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and Aging, as an extension of www.toiletmap.gov.au to ""meet an immediate need for people away from their computer,"" explains Michael Rochford, director of Human Solutions Pty Ltd, the developer. The app provides details of 15,000 public and private latrines across Australia, including details on whether there is a baby change room, sharps disposal unit and sanitary disposal bin and whether the water is drinkable. ""Forty-two percent of our users are on mobile devices, with about half of those using the iPhone app. Downloads and usage are significant,"" Rochford says. Backpackers can ditch clumsy guide books and use smartphone apps to plan their trips around Australia using The Australia Planner, a free mobile application by Tourism Australia, while those playing non-elite sports can keep up to date with the results, league tables and schedules of their teams via the SportingPulse app. SunSmart, an app developed by Boosted Human, a Melbourne-based software consultancy, provides exact UV levels anywhere in Australia. Users choose their location in Australia and get alerted when UV levels there have reached dangerous levels. The app includes a calculator letting users know how much sunscreen they need to apply according to their body size. Earthquake Buddy, developed by The App Collective, based in Australia, can figure out your location if an earthquake above 5.5 Richter occurs. The app sends an automatic email showing a user's GPS-mapped location from a secure server to four chosen so-called ""Quake Buddies."" It even allows users to record a video or audio message to their loved ones to be played if they are never found and can function as a bright torch to help them if they are buried beneath the rubble. The Australian Mobile Phone Lifestyle Index, published in September 2012, found that 69% of respondents had installed an application to their mobile phone, half of them were using between two and five applications on average per week, while just over a third were using more than six applications. And the app market looks set to keep growing. According to a Deloitte study, the market for developing apps in Australia is expected to be worth more than half a billion dollars in the next three to five years.","Mobile app designed to preserve language now spoken by less than 200 people .

"(CNN) -- One of the nurses duped by a prank phone call about Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, apparently committed suicide on Friday, and many social media users were quick to point fingers at the two radio hosts who made the call and then promoted it on Facebook. Australian radio station 2DayFM posted audio of the call on its Facebook page Wednesday with the caption, ""Listen to the prank that the world is talking about. Can you believe Mel and MC got away with these dodgy accents?"" The hashtag #royalprank was retweeted more than 15,000 times on Twitter after the radio station began promoting the call. It continued to be used after news of the nurse's death. Catherine, the pregnant wife of Britain's Prince William, had been hospitalized with severe morning sickness. The prank became worldwide news as the nurse, believing the DJs were Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, forwarded the call to a second nurse who eventually revealed details of the former Kate Middleton's condition. Concerns over privacy and the media, which had surfaced in England during the News of the World scandal and again when topless photos taken of Catherine were published, were quickly reignited. But Prince Charles himself joked about the incident after being contacted by the radio station. News of the prank was also widely shared on social networks, with at least 5,000 links created and shared between Tuesday and Thursday. At the time, royal commentator Robert Jobson said he did not believe the radio call had been intended as a serious invasion of privacy. The hospital identified the nurse as Jacintha Saldanha. As news of her death spread, commenters flooded the 2DayFM Facebook page. A user named Gary Dawson posted, ""Shame for still having this sick call on website!! Shame on the DJs and shame on the radio station."" At 10:54 a.m. ET, 700 comments had been posted since Wednesday. By 11:15 a.m. ET, the number had risen to more than 1,100 and was still growing rapidly. The Facebook page Hot30 Countdown, also used to promote the two DJs, did not have a post about the prank, but that didn't stop people from commenting there. The 2DayFM posts, including the audio of the prank, were deleted by 11:41 a.m. Although it is unclear what scrutiny Saldanha had been under since the prank, the hospital said in a statement that it had been supporting her. Neither police nor the hospital had publicly blamed the radio station for Saldanha's death. But on Saturday the hospital released this statement: . ""King Edward VII's Hospital cares for sick people, and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients, let alone actually make the call,"" wrote hospital chairman Lord Glenarthur. Management's decision then to broadcast the recorded call ""was truly appalling,"" said Lord Glenarthur in the letter addressed to Max Moore-Wilton, chairman of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns the radio station. ""The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients. ""The longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is, frankly, tragic beyond words."" Lord Glenarthur called on the radio station to take steps ""to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated."" At St. James's Palace, a spokesman said, ""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Jacintha Saldanha."" The Twitter account for radio host Michael Christian (@MContheradio) had included five updates about the prank on Friday morning. By 11:22 a.m., the account had been deleted. The account for co-host Mel Greig (@MelGreigHot30) was also deleted. The station and its parent company, Southern Cross Austereo released the following: . ""Chief Executive Officer Rhys Holleran has spoken with the presenters, they are both deeply shocked and at this time we have agreed that they not comment about the circumstances. SCA and the hosts have decided that they will not return to their radio show until further notice out of respect for what can only be described as a tragedy."" The full statement was also posted to the 2Day FM Facebook page and in one hour received more than 4,400 comments and 234 shares. One comment linked to an online petition to fire Greig and Christian. At the time of this writing it had received 1,985 online signatures from around the world. The introduction states, ""Journalists should be held to higher standards."" But there were also calls for a step back from the immediate tragedy. ""Do you know why patriots like myself defend this kind of speech until my dying breath?"" posted a CNN commenter. ""To find that answer, ask yourself this: Who decides what kind of speech is appropriate or inappropriate? Who decides what kind of speech is offensive or not? What if you have the power to decide? At what point does an opinion that differs from yours become offensive to you? And what will be the penalty for my supposed offense? ""We can never afford to go down the road if defining right speech from wrong speech. It throws everything else into doubt and opens the doorway for tyrants and the fringe to persecute those who are not like minded. ""The nurse, for whatever personal reasons she might have clearly over-reacted. It is sad. But that is all it is. Nobody should be prosecuted or penalized over this."" Others fired back, arguing that not all speech is protected and that no one has immunity from the negative effects of reckless actions. Still others said the discussion was pointless, since ""Australia does not have explicit freedom of speech in any constitutional or statutory declaration of rights"" Another CNN commenter offered this: . ""Let us also remember that she was not a native English speaker - she was front line reception at a major international private hospital where ability in many languages is the priority, and those calling may be all of stressed, powerful, and arrogant - not people to be called upon to give references before being given assistance. And that could not have been changed simply because a UK royal was in the building. So the supposed point of the ""prank"" - Australian xenophobic mockery of an English accent - was actually a gross exhibition of cruel racism in a world far larger than they could apparently imagine, on top of a gross breach of medical privacy, data protection, and journalistic ethics, which the radio station should never have allowed, and no one should have re-broadcast."" ""Here's a social experiment for you,"" wrote James Breen on the Hot30 Countdown page. ""Try treating people with common decency and respect.""","Radio hosts blamed after nurse's death .

"(CNN) -- Apple has responded to complaints that some photos taken with the iPhone 5 show a purple flare, saying it happens to many smartphones when they're aimed near a light source like the sun. ""Most small cameras, including those in every generation of iPhone, may exhibit some form of flare at the edge of the frame when capturing an image with out-of-scene light sources,"" the company wrote in the support section of its website. ""This can happen when a light source is positioned at an angle (usually just outside the field of view) so that it causes a reflection off the surfaces inside the camera module and onto the camera sensor."" Apple suggested keeping bright light from shining into photos taken with the phone. Readers: Smartphone zombie apocalypse? ""Moving the camera slightly to change the position at which the bright light is entering the lens, or shielding the lens with your hand, should minimize or eliminate the effect,"" the post said. Not surprisingly, some users weren't satisfied with the response. ""You gotta be kidding me apple. You must be. Now I have to protect the camera with my hand when I want to take a picture?"" one user wrote in a thread on Apple's user forums. ""When a new iPhone comes out, I always buy it. If there is anyone from Apple reading this, I have to tell you that I am pretty disappointed with the product, for the first time. That's very bad."" Wrote another: ""This purpling has nothing to do with pointing the iPhone 5 at direct sunlight. You can see this purple is occurring in more than just the bright light scenarios."" Some have speculated that the problem is caused by a sapphire cover that Apple added to the phone's camera. ""The new iSight camera in iPhone 5 features a sapphire crystal lens cover that is thinner and more durable than standard glass with the ability to provide crystal clear images,"" Apple wrote in promotional material for the phone.

Released Septermber 21, the iPhone 5 has been Apple's biggest product launch to date, with more than 5 million sold over its first weekend on the market. But, as often is the case with new tech products, there have been a handful of persistent complaints about the iPhone 5. Among them, some users have said the phone's new aluminum casing scratches and dents easily. And Apple's new map app, which replaced Google Maps for the first time, has been so glitchy that CEO Tim Cook issued an apology. But, overall, reviews have been positive. And on Friday, respected product testers Consumer Reports gave the phone a thumbs-up, calling it the best iPhone yet after running a battery of tests. ""A larger, 4-inch display; a thinner and lighter profile; 4G LTE access; and a host of innovative features all helped the iPhone 5 move up in the ranks, surpassing not only the previous iPhone 4S but also a number of other new Android-based smart phones,"" CR wrote on its website. In its review, Consumer Reports actually gave high praise to the phone's 8-megapixel camera. Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs? ""In the full battery of tests we give to smartphone cameras, the iPhone 5's camera proved capable of capturing beautifully sharp and vibrant photos,"" the report read. CR also gave high marks to the phone's new turn-by-turn GPS navigation (a feature Android phones already had) and its larger 4-inch screen. Of the map app, Consumer Reports found it ""competent enough, even if it falls short of what's available for free on many other phones,"" and said it expects Apple to improve it.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- A Seattle, Washington, woman who accused illusionist David Copperfield of sexually assaulting her more than two years ago has now been charged with prostitution and making a false accusation in another case, according to Copperfield's attorney and Washington state officials. The federal probe of Copperfield was officially closed earlier this month. ""Local authorities have charged Mr. Copperfield's accuser with making yet another false claim of rape, this time against a Seattle-area businessman, and with prostitution,"" Copperfield lawyer Patty Eakes said Tuesday. King County, Washington, prosecutor Susan Irwin said in criminal complaints filed Monday that Lacey Carroll committed the alleged offenses on December 2, 2009. ""These developments vindicate Mr. Copperfield and confirm what he has said all along -- this woman tried to extort money from him by making a false claim,"" Eakes said. ""Thankfully, authorities have now stepped in to stop her."" The investigation of Copperfield became public in October 2007 when FBI agents raided a warehouse owned by Copperfield in Las Vegas, Nevada. Investigators hauled away a computer hard drive and a memory chip from a digital camera system, as well as $2 million in cash that was inside a safe, sources close to the probe said. Federal agents also searched the Hollywood Theater at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, where Copperfield performed, a hotel spokesman said. A Seattle police spokesman told CNN the investigation began when the woman filed a police report concerning an incident that allegedly took place in the Bahamas in the summer of 2007. His lawyer at the time called it a false allegation and said ""Mr. Copperfield's reputation precedes him as an impeccable gentleman."" The 53-year-old performs in Las Vegas and around the world, has starred in TV specials, and was named a ""living legend"" by the Library of Congress. Despite the accusation, Copperfield continued to sell out large arenas around the United States, according to Forbes Magazine, which estimated he earned $30 million last year. He was once engaged to model Claudia Schiffer. According to his Web site, Copperfield began performing professionally at age 12 ""and became the youngest person ever to be admitted to the Society of American Magicians.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two men pleaded not guilty Wednesday to felony charges related to the brutal beating of San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow after a Los Angeles Dodgers game in March. Late Wednesday, prosecutors announced they won't charge a woman who's the sister to one defendant and the girlfriend to the other because they don't have enough evidence against her, a spokeswoman said. During their arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Marvin Norwood, 30, and Louie Sanchez, 29, both of Rialto, California, were ordered by the judge to remain in custody in lieu of $500,000 bail each. Meanwhile, Dorene Virginia Sanchez, 31, who is Sanchez's sister and the live-in girlfriend of Norwood, won't be charged, said spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. ""There's not sufficient evidence,"" Gibbons told CNN. She was taken into custody last month with her brother and boyfriend. Police allege that the two men kicked and punched Stow and then fled in a car driven by a woman. The two men withdrew their earlier request for a bond reduction Wednesday, said Gilbert Quinones, Sanchez's attorney. Quinones said the withdrawal ""was best"" for his client in the high-profile case, but the defendants can renew the request later. Authorities have also kept the two defendants from taking showers, having visitors and making phone calls -- which was done ""for their own protection"" while in jail, Quinones said. But the attorneys for the two defendants told the court Wednesday they would file requests to have those activities restored. The two men are each charged with mayhem, assault and battery, and all three charges are felonies, according to the complaint provided by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the March 31 beating in the parking lot of Dodgers Stadium after a game between the Giants and the Dodgers. Stow remained in serious condition Wednesday at San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said. Sanchez is also charged with two misdemeanor counts -- one for battery and the other for assault -- against one person inside the ballpark and another person in the stadium parking lot on the same day, according to court documents provided by prosecutors. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Upinder S. Kalra denied a media request Wednesday to have cameras in the courtroom because, he said, the identification issues surrounding the two men as defendants ""are unresolved."" But the judge allowed journalists to make an audio recording of Wednesday's court proceeding. During arguments about the media's camera request, Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Frank Santoro told the court that authorities have statements from the defendants that prosecutors used to file charges. One is a direct statement from Norwood, and the other is a surreptitiously obtained statement by Sanchez, Santoro said. Santoro also said that only one of about 20 witnesses identified Sanchez as allegedly being involved in the beating, but no witnesses have identified Norwood at the crime scene. Asked about the alleged statements made by the defendants, Quinones said: ""You know, assertions are made in a case. Making assertions and proving them are two different things."" Quinones also said that Wednesday was the first time he heard that authorities have only one witness identifying Sanchez at the alleged crime scene. ""That's a good piece of information to have,"" Quinones told reporters. ""At this point, like I said, I'm waiting for further discovery."" Quinones said prosecutors still have to turn over 25 binders of information about the case, including video and audiotapes and photographs. So far, he has seen only about 20 pages and added that prosecutors just gave him Wednesday a copy of the grand jury transcript that he understood included testimony by Sanchez's sister. ""My understanding is that the family is close, and they have a good relationship,"" Quinones said of Sanchez and his sister. The two defendants' next court hearing is September 30, the judge said. Sanchez and Norwood were arrested at their San Bernardino County homes on July 21. Earlier this week, Stow's family reported on their website that Stow showed the most response yet since the beating on the Dodgers' home opener: He lifted his left leg slightly when asked and raised his left arm every time family members asked if they could hold his hand. ""And the best part?"" the family website said Monday. ""Bonnie (Stow's sister) asked Bryan if she could have a kiss and every time she asked him, he puckered his lips. The final time when she was leaving, Bonnie asked again for a kiss. Bryan turned his head towards her, puckered his lips for the kiss, then turned his head back. The nurse was shocked and excited to see that!"" The website then added: ""Side note from Bonnie: I have never, in my 32 years, thought I would kiss my brother on the lips, let alone that many times. But can't wait to do it again! ""Side note from Erin (another sister): I couldn't be there to see it, but I never thought I would be jealous of my brother kissing my sister on the lips ... regardless, I am chapsticking up for my next visit.""","NEW: A woman who's the sister of one defendant won't be charged, prosecutor's office says .

"Woodbridge, Virginia (CNN) -- Ballistics test results link four shootings at U.S. military facilities in the Washington suburbs in October, and investigators are probing whether a new case at a Coast Guard recruiting office is related, police in Virginia said Tuesday. The latest incident was reported Tuesday morning after a bullet struck the recruiting office, housed in a Woodbridge strip mall. The description is ""relatively similar"" to October cases in which shots were fired at the Pentagon, the National Museum of the Marine Corps and a vacant Marine recruiting station, said 1st Sgt. Kim Chinn, spokeswoman for Prince William County police. ""Employees of the Coast Guard recruiting station called to tell us there was some damage to the glass, and police arrived and determined it was probably done by a bullet,"" Chinn said. She said the shooting left a mark on the glass. ""It did not penetrate the glass, more like a graze,"" she said. No one has been injured in any of the incidents, which include one in which six shots were fired at the Pentagon early on October 19. Ballistics tests have connected that incident to shots aimed at the Marine museum on October 17 and 29, as well as to an October 25 case in which shots were fired at a Marine Corps recruiting station in Chantilly, near Washington Dulles International Airport. Chinn would not say how many bullets were found at the scene Tuesday. The Coast Guard referred questions to the FBI, saying it is taking the lead in the investigation. The FBI said it has sent personnel to the recruiting center. The Pentagon Force Protection Agency has declined comment on the shooting. CNN's Brian Todd, Adam Levine, Padma Rama, Mike Ahlers and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Ballistics link 4 previous attacks on military facilities .

"(CNN) -- The teenager accused of gunning down his parents and three siblings in their New Mexico home had hoped to go on a killing spree and die in a shootout with police, investigators said Tuesday. Nehemiah Griego, 15, will stand trial as an adult in the weekend killings, prosecutors announced. He was arrested Saturday night, after deputies found the bodies of his mother, father, brother and two of his sisters in their home on the outskirts of Albuquerque. Griego told investigators he hoped to end his spree ""at a Walmart, with mass destruction,"" Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston told reporters. Griego told investigators he was ""frustrated with his mother,"" but ""he did not articulate that to our investigators any further or give any explanation of that at all,"" Houston said. Three reported shot on Texas college campus . ""This is beyond any human reasoning or understanding at this time,"" he said. The teen had been scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face two counts of murder and three counts of child abuse resulting in death, but the hearing was waived, according to CNN affiliate KOAT reported. The station said Griego's case will go to a grand jury in 10 days. Houston said the arrest came after Griego went to the family's church with his girlfriend, to whom he had sent a picture of his slain mother, and a staff member called deputies. The youth's father, Greg Griego, was a former pastor at an Albuquerque church and a chaplain to the city's fire department who also worked with prisoners. He's believed to have been the last of the victims, gunned down about 5 a.m. Saturday when he came home from working the graveyard shift at a homeless shelter, Houston said. The killings had begun about four hours earlier, when Nehemiah Griego shot and killed his mother, Sarah Griego, while she slept. The shot from the .22-caliber rifle woke his 9-year-old brother Zephania, who had been asleep next to her, an arrest affidavit recounted. KRQE: Complaint details horrific murders . When the teen told Zephania that their mother was dead, ""Nehemiah stated his brother did not believe him,"" the affidavit states. ""So Nehemiah picked up his mother's head to show his brother her bloody face. Nehemiah stated his brother became upset, so he shot his brother in the head with the same rifle used to kill his mother."" After that, ""Nehemiah stated he lost his sense of conscience"" and went on to kill his sisters, 5-year-old Jael and 2-year-old Angelina, police said. After the slayings, Griego ""spent the majority of the day with his girlfriend,"" whose conduct remains a focus of the investigation, Houston said. Most of the victims were shot with the .22, but a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle was also used in the killings, sheriff's Lt. Sid Covington said. The Griegos had five other grown children, none of whom lived at home, Covington said. Police said in a statement the weapons appear to have been purchased legally.","NEW: Initial court appearance for 15-year-old suspect waived .

""I decided that there were two groups of people in life,"" Haynes said. ""Those people who went out and did and do, and those who dream about it and never really accomplish anything. I decided to be a doer."" Now 47, Haynes has backpacked through Europe -- three times. She's been to the top of Machu Picchu in Peru. She's gone to China, New York City and a Yankees game. She has sung at the famous Cavern Club in Liverpool where the Beatles first met their manager, and she's seen the Iditarod sled dog race in Alaska. ""I don't want to get to my dying breath and wish I had done something,"" Haynes said. ""I want to get to my dying breath and say 'I did it. I overcame it. I became it.' No regrets."" The recent death of Dave Freeman, co-author of ""100 Things to Do Before You Die,"" after hitting his head in a fall prompted iReport.com to ask users about places they don't want to miss.

"Blacksburg,Va. (CNN) -- When it comes to recruiting, Virginia Tech's athletics department is taking an ""if we build it, they will come"" approach, with plans to construct a new $20 million indoor practice facility for its football and other sports teams near Lane Stadium on the university campus. The Hokies have the third-longest college bowl game streak in the country, and have sold out every game since 1998. However, they have yet to win a national championship. The athletics department hopes a state-of-the-art facility nearer to the football stadium could help change that. There's only one problem: A densely wooded area chock full of old-growth trees, some older than the United States itself, is in the way. Blueprint plans that have been in the works for over a decade would require chopping down at least 60 trees over the age of 150. Six of the trees have been found to be more than 300 years old. A group called Friends of Stadium Woods and Virginia Tech professor John Seiler are determined not to let those trees come down. Seiler, a professor of forest biology and a tree physiology specialist, has dedicated his entire career to the university and often takes his students into these 11 acres of woods to teach. So when he was told by university administration officials that they believed no tree in the woods was more than 80 years old and the new facility site was a ""done deal,"" Seiler decided to do something about it. In January, he bought a large increment borer -- a tool used to extract a section of wood from a living tree used to determine its age -- and took a walk into the familiar woods. After testing a few trees, he discovered something amazing. ""This was like catching a big fish for me,"" he said, pointing to a small slice of wood in his office. ""That wood was formed from carbon dioxide in the air, turned into wood by photosynthesis, in 1697."" Seiler believes the forest is a national treasure and should be saved. ""The forest is in fact an endangered species in the United States. It's literally the rarest type of forest structure left in the United States."" Armed with the tree-testing evidence, Seiler hoped the discussion would end right then and there, that the athletics department would consider building at another location. Instead, they pushed back, insisting on moving forward on the original plans. Virginia Tech President Dr. Charles W. Steger in January appointed an ad hoc committee to hear the arguments and make a recommendation on whether the facility should be built as planned or at at alternate location. Steger took his own walk through the woods but confessed he couldn't tell the significance or the age of the trees. ""I'm not qualified to judge. ... I can't tell the age of a tree. I forget my own birthday on occasion,"" the president joked. ""So, we'll see what the report has to say and at the end of the day we'll do the right thing."" The committee has been holding closed-door sessions for months now. John Randolph, a professor of urban affairs and planning, chairs the committee and acknowledges the school faces a ""conflict of value."" ""We're a big-time football school and a lot of people care about that,"" Randolph said. ""We are also a green university. We're (among) Princeton Review's 'Top 16 Green Universities' and we're a Tree Campus USA designee."" The committee surveyed faculty members and staff on campus and found most were in favor of saving the trees. The sentiment for preserving the woods is ""pretty clear and pretty overwhelming,"" Randolph said. ""Very few have indicated that athletics should probably decide where this should go."" Still, committee members have continued to meet to balance that perceived majority opinion with the importance of the new facility. ""Success begets success. Fundraising, new facilities and trying to be competitive in a very competitive football environment -- an indoor practice facility is kind of a key part of that element,"" Randolph said. ""A lot of the big schools are adding them."" According to George Schroeder, college football contributor for Sports Illustrated, close-by practice facilities are essential to college athletics programs' recruiting. ""A lot of other programs have smaller, convenient, localized facilities. If you can stick it closer it helps recruiting,"" Schroeder said. ""But the buzzword is efficiency. It's the idea of let's have everything in a central location and try to squeeze the most into their day."" Seiler said he and other advocates for the forest ""are not against this facility at all. We're simply saying you need to put it in the alternate location, which doesn't have to cut a single tree."" He was referring to a suggested spot, right next to the woods, that is currently occupied by tennis courts, but not all students like that idea. ""You use the tennis courts a lot more than I see people using the trees and hanging around the trees,"" recent Tech graduate Alex Foldenauer said. A less preferable alternative would be the area where a large parking lot is currently situated, but the campus has a critical need for parking and the space is already set aside for a future parking garage, said Randolph, the committee chairman. Randolph said the opposing sides might ""have to give a little on the edges, but if their core values can be represented, that's the idea."" With signs urging ""Save Stadium Woods"" placed in yards throughout Blacksburg, and an online petition signed by more than 9,000 people across the country, Seiler and members of Friends of Stadium Woods hope public sentiment will sway the committee. But they are also preparing for the chance that the committee recommends building at the stadium woods location and are willing to go to extreme lengths if they have to. ""There will be things that we can do if they decide to site it in the woods,"" Rebekah Paulson, executive director of Friends of Stadium Woods says. ""Like chaining people to trees and putting people up in the trees."" Seiler noted that the committee recommendation is not binding. ""The administration can make a different decision and the board of visitors will have the final say,"" he said. The committee plans to deliver their final report to university Vice President Sherwood Wilson by Friday. Wilson will then prepare his recommendations to Steger, and the university's Board of Visitors will be briefed by Randolph on Monday.","Virginia Tech wants to build a new, $20 million indoor sports facility .

"(EW.com) -- NBC may be creatively reviving ""The Office"" for its final season, but it looks like many fans aren't yet willing to give the comedy another shot. The veteran series â€” NBC's highest-rated scripted show last season â€” returned Thursday night to not only its lowest premiere rating ever, but the show matched its lowest-rated episode ever. ""The Office"" had 4.3 million viewers and a 2.1 rating among adults 18-49, down a whopping 46 percent in the demo from last fall. I figured the show would be down from its last premiere given how much its ratings dropped midseason. But this big of a drop is surprising considering how little competition was on the air and how much pre-season momentum NBC has had lately. Thursday also marked the return of NBC's ""Up All Night"" (3.1 million, 1.3), down 46 percent, and ""Parks and Recreation"" (3.5 million, 1.7), down 19 percent for its lowest-rated premiere yet. The network's ""SNL Election Special"" (5.2 million, 1.6) was modest and ""Rock Center with Brian Williams"" (4.1 million, 1.1) was down 21 percent. One of the biggest surprises in the fall schedule was that NBC didn't change this lineup considering how much it was struggling last season. NBC was in third place last night â€” and CBS and ABC haven't even launched their fall lineups yet. The Peacock has had a great few weeks launching freshman series like apocalyptic drama ""Revolution"" and Matthew Perry's comedy ""Go On,"" as well as maintaining ""The Voice"" (See: Can NBC's fall ratings winning streak continue?), but last night suggests the network is going to have a rough time on Thursdays this fall. Over on Fox, more good news for ""The X Factor"" (9.9 million, 3.4). The reality competition jumped 10 percent from last Thursday. The second week of ""Glee"" (7.4 million, 2.9), however, took a slight dip, down 6 percent in the demo.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian negotiators agreed to give up large swaths of East Jerusalem to Israel during negotiations dating back to 2008, the Al-Jazeera network said Sunday, suggesting Palestinians have been willing to offer much larger concessions in private than what was previously acknowledged in public. The report is based on a trove of nearly 1,700 internal documents the network said it had obtained. Al-Jazeera did not disclose the source of the material, nor did it say how the documents came into its possession. It said it will be releasing what it has between Sunday and Wednesday of this week. The papers, some of which were posted on the network's website, shed new light on the details of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 1999 through last year. They could not be immediately verified by CNN. The documents outline meetings between Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials in which Palestinian negotiators offered in 2008 to relinquish claims on nearly all of the settlements built in East Jerusalem. The offer was flatly rejected by the Israeli side, according to the posted documents. Israel seized the eastern half of the city following war with its Arab neighbors in 1967 and considers Jerusalem its sovereign capital. This is a claim rejected by the international community that considers Israeli building in East Jerusalem to be illegal. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital for their future state. The leaked documents could prove to be politically damaging for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Officials from the Ramallah-based government have consistently condemned growing Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and disclosures that Palestinians officials were willing to make offers that would allow Israeli construction to continue are likely to be seized on by their critics. In one leaked document from 2010, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat is quoted as telling a U.S. state department official, ""Israelis want the two-state solution but they don't trust. They want it more than you think, sometimes more than the Palestinians. What is in that paper (that) gives them the biggest (Jerusalem) in Jewish history ... what more can I give?"" In addition to details about concessions made on the issue of East Jerusalem, Al-Jazeera reported that Palestinian officials also offered compromise positions on sensitive issues like the right of return of Palestinian refugees and control of the Temple Mount, which houses the Al-Aqsa mosque, one of the most important sites in Islam. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's news agency, quoted President Abbas telling newspaper editors in Cairo Sunday that he did not know where Al-Jazeera got its information and that there was nothing new to report. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Sunday night the United States is looking into the purported leak to Al-Jazeera. ""The U.S. government is reviewing the alleged Palestinian documents released by Al-Jazeera. We cannot vouch for their veracity,"" he tweeted.","Al-Jazeera: It has nearly 1,700 leaked documents related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .

"(CNN) -- Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers University student convicted of bias intimidation, appeared in court Wednesday, one day after he apologized for spying on his roommate with a webcam. ""I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010, and September 21, 2010,"" Ravi said in a written statement. His court appearance Wednesday formalized his decision to head to jail Thursday, waiving his right not to serve jail time twice for the same crime, as prosecutors appeal his sentence. New Jersey prosecutors argue that the former student's crimes warranted more than a 30-day jail term and called Superior Judge Glenn Berman's sentence ""insufficient under the sentencing laws of this state."" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said there is ""very little chance"" the sentence will be overturned on appeal. He noted that under New Jersey law, the judge had the flexibility to sentence Ravi to anything from zero to 10 years in prison. Ravi was handed a 30-day jail sentence, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. He also must pay more than $11,000 in restitution. ""I decided to accept and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible. It's the only way I can go on with my life,"" Ravi said in his statement. His attorney said he intends to begin community service after he serves his sentence and will start paying his fines in August.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Korean is considered one of the hardest languages in the world to master, but an elephant in a South Korean zoo is making a good start. Koshik, a 22-year-old Asian elephant has stunned experts and his keepers at Everland Zoo near Seoul by imitating human speech. Koshik can say the Korean words for ""hello,"" ""sit down,"" ""no,"" ""lie down"" and ""good."" His trainer, Kim Jong Gap, first started to realize Koshik was mimicking him several years ago. """"In 2004 and 2005, Kim didn't even know that the human voice he heard at the zoo was actually from Koshik,"" zoo spokesman In Kim In Cherl said. ""But in 2006, he started to realize that Koshik had been imitating his voice and mentioned it to his boss."" Why do elephants have hair on their heads? His boss initially called him ""crazy."" Koshik's remarkable antics grabbed the interest of an elephant vocalization expert thousands of kilometers away at the University of Vienna in Austria. """"There was a YouTube video about Koshik vocalizing, and I was not sure if it was a fake, or if it was real,"" Dr. Angela Stoeger-Horwath said. She traveled with fellow expert Dr. Daniel Mietchen to South Korea in 2010 to test the elephant's ability. They recorded Koshik repeating certain words his keeper said and then played them for native Korean speakers to see, if they were recognizable. ""It is, for some of the sounds he makes, quite astonishing for how similar they are,"" said Mietchen of the University of Jena in Germany. ""For instance the word 'choa' (meaning good) -- if you hear it right after what the keeper says -- it's quite similar."" The findings have been published in the journal Current Biology this week and describe how Koshik places the tip of his trunk into his mouth to produce his convincing impression of a human voice. Koshik was born in captivity in 1990 and was transferred to Everland Zoo a few years later. From the age of 5 to 12 there were no other elephants with Koshik at the zoo, and his only interaction was with humans. The researchers believe Koshik may have learned certain words out of necessity ""to cement social bonds.""

"(CNN) -- On an island chain located halfway between Africa and Argentina, local authorities say a massive penguin rescue operation is under way. A mix of island officials and resident volunteers are struggling to save tens of thousands of Northern Rockhopper penguins threatened by an oil spill in the remote stretches of the south Atlantic, roughly 1,500 miles west of Cape Town, South Africa. The islands' conservation director said at least 300 penguins have died after a cargo ship leaked thousands of tons of heavy oil, diesel fuel and soya bean near Nightingale Island, a British territory part of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago. ""I've seen about 15 to 20 dead penguins just today,"" director Trevor Glass said. Thousands more are covered in the ships' oil and diesel fuel, according to local officials and conservationists. ""The danger now is getting the rest of these penguins past that oil slick,"" Glass said. The rescue operation began shortly after March 16, when the M.S. Oliva -- a Maltese-registered ship -- ran aground, fracturing its hull and ultimately splitting the vessel in two. The ship was heading from Santos, Brazil, to Singapore and had been carrying 60,000 metric tons of soya beans and 1,500 metric tons of heavy fuel, according to islands' administrator Sean Burns and Transport Malta, the Maltese shipping authority. The agency said in a statement that it ""is investigating the grounding and subsequent complete hull failure"" of the bulk carrier cargo ship. The dramatic rescue of the ship's 22 crew members was captured on video, along with the spills' aftermath, which showed penguins soaked in heavy oil. It was shot by an expedition team from an eco-tourism ship -- whose crew used inflatable boats to help ferry the sailors to safety, according to David E. Guggenheim of the Washington-based Ocean Foundation. Guggenheim witnessed the rescue aboard the vessel, called the Prince Albert II. Since then, an oil sheen has surrounded the island chain, which officials say could lead to an environmental disaster. Rescue workers, using inflatable watercraft and fishing vessels, are now ferrying penguins to a series of makeshift rehabilitation centers at the main island of Tristan da Cunha, according to Glass. There, he added, conservationists and volunteers are working in an effort to nurse the blackened penguins back to health. ""We need help,"" said Katrine Herian, a spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds who is also apart of the ongoing rescue effort. ""The priority is to get food into the birds as they are very hungry,"" she said. ""We are trying locally caught fish and some are starting to take small half-inch squares of the food."" Herian noted that some of the islands' residents had emptied their personal freezers in an effort to help feed the animals. By Friday, Glass said his team had corralled and transported a total of nearly 5,000 penguins, despite harsh winds and high seas that had hampered earlier rescue attempts. But the timing of their task is daunting. The shipwreck, having occurred at the end of the birds' molting season -- a period during which penguins shed their feathers, do not eat and largely stay out of the water -- left the birds ""at their weakest possible state,"" Guggenheim explained. ""They're very hungry."" The season's end also marks the beginning of a period when penguins re-enter the sea, now laden with heavy oil and soya beans. In a written statement, Tristin da Cunha administrator Burns said it is unclear what the impact of the ship's cargo will have on the local marine environment, particularly ""any long-term effect on the economically valuable fishing industry for crawfish, crayfish or Tristan Rock Lobster ... which is the mainstay of Tristan da Cunha's economy."" Fewer than 300 people live on the island chain, eclipsed by the its massive penguin population -- estimated at 150,000 -- which accounts for roughly 40 percent of the world's total, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a global network of conservationists. The Northern Rockhopper penguin had been listed as ""one of the world's most threatened species of penguin,"" according to the RSPB.","Rescuers are struggling to save tens of thousands of Northern Rockhopper penguins .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- An estimated 10,000 Argentines marched on the historic Plaza de Mayo in the capital, Buenos Aires, on Wednesday to demand more anti-crime measures, reflecting a top priority among Argentines, according to recent polls. Graciela Lopez takes part in the march on Wednesday. Her 16-year-old son was killed by a drunk driver in 2007. There were other anti-crime marches throughout Argentina on Wednesday night, as well. At least three police officers have been killed in Buenos Aires in recent weeks, and other high-profile crimes have grabbed the nation's attention. An employee of Argentina's most famous TV talk-show host, Susana Gimenez, was killed last month. That prompted Gimenez to call for the return of the death penalty. The death penalty was outlawed in Argentina in 1984, a year after the country's military ended its seven-year dictatorship, during which some 30,000 people were killed. Organizers used the Internet to mobilize people, setting up a Web page asking Congress to declare a national security emergency, and creating a Facebook page for the march. More than 106,000 people signed up as ""friends."" Those gathered in the Plaza de Mayo -- many carrying photos of their dead loved ones -- asked their leaders to act against rising crime. ""We need to scream loud, so our president can hear us. All social classes are being affected by this crime wave. There needs to be sanctions for those responsible for this insecurity,"" said Graciela Lopez, 43, whose 16-year-old son was killed by a drunk driver in 2007. A small-business owner who was robbed in November echoed Lopez's sentiments: . ""The police patrol cars hardly ever pass by. We are surrounded by delinquents. Our kids can't even take the bus to school without being worried about being assaulted. We are here to ask the government to get aware of what is happening to us, and that our president finds an answer for this insecurity,"" said Liliana Peyrera, 41, who owns an ice cream shop in the Buenos Aires suburb of La Tablada. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has been criticized for not focusing enough on crime. Her justice minister has defended the government's efforts, saying Argentina has one of the lowest murder rates in South America. ""The government -- from the president to the senators to the judges -- they need to comply and uphold the laws that exist. We don't need new laws; we need to prosecute people that break the law,"" said Jorge Quiroga, 62, a mechanic who attended the march with his wife.","Buenos Aires rally is largest of various anti-crime protests across Argentina .

"(CNN) -- Despite its xenophobic, anti-immigration campaign tactics, Switzerland's far-right Swiss People's Party, which took the largest share of votes four years ago in Swiss modern history, suffered losses in Sunday's parliamentary vote as voters chose more moderate parties over polarizing candidates. The Conservative Democrats and the Liberal Greens -- more moderate parties -- were the clear winners of Sunday's vote, signaling a change in the nation's heavily polarized political scene. According to Swissinfo.ch, the nations' public broadcaster and pollsters, near-final results showed the People's Party taking a considerable drop, but still ahead of the center-left Social Democrats. The two traditional center-right parties, the Radicals and the Christian Democrats are also down 3% and 1.5% respectively, Swissinfo.ch reported. The far-right People's Party's loss came as a surprise to many who expected the far-right's scare campaign tactics to succeed once again. A poster in the German-speaking part of the country shows black boots marching over the Swiss flag. One in French-speaking areas shows a condom plastered over the European Union's banner, proclaiming ""Swiss protection against the European virus."" The anti-immigrant party looked to repeat its 2007 election victory, with pre-election opinion polls putting it in first place as voters cast ballots Sunday for the federal parliament. A Eurobarometer survey this month put the party, known as the SVP, far ahead of its main rivals, with just under a third of people saying they would back it. The Social Democrats were in second place, with about 20% support in pre-election polls, followed by the FDP Liberals, the Christian Democrats and the Greens. The People's Party won the biggest election victory in Swiss history in 2007, after a controversial campaign that blamed foreigners for much of the country's crime. The nationalist party rode a wave of anti-immigration sentiment to gain 29% of the vote -- about the same that it was getting in opinion polls ahead of the election. Switzerland's political system requires consensus, making radical government policies unlikely, regardless of the election results. But anti-immigrant sentiment helped fuel a 2009 ban on the construction of minarets, the towers usually built next to mosques for the traditional call to prayer. The SVP campaigned against minaret building in the national referendum, arguing that minarets are political symbols and therefore go against the the country's constitution. The party's campaign included fliers featuring a veiled woman against a background of a Swiss flag pierced by several minarets resembling missiles. The Federal Commission against Racism denounced the posters, saying they ""defame Switzerland's peaceful Muslim population, feed prejudice and portray the Muslim community as wanting to dominate Switzerland, oppress women and trample on fundamental rights."" Four years ago, the SVP ran an ad campaign featuring a poster of a white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag. The party also called for immigrant families to be thrown out of the country if their children committed a crime. But while voters gave the People's Party the biggest win in recent years in 2007, they also elected the first black politician to the National Council . Ricardo Lumengo, who accused the SVP of ""scapegoating,"" came to Switzerland as an asylum seeker from Angola. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","NEW: The anti-immigration People's Party suffered losses in parliamentary elections Sunday .

"(Mashable) -- Now that Google Drive is finally a reality, how does it stack up against the cloud competition? Google's new cloud-based document and storage solution is priced aggressively and boasts best-in-class integration with other Google services -- including Google Docs. As you can see from our hands-on, Google Drive is an impressive product. Still, the cloud storage and collaboration space is more competitive than ever before. Google faces competition not just from cloud companies such as Box and Dropbox, but from Apple, Microsoft and Amazon as well. Storage and Pricing . Google is pricing Google Drive at a VERY aggressive level. For $30 a year ($2.50 a month), users get 25GB to use for Google Drive and Picasa, plus 25GB of Gmail storage. This is more than what Amazon and Microsoft charge for an additional 20GB, but less than the price of Dropbox, Apple and Box.net. For $60 a year ($5 a month), Google offers 100GB of Drive and Picasa storage (plus 25GB for Gmail), which clocks in below Amazon, Apple, Dropbox and Box.net. For penny pinchers, Microsoft's offer of 100GB of additional storage -- on top of the 7 or 25GB that users already get with the service -- is just $50 a year. Dropbox and Box are among the more expensive services. In the case of Box, the company's real focus is on business users. In fact, the company has told us on multiple occasions that its focus isn't so much on Dropbox, but on Microsoft SharePoint. A 100GB Dropbox account costs more than three times what a Google Drive account costs. In this area, Google is clearly trying to undermine its competition on a per-GB pricing basis. Box's pricing is also significantly higher than Google Drive; however, that differentiation is also part of the company's focus. As Box has told us on multiple occasions, it wants to replace Microsoft SharePoint in the SMB and Enterprise space. While Google is also looking in this direction, Box has a bevy of services and integrations that are focused on replacing a company's central file server. Upload Limit . The most limiting factor of the majority of cloud storage and collaboration services isn't the total amount of storage -- it's the limitations on upload size. Google has an impressive 10GB limit on files or folders. This is significantly more than the 2GB limit imposed by most cloud services. Only Dropbox's desktop apps for Mac, Windows and Linux do better. With Dropbox, the only limitation is the size of a storage plan. Collaboration and Sharing . Like Microsoft's SkyDrive and Box, Google Drive offers in-browser access to files and folders, including document editing via Google Docs. And like SkyDrive, Box and iCloud, third-party applications can plug into Google Drive to retrieve or store files. This makes keeping apps synchronized across devices and platforms much more seamless. Mobile Integration . Although Google Drive's Android app is already around, Google is making iOS users wait for access to the app. This is in contrast to Dropbox, Box and SkyDrive, which all offer official or unofficial solutions for multiple mobile platforms. Amazon and Apple are behind in the mobile access game. Apple makes iCloud exclusively available to iOS 5 users, and Amazon's Cloud Drive only integrates with Android (and the integration is limited at that). Desktop Integration . Part of the reason that Dropbox has such a loyal following is because of its fantastic Desktop integration. Mac, Windows and Linux users can automatically sync and share files from their native file systems without having to bother with desktop uploads. This is a similar approach to the one Box has taken with its Box Sync service for Windows, and to what Microsoft employs for SkyDrive for Windows and Mac. Google Drive's desktop app works essentially the same as SkyDrive -- in other words, it isn't as tightly coupled with the file system as Dropbox, but it does the job. Final Thoughts . Which cloud storage service an individual or business decides to use is a decision that should encompass more than just comparing specs and pricing. Take time to use a service and see how it integrates into your workflow before plunking down cash on an upgrade. For users and businesses heavily tied to Google Docs, Google Drive will likely make sense. For those that love Dropbox or need some of Box's more robust features, Google Drive might not fit the bill. For Microsoft Office users, consider giving Microsoft SkyDrive a try -- it works well and also offers online access to basic web and editing apps. Ultimately, neither offering from Apple nor Amazon is likely to compete with Google Drive -- the products are focused on different use cases. We'd also like to give Canonical's Ubuntu One a shout-out. We didn't include it in our direct comparison because of its more limited options, but for Windows and Ubuntu users, its free service is worth a look as well.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of protesters amassed in Madrid and other Spanish cities on Saturday to voice their anger over harsh austerity and the way the country's being run in the wake of its financial crisis. In Madrid, demonstrations turned violent and two police officers were injured, Spanish national police said on Twitter. Forty people were arrested. Madrid, Barcelona, Seville and Zaragoza were just a handful of the cities where big crowds conducted mass protests, dubbed the ""Marea Cuidadana"" (Tide of Citizens). Members of workers' unions and civil society groups joined forces to swell their numbers. The crowds were dressed in colored shirts indicating what sector they work in. Ahead of the marches, organizers used the hashtags #MareaCiudadana, #F23 and #YoVoy23F on Twitter to help protesters link up. Read more: Welcome to Madrid, city of protests . Many in Spain have been struggling since the global financial crisis knocked the bottom out of the country's housing market and sparked a major recession that left thousands jobless. The country's unemployment rate stands at 26% -- its highest level ever -- and the situation is even worse for young people, with more than 55% of 16- to 24-year-olds out of work. With no income, many are finding themselves unable to afford the mortgage payments on homes that are no longer worth the prices paid for them. The situation has compelled growing numbers to demonstrate against what they see as the gross unfairness of everyday life in Spain in 2013, where struggling citizens are evicted, even as hundreds of homes lie empty. In recent weeks, allegations of high-level corruption in Spain's ruling conservative Popular Party have added to popular anger over the way the country is being run. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has strongly denied that he or other top conservatives have for years accepted secretive cash payments from the party. Gloria Rodriguez, a 49-year-old high school teacher who marched with fellow educators in the capital, Madrid, told CNN there are ""many reasons"" to demonstrate against the government. Its cuts, not only to Spain's education budget but also to spending on health, justice and social programs, seem designed to ""prevent the state being one that takes care of its citizens,"" she said. ""I feel that people are getting angrier and angrier, not only because of the cuts but because of the latest news about corruption,"" she said. ""However, I also feel that people are getting tired because we go out to the streets and we don't get a reaction."" Activist Sofia de Roa, 28, who works as a university press officer in Madrid, struck a similar note. She was one of the founders of Spain's 15-M protest movement, set up by so-called ""Indignados"" disenchanted with the way the country was being run and upset at a lack of prospects. ""It is a shame what the government does; they operate as a totalitarian government with their cuts that are affecting everyone, especially in the public sector. The inequality in this country is horrific,"" she told CNN. ""There are thousands of reasons for coming out to protest today. We are angry and tired. This government doesn't listen to our calls for help. They treat us like idiots. And not only aren't they listening to our protests, they even criminalize our actions,"" she said. Spain has witnessed frequent public demonstrations since thousands of Spaniards took to the streets in 2011, inspiring the global ""Occupy"" movement with their protest camp in Madrid's Puerta del Sol. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro reported from Spain and Per Nyberg from London, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Al Goodman and Bryony Jones also contributed to this report.","NEW: Two police officers are injured and 40 people are arrested as protests turn violent .

"(CNN) -- The upcoming World Cup and Olympics guarantee that Brazil's international visibility will continue its rapid ascent. The country just has to ensure there are seats for all of the guests. Brazil may be emerging from its reputation as the permanent ""land of tomorrow,"" but Parag Khanna suspects it will likely get there only at the last minute. As Brazil's annual Carnival hangover fades, a more serious road lies ahead. It's crunch time for the South American giant as it prepares to host next year's football World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. The country definitely needs an economic boost given the recent downgraded forecast of barely over 1% growth for 2013. Hosting these mega-events was seen as an essential spark to get Brazil to overhaul its dilapidated infrastructure, but despite the advance notice, politicians aren't yet living up to their continental scale ambitions. Brazilians excel at throwing massive parties, but so much is at stake beyond the Games. Can Brazil really become the ""America of South America,"" unchallenged and indispensable to all its neighbors? Brazil wants to be the first superpower from the global south, yet with the equator just crossing a sliver of the country's north, it has quite a long climb still to join the league of the wealthy, not just the large. Brasilia's technocrats have been aggressive, even creative, in recent years, using pro-poor policies and monetary intervention to deliver growth and stability. Yet lower interest rate policy has failed to drive stronger investment, and business confidence is down due to government intrusions large and small in banks, car companies, and other sectors. Even the major offshore oil discoveries haven't yet borne fruit for energy major Petrobras due to local content requirements that favor less sophisticated domestic suppliers. While its currency control policy has effectively been blessed by the IMF, the still massively overvalued Real currency has undercut exports in what has been an increasingly diversified economy. Latin America in general, and Brazil in particular, has been the most urbanized region long before cities became the dominant meme of global socio-economic studies. Sao Paulo very much feels like the second-largest city in the world, but unlike even larger Tokyo, its airport feels third world and public transportation can scarcely cope with demand. It ranks alongside New Delhi, Moscow, Beijing and Mexico City in IBM's aptly named Commuter Pain Index. And with close to 1,000 new cars joining the traffic jams each day, it's no surprise that the rich take to the air: Paulistas have the highest rate of private helicopter usage in the world. Overall, the World Economic Forum's most recent Global Competitiveness Report ranks Brazil a measly 107 (out of 144) for quality of infrastructure. Since taking office just over two years ago, President Dilma Rousseff has regularly announced massive infrastructure investment schemes. Airports, roads and railways have been slated for privatization, hundreds of new airports are planned to link the vast interior, the country's development bank has pledged an immediate $10 billion in related spending, private banks are planning greater lending in the infrastructure space, a Sao Paulo to Rio bullet train has been announced for completion by 2020, and $26 billion has been allocated to modernize the country's 34 ports which are responsible for more than 90% of the country's annual $482 billion in trade. Taken together, the government promises $100 billion in infrastructure spending over the next decade, while raising $65 billion in privatization and auctions. Discuss these numbers with any Brazilian, however, and they are apt to stare blankly and demand, ""But where is all the money going?"" As popular a figure as former president Lula was -- and deservedly so for his innovative and transformative policies such as the targeted cash transfer program ""Bolsa Familia"" -- corruption allegations still dog his still-dominant Workers Party (PT). O Estado de Sao Paulo, the leading daily newspaper, recently added a ""corruption library"" to its website to track the steady tide of suspicious contracts and spending. With the opposition parties fragmented and scattered, however, the PT may well be in power long enough to be held accountable to its plans. As Brazil focuses on its overhauling its cities, it must remember that urbanization itself won't drive meaningful growth, but rather empowering the tens of millions in the urban underclass. Cities like Sao Paulo are designed for an industrial age while the urban economy has become 85% related to services. The key question then is how to humanize such mega-cities, the theme of the upcoming New Cities Foundation summit that Sao Paulo is hosting in June. (Full disclosure: I serve on the NCF board of trustees.) The reinvention of Sao Paulo will begin right at its center with projects such as the URBEM Foundation's Casa Paulista. Multiple mixed used social and commercial developments designed to be affordable and professional could help to reintegrate a population that has grown accustomed to gated communities. In such neighborhoods, Brazilians should find apprenticeships, vocational training, and more public libraries that promote literacy, social inclusion, and citizenship, all topics debated by world-famous architects and experts and locals together in a new series called Arq.Futuro being held around the country. There is an opportunity to conduct this urban regeneration in a way that embodies Brazil's amazing cultural depth. Like China, the more modern it gets, the more Brazilian it gets; its identity is enhanced rather than diluted. There is no higher symbol of this than fabled architect Oscar Niemeyer's buildings, which manage to be both angular yet still in harmony with nature. But there are also efforts to restore the lifestyle of Carnival in Rio, a tradition of street culture and music, rather than just an annual bonanza, and connecting Rio's favelas closer to its beaches through cable cars. In Sao Paulo, soccer pitches are being hastily laid in the outskirts to remind the nation that its best players have come from conditions of socio-economic adversity. The message is clear: Brazilians should resist overly consumerist temptations; when they become too showy, they (especially their soccer stars) get distracted and under-perform. In the coming years, Brazil's image will also be shaped by a new set of stars and issues. Banks like Itau Unibanco have a healthy balance sheet and appetite to expand across Latin America and beyond. Secondary regions like Bahia are now rivaling Rio for visitors reveling in Carnival culture, while Pernambuco's capital Recife is attracting innovative industries to relocate. Given that Brazil holds approximately one-third of the world's biodiversity and 20% of its fresh water in the Amazon rainforest, it is also becoming a leader in fields ranging from combating deforestation (which has dropped by 80% since 2004) to plant genetics. And Brazil has become a leading and positive investor in Africa, as the country's eloquent foreign minister Antonio Patriota reminded participants at the recent Munich Security Conference. The upcoming World Cup and Olympics guarantee that Brazil's international visibility will continue its rapid ascent. The country just has to ensure there are enough seats for all of the guests. Brazil may finally be emerging from its reputation as the permanent ""land of tomorrow,"" but it will likely get there at the last minute.

"London (CNN) -- Lawyers for Julian Assange wrapped up their case against his extradition to Sweden on Tuesday and challenged a Swedish prosecutor to ""come to London"" to defend her handling of the sexual misconduct allegations facing the WikiLeaks founder. ""Today, we have seen a Hamlet without the princess -- a prosecutor who has been ready to feed the media within information, but has been unwilling to come here,"" Assange attorney Mark Stephens told reporters outside a south London courtroom. Stephens called on Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny to attend the extradition hearing when it resumes Friday and ""subject yourself to the cross-examination."" Assange has not been charged with a crime, but Swedish prosecutors want to question him in connection with sexual misconduct allegations related to separate incidents last August. Assange denies the accusations, and his attorneys are fighting his extradition on procedural and human-rights grounds. The case is not related to the work of the website, which has facilitated the leaking of thousands of secret documents on subjects ranging from the war in Afghanistan to the inner workings of U.S. diplomacy. Assange said the hearing is lifting the lid on allegations he says are false and have blighted his reputation for months, telling reporters after Tuesday's proceedings that he is facing ""the unlimited budget of Sweden and the United Kingdom on this matter."" Assange's lawyers say Ny ordered his arrest without formally summoning him for an interview or requesting an interrogation. They also argue that Sweden could send him to the United States to face espionage charges related to his site's disclosure of thousands of secret U.S. military and diplomatic documents. Former Swedish prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem testified Tuesday that Swedish authorities should not have told the media that Assange was accused of rape. But Alhem seemed unimpressed by some elements of the defense, including the claim that Assange could be sent on to the United States to face imprisonment in Guantanamo Bay or execution. He said Assange did not run that risk, in his opinion. Prosecutor Clare Montgomery, representing Sweden, dismissed the defense claim that Sweden would hand Assange over to the United States. The ""suggestion that Sweden provides no protection against human rights violations is unfounded,"" Montgomery argued, adding that Britain would have the right to intervene if Washington asked Sweden for Assange. Assange is free on 200,000 pounds ($310,000) bail while he fights extradition. British courts have ordered him to stay at a supporter's mansion outside London each night, to wear an electronic tag that monitors his location and to check in daily with police. Proceedings are set to resume Friday at Woolwich Crown Court in south London. ""For the past five and a half months, we have been in a condition where a black box has been applied to my life,"" Assange said after Monday's session. ""On the outside of that black box has been written the word 'rape.' That box is now, thanks to an open court process, being opened, and I hope over the next day we will see that that box is, in fact, empty and has nothing to do with the words that are on the outside of it."" Testifying for the defense on Monday, retired Swedish Court of Appeals judge Brita Sundberg-Weitman harshly criticized Ny, who issued an arrest warrant for Assange in the case. Sundberg-Weitman said Ny has a ""rather biased view against men"" and has ""lost balance"" on sexual offenses after years of working with battered women. Sundberg-Weitman said Ny could have pursued more straightforward approaches, such as questioning by telephone, for the preliminary investigation.  And Bengt Goran Rudling, a Swedish activist for legal reform in sex-offense cases, testified that he approached police to raise doubts about one of Assange's accusers. Rudling said the woman, identified as ""Miss A,"" made Twitter postings 20 hours after the alleged offenses that described being positive and happy in Assange's company. Assange's lawyers argue Britain cannot extradite Assange without violation of his human rights, because doing so puts him at risk of execution, according to an outline of their defense published on their website. ""There is a real risk he could be made subject to the death penalty,"" Assange lawyers say, citing British media reports that U.S. Republican politicians Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee have called for him to be executed. They also say he should not be sent to Sweden because rape trials there are held behind closed doors, while British trials are open. Rudling said Miss A erased the postings when she reported the alleged crime, but prosecutors said Miss A told Rudling she deleted them to avoid a media storm. Rudling also said that that two days after the alleged crime, Miss A wanted to become Assange's personal press liaison officer. He told CNN he is not an Assange supporter. CNN's Atika Shubert, Richard Allen Greene and Andrew Carey contributed to this report.","NEW: Assange lawyers to prosecutor: ""Come to London""

"(CNN) -- The families of the victims of a mass shooting rampage on a Norwegian island are visiting the scene Friday, a month after two attacks plunged the Scandinavian nation into mourning. Sixty-nine people died July 22 on Utoya island, where hundreds of mostly young people were gathered for a summer camp held by the youth wing of the governing Labour Party. Eight others died in the bombing of Oslo government buildings hours earlier. TV footage showed the first group of relatives of victims of the shooting walking in line as they arrived on Utoya island in the rain. ""It is a very important and emotional day for these families,"" Health Minister Anne-Grete Strom-Erichsen said, according to Norway's official NTB news agency. A policeman will show each family where their loved one was found after the attack, NTB reported. The families will also be accompanied by Red Cross representatives. Many of the 69 families affected have said they plan to visit the island over the weekend, Norwegian reports say. Meanwhile, a judge ruled that Anders Breivik, the man accused of carrying out both attacks, should be held in solitary confinement for another four weeks because there was a real danger he would otherwise tamper with evidence. This was especially important because the police have still not established whether Breivik had accomplices, Judge Hugo Abelseth said. He told the court in Oslo that the police request for Breivik to remain in isolation outweighed the suspect's concerns. Breivik, 32, had told the court that being held in isolation is ""boring, monotonous and a sadistic method of torture,"" the judge said. Breivik appeared in court to hear the arguments but the session was not open to the public or media. He will remain in solitary confinement until September 19, Abelseth said. At an initial court appearance for Breivik last month, the police were granted eight weeks' custody, four of them in isolation. Suspects are not normally held in isolation for longer than two weeks in Norway, according to local media reports. Speaking after Breivik's court appearance, Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby of Oslo Police District told reporters that the suspect was being kept cuffed by his hands and feet, and also chained at the waist. He said several survivors of the Utoya massacres had wanted to be present at the court hearing, but that the police had decided it was too risky in case they unwittingly revealed details of the case that would enable Breivik to alter his explanations. The police instead allowed four of the 113 lawyers representing the survivors, victims and their families to be present at the hearing, Kraby said. Survivors may be allowed in court when the investigation is no longer at such a sensitive point, he said. Kraby also responded to questions about the revelation by police Thursday that Breivik had made two calls to the police while on Utoya island on July 22. Officers had not called Breivik back because they say no number came up on their display. The most likely explanation for this is that the phone was not equipped with a SIM card or subscriber identity module, Kraby said, which would have transmitted the phone's number. Police chief Sissel Hammer on Thursday confirmed that Breivik had made two calls, one to Nordre Buskerud district and another to Sondre Buskerud Police district. According to a police transcript of the calls, Breivik said: ""Hello, my name is commander Anders Behring Breivik of the Norwegian anti-communist resistance movement."" After the police operator responded, he said: ""I am at Utoya. I wish to surrender."" Kraby said Breivik had been questioned for a total of 60 hours. He has not been questioned this week but questioning will resume next week. It is too early to tell what the final charges against Breivik will be, Kraby added, as the police are still systematically collecting and evaluating evidence and information. Breivik's lawyer said his client was concerned about appearing smart and respectably dressed for Friday's court appearance, state broadcaster NRK reported. During the past four weeks in solitary confinement, Breivik has been given more clothes, a clock and books, as well as a computer that is not connected to the internet, NRK said. He has not had been allowed any visitors, letters or media access. Breivik was taken back to Utoya -- which remains a crime scene -- on Saturday as part of a police investigation into the rampage. Police said they spent nearly eight hours questioning Breivik and walking with him around the island during a reconstruction of the attack.

"(CNN) -- Best known for hosting Discovery Channel's enormously popular series ""Man vs. Wild,"" British extreme adventurist Bear Grylls recently released his autobiography, ""Mud, Sweat & Tears."" The book is essentially the story of how Grylls became the grub eating, naturalist risk taker that has captivated a global audience. The chapters are short and punchy; rarely do they go over three pages and Grylls opens up about his formative years growing up on the Isle of Wight, his time spent at boarding schools and in the SAS (the British Special Air Service), his inabilities to woo girls and his recovery from a parachuting accident that left his back broken. Earlier this year, Grylls and Discovery failed to come to contract agreements, so at the moment he's currently searching for a new television project. Meanwhile he's enjoying a bit of success for his appearances in a series of Degree deodorant commercials. CNN recently spoke with Grylls in New York as he was preparing for a book signing. CNN: Everyone knows about the extreme conditions you put yourself through. Do you write in extreme conditions? Grylls: No, I didn't want to be away filming, then get home and be a dad and be writing. So I made a rule: I would only write on flights. And I had a load of those. Maybe 18 months on a plane. So I didn't write at home; I need every sense and focus when I'm there. CNN: But it was at a high altitude, just a little more contained. Grylls: (Laughs) Yeah. When you're out there, you need every sense of your body working for you. That's why I'm always exhausted at the end of those days. You don't have time for anything like that. CNN: At this point for you, which is harder for you: surviving a publisher deadline or surviving deadly conditions? Grylls: Well, the deadlines aren't going to kill you. I don't adhere strictly to deadlines -- writing ones. It's always going to be delayed because stuff takes longer ... I always figure no rush. I take the deadly deadlines more serious than the publisher's deadlines. CNN: The first third of the book, you discuss your formative years. You seem like a pretty well-adjusted guy. No rebellious drug phase or dark Goth phase. Grylls: I think there was more stumbling than that, but I was focused. I found at a young age that I could do well at what I loved. CNN: In the early chapters, it becomes evident that you're not self-conscious about your body. In fact, you seem to generally okay with getting naked. Grylls: Yeah, I grew up on an island so for me, I was always running around naked. Still am when I'm around good friends. I loved it in my workouts in the morning, at dawn, without any clothes on, doing pull ups on the bar. I loved that. Obviously on the show, you're always getting naked diving in the water, but the truth is, however many days of filming, I'm going to get my skivvs off and have a wash. But they always film that and that's out of my control. I'm usually naked for about 3 minutes over four days, but that happens to be 3 minutes of the show. It's a little bit harsh, but when I'm relaxed and with friends and stuff, I'm always skinny dipping in the sea. I love all of that. CNN: You also detail your time spent in the SAS and British Army -- did you identify more with the idea behind the SAS or more of the physical aspects of it? Grylls: I always loved the ethos there. The regiment of character of the individual. There was something I loved about that. You could be a scruff, but everybody was encouraged to have peers and you've got be able to laugh at yourself and work under pressure with each other and not have an ego. Those sort of things mattered. The unofficial motto is the ""the regiment, the misfits working together."" CNN: You discuss the parachuting accident that you had where you broke your back. Were you classified as depressed during that time? Grylls: People said you must've been positive to go through a broken back but the truth was it wasn't like that. It was a very dark time with struggle and doubt. I think the hard thing for me was not knowing. None of the doctors could tell me if I would walk properly again or climb properly again. I realized I could determine what was best for me and that's why I chose (to climb) Mount Everest as the goal. People looked at me like I was crazy, but the staff at the rehab center knew the power of a dream and having a focus like that. CNN: Watching your shows and reading your book, there's the idea that you don't need a lot of modern technology to live. What are your thoughts on that? Are we too reliant on technology these days? Grylls: Technology is great; it allows me to communicate with my family when I'm in remote areas. But the downside is that it disempowers people to display skills that without technology they could depend on for their life. So I think the key is to still having those skills, but using technology to help you. You always got to plan for the worst and hope for the best. If the GPS isn't going to work, if the lifeboat isn't going to work, you still got to know how to navigate across the mountains, across the bridges. Skills like that are very natural and basic to learn. It'll surprise you. I've taken people out who have more money than the world and they start smiling when they make their own fire. It's deep inside thousands and thousands of years in our psyche. It's the best free entertainment you can get. It's the natural world. Technology is great but it's never going to be as much fun as creating something out of nothing. CNN: Are you working on any shows for this year or next? Grylls: Yeah, well we're kind of offers and ideas coming in at the moment. We're just trying to be smart and wise. Definitely making programs that are about adventure and empowering people. That's been the driving force for me in the TV side of my life.","Survivalist Bear Grylls has released his autobiography .

"Washington (CNN) -- As Mitt Romney leaves Las Vegas, he hopes he hit the jackpot. Following an hour and a half hour meeting Tuesday afternoon with Nevada billionaire Sheldon Adelson and a few aides, the presumptive Republican nominee was assured the casino magnate was fully supportive of him. Adelson, who Forbes magazine estimates is worth $24.9 billion and is ranked as the eighth-richest man in America, was largely responsible, along with his wife, Miriam, for keeping Newt Gingrich's presidential bid alive by giving $20 million to the super PAC backing the ex-House speaker's candidacy, Winning Our Future. Now with Gingrich out of the race, political analysts are looking to see when Adelson will put his next big bet down -- this one on Romney. Adelson did not attend a high-profile Romney fund-raiser Tuesday night at the Trump International Hotel but later went to a smaller dessert donor reception at a private residence with Romney and Gingrich, a source familiar with the event told CNN. The key motivation for Adelson this campaign is preventing the re-election of President Barack Obama, those knowledgeable about the billionaire's thinking have said. He reportedly sees Republicans as stronger proponents for Israel's safety, which friends have said trumps all other concerns for him and was a key factor in his support for Gingrich, a longtime friend of his. ""He is very focused on defeating Barack Obama,"" one friend told CNN. ""He is going to be the Republican Party's 800-pound gorilla in defeating Barack Obama.' During the GOP primaries, Adelson told associates that he would back whoever won the nomination and that he now fully supports Romney, sources have told CNN. About a dozen financial backers of Romney and other major Republican donors met with Adelson in Las Vegas while they were in town for a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition to convince him to ""come on board"" with respect to supporting Romney. He indicated to them, according to one of the participants, ""it is just a matter of time."" However, the question is when and how much. As of April 30, he had not given to the pro-Romney super PAC, Restore Our Future. When Las Vegas columnist Jon Ralston asked Adelson in late April whether he was going to donate to Restore Our Future, he said, ""I'm not going to tell you. ... You'll find out when it's reported."" Adelson said at the time he wanted to become less visible in the political world and that references to him being a mogul when his donations were reported were ""not helpful to that person."" Asked if he was going to give to the Republican super PAC American Crossroads or its nonprofit affiliate Crossroads GPS, he initially would not answer. Later, he said to Ralston, ""I'm going to give one more small donation -- you might not think it's that small -- to a super PAC and then if I give it will be to a C4,"" referring to 501(c)(4) nonprofit groups, such as Crossroads GPS, which are not required to disclose their donors. While he has been complimentary of Romney in some private sessions, according to one source familiar with the matter, he also has publicly criticized him for lacking decisiveness -- an attribute he said Gingrich demonstrated. ""He's not the bold decision-maker like Newt Gingrich is. He doesn't want to -- every time I talk to him, he says, 'Well, let me think about it,' "" Adelson told JewishJournal.com at the end of March. Adelson has been a prolific donor to Republican causes. Earlier this year, he and his wife each donated $2.5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a group dedicated to keeping the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The Adelsons hosted a fund-raiser in April for House Speaker John Boehner's re-election campaign. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks the role of money in politics, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson rank as the top individuals funding outside spending groups this election cycle. In February, when Gingrich still seemed to have a shot at the Republican nomination, Adelson told Forbes magazine he might give as much as $100 million to support the former House speaker. What is unclear is whether he will follow through giving that amount to others. In that interview, he defended his donations and said he had nothing for which to apologize. ""I'm against very wealthy people attempting to influence elections,"" he said. ""But as long as it's doable, I'm going to do it. Because I know that guys like (George) Soros have been doing it for years, if not decades. And they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money. I have my own philosophy, and I'm not ashamed of it. I gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it. I don't want to go through 10 different corporations to hide my name. I'm proud of what I do, and I'm not looking to escape recognition."" The Adelsons came under some criticism from Republicans for their support of the super PAC backing Gingrich, especially when it aired bitter ads in January questioning Romney's record at Bain Capital and also when it became clear that Gingrich's candidacy had stalled. One friend said Adelson saw his support as fulfilling his commitment to Gingrich. Adelson reacted to the critics in the Forbes interview: ""Those people are either jealous or professional critics."" He added: ""They like to trash other people. It's unfair that I've been treated unfair -- but it doesn't stop me.""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India's supreme court has temporarily barred the Italian ambassador from leaving the country as a diplomatic row over Rome's refusal to return two of its marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen intensified. Last month, the court allowed the two Italian sailors -- Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone -- to participate in their country's elections after Ambassador Daniele Mancini's assurance about their return in four weeks. Latorre and Girone are facing trial in India in connection with the 2012 killing of the fishermen off the country's coast. The defendants say they mistook the fishermen for pirates. On Thursday, the top Indian court demanded an explanation from Mancini by March 18 over his country's decision not to send them back. ""Till then (March 18), Mr. Daniele Mancini shall not leave India without the permission of this court,"" the order said. Italy insists the February 2012 shooting involving its marines happened in international waters and was therefore outside of Indian jurisdiction. In a statement Monday, the Italian Foreign Ministry said the sailors would not go back to India. ""Italy takes this opportunity to inform the Indian government that, given the formal acknowledgment of an international dispute between the two states, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone will not be returning to India upon expiration of the leave granted (to) them,"" it said. The Italian move has invited strong reaction in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warning Rome of consequences. ""Our government has already made it clear that these actions of the government of Italy are not acceptable. They violate every rule of diplomatic discourse and call into question solemn commitments given by accredited representatives of a sovereign government to our supreme court,"" he said in parliament Wednesday. ""Our government has therefore insisted that the Italian authorities respect the undertakings they have given to the honorable supreme court and return the two accused persons to stand trial in India. If they do not keep their word, there will be consequences for our relations with Italy,"" he added. Indian external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said at a news briefing Thursday that the court action against the Italian ambassador did not violate the global Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. ""As of today, I have again said, we do not see any impact on the Vienna convention,"" he said.","Two Italian sailors face trial in India in connection with the killings of 2 Indian fishermen .

"(CNN) -- ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Patrick Dempsey believes he and a group of investors are just what the doctor ordered for a struggling Seattle-based coffee chain. Dempsey said the group wants to save 500 jobs by purchasing Tully's Coffee, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. The company, citing ""rising commodity prices and challenging lease economics,"" said it planned to close a number of underperforming coffee shop locations as part of its reorganization. ""I'm excited about the opportunity to save hundreds of jobs, give back to Seattle and become a larger part of the economic growth and fabric of the community,"" the actor said in a statement released Wednesday. Tully's Coffee confirmed Thursday that Dempsey is part of an investment group, but had no comment on the effort.

""It looks like Seattle may be my home away from home in the very near future."" According to Dempsey, Tully's Coffee operates 47 locations in Washington and California with other franchises across the country. The bankruptcy filing did not affect Tully's Coffee online sales and wholesale business, which were purchased in 2009 by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.

"Washington (CNN) -- Chuck Hagel is, to some conservatives, a party turncoat whose views on the use of military force and his chumminess with the president make many Republicans' skin crawl. The candidate for defense secretary is seen as Obama's most controversial nominee for his second-term Cabinet. The former two-term Republican senator from Nebraska will likely face a tough Senate confirmation hearing Thursday, but is expected to be confirmed, nevertheless. Obama's Cabinet: Who's in, who's out? But none of that is stopping conservative groups, and billionaire activist Sheldon Adelson, from pushing hard and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads to block the nomination. ""If it's a strategy, it doesn't seem like a particularly enlightened one,"" said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of the book ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism."" ""They almost certainly realize they're going to lose and that he'll be confirmed."" The effort is partly about making a public ado about Hagel, Mann said. ""They want to show some sort of collective reaction against it and a number of their key interests are pumped up about it, so they figure why not make a fight out of it?"" New ads from anti-Hagel group sound alarm bells . At least two groups publicly released ads last week slamming the nominee. Americans for a Strong Defense put out a 30-second spot that urged viewers to call their senator and vote against Hagel's confirmation ""before it's too late."" Another group, the American Future Fund, also revealed a new spot targeting Hagel's record in the Senate. Adelson, the Las Vegas conservative financier who also heads the Republican Jewish Coalition, was reportedly calling Republican senators personally to urge them to vote against Hagel, according to The New York Times. But the opponents also have significant concerns about Hagel's record. Hagel in 2007 remarked that the ""Jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers."" Republicans who are already uncomfortable with President Barack Obama's policies toward Israel are hard-pressed to embrace a defense secretary with such views. Five things Hagel may be asked . ""For a lot of groups, especially Jewish and conservative groups that care about Israel, this is a fundamental issue of right and wrong,"" said Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, CNN contributor and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition. ""Despite the fact that this is an uphill fight, groups are making the fight because they believe in it."" Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Barbara Boxer, D-California, are perhaps the two highest-profile Jewish senators who have announced their support for Hagel after speaking privately with him in recent days. Then there is Hagel's criticism of the Iraq War and the Patriot Act. Hagel has also faced some criticism on both sides of the aisle because of past positions he has taken on Iran and on U.S. military action. And in 1998 he spoke of an ambassadorial nominee as being ""openly, aggressively gay,"" remarks for which he has since apologized. A view of what's really behind Hagel nomination fight . And he hasn't been sparing in his criticism of conservative and GOP figures, saying radio show hosts like Rush Limbaugh ""try to rip everybody down"" but ""don't have any answers,"" and labeling Bush as callous on Iraq. ""In a town that seems too focused too often on personalities and politics, this is a matter of conviction based on policy -- the wrong man for the job,"" Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told CNN. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, prominent among politicians who have questioned Hagel's suitability for the job, recently told CNN he will not exert his power to block Hagel's nomination, but ""I plan to make a judgment as to whether I think he's appropriate to be secretary of defense or not."" But some Republicans also believed that Hagel, like Susan Rice, was vulnerable, according to political experts. (Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after drawing heavy criticism from McCain and other Republicans over her public statements about the deadly September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya). ""There is an element of strategic calculation going on here,"" said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. ""They see him as being more vulnerable and they have a chance to stop this nomination or embarrass the president or at least make it more difficult for him."" Kerry defends fellow Cabinet nominee Hagel . Groups opposing Hagel released new television ads recently with dire warnings of what they think could happen should Hagel be confirmed. The first spot, from Americans for a Strong Defense, uses themes that mimic a movie trailer for a spy/action thriller. The 30-second spot says ""we live in a dangerous world"" and points to threats from Iran, North Korea, and ""even Russia."" ""But Barack Obama's nominee for secretary of defense wants America to back down,"" the narrator continues. ""An end to our nuclear program. Devastating defense cuts. A weaker country."" The narrator then urges viewers to call their senator and vote against Hagel's confirmation ""before it's too late."" Hagel's other war . The American Future Fund plans to run television ads in Washington and in certain states against Obama's nominee, the group said, as well as print ads, web spots, and a website. Sources close to the group said they would spend about $500,000 to air the new ad on CNN and Fox News Channel. They call it an ""all the above"" strategy that ""will be nationwide, focused on the many disqualifying characteristics of the Hagel nomination -- including not only his now well-known statements against Israel and his weak opposition to the Iranian nuclear threat, but also his to be disclosed personal, business and ethical conflicts."" McCain moves from backer to skeptic on Hagel . Increasingly, outside groups are going to get more involved in nomination fights, said American Future Fund spokesman Stuart Roy. ""I think what have seen are outside groups get more involved, it hasn't be unusual for outside groups to get involved in Supreme Court nominations,"" Roy said. ""I think what you see now are additional groups getting involved in communicating about other nominations that are particularly problematic or controversial. Chuck Hagel's nomination to defense secretary in this administration is a particularly troubling and controversial nomination."" The opposition is also about policy and personality. Conservative groups take issue with Hagel's policy positions, but also, ""They don't like the fact that he is a supporter of President Obama,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Republicans have been playing opposition politics for four years and it's not easy to come out of that mold,"" he said. ""In Hagel's case there's no love lost. They see him as someone as who turned on his party and they don't want there to be any confusion that this is a real Republican going into the Obama Cabinet."" Opinion: Reality check for Hagel bashers . CNN's Ashley Killough, Gregory Wallace, Barbara Starr and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Conservative groups fight Sen.

"Colorado Springs (CNN) -- Days after he led police in a wild car chase that ended in a hail of gunfire, authorities are investigating the driver's links to two Colorado killings. And whether he has ties to a third shooting, in Texas, earlier this year. Suspect Evan Spencer Ebel, 28, was fatally shot in the head Thursday after he opened fire on the deputies chasing him in in Montague County, Texas. Investigators have found evidence linking him to the slaying of a Colorado prison chief and a pizza delivery driver this week. And the FBI is looking for possible evidence linking the January slaying of Kaufman County prosecutor Mark Hasse to Tuesday's killing of Colorado prison chief Tom Clements at a Denver suburb. ""This is part of routine investigative work when two crimes occur under somewhat similar circumstances,"" the Kaufman County Sheriffs Office said in a statement Friday. "" If any link is found, or a possible link is disproven, that information will be released at the appropriate time."" In an affidavit, Texas authorities detailed what they believe links him to the prison chief's killing. Black Cadillac . Of key focus in the affidavit is a 1991 black Cadillac authorities say the suspect was driving in a wild, high-speed chase Thursday. He opened fire on sheriff's deputies before slamming into an 18-wheeler, climbing out of the wreckage and opening fire again. Witnesses reported a similar vehicle -- a black, boxy car with Colorado license plates -- near the prison chief's house the day he was killed. Among the links in the cases, according to the affidavit, are shell casings from a 9mm handgun found at Clements house. They are the same brand and caliber used in the shooting of James Boyd, a Wise County, Texas, sheriff's deputy who tried to pull over the suspect. Pizza box carrier . Boyd, who had on a bullet-proof vest, managed to call for help and tell law enforcement which way Ebel was driving. The deputy remains hospitalized at a Dallas-Fort Worth area hospital. During the investigation into the shooting, authorities found a Domino's Pizza box carrier and a uniform jacket in the trunk of the Cadillac, prompting Denver authorities to go to Texas to examine the car. Video: Pizza deliveryman remembered . 'Strong connection' They are investigating the killing of Nathan Collin Leon, 27, a Domino's Pizza deliveryman in Denver. Leon disappeared from work Sunday and was found dead in the Denver suburb of Golden. Denver investigators said there is a ""strong connection"" between Leon and Clements killings, but have said little about a possible motive. Did Ebel kill a pizza deliveryman to get a hold of his uniform as part of an effort to disguise himself? Did he target Clements because of the prison chief's crackdown on white supremacist gangs in prison? Was he part of a wider conspiracy to kill Clements? Or was it something else? Investigators looking into Clements' killing have told reporters they are considering numerous angles. One is that Ebel, a former member of the 211s -- a white-supremacist prison gang -- might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements, the Colorado, sheriff's department said. Clements earned widespread recognition for prison reforms and crackdown on prison gangs, including the 211s. Citing media coverage of the shooting and its possible connection with the the 211s, authorities locked down Colorado's prisons on Friday. History of violence . Ebel lengthy prison record dates to his teen years, including a 2003 charge for felony armed robbery after he brandished a gun and threatened to kill a man unless he handed over his wallet, court documents show. He was 18 at the time. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison, serving just over a year. Just months after his release, he was arrested again. This time for felony menacing, robbery and assault. He pleaded guilty to those charges in 2005 and was sentenced to another three years in prison. In 2006, while in prison, Ebel was charged with assaulting a detention officer, records show. He pleaded guilty and received an additional four years on his sentence. Ebel served his entire sentence and was given mandatory parole on January 28, 2013, according to the state Department of Corrections. CNN's Jim Spellman reported from Colorado and Ed Lavandera from Texas, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"London (CNN) -- Dragon boats, a floating belfry and the royal barge are among more than 1,000 vessels preparing to transform London's River Thames into a spectacular floating tribute to the 60-year reign of Queen Elizabeth II. About 20,000 people will take to the water Sunday for a river pageant -- inspired by regal riverside celebrations of the past -- which is set to be the largest such event on the Thames for hundreds of years. The event is set to be a highlight in a four-day weekend of celebrations for the queen's diamond jubilee. What's on during Diamond Jubilee weekend . After gathering upriver in west London, the seven-mile long flotilla will wend its majestic way from Battersea Bridge to Tower Bridge, passing through the heart of Britain's capital city over the course of several hours. At the front will be about 300 man-powered boats, with thousands of volunteers propelling them downriver, flags and streamers fluttering around them. A barge carrying the eight Royal Jubilee Bells -- the largest of which, at nearly half a ton, is named for the monarch -- will lead the way, its peals of bells to be echoed from church towers along the river. Fashions and treats fit for a queen . Next will come passenger boats, pleasure boats, historic wooden vessels -- the oldest built in 1740 -- and boats carrying members of the armed forces, police and fire services. One of the boats taking part, the Amazon, also took part in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria, Britain's longest-serving monarch and the only other to reach the landmark 60 years on the throne. The biggest cheer will no doubt come for the present queen, who will be carried aboard a specially converted royal barge, opulently draped in red and gold. Huge numbers of flag-waving spectators are expected to line the banks, despite the forecast for rain. Millions more around the world are likely to watch the spectacle unfold on television. Sailing boats that are too tall to pass under the 14 bridges along the river pageant route will line the river from London Bridge to Wapping, in the east, creating an avenue of sails set against the Tower of London and the city's financial center. The queen will disembark at Tower Bridge and watch as the remainder of the river pageant passes in a riot of color and noise. More than 14 miles of bunting in the colors of the Union Flag, or the Union Jack as it is commonly referred to, will be strung along the route, pageant organizers say. London's Metropolitan Police said as many as 6,000 extra officers would be on patrol during jubilee events. The force will deploy more than 20 police boats during the river pageant, as well as carrying out searches on shore with dogs, and using rope climbing teams to inspect the bridges. Police divers will carry out underwater checks of piers and boats. The huge security operation comes as London prepares to host the 2012 Olympic Games, which open in late July. Outside the capital, Britons are expected to gather for thousands of Jubilee-themed street parties and barbecues Sunday. Stores have been filled for weeks with an array of patriotic paraphernalia, from flag-adorned teapots to aprons to picnic sets, to help hosts set the scene for what is billed as a national celebration. The queen, known for her love of horse racing, kicked off the long weekend at Epsom Downs racecourse Saturday, where she attended the Derby, Britain's most prestigious racing meet, with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. Singer Katherine Jenkins performed the national anthem and the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery fired a gun salute in the Queen's honor. The celebrations continue on Monday and Tuesday, which have been declared public holidays to mark the diamond jubilee. An afternoon garden party at Buckingham Palace will be followed Monday evening by a televised pop concert outside the palace grounds. At the end of the concert, the queen will take to the stage to light the ""National Beacon,"" which will be on the Mall. She will use a diamond made from crystal glass, which has been on display at the Tower of London from the beginning of May, to light the flame. More than 4,000 beacons will be then lit in communities throughout the United Kingdom, along with the Commonwealth and UK Overseas Territories. Tuesday will be a day of pomp and ceremony, as the queen attends a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, followed after lunch in Westminster by a carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace, where she will appear on the balcony, flanked by members of the royal family.","The queen will be carried aboard a specially converted royal barge, draped in red and gold .

"(Parenting.com) -- Last night I sat down to watch the Oscar red carpet with my 6-year-old daughter Kaia. She played dress-up with her American Girl doll while I followed the commentary on Twitter.

I have been a huge fan of Quvenzhané from the moment I saw the trailer for ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" She made the movie when she was only six years old and earned herself a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance. She deserves a standing ovation from us. Instead, last night, on her special night, she was subjected to the most distasteful showing of adult ""humor"" I have ever seen. It started with a ""joke"" by Oscar host Seth MacFarlane about how it will be ""sixteen years before she's too old"" for George Clooney, but sadly it didn't stop there. The popular satire site The Onion tweeted the following to its more than 4 million followers during the show last night: . ""Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a ____, right?"" (If you want to see the actual tweet, it's here.) As if it wasn't bad enough that she was sexualized in front of her peers during what was undoubtedly the most exciting night of her life, but to be further humiliated on a social networking site and called one of the most degrading terms that can be used toward women is reprehensible. The Onion is a site known for its sarcasm and although I'm sure they didn't mean it, does that make it better? Am I supposed to laugh at the absurdity of the statement? Am I supposed to look at my daughter and think, wow, it would be really really funny and smart if someone jokingly called her the c word? How ironic. Parenting.com: Celebrity baby bumps on the red carpet . Many online have tried to make this a race issue. Saying she was singled out because she's a young black girl. I hope that's not the case. To me, this has less to do with race and everything to do with the fact that we have stopped respecting the innocence of our children. We've become so desensitized by the ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" culture that we take hurtful aim at those who epitomize childhood as much as the fluffy puppy purses they carry on the red carpet. Imagine what went through Quvenzhané's mother's mind when someone pulled her aside last night to tell her what happened. Did her stomach bottom out like mine did? Did she look at her daughter with a tear in her eye and think why? Why tonight? What is wrong with this world? I want my little girl to know she can do anything she sets her mind to. She can be herself, silly purse and all, and star in whatever version of life she desires. Kaia went to sleep last night clutching her American Girl doll tight, updo still in place, as I imagine Q did with her puppy purse. Both, I am sure, completely unaware of the storm brewing online in defense of little girls like them. In defense of their innocence. When our children take their turn in the spotlight, they have the right to leave it unscathed. It's our job as adults to protect them. Parenting.com: What really happens when dad's in charge . I wish the headlines today were different. I wish we lived in a world where Quvenzhané could wake up this morning and search the internet with her mama to find herself on our best-dressed lists. To see celebrities like Oprah and Beyoncé, her biggest fans, rave about her. Instead her family must hide the horrible truth from her -- the truth that our media took a cheap shot at someone too small to stand up for herself or to even know what the word she was called means. The way we treat our kids is no laughing matter. Quvenzhané Wallis is a lot of things. She is smart. She is sassy. She is talented. She is beautiful. And she is a child. She is not the c word. But thanks to the insensitive staffer at The Onion who decided to tweet and then recant the vulgar comment, this incident too is one of the ways she'll be remembered. Parenting.com: The best books to read with your kids . As chief executive Steve Hannah of the Onion wrote in his apology this morning, ""Miss Wallis, you are young and talented and deserve better.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The badly burned former nanny of two of Moammar Gadhafi's grandchildren was receiving medical treatment Tuesday in the burn unit of a Tripoli hospital. Shwygar Mullah says the wife of Gadhafi's son Hannibal poured boiling water on her for failing to keep a child quiet. She is being treated with antibiotics for an infection. Her burns are dressed. CNN first met Mullah on Sunday while visiting the luxurious former home of Hannibal Gadhafi. As a CNN crew was about to leave, one of the staff members mentioned a nanny who worked for Hannibal Gadhafi. He said that Hannibal's wife, Aline, had burned the nanny. At first it looked as though the nanny was wearing a hat and something over her face. Then the crew realized that her scalp and face were covered in red wounds and scabs, a mosaic of injuries that rendered her face into a grotesque patchwork. Even though the burns were inflicted three months ago, she clearly was still in considerable pain, but she told her story calmly. She'd been the nanny to Hannibal's little son and daughter. The 30-year-old came to Libya from her native Ethiopia a year ago. At first things seemed OK, but then six months into her employment she was burned by Aline, she said. Three months later the same thing happened again, this time much more seriously. In soft tones, she said Aline lost her temper when her daughter wouldn't stop crying and Mullah refused to beat the child. ""She took me to a bathroom. She tied my hands behind my back, and tied my feet. She taped my mouth, and she started pouring the boiling water on my head like this,"" she said, imitating the vessel of scalding hot water being poured over her head. She peeled back the garment draped carefully over her body. Her chest, torso and legs are all mottled with scars -- some old, some still red, raw and weeping. As she spoke, clear liquid oozed from an open wound on her head. After one attack, ""There were maggots coming out of my head, because she had hidden me and no one had seen me,"" Mullah said. Photographs show Mullah's terrible condition when she first arrived at the hospital in June -- taken by doctors who started to treat her. They say they were bullied by Hannibal Gadhafi's staff into stopping treatment. Hospital director Rida Franka told CNN: ""After three days they came and threatened me here and said you have to discharge the case or otherwise you have a lot of problems."" Despite the threats, a guard later brought the nanny back secretly for more treatment. When the Gadhafi family found out, doctors say they were again ordered to stop treatment. And after Aline Gadhafi found out about the kind actions of Mullah's co-worker, he was threatened with imprisonment if he dared to help her again. ""When she did all this to me, for three days, she wouldn't let me sleep,"" Mullah said. ""I stood outside in the cold, with no food. She would say to staff, 'If anyone gives her food, I'll do the same to you.' I had no water -- nothing."" Her colleague, a man from Bangladesh who didn't want to give his name, says he was also regularly beaten and slashed with knives. He corroborated Mullah's account and said the family's dogs were treated considerably better than the staff. Mullah was forced to watch as the dogs ate and she was left to go hungry, he said. CNN has been inundated with offers of assistance for Mullah and is working with humanitarian organizations and medical officials to get help for her. As soon as information is available, CNN will let people know how to help on CNN and CNN.com/impact.","NEW: Doctors say they were bullied by Gadhafi staff into halting treatment for the nanny .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona's Sunday celebrations started early with a 6-1 romp over Getafe, and ended late with a slip-up by second-placed Atletico Madrid which has all but ended the Spanish title race. Atletico's 2-1 defeat at Rayo Vallecano gave Barca a commanding 12-point lead with 15 matches to play, as third-placed champions Real Madrid languish another four points adrift. ""It was an unusual time to play but we had a party in the stadium,"" the Catalan side's assistant coach Jordi Roura said after the midday kickoff at the Camp Nou, where more than 85,000 fans turned up. ""The players were at an extraordinary level. They were intense from the first minute,"" added Roura, who is running the team while Tito Vilanova is receiving cancer treatment in New York . Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring in the sixth minute with his first league goal this season before Lionel Messi netted for a record-extending 13th successive La Liga game before quarter of an hour had been played -- his 35th in the competition from 23 appearances. David Villa and substitute Cristian Tello scored in the second half before Getafe hit back through striker Alvaro Vazquez, but then Andres Iniesta and defender Gerard Pique netted in time added on. ""We felt great on the pitch, a lot of people were able to make it to the stadium and the atmosphere was fantastic,"" Pique said. ""It wouldn't be an inconvenience if we had to play at the same time in the future."" Atletico striker Radamel Falcao scored his 19th league goal this season, putting him third in the Pichichi standings behind Real's Cristiano Ronaldo -- who took his tally to 24 with a hat-trick in Saturday's 4-1 win over Sevilla. However, it came far too late -- the last kick of the match -- as Vallecano moved up to fifth place on goal difference above Valencia thanks to first-half goals from Guinean striker Alhassane Bangoura and Brazilian forward Leo Baptistao. Real Sociedad moved up to eighth with a 2-1 win at Zaragoza, while Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol eased relegation worries with a 4-0 win at Athletic Bilbao. Italy . Mario Balotelli scored his second successive penalty for AC Milan to rescue a 1-1 draw at Cagliari, but his team surrendered fourth place in Serie A to city rivals Internazionale. Balotelli took his tally to three goals in two games since signing for $30 million from English champions Manchester City with an 82nd-minute spot-kick, but the Italy striker also missed a late chance to snatch victory. Inter won 3-1 at home to Chievo to move within a point of third-placed Lazio, as striker Antonio Cassano scored in the second minute then defender Andrea Ranocchia restored the lead with a header after Luca Rigoni's equalizer, and Diego Milito added the third in the second half. Germany . Freiburg moved up to fifth in the Bundesliga following Sunday's 1-0 win at home to lowly Fortuna Dusseldorf.

"Bekoji, Ethiopia (CNN) -- It might be many miles away from the usual sporting capitals of the world, but when it comes to long-distance running there's one tiny place that's setting the pace. Nestled amidst rolling farmlands on the green hills of southern central Ethiopia, Bekoji is a sleepy town of less than 20,000 people, most of whom are farmers and herders. But apart from the wheat and maize growing on Bekoji's fertile soil, this small town a few hours south from capital Addis Ababa is also the breeding ground for some of the best track and field athletes in the world. Set at about 2,800 meters above sea level, Bekoji has produced a string of Olympic champions and world-beating long-distance runners, including multiple Olympic gold medal winners Tirunesh Dibaba and Kenenisa Bekele. Sentayehu Eshetu, the legendary coach who has so far trained four of Bekoji's Olympic gold winners, says that a winning mix of thin air, lean diet and different terrains has helped the town's rich crop of runners stand out in recent years. ""Our training fields are very conducive for athletics,"" says Eshetu, 56, who is known in Bekoji simply as ""Coach."" ""We have downhill, flat land, all of these here in Bekoji. The food they eat also has an impact, the weather has an impact, the combination of these makes the kids successful."" Read this: Senegalese teens shoot for U.S. glory . Eshetu is quick to add, however, that favorable weather and training conditions do not guarantee success. Determination and dedication are key, he says. ""Our runners are successful because they work hard,"" he explains. ""They work with the aim of reaching for success. This is what makes them different."" And if there's anyone who should know about success, that's Eshetu. For some 25 years he has been discovering and nurturing the talents of some the finest runners in Ethiopia -- a global powerhouse in long-distance running, with 35 Olympic medals in the last 20 years. Apart from Dibaba and Bekele, Eshetu has also trained Derartu Tulu, a two-time Olympic champion, Tiki Gelana, the marathon winner at the 2012 London Olympics, Tirfi Tsegaye, winner of the recent 2013 Dubai Marathon, and many others. Read this: Cameroon's outspoken football star . Using a blue-walled mud hut as an office and Bekoji's fields as training grounds, Eshetu spots, coaches and mentors scores of local youngsters who follow his rigorous routine in the hope of running their way from Bekoji to international stardom. ""When I recruit athletes, I look at those who have a desire to put in the work,"" says Eshetu. ""I look at their shape. Kids who are too short won't have good results. Those who are tall walk upright and those who complete their training with passion, I recruit them. ""They train here for three years after entering the camp. After three years, those with good results move on to other clubs. After that, based on their time, they compete in other races, even international ones."" But for the majority of these young athletes, this is not an easy road. Poverty is common, sporting equipment does not come cheap and most get by on no more than two meals a day. ""Here athletes have difficulty with getting regular food, with owning shoes, they face a lot of problems,"" says Eshetu. ""They have to sew their shoes, manage with little food, work long and hard, but I believe this allows them to become stronger and successful."" Read this: NBA boss finding Africa's basketball stars . Eshetu's golden girl is three-time Olympic champion Dibaba, a member of a sporting family dynasty that includes four successful long-distance athletes. Last summer, as Dibaba sprinted through the finish line to win gold in the 10,000 meters at the London Olympics, Eshetu was watching proudly on a screen thousands of miles away. ""Sentayehu knew that my cousin Derartu Tulu ran,"" says Dibaba. ""He knew that my sisters ran too, that's why he encouraged me to start running. He used to tell me that I would be a great runner. He knew I would be a fast runner that's why he started coaching me."" For Dibaba, representing a country with such a distinguished athletics history brings a feeling of great responsibility. ""Our country is not like other countries,"" says Dibaba. ""You should bring back gold when you compete for Ethiopia. The people don't accept anything less, the people won't be happy with anything less. ""Silver and bronze in our country is no better than finishing fifth or sixth. I want to make people happy and therefore think of finishing first. My heart pounds when I think of this, and that why I train hard, to make the people happy."" Driven by a strong sense of duty and a strong desire to produce successful athletes, Eshetu shows no signs of stopping. Instead, he's always keeping an eye out for the next rising star to come out of Bekoji's rich crop. ""Running for Ethiopia is a movement that has shown the world where we are, what we can do and who we are as a people,"" says Eshetu.","Ethiopian long-distance runners have won 35 Olympic medals in the last 20 years .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Is child obesity a form of child neglect? Of course not. That's ridiculous. But, it seems, the ridiculous is now standard operating procedure in the upside down world of the Department of Children and Family Services of Cuyahoga County in Ohio. In a case making headlines around the country, the agency recently decided that a Cleveland third grader should be taken from his mother and placed in foster care. Was this an instance of child abuse? Apparently not. Was it an urgent situation that required this local government entity to immediately intervene and take the drastic step of separating a family? It doesn't seem so. In fact, county public defender Sam Amata told reporters that his office would challenge the removal because the boy was not in imminent danger. Here's the alleged abuse: The 8-year-old boy weighed more than 200 pounds, and officials essentially claimed that his mother was to blame for not doing enough to help her son lose weight. So they went into the home and took the child away. Just like that. Department spokeswoman Mary Louise Madigan told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the boy's condition constituted ""a form of medical neglect."" Hold on. Constituted to whom? Who made that determination? Was it a doctor or a social worker? The boy reportedly caught the attention of the agency when his mother took him to the hospital last year because he was having trouble breathing. And, once someone determined that this was a case of neglect and not just a health issue, who made the subsequent life-altering decision to remove the child from his home and put him at tender mercies of a foster care system that is notoriously dysfunctional? The answer to that question isn't clear. From the looks of it, this is precisely the kind of heavy-handed abuse for which social service agencies in communities across the country have become infamous over the past 20 years. Many people claim that child protective services agencies often abuse their authority and act hastily, without respect for families or what's best for the child. Others defend the agencies, and claim that it's better they err on the side of caution when dealing with the safety of children. Of course, if there were genuine abuse, then social workers should intervene. So should law enforcement. But that's not what we're talking about here. Madigan told the newspaper that her office had worked with the boy's mother for over a year before deciding to remove him. That's more than enough time to have detected any abuse, had there been any to detect. The agency claims that the boy's weight gain stemmed from his home environment, and that his mother was not following doctor's orders. The mother says otherwise. Undoubtedly there is something wrong here. The boy's condition isn't normal. And, at the same time, child obesity is a growing problem in this country, fueled as much by inactivity as it is by an unhealthy diet. Kids spend too much time indoors watching television or fiddling with video games when they should be outdoors exercising, running and playing. But since when is a parent totally to blame when a child weighs too much -- or perhaps, in the case of a teenager with an eating disorder, doesn't weigh enough? The issue is more complicated than that. The boy's mother told the Plain Dealer, ""They are trying to make it seem like I am unfit, like I don't love my child. Of course I love him. Of course I want him to lose weight. It's a lifestyle change, and they are trying to make it seem like I am not embracing that. It is very hard, but I am trying."" The people who run these social service agencies always claim that they're acting in the best interests of the child. Yet, in this case, that could be a tough sell. In the absence of actual abuse, taking a child away from his mother and placing him in foster care is not in anyone's best interests -- not the child, not the mother and not the rest of society which will have to deal with the emotional fallout for years to come. What will become of this child? What kind of person will he grow up to be? Will he be angry and bitter, and how will he express those feelings? No matter what is causing the boy's weight gain, the problem could get worse and not better with the stress that the agency is putting him through. The emotional effect on the boy is something at which lawyers for the mother are looking as they fight to get the boy back home. Others say that county officials overreacted in seizing the boy, and now they're overreaching in trying to justify their actions. ""I think we would concede that some intervention is appropriate,"" said Amata. ""But what risk became imminent? When did it become an immediate problem?"" This boy needs help, and so does the mother. But they also need each other, and a government agency shouldn't be standing between them. The county social workers may not be able to help this child overcome his weight problem. But they can make it easier for others to help him by doing the right thing and immediately reuniting this family. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","A 200-pound boy who is 8 years old was taken away from his mother in Ohio .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Oscar winners use most of their onstage time thanking the Academy, their co-stars, agents, lawyers, family and God. Some of their best quotes happen backstage with reporters, where there is no orchestra poised to play them off. Here's a collection of what you would have heard if you had a backstage press pass. Best actress . Jennifer Lawrence was asked to explain why she fell on her way to collect her best actress Oscar for ""Silver Linings Playbook."" ""Look at my dress. I tried to walk up stairs in this dress. That's what happened. I think I just stepped on the fabric and they waxed the stairs... What went through my mind when I fell down? A bad word that I can't say that starts with 'F.'"" Best actor . Best actor Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis was asked if wearing a beard throughout the filming of ""Lincoln"" was annoying. ""What do you mean 'wearing it'? Do you wear your own hair? No, it was just a beard. It was a little bit scratchy now and then, but no, it was just a beard. It was mine. It was my very own beard."" Day-Lewis, the first person to win three best lead actor awards, is known for getting deep into a character. But he insists he's no longer into Abe Lincoln. ""I'm definitely out of character at this moment. If I slip back into it by mistake, you can do an intervention of some kind, Heimlich maneuver or whatever, if I get stuck in character. No, I'm definitely out of character now."" Best picture . Hearing first lady Michelle Obama announce that ""Argo"" won the best picture Oscar made Ben Affleck hallucinate. ""Honestly, I was just asking these two guys (co-producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov) outside, was that Michelle Obama? The whole thing kind of alarmed me at the time. But in retrospect, the fact that it was the first lady was an enormous honor and the fact that she surrounded herself by service men and women was special and I thought appropriate. Anyway, it was very cool."" Affleck was asked about not being nominated in the best director category for Argo. ""Naturally I was disappointed, and a lot of people said this is something that's going to happen. But when I look at the directors who were, people who weren't nominated as well, Paul Thomas Anderson and Kathryn Bigelow, just amazing, Tom Hooper and Quentin Tarantino. These are all directors who I admire enormously. So, it was a very tough year."" Clooney added ""You were in good company not to be nominated."" Best supporting actress . Winning the best supporting actress Oscar will not keep Anne Hathaway from considering herself as the underdog. ""You're always looking for the next job. You always think at the end of one, it doesn't matter what's happened before, no one's going to hire me again. So, I do feel this evening the respect of my peers, and I am going to ride that wave for as long as I can, but I do also have a practical approach to acting, which is got to work, got to work, got to work."" Hathaway said she is not impressed with her Academy Award winning ""Les Miserables"" performance. ""I'm impressed by the work around me. I'm impressed by my makeup. I'm impressed by my costume. I'm impressed by the haircut and the set and the score and the song, but no, all I can hear is all of the notes that I didn't quite hit. But maybe I'll get over it some day. Hugh Jackman was ""our rock,"" Hathaway said. ""Hugh is this magical alien combination of strength and soul and heart and artistry and fun. And if you think about it, I mean, not to get serious, but we do live in a world that can tend toward the cynical, and to have someone in a film like this where it's inherent to the film's success that you believe in the goodness of the central character, and that someone like Hugh exists who has that goodness within him, it made the film soar. ... And we all knew that and, I mean, we are not coal miners. It wasn't hard work, but, you know, it was challenging. And we looked to him every day and to his strength and to his indefatigable spirit. He never complained once. He did as many takes as need be, and he was absolutely our rock and our inspiration through everything and to me personally."" Hathaway's ""Les Miserables"" role made her a better human. ""Playing Fantine, having to connect with the darkness of life, and I think maybe more to the point, the unnecessary suffering that human beings can inflict on each other, I would have loved to have gone home and forgotten about that everyday, but you just can't because it exists. And it exists for millions of men and women throughout the world. I think this film changed me because it made me more compassionate and more aware. Hathaway got bit choked up explaining what she meant in her acceptance speech when she said ""It came true."" ""I had a dream, and it came true. And that can happen. And that's wonderful. And so, that was all I was saying was that it can and it did."" Best supporting actor . ""Django Unchained"" actor Christoph Waltz was at a loss for words to describe the feeling of winning his second best supporting actor Oscar. ""I was on a list with greatest actors around, with Robert De Niro, with Alan Arkin, with Tommy Lee Jones with Philip Seymour Hoffman. How do you think someone feels when all of a sudden his name is called in that context? I can't tell you. I'm sorry."" The Tarantino movie broke box office records for a western, but Waltz said he pays little attention to how much money a movie makes. ""I'm just an actor, I am not an accountant. I love this movie, not for being the highest grossing one. I love this movie because it's a fabulous, exciting piece of entertainment with a really deep message. So, I'm glad that it's popular because this is what the box office reflects. But the money, sorry, I do something else."" Best Director . Ang Lee suggested the Oscar he won for director ""Life of Pi"" should help him raise the big money needed to make more films heavy in visual effects.

"Utah (CNN) -- I didn't really know what to expect when I got to Provo, Utah. I knew that many people here were followers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, better known as the Mormons. And I was here to visit Brigham Young University -- also known as the Mormon university. Mitt Romney graduated from here in 1971. I was visiting the school to find out how they viewed their famous alumnus, and if people would vote for him because he was of the same faith -- that report comes next week. For the moment, let me muse on my visit to BYU. I went to university in Leeds in the 1980s. It was a time of political ferment. Thatcherism was at its peak. We had demonstrations and sit-ins. The students' union was a hotbed of political activism. Most big European schools were like that in those days, as we battled everything. Amtrak train: No better way to connect with U.S. voters . The campus of BYU is a world apart from my experience; new buildings, manicured lawns, and plenty of flower beds to beautify the surroundings. And a student body that frankly looks nothing like the student ragamuffins of my own university days. The bell tower lets you know this is a religious-based institution. At 12 o'clock they ring out a selection of light hymns as part of the top-of-the-hour chimes. Meeting staff and students, I felt the differences almost immediately. The polite inquiry as to whether I'd like ""a beverage"" had me checking myself before replying ""oh, coffee would be lovely."" BYU follows a strict interpretation of the Mormon Code and caffeine is banned on the campus. Flustered, I couldn't think of much else quickly enough besides ""oh, a water would be lovely."" Iowa: A barometer for the swing states . The students here have a different air about them. Walking around the campus it looks as if they have all bought their preppy clothes from J.Crew, Gap or similar. Nothing wrong with that of course. Neat. Tidy. Oh, and everyone smiles. Smiling. The woman at the ice cream shop smiled. The guides showing me round the university smiled. The student who handed me Mormon literature smiled. It was hard to imagine any of these clean-cut youths suddenly bursting into a bout of obscenities as they stubbed a toe or dropped a plate. Colorado: Will frontier state call the election? Respectable and respectful throughout is the best way to describe them, and for good reason: They have all signed the Honor Code. The code requires them to be, among other things, honest, true, chaste, benevolent and virtuous. There is a reminder on a poster at the bowling alley, which announced ""we follow the honor code"" and asked visitors to uphold standards of grooming and dress. When I suggested there was plenty of time in the future to uphold grooming and dress, and that surely student years were designed for rebellion, my host gave a ""we know what's coming next"" tolerant look and, ever so politely, explained there were plenty of other schools for that, and this was a Mormon school for those who wanted to live the Mormon way of life. An Amish life: America without sound bites . Living the Mormon way of life is central to this school. At BYU there is a lot of hand holding (between men and women only), with chaste kisses and long looks. I know that Mormon beliefs forbid pre-marital sex, but somehow I imagined that meant no relationships, and by extension, no physical contact. By now I was realizing I was the victim of my own preconceptions and prejudices about this faith and its worshippers. 'I'm 92 ... of course I will vote!' And then the penny dropped. Having probably spent their youth in the minority -- depending on where they grew up -- for many BYU students this was the first time they were in the majority, the norm! They needn't explain why they didn't drink alcohol, swear or want to wear ripped jeans with their butts hanging out. At BYU everyone knew why, and believed the same as they did. Far from being restricting, this homogeny was their freedom to be as they wanted to be. Honest Abe's 19th century wisdom for 21st century problem . But there were moments when I wondered what sort of life experience these students would gain here. And I wondered, what it might be like for the person who discovered they were gay and wanted to explore their sexuality; or the student who became pregnant or fell by the wayside and lapsed into drink or drugs. What would it be like for someone who felt like they didn't fit in? I enjoyed my visit to BYU. My host was completely charming throughout and happy to take all my impertinent questions in good humor. What struck me most was this was a college which, on the face of it, looked so familiar and yet underneath was a world apart from any school I had seen before.","CNN's Richard Quest is in Utah filming for the upcoming series American Quest .

"(CNN) -- Italy's parliamentary elections kick off Sunday, with polls suggesting the center-left -- led by Pier Luigi Bersani -- is on track to defeat controversial three-time prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. But Berlusconi's rise in the polls in recent weeks, combined with widespread public disillusionment, means that nothing about the race is a foregone conclusion. Who are the candidates? The two-day election is a four-horse race between political coalitions led by Bersani, Berlusconi, outgoing premier Mario Monti, and the anti-establishment movement led by ex-comedian Beppe Grillo. Polls are banned within two weeks of the elections, but the most recent ones had Bersani holding onto a slender lead over Berlusconi. Grillo was a distant third. Italy's political system encourages the forming of alliances. For example, the Democratic Party has teamed with the more left-wing Left Ecology Freedom party. The center-left alliance is dominated by the Democratic Party, led by Bersani. The 61-year-old Bersani comes across as ""bluff and homespun, and that's part of his appeal -- or not, depending on your point of view,"" said political analyst James Walston, department chair of international relations at the American University of Rome. He described Bersani, a former communist, as a ""revised apparatchik,"" saying the reform-minded socialist was paradoxically ""far more of a free marketeer than even people on the right."" At second place in the polls is the center-right alliance led by Berlusconi's PdL, in coalition with the right-wing, anti-immigration Northern League. Berlusconi has given conflicting signals as to whether he is running for the premiership, indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won, but contradicting that on other occasions. The septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed ""Il Cavaliere"" has been campaigning as a Milan court weighs his appeal against a tax fraud conviction, for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year. The verdict will be delivered after the elections; however, under the Italian legal system, he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court. Because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire this year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. Why are elections taking place now? Italian parliamentarians are elected for five-year terms, with the current one due to end in April. But in December, Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party (PdL) withdrew its support from the reformist government led by Mario Monti, saying it was pursuing policies that ""were too German-centric."" Monti subsequently resigned, and the parliament was dissolved.","Bersani's center-left alliance leads Berlusconi's center-right alliance in polls .

"Fairhope, Alabama (CNN) -- The polls and the campaign dialogue aren't much help in assessing the Mormon factor in the Alabama and Mississippi primaries. The distinct feeling on the ground was that it had an impact, leading many evangelical Christians to reject pragmatic arguments to ignore Mitt Romney's Mormonism because of his presumed electability. In a pattern dating back to the single-issue campaigns of the segregation era, discussion of this underground religious division was conducted almost entirely through code words and signals and was mainly missing from public forums and press accounts. The strongest signal came from Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, who had a political ally reveal election day morning that he was voting for Rick Santorum. The announcement came on the statewide ""Rick and Bubba"" radio show, described by the Birmingham News as having ""broad appeal to evangelical, conservative voters."" The news flashed around the state long before the polls closed. Everyone understood what was meant by a subsequent Facebook posting by Bentley, who in the last gubernatorial primary rode the church vote to victory over a better qualified Republican opponent. Bentley said he voted for Santorum because he considered him the ""most conservative candidate"" in the field. Among two-thirds of Alabama Republicans, that description translates to most-like-us-religiously. Also on election morning, the president of the Baptist-affiliated University of Mobile, Dr. Mark Foley, addressed religious divisions obliquely in a prominent op-ed piece addressed to ""persons of faith"" in the Mobile Press Register. ""Honest interpretations of scripture"" among Christians ""have formed hard lines that make it hard for us to agree,"" he wrote. He then endorsed Santorum as the best representative of ""American ideals."" Few people spoke as candidly as a caller to the popular Paul Finebaum radio show. He noted that President Obama was a congregant of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Romney is a Mormon. He concluded ""hold your nose"" and vote for the lesser of two evils. Bloc voting by evangelicals is a standard feature of Southern Republican politics, and polls show it has also fueled Santorum's rise nationally. Belief blog: Romney stumbles in bible belt . Students of the theocratic strain in Southern politics may recall that anti-Catholicism was once a major force in the region's elections. But the fact that both Santorum and Newt Gingrich are Roman Catholic had little impact this time. The South's Republican Christian base vote has been unified since 1980, when Northern urban Catholics and Southern born-agains rallied to Ronald Reagan. Religious or racial prejudice is notoriously hard for pollsters to measure. The National Election Pool found that Gingrich and Santorum together got two-thirds of the evangelical vote in Alabama and Mississippi. Romney got 27% in Alabama and 29% in Mississippi. Those numbers probably reflect the number of establishment Republicans in those states, a group that was notably subdued in the days before the election. Would anti-Mormon feeling in the South hurt Romney in a general election? That's not likely, since about half the Republican voters in Alabama and Mississippi believe Obama is a Muslim. In any event, the Deep South is so much a one-party region that nothing will get the Democratic ticket in the hunt. But in contested states, religion, like race, could be a tilt factor that the press seems reluctant to engage. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- Patti LaBelle has agreed to pay $100,000 to settle a complaint that she verbally and physically assaulted a mother and her 18-month-old daughter in a Manhattan apartment lobby two years ago, the mother's lawyer said Wednesday. The agreement ends a lawsuit that accused the singer of ""yelling, screaming obscenities, throwing water and drenching with water, attempting to strike and physically injure"" Roseanna Monk and her child, Genevieve, in the lobby of Trump Place on Manhattan's Upper West Side on November 11, 2010. LaBelle, her lawyer and representative did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on the settlement filed in a federal court in New York. A jury trial had been scheduled for late November, but U.S. District Judge John Koeltl signed an order dismissing the case at the request of each side Wednesday morning.

Monk's lawyer, Samuel Davis, told CNN Wednesday that it ""took a bunch of depositions"" before LaBelle ""recognized that she was going to have to face the music.""

""LaBelle besieged them with such ferocity, before she doused them with water, that the baby was crying hysterically,"" Davis said. ""LaBelle would not desist."" Davis called the incident violent and traumatic. ""The baby went from crying hysterically to vomiting,"" he said. The incident caused a change in the child's personality for several months, he said. ""She went from being the most outgoing, saying 'hi' to everybody in the lobby of her building, to being clingy and shy,"" he said.

"Tal Kalakh, Syria (CNN) -- In the western town of Tal Kalakh, rebel fighters stand their ground as government forces loom just yards away. But here, bullets aren't flying. That's because the two sides have agreed to something remarkable -- a cease-fire. While fragile, the agreement could be a blueprint for peace across more parts of the country, which has seen incessant bloodshed for 23 months. If the local cease-fire continues to hold, it would defy failures at the national and international levels to implement a meaningful halt in violence. ""We are for peace. We don't want war. We are 100% committed to peace,"" said a rebel leader who goes by the name Al Abrash. ""But if they want a war, we are ready for that. We didn't agree to the cease-fire out of weakness. We did it to protect the women and children."" Tal Kalakh, near Syria's border with Lebanon was one of the first cities to rebel against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. It has seen heavy fighting since the uprising began. Many civilians were forced to flee as government and rebel fighters battled in the streets. Houses, pockmarked with signs of artillery fire, bear witness to the fierce clashes that raged here. The walls of buildings in the city center are still covered in revolutionary graffiti; ""God is great! Freedom,"" one read and ""down with the thug,"" reads another. Syrian opposition: Turkish border blast was an assassination attempt . But now Tal Kalakh has become a model project of sorts. The cease-fire is a first step of a private ""reconciliation initiative"" led by a sheikh and a member of Syria's parliament. ""Before the agreement we reached, there were intense battles here. Many civilians, militants and soldiers were killed, a lot of blood was spilled. After the agreement there have been some individual violations like a soldier opening fire... but those have been dealt with straight away,"" Sheikh Habib al-Fandi said. ""Compared to the past this is a state of peace and security."" But many people in Tal Kalakh say make no mistake -- this town is still under siege. While the opposition Free Syrian Army controls Tal Kalakh, the town is surrounded by regime troops. Residents, surprised to see an international TV crew escorted by officials into their city, swarmed around the CNN team in the main square. More than a dozen people complained about harassment by government-backed militias known as ""Shabeeha."" One man with his three young children said he could not leave the city out of fear government forces would detain him. Another man said his two sons were among more than 400 Tal Kalakh residents detained since the uprising. Residents and fighters said they have had to create a makeshift graveyard close to the city center because regime troops have prevented them from reaching the main cemetery. Al-Abrash and some of his fighters gathered for prayers at the small garden where they recently buried their dead. He says three rebels have been killed since the cease-fire began. But signs of normalcy have sprouted amid the country's prolonged civil war. Some shops have reopened and the town center has come back to life. The governor of Homs, where Tal Kalakh is located, described the city as once being ""extremely dangerous and volatile,"" but now he says he is able to visit and even meet with the militants. He says Tal Kalakh is an experiment. ""If the media and military support of terrorism is stopped ... I am convinced Homs will go back to what it was like within four months,"" Governor Ahmad Munir Mohammad said. While rebel and government forces keep their positions around town, an unusual meeting takes place between a parliamentarian and rebels. The parliamentarian, Eyad Sulaiman, is an Alawite -- the same sect of Islam that President Bashar al-Assad belongs to. But he's accepted by the mostly Sunni members of the Free Syrian Army. The men agree on almost everything: They don't want a sectarian rift in Syria, they don't want foreign jihadist fighters entering the country, and they say government thugs must be stopped from harassing the population here. Sulaiman says the local cease-fire in Tal Kalakh might work elsewhere. ""We have already tried to apply this concept in areas of Damascus ... so this can be applied anywhere in Syria, as long as there is no interference by other countries,"" the parliamentarian said. Still, both sides acknowledge, the fighting could reignite anytime. Abu Udey a rebel commander who accuses regime troops of continued provocations, said: ""We don't kill people as a hobby ... the security forces in the area don't want a truce."" And there's one fundamental mission the rebels will not back down from. ""Our goal is to bring down the regime,"" Al Abbrash said. ""It's impossible to change that -- impossible to back down from that goal."" Abu Udey says the men in his city were forced to arm themselves after peaceful demonstrations were met by violence from regime forces. ""If we achieve what we want -- [to] bring down the regime through peaceful means -- we are ready to lay down our arms for peace,"" Abu Udey said.

"Oakland, California (CNN) -- San Francisco's transit system board agreed Wednesday to put together a formal policy on when cell-phone service can be cut off to commuters, in response to widespread complaints and recent protests. The Bay Area Rapid Transit's board of directors will also have the proposed policy reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission and California Public Utilities Commission. The board's decision came during a three-hour special meeting Wednesday to discuss the agency's decision earlier this month to cut off cell-phone signals at certain underground stations to ward off protests. That decision ignited a debate about free speech and public safety. The board agreed that the new policy would define the kinds of public safety threats warranting a cutoff of commuters' cell signals. Developing the new policy could take up to four weeks. The proposed policy would also be presented to free-speech groups for their review, board members said. BART director Lynette Sweet acknowledged the controversy as a ""PR nightmare."" She was upset that the board didn't have a say in the staff decision -- which was widely criticized by free-speech advocates. ""Obvious First Amendment rights and the right to have a communication are what people are looking for,"" Sweet said. ""We need to defend First Amendment rights to protest us and use cell-phone communication."" She found the widespread public criticism ""really frustrating -- I'm held accountable for a staff decision,"" she said. ""If we're gonna shut off cell phones, it has to be the most extraordinary circumstances that I equate to 9/11 level."" On August 11, demonstrators had planned a rally to bring attention to a number of transit police officer shootings, including the death of 45-year-old Charles Hill. Hill was shot July 3 after a confrontation with officers. The transit agency said protests during rush hour endangered the safety of commuters and employees. As evidence, they cited a protest on July 11 where demonstrators had used cell phones to coordinate which stations to target. That spirited and largely peaceful rally at the city's Civic Center stop was organized by a group called ""No Justice, No BART."" But at the demonstration, one person climbed atop a subway train before being pulled down. BART also said protesters blocked doors and generally delayed roughly two-thirds of trains running during the rush-hour commute that day. As a result, when protesters planned another demonstration on August 11, the subway system said it cut off cell-phone signals at some stations. BART said it did so to prevent protesters from using ""mobile devices to coordinate their disruptive activities and communicate about the location and number of BART Police."" The August 11 protests never materialized. But the decision to cut off signals elicited criticism from civil liberty organizations, the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial page and others. ""Shutting down access to mobile phones is the wrong response to political protests, whether it's halfway around the world or right here at home,"" the ACLU of Northern California said. The Federal Communications Commission said it is looking into the incident. ""Any time communications services are interrupted, we seek to assess the situation,"" FCC spokesman Neil Grace said last week. ""We ... will be taking steps to hear from stakeholders about the important issues those actions raised, including protecting public safety and ensuring the availability of communications networks,"" Grace said. Last week, hackers attacked BART's website and posted the home addresses and other information of all 102 police officers on the train system's police force. It wasn't clear who was to blame for the hacking incident. But in a prior hacking incident on August 14, members of the well-known hacking group Anonymous took credit in online messages for breaking into a link off BART's website. The hackers posted information from BART's internal network, including phone numbers of hundreds of people. Meanwhile, police alternately closed and reopened commuter train stations in downtown San Francisco Monday after demonstrators gathered to protest the recent shootings. CNN's Dan Simon reported from Oakland, California.","NEW: BART board will have FCC and others vet proposed policy .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it is requiring manufacturers of insomnia products, such as Ambien, Edluar and Zolpimist, to lower their current recommended doses. The drugs contain an active ingredient called zolpidem, which causes drowsiness. Researchers have found high levels of zolpidem in the blood of some patients the morning after a dose -- so much so it affects patients' cognitive skills, including their ability to drive. The FDA said using lower doses of zolpidem will cut down on the amount of the drug found in the bloodstream the following morning. It also noted that the recommended dosage should be lower for women, because they don't process zolpidem out of their system as quickly as men. The agency recommended the dosage of zolpidem for women be lowered to 5 milligrams from 10 milligrams for immediate-release products and to 6.25 milligrams from 12.5 milligrams for extended-release products. Patients who use the extended-release forms of these drugs have an even higher risk for next morning impairment, according to the FDA. The FDA said new labeling on the insomnia products will let doctors know they should consider a lower dose for men, especially for those who are having difficulty concentrating the next morning. And all patients, the FDA said, should be told about the possible ""morning after"" risks. ""Patients should also read the medication guides and understand the benefits and risks of these drugs,"" said Dr. Ellis Unger of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""We believe that by lowering these doses, we can decrease the side effects that happen the morning after."" Unger said that those who are taking these drugs talk to their doctors first before changing the dosage. He added that morning impairment is not limited to products with zolpidem. Drowsiness is a symptom listed on a number of insomnia drugs, and Unger said that alertness may be impaired even if the person doesn't feel sleepy. In making its recommendations, the FDA looked at findings from a large driving simulation study that showed some people taking products containing zolpidem had higher levels of the drug in their system and could not operate a vehicle as well as those who did not take the drugs, or who took lower doses.","Insomnia drugs contain active ingredient zolpidem, which causes drowsiness .

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Robert Jeffress, a leading evangelical minister, claimed last Friday that Mormons are not Christians. Jeffress went on to declare that Mormonism is ""a cult,"" meaning it's not a ""real"" religion, and he implored his followers to reject Mitt Romney, a Mormon, as a candidate for president because as Jeffress sees it: ""As Christians, we have the duty to prefer and select Christians as our leaders."" Jeffress is infamous for his past ""Christian"" comments such as: Jews, gays, Muslims and Mormons are all going to hell; Islam encourages pedophilia; and that gays should be banned from the military because 70% of the gay population has AIDS. At the time of Jeffress' comments about Mormons, I happened to be in Utah, the state with the largest percentage of Mormons in the nation. I'm not Mormon, meaning I'm not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And prior to this trip, I had met only a few members of the LDS Church. I was in Salt Lake City because I'm performing as part of a stand-up comedy tour called ""The Muslims Are Coming,"" featuring American-Muslim comedians performing free comedy shows across the country as a way, we hope, to counter misinformation and build bridges with our fellow Americans. There we were -- Muslims and Mormons -- bonding on some level because we were both the subject of attacks from people on the far right. Earlier in this presidential campaign it was our time, with Herman Cain essentially arguing for discrimination against American Muslims simply because of our faith. Now the voices of hate had turned their focus to Mormons. Over the last four days I have spent a great deal of time with members of the LDS Church. I'm not saying that I'm an expert on their teachings and, to be honest, I had some apprehension about Mormons because the LDS Church had publicly funded opposition to marriage equality in California, which I disagree with because I oppose discrimination against any American. But I can now say without hesitation that the LDS Church members we met represented the best of Christianity. They were truly caring and compassionate people. And perhaps it's overly simplistic to define an entire religion by the few hundred we met, but let's be honest: many define religions, races and ethnicities by a few of their worst examples. I prefer instead to define minority groups by their best examples. While it probably doesn't matter to a person like Jeffress, the LDS members we met proudly consider themselves Christians. After all, the full name of their religion is ""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."" If your religion has the words ""Jesus Christ"" in its name, it's kind of a tip off that Christ's teachings are important to you. In contrast to the hate spewed by Jeffress, we found that the Mormons we met truly represent the Christian ideal of loving your neighbor. One of the best examples we found of a true Christian was Andrew Kosorok, a proud member of the LDS Church and a talented glassmaker who created an awe-inspiring glass exhibit called ""99 Most Beautiful Names: A Sculptural Presentation of the Names of God from the Quran."" Kosorok had sacrificed hundreds of hours of time from his family and friends and spent more than $7,000 of his own money to create this exhibit. Why did Kosorok do this? Because he believed that fostering understanding and countering negative misconceptions about another faith -- in this case Islam -- was part of his duty as a Christian. This passage from the New Testament is often cited as one that articulates Jesus' philosophy: ""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."" (John 13:34-35) In comparing the hate-filled language of Jeffress with the words and good deeds of the Mormons we met, it is clear to me who is best following the teachings of Jesus Christ and truly deserves to be called a Christian. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Rev. Robert Jeffress recently called Mormonism ""a cult""

"(CNN) -- The riskiest, trickiest, friskiest movie you can see right now happens to be a documentary. Don't let that put you off. This is the story of an ambitious European entrepreneur who buys himself diplomatic immunity for less than $200,000. That would be Danish agent provocateur Mads Brugger, who greases several palms in a bid to get himself appointed the Liberian ambassador to the Central African Republic. And why would anyone want to do that? Well, if you think Liberia could use some governmental oversight, wait until you see what goes on in the Central African Republic. While most of the populace is mired in poverty, let's not forget that this former French colony is also home to some of the world's richest diamond fields (which is where diplomatic status proves an invaluable investment). We're used to seeing intrepid reporters digging out a story, but bribing officials to smuggle out blood diamonds? That's not something Robert Redford would have done, surely? Brugger is short and bald, very white, and with a ginger goatee. In his previous film, ""The Red Chapel,"" he sneaked a peek into North Korea under the guise of filming a theatrical troupe on a cultural exchange. Here he dresses the part of a colonial martinet: tight jackets, jodhpurs, riding boots, and even affects a cigarette holder. He makes ""humorous"" remarks about Hitler in an effort to ingratiate himself with his new friends -- a ploy that works quite well, actually -- and liberally distributes what he calls ""little envelopes of happiness"" to smooth the way for his business proposal, a plan to build a match factory staffed by the country's pygmy tribe. This is his cover story, a fig leaf for his smuggling plans, and an illustration of the kind of development that might genuinely help the indigenous peoples. But it's also a cruel hoax on the pygmies he meets, collateral damage in his bid to expose their corrupt political masters and the international diplomatic classes who feed off them. Brugger is playing with dynamite here. The closest comparison may be Sacha Baron Cohen's knife-edge satirical rubes. The film is often very funny even if you feel lousy about laughing -- except that Baron Cohen hasn't put his own neck on the line like this. Central Africa can be a dangerous place at the best of times. For a long while Brugger is marooned there (his documentation has not come through, and in fairness to Liberia's authorities, it never does), and if he needs any reminder of what could go wrong, it all comes crashing home when one of his interviewees is assassinated. The movie's last 20 minutes play like a real-life John le Carré spy thriller: The wheels start to come off the deceit and we have to wonder if he'll be able to extricate himself without serious injury. ""The Ambassador"" is a damning movie on almost every level. You might have serious reservations about his methods, but you can't fault the man's nerve. It's extraordinary just how many illicit conversations with important men Brugger manages to get on camera. Already the Liberian president has called for an inquiry, though there seems little likelihood of similar soul-searching in the Central African Republic. In any case, Brugger has given his testimony and issued his indictments, too.","The filmmaker plays at a game of deceit to uncover corruption .

"(CNN) -- At the time of his death, Heath Ledger had just concluded his work as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" the sequel to 2005's ""Batman Begins."" Heath Ledger died in January at age 28. He had been expected to hit new heights of stardom. The buzz surrounding his performance was electrifying. He was remaking the Joker; he wasn't a camp comedian like Cesar Romero or a malevolent clown like Jack Nicholson. He was pure nihilism, with his jagged makeup and ragged hair. Even glimpses of his smile on the ""Dark Knight"" movie posters were thrilling. And then he was gone. ""We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications,"" read the New York City medical examiner's office report, affectlessly. Who knows what could have happened? The hype surrounding ""The Dark Knight,"" partly fueled by Ledger's death, turned out to have been warranted; the film earned critical praise and planeloads of money. Ledger has been posthumously nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award and is expected to receive an Oscar nomination, as well. Had he lived, he could have named his price. We'll never know. ""Prediction is very difficult, especially of the future,"" the physicist Niels Bohr is credited with saying. Ledger's movie, ""The Dark Knight"" -- with its uncertain, bleak Gotham City --seemed symbolic of the year in entertainment. A writers' strike cast a pall over awards season. The paparazzi's favorite target, Britney Spears, was institutionalized for a time. Pixar's brilliant ""Wall-E"" depicted an Earth abandoned to the waste of consumerism.  See some of the year's top entertainment stories » . Even the presidential campaign, source of so many laughs for late-night comedians, was fraught with 3 a.m. phone calls and ""terrorist fist bumps."" Why wouldn't people be attracted to change and hope? Hollywood, usually a prime provider of optimism, is littered with the stories of lights put out early. James Dean was 24 when a Ford coupe crossed into his lane and hit his Porsche Spyder head-on near Cholame, California. River Phoenix was 23 when he died of a drug overdose outside the Viper Room in Hollywood. They are two of too many. So: On January 22, 2008, Heath Ledger was found dead in a New York apartment. He was 28. Asking ""what if"" is a dead end. ""Saturday Night Live,"" many years ago, used to mock it: What if Superman grew up in Nazi Germany? What if Eleanor Roosevelt could fly? The past is past, what's done is done, and the future can be fickle, anyway. So many of the year's stories had unexpected outcomes. Consider: For almost two decades, movie audiences eagerly awaited a new Indiana Jones film. This year, they got their wish with ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" and the film was widely criticized for taxing the credulousness of even its most dedicated fans. It's one thing to chat with a centuries-old Grail Knight, but surviving an A-bomb by hiding in a refrigerator? Not quite. Then there was the ultimate reality show: the election. If you'd polled media professionals last year, they might have named Hillary Clinton and Fred Thompson as the future nominees. John McCain's campaign was on life-support; Barack Obama's was struggling. We all know how things turned out. And the election also made a star -- a celebrity, if you will -- of Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate. Palin had a charisma -- the TV execs call it ""breakthrough"" -- that, at times, overshadowed the man at the top of the GOP ticket. iReport.com: What was your most memorable entertainment event this year? There was something else about Palin: She looked like Tina Fey, once the ""Weekend Update"" anchor and head writer for ""Saturday Night Live,"" now the star of the smart ""30 Rock."" Fey went back on her old show and had great success parodying Palin, driving ""SNL"" to some of its highest ratings in years. (Palin also looked like ""King of the Hill's"" Peggy Hill, but unlike Fey, the animated character wasn't a Second City-trained comedy performer who could strike in real time.) Some observers foresee a bright future for the Alaska governor; others believe she'll wear out her welcome. Time, again, will tell. Cast members of ""Saturday Night Live"" are object lessons: John Belushi and Chris Farley, gone before their times; Robert Downey Jr. (1985-86) emerges from a lifetime of troubles with two hit movies and Entertainment Weekly's Entertainer of the Year distinction. Other notables had a chance to live out three rich acts. Paul Newman, who epitomized the best qualities of a performer and human being -- thoughtful, charitable, capable, courageous -- died in September. Visionary author Arthur C. Clarke died in March; elemental guitarist Bo Diddley died in June. And comedian George Carlin, who viewed life as ""a ticket to the freak show"" and ""a zero-sum game,"" died in June. Carlin, who reveled in absurdity, had the right attitude to try to figure out ""what if."" In his surrealist way, he noted that the light at the end of the tunnel could be daylight -- or, maybe, an approaching train. Either way, it'll be here soon enough. ""The future,"" he once said, ""will soon be a thing of the past.""","Heath Ledger died in January, had been expected to reach new stardom .

"(CNN Student News) -- January 14, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Port-au-Prince, Haiti • China . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Today, we are exploring the connection between your education and your community's economy. Thank you for spending part of your Thursday with CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's go. First Up: Quake Update . AZUZ: Massive devastation, severe loss of life, uncertainty about what to do or where to go: That is what is facing survivors of Tuesday's deadly earthquake in Haiti. The Caribbean island nation is home to around 9 million people. The Red Cross says that one out of every three of those residents was affected by this quake. Yesterday, Haiti's president told CNN that it was too early to know how many people had died in the tremor, although he had heard reports ranging from 30,000 to 100,000. To make matters worse, he said it's difficult to help people who have been injured because many hospitals were destroyed by the earthquake. Several Haitian officials have said that all of Port-au-Prince, the capital city, is either damaged or destroyed. The quake struck about 10 miles from the city. One CNN reporter on the scene described the devastation as ""horrifying and disturbing."" In downtown Port-au-Prince, he said, ""block after block after block, there is not one building."" The country's president is calling on the international community for aid, saying, ""We need doctors, we need medicine, we need medical help."" The U.S., along with nations from Europe, Asia and South America, as well as global relief agencies -- all of them have already begun sending relief workers and assistance to Haiti. President Obama has pledged that America will have a major role in the relief efforts. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The people of Haiti will have the full support of the United States in the urgent effort to rescue those trapped beneath the rubble and to deliver the humanitarian relief: the food, water and medicine that Haitians will need in the coming days. AZUZ: Haiti is part of the island of Hispaniola, along with the Dominican Republic. And that island has a fault line that runs along its southern side. That's why scientists have warned that Hispaniola was at risk for a major earthquake. Haiti itself is a little smaller than the state of Maryland. It's the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. 80 percent of its population lives under the poverty line, and that economic situation might create additional challenges as the country tries to recover from this natural disaster. Impact Your World . AZUZ: That recovery process: likely to be long and difficult. We've already mentioned that several countries and agencies have launched relief efforts. But if you want to get involved, head to the Spotlight section at CNNStudentNews.com and click on the ""Impact Your World"" link. You're going to find a list of organizations that can use your help. Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... censorship (noun) the act of deleting or restricting something . Google v. China . AZUZ: Google has been practicing self-censorship for years in China. When the Internet giant first started operating in the communist country -- that was in 2006 -- China's government demanded that some search results be restricted. Google said okay, arguing that it was providing at least some information to Chinese citizens. But now, the company is changing its policy. John Vause explains why and what it might mean for Google's future in the world's most populated country. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN VAUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT, BEIJING: After all the self-censorship, the government Web crackdowns, after compromising its own stated ethics, Google, it seems, has finally had enough of doing business the China way. JEREMY GOLDKORN, DANWEI.COM: Google has been subject to inordinate amount of harassment in China over the last year. VAUSE: The tipping point, it seems, is what the Internet giant calls ""sophisticated"" cyber attacks originating from within China, targeting gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. None were breached, but the company says the attacks ""...have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China,"" and it's ""...no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn."".... ""This may well mean having to shut down Google.cn and potentially our offices in China."" GOLDKORN: I imagine the Chinese government's reaction is going to be well, if you don't like our laws, get lost. VAUSE: Within hours of the announcement, the self-censorship was being rolled back. Search results from Google's China server showed images of the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square. So too, the Dalai Lama and the outlawed religious group Falun Gong. For a company with ""don't do evil"" as its motto, this defiant new stand one praise from supporters of free speech, who in the past have been critical of Google for agreeing to government censorship as a condition for setting up shop in China. ROSEANN RIFE, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL: They've revisited the idea of censorship and are now saying that the price they're paying is perhaps too high. VAUSE: If Google really does pull out of China, it could come with huge financial cost. This country has more than 300 million Internet users, more than any other, and the Internet advertising market here is seen as one of the most important and fastest growing in the world. Google has not directly accused the Chinese government of being involved in the cyber attacks and says it will seek negotiations with Beijing over the next few weeks to see if it's possible to continue to operate here. Chinese government officials declined to comment when asked by CNN. Meantime, all Beijing Google staff are now reportedly on paid leave. John Vause, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO) Financial Hearing . AZUZ: In Washington, D.C., a commission set up by Congress is investigating the U.S. financial crisis. They're looking into what caused it and hopefully how to avoid another one in the future. As part of that investigation, the commission has been talking with some government officials. And yesterday, it met with the chief executives of four of the country's biggest banks. The head of the commission said he wanted to hear the bankers talk about their companies' roles in causing the crisis. The executives acknowledged that their banks had made mistakes, but said they didn't realize how bad those mistakes were at the time. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What percent of American students earn their high school diploma? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) 50 percent, B) 70 percent, C) 85 percent or D) 95 percent? You've got three seconds -- GO! Only 70 percent of students earn their high school diplomas. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Dropout Ripple Effect . AZUZ: Okay, that number may surprise you. Another thing you might not realize is that getting your high school diploma can help many more people than just you. A new study looked at how communities would've benefited if more people stayed in school. Take a look at what it found out. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: Soaring unemployment, states trying to avoid running out of money: Could students dropping out of high school actually make this worse? Absolutely, says the Alliance for Excellent Education. The group's been analyzing the effects that dropouts have, not only on themselves, but on the places where they live, and they found that just getting a high school diploma can dramatically affect communities. Here's how the study worked: An estimated 600,000 students dropped out of the class of 2008. The Alliance figured out how the country could've benefited if just half of them, 300,000, had gotten their diplomas. It estimated they would've earned a combined $4.1 billion more money in an average year. Then, they could've spent $2.8 billion more and invested more than $1 billion more. So what? Well, all that additional spending could've supported 30,000 more jobs; you know we could use them now. And down the road, these hypothetical graduates could've bought homes valued at $10.5 billion more than what they'd have spent without diplomas. And they'd probably have the money to spend $340 million more on cars. With the taxes that come with all that spending, the Alliance estimates that states and communities would be pulling in an extra $536 million a year. And the point? To show how getting a diploma doesn't just help students, it helps the country. SUSAN LISCOVICZ, CNN BUSINESS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Right now, there are 7,000 kids, estimated, that drop out of school every day. The Alliance president says this report underscores the notion that the best economic stimulus package is a high school diploma. AZUZ: Another reason why all this means so much.

"(CNN) -- The body of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will lie in state in the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang, which houses the corpse of his father, Kim Il Sung, North Korean state-run media reported Thursday. The secretive state also plans to erect a statue of Kim Jong Il and build towers across the country to symbolize his ""immortality,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported, citing orders from the leaders of the ruling Workers Party. North Korea announced Kim Jong Il's death on December 19, putting the region on edge as observers speculated about the nuclear-armed regime's stability and future direction. Pyongyang held an elaborately choreographed funeral procession and memorial ceremony the following week that served to underline the elevation of Kim Jong Un -- the youngest son and chosen successor of Kim Jong Il -- to the position of ""supreme leader"" of the country. On Thursday, the regime also announced that February 16, Kim Jong Il's birthday, will henceforth be known as ""the Day of the Shining Star."" His father's birthday is dubbed ""the Day of the Sun"" in the North Korean calendar.","North Korea plans to erect a statue of Kim Jong Il and build towers across the country .

"(CNN) -- Let the games begin -- finally. The National Hockey League season will officially get under way Saturday, three months later than scheduled, the league announced on its website. The NHL Players' Association ratified a new collective bargaining agreement Saturday, ending the lockout that began September 15. The agreement came after a sometimes acrimonious process to retool the labor deal between the players' association and the league. During on-and-off negotiations, the NHL scrapped its preseason, all games through 2012 and threatened to scratch the entire season if a deal couldn't be reached. But on January 6, the league and the players announced they'd struck a tentative agreement after a 16-hour negotiating session. The league's board of governors approved the deal Wednesday, but it wasn't official until Saturday. Hours after the players ratified the agreement, leaders from the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding about the terms of the new 10-year labor deal. Training camps begin Sunday, the NHL said. Three games will open the truncated regular season at 3 p.m. ET on Saturday: Pittsburgh at Philadelphia, Ottawa at Winnipeg and Chicago at Los Angeles, the reigning Stanley Cup champion. The season will be 48 games, down from the standard 82. The regular season ends April 27. The last time the league had labor strife, the entire 2004-05 season was eliminated.","NHL owners locked out their players and sought a new labor deal .

"(CNN) -- After six months of negotiations with Kansas prosecutors, a veteran accused of stalking with intent to harm members of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church pleaded guilty to lesser charges, his lawyer said. Former Army Sgt. Ryan Newell pleaded guilty Thursday to two counts of false impersonation of an officer Thursday, a misdemeanor in Kansas. Newell received a six-month suspended sentence on each count and was given two years on probation, said his lawyer, Boyd McPherson. McPherson said the negotiations were long, but his team and the district attorney's office in Wichita wanted to ensure that the charges were made ""when the timing was ripe."" ""Without getting into the personal details of Mr. Newell's life, the state wanted to ensure that Sgt. Newell was in a position that the behavior that got him into this original situation wouldn't be repeated,"" McPherson said. Newell was charged with stalking church members and the Phelps family that runs Westboro Baptist in December. The church has garnered media attention for protesting at funerals of military servicemen who have died during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, claiming that the deaths of U.S. troops are God's punishment for America's ""sin of homosexuality."" Despite the lengthy talks with prosecutors, the attorney described Thursday's outcome as unexpected. ""I'm sure his family is pleased with the outcome and that this chapter of his life is closed and they can move forward,"" McPherson said. ""But I don't know that they realized it would be over today."" Newell, of Marion, Kansas, originally faced charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated battery and three misdemeanor counts of criminal use of weapons. At the time of his arrest, Sedgwick County, Kansas, police recovered an M4 assault rile, a .45-caliber Glock, a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol and 90 rounds of ammunition. Newell is a retired turret gunner who lost both legs to an improvised bomb in Afghanistan in 2008. Newell entered into an unspecified treatment program as a condition of his release on bail, and his attorney said he has improved dramatically since then. ""I feel that he is doing wonderfully in every aspect of his life, whereas when he came to me, there were a number of layers that weren't functioning as well,"" McPherson said.","Former Sgt.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from a North Carolina county that had regularly opened its public meetings with Christian prayers. The church-state dispute is a victory for two Forsyth County residents who brought suit against the Board of Commissioners. Janet Joyner and Constance Lynn Blackmon were represented in their court challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ""When government meetings are opened regularly with Christian prayer, it sends the unmistakable message that non-Christians are second-class citizens in their own community,"" said the Rev. Barry Lynn, who heads Americans United, a Washington-based group. ""The Constitution clearly forbids government to play favorites when it comes to religion."" Court records show that 26 of 33 invocations given at the council meetings in 2007 and 2008 contained references to Jesus Christ, the Trinity, or other Christian symbols or names. Clergy members from the community often delivered the sectarian invocations. The county seat is Winston-Salem, one the largest cities in the state. A federal appeals court last year found the prayers to be an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government endorsement of one religion over another. The case is Forsyth County, N.C., v. Joyner (11-546). The high court also turned aside a pair of student speech cases involving off-campus activity in the digital age. Both appeals involved school suspensions of students who engaged in cyberattacks using their home computers. In one appeal from northeastern Pennsylvania, the justices let stand a lower-court ruling in favor of an eighth-grade girl who created a fake MySpace profile of her male principal, who was described as a ""hairy sex addict"" and a ""pervert."" Attached was a real photo of James McGonigle of Blue Mountain Middle School near Allentown. Court records show the posting was widely circulated at the school among students and faculty, and the principal eventually suspended the girl for 10 days. Her parents, Steven and Terry Snyder, then sued and were represented by the ACLU, which called the posting a ""juvenile humor"" parody. A federal appeals court concluded that the posting caused no substantial disruption at the school, and that officials lacked authority ""to punish students for off-campus speech."" That same court also ruled in favor of a Pittsburgh-area high school student who also created a mock MySpace profile of his principal, who was labeled as a drug user, ""whore,"" and ""big fag."" But a separate appeals court had given a West Virginia school district a legal victory after a high school senior was punished for creating what officials called a targeted ""hate website."" Kara Kowalski had organized a MySpace discussion group involving about a 100 classmates, suggesting a fellow student was a ""slut"" who had contracted herpes. Kowalski sued after she was cited for violating the county school policy on bullying and harassment. Free speech advocates and national school coalitions separately urged the high court to intervene and resolve the conflicting rulings, but the justices gave no reason for their decision to stay out, at least in these disputes. ""Now is the time for the Supreme Court to resolve the question of whether and to what extent school districts have the authority to discipline students for off-campus speech,"" said Francisco Negron Jr., of the National School Boards Association. ""As technology blurs the lines between on-campus and off-campus speech, school districts need clear guidance to be able to effectively address extreme off-campus speech that interferes with a safe and orderly learning environment."" In the famous ""Tinker"" case from 1969, the Supreme Court ruled two Iowa high school students could continue wearing anti-Vietnam War armbands. The high court established an important precedent, saying students do not ""shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse door."" But school administrators do retain the authority to restrict any activity that would cause a ""substantial disruption"" of the school's educational mission. The current cases are Blue Mountain School District v. J.S. (11-502); and Kowalski v. Berkeley County Schools (11-461).","Two Forsyth County, North Carolina, residents objected to board meeting prayers .

"DENVER, Colorado -- Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy, recuperating from recent brain surgery, made a dramatic appearance at his party's national convention in Denver, Colorado on Monday. Edward Kennedy's speech in Denver, Colorado, marked his second public appearance since brain surgery. The senator pledged to see Barack Obama to the White House and his own return to the Senate floor. Caroline Kennedy, daughter of slain President John F. Kennedy, introduced her ailing uncle. The following is a transcript of his speech:  Watch Kennedy electrify the convention » . Edward Kennedy:  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Caroline. My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here. And nothing -- nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight. I have come here tonight to stand with you to change America, to restore its future, to rise to our best ideals, and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States. As I look ahead, I am strengthened by family and friendship. So many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days. Together we have known success and seen setbacks, victory and defeat. But we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world. And I pledge to you -- I pledge to you that I will be there next January on the floor of the United States Senate when we begin the great test. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. For me this is a season of hope -- new hope for a justice and fair prosperity for the many, and not just for the few -- new hope. And this is the cause of my life -- new hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every American -- north, south, east, west, young, old -- will have decent, quality health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege. We can meet these challenges with Barack Obama. Yes, we can, and finally, yes, we will. Barack Obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender and group against group and straight against gay. And Barack Obama will be a commander-in-chief who understands that young Americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake, but always for a mission worthy of their bravery. We are told that Barack Obama believes too much in an America of high principle and bold endeavor, but when John Kennedy called of going to the moon, he didn't say it's too far to get there. We shouldn't even try. Our people answered his call and rose to the challenge, and today an American flag still marks the surface of the moon. Yes, we are all Americans. This is what we do. We reach the moon. We scale the heights. I know it. I've seen it. I've lived it. And we can do it again. There is a new wave of change all around us, and if we set our compass true, we will reach our destination -- not merely victory for our Party, but renewal for our nation. And this November the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans, so with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on. iReport.com: Share your reactions to DNC speeches .","Speech was his second time in public since undergoing surgery for a brain tumor .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- After days sitting in freezing temperatures next to their slain loved ones, the families of dozens of bombing victims will end their protest and bury the bodies, a protest organizer said. Relatives had camped out at major intersections of Quetta since late last week to protest the deaths of 97 residents killed by a series of bombings on Thursday. The deadliest blasts were two suicide bombings in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood known as Alamdar Road. The double bombing, described by police as one of the worst attacks on the Shiite minority, killed 85 people. A banned Sunni militant group claimed responsibility. A third explosion in killed 12 people in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, on Thursday. Police blamed Baloch insurgents for that blast. Although Balochistan is the largest province in Pakistan geographically, analysts and some locals have criticized the federal government for neglecting it, leading to instability. The Shiite community has repeatedly asked for more protection, but to no avail. On Sunday, Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf met with Shiites in Quetta, Pakistani media reported. Ashraf addressed protestors who participated in the protest sit-in. He said he would meet one of the two major demands of the group -- tossing out the provincial government and putting a governor in charge. However, Ashraf said he wouldn't implement military rule in the city but would leave it up to the governor to ask for more help -- if needed -- from paramilitary forces to try to quell the violence. The visit appeared to satisfy protesters. ""We end our sit-in protest as the government has assured us ... action against perpetrators of the blasts,"" said Qayoum Changezi, an organizer of the demonstration. Changezi said the government had agreed to meet almost all of their demands and said burials would now proceed. Not burying dead bodies immediately after death is taboo in Islam. The soul of the body is not considered to be at rest until the body is in the ground. Quetta is the capital of Balochistan province, an area regularly plagued by violence. In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban. Read more: What's working in Pakistan . Last week's string of attacks was the deadliest so far against the minority Shiite community, which has been targeted repeatedly in the past by groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a banned Sunni militant group. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the Alamdar Road attacks. More on Pakistan: India and Pakistan trade accusations over Kashmir violence . Shiites, a minority sect in mainly Sunni Muslim Pakistan, face persecution from extremists. Last month, more than 20 Shiite pilgrims were killed when a car bomb detonated near the buses they were traveling in. Mir Zubair Mehmood, a Quetta police official, said the Alamdar attacks were motivated by Sunni and Shiite sectarian differences. Read more: Malala, others on front lines in fight for women .
