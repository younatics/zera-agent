"There is never really a good time to watch porn at work, no matter how empty you think the office is. But even when you've checked every meeting room, toilet cubicle and the office kitchen to ensure the coast is clear, it is always a good idea to close the blinds. That is what one lonesome worker in Australia learned when he was caught red handed pouring over a graphic X-rated video at his desk - by office employees across the street. Smutting his stuff: Despite their applause and calls of encouragement, the white-shirted worker bashfully turned off his computer and vanished into a darker corner of his office where he could no longer be seen . The picture was taken by Twitter user James P in . Brisbane who posted it on the social networking site for the world to see. It immediately went viral. Lounging in his swivel chair, the unidentified voyeur continued watching the flick, blissfully unaware that he was giving the building opposite a peep show of its very own.

We gave him a round of applause, he closed his screen down...' It is not the first time an employee has exposed their predilection for the adult arts to public scrutiny. In December a high school teacher became an internet sensation after he hooked up his laptop to a projector screen in a lecture hall, apparently unaware of the Pornhub.com account notification email sitting at the top of his inbox. As titters rippled through the auditorium, one enterprising student took a picture of the screen and posted it online, thus compounding the teacher's already widespread humiliation.

In November last year, German sex therapist Dr Christoph Ahlers told a conference on medicine and therapies for the treatment of sexual behavioural issues that as much as two thirds of the world's office workers have watched porn from their desks.

"The idea of heading deep into the desert to camp under the stars has been given the ultimate upgrade by one company in Oman. Forget sleeping in cramped tents and eating food cooked on a gas stove, Hud Hud Travels . Many guests visit the far-flung Arabian Peninsula to experience the capital city of Muscat, but Hud Hud Travels offers an opportunity to sample a taste of rural Oman.. without sacrificing any of life's little luxuries. With options to customise an already-developed itinerary or design a completely bespoke holiday from start to finish, guides will tailor the days and nights of your safari specifically to suit your interests. Whether you prefer to shop in the souks, visit an ancient village, or swim in a water-filled ravine, known as a wadi, Hud Hud offers an adventure through northern Oman like no other. Is this the most luxurious desert camp in the world? African style tents are set up in the Wahiba Desert . Working closely with the guides, guests can customise a five-to-seven day itinerary suited to their interests . First time visitors, however, may prefer to stick to Hud Hud's suggested five or seven day schedules, which includes at least one night in the Wahiba Desert and one in the Hajar Mountains. Since all of the camps are entirely private and mobile, Hud Hud can camp almost anywhere in Oman, literally making the entire country your playground. 'We love to develop very special itineraries that add in different modes of transport and different activities,' says a spokesperson for Hud Hud. For example, in the past, Hud Hud has organised such events a village-wide Arabian horse show - for just two guests - and even a catered sushi dinner in the middle of the desert. Hud Hud also organises stunning, yet remote special events - like a sushi dinner in the middle of the desert . While camping in Wahiba Sands, guests stay in traditional Bedouin tents, complete with beds and mattresses . Relax and enjoy a book - with stunning sand dune views - with your significant other . Tents are also outfitted with cotton bedding, Arabian rugs and throws, and other elegant furnishings . Despite all the high-end luxuries, there is no electric light - instead, there's an emphasis on preserving the natural atmosphere using only candles, oil lamps, and fires . In the Wahiba Sands, guests will sleep in authentic, handmade Bedouin tents - complete with large beds and real mattresses, cotton bedding, Arabian rugs and throws and elegant furnishings. However, there is no electric light. Instead, there is an emphasis on preserving the natural atmosphere using only candles, oil lamps and fires. After enjoying the desert, guests can also take day trips within the Sharqiya Region and experience traditional villages, old forts, castles and tombs. There are also several 'wadis' and canyons in the area for swimming, but the real attraction is the region's famous camel racing. Day trips in the Sharqiya Region are also possible. Pictured: an elegant set-up in Oman's Empty Quarter, an area of over 250,000 square miles of dunes . All basic itineraries also include time spent in the Hajar Mountains to allow travellers to experience two completely different sides of the country . All  Hajar Mountain camps are set up at 1,000 m elevation with views of Oman's highest peak: Jebel Shams . By contrast, in the days and nights spent in the Hajar Mountains, travellers will have the opportunity to experience a completely opposite part of Oman. The camps are set up at 1,000 m, in complete privacy, with stunning views of Oman's highest peak: Jebel Shams. And there are activities for all interests. For those excited about geology, for example, Hud Hud can arrange for specialists to come in to speak to you about the area. Or simply wander the traditional mountain villages and chat with locals about their lifestyle. The camp is also within easy reach of both Nizwa and Bahla, close to one of Oman's greatest off road drives, as well as accessible to date plantations and Nizwa's famous souk. Longer trips can also include time spent camping along the coast. Pictured: the Khalouf Beach .

A dune-top lunch table can also be set up to offer guests a truly unique view of the ocean below . An outdoor, beach-front living space is likewise constructed for guests spending time in the coastal region . In this relatively remote area, about five hours south of Muscat, tourists can meet local fisherman and experience the wildlife - namely, flamingoes . Though stunning during the day, it's at night that the real show begins: a night-sky completely lit with stars . Hud Hud is also happy to provide a custom adventure or mode of transport - such as a chartered boat . Ocean lovers can opt for a longer stay to experience the sandy beauty of Khalouf Beach and take dip in the Indian Ocean. Located about five hours south of Muscat, tourists rarely reach the stunning remote area, where guests can explore sand dunes, meet local fisherman, and spend time with the flamingoes native to the area. No matter where you decide to set up camp, however, it is the night sky that is the true show-stopper - the sparkling constellations made visible in these remote areas will impress even the most experienced of astronomers.

"The fourth wave of of celebrity nudes hacked from the iCloud has been leaked online - revealing its first male victim. Less high profile than the previous victims, this bout features Nick Hogan, son of Hulk, as well as Winona Ryder, 90210 actress AnnaLynne McCord, and Victoria's Secret model Erin Heatherton. It comes four days after a lawyer for more than a dozen targeted celebrities issued Google with a threat to sue for $100 million for 'failing to act' and 'making millions and profiting from the victimization of women'. Scroll down for video . First male victim: Reality TV star Nick Hogan, son of wrestler Hulk Hogan, is said to be the hacker's first victim as nude images of him appear to have been uploaded to image-sharing site 4Chan in the fourth wave of hacks . Hacked: Winona Ryder (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio's ex Erin Heatherton have had nudes leaked on 4Chan . Prolific: 147 images of The Vampire Diaries actress Nina Dobrev (left) - fully-clothed - have allegedly surfaced in the fourth and latest bout of hacks, and nude images include those of 90210 actress AnnaLynne McCord (right) The latest hit will also come as a blow to Apple as the tech firm desperately tries to tighten security on the iCloud - which allows users to attempt access to any account an unlimited amount of times. Other victims targeted today include the singer Ingrid Michaelson and indie actress Zoe Kazan, who appears in 43 of the images uploaded to photo-sharing blog 4Chan. And at least 147 personal, fully-clothed images of The Vampire Diaries actress Nina Dobrev have also emerged, according to the Daily Beast. Many have surmised that the controversy may be coming to a close given the lower profile of the hacker's latest victims. The first wave of explicit, personal images were released on August 31, featuring Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, and Kate Upton. Since, images have surfaced of singers Rihanna and Avril Lavigne, TV actress Kaley Cuoco, American goalkeeper Hope Solo, and socialities Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton. The images have been cached by thousands of users all over the world and shared on other blogs and websites, meaning many still appear on Google Images. Reddit closed the forum titled Fappening, a lewd reference to masturbation, a week after the first hit on receiving a warning that the images violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Scandal: Photos of Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other stars', including supermodel Kate Upton and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, were first published online last month, with more after that . Victims: Naked images are also alleged to feature actress Vanessa Hudgens (left) and TV actress Kaley CUoco (right). They were reportedly posted to image-sharing forum 4chan and RedditRead . Marty Singer, a powerful Hollywood attorney, claims he also issued more than a dozen warning letters to Google but received no response. Singer, half of Lavely & Singer law firm in Los Angeles, California, is now persuing legal action on behalf of a number of A-list victims. In a letter to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Singer accused the pair of 'blatantly unethical behavior'. 'Because the victims are celebrities with valuable publicity rights you do nothing - nothing but collect millions of dollars in advertising revenue - as you seek to capitalize on this scandal rather than quash it,' the letter said, according to Page Six. The blogger has also threatened to target Emma Watson - and created a website called Emma You Are Next - after she gave a feminist talk at the UN, but weeks later the images have yet to be released and the threats have ceased. 4chan has been quick to remove the boards where naked pictures have appeared in the past. Targeted: Kim Kardashian was also among one of the previous hacks, which has been a major blow to Apple . Threats: A website was set up titled Emma You Are Next but the images of Emma Watson never surfaced . Last month, during a previous leak of stolen, naked pictures, Twitter said it was shutting down accounts disseminating the images. Despite stringent rules against abusive and explicit content, the firm has struggled to control the wave of cached images shared by thousands of users. In response to a request for comment, a Twitter spokesman said in August: 'We do not comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons,' and referred MailOnline to the company's content boundaries web page. MailOnline was also awaiting a comment from Facebook - although the naked pictures did not appear to be on the site. In their online help guide, Facebook suggests that if users come across a harmful photograph to click on the image and select the 'report photo' tool. An online legal expert previously told the OCRegister that despite celebrities' legal complaints, it was really a game of 'whack-a-mole' as it was near impossible to completely scrub the private pictures from the Internet.","Nick Hogan, reality star and son of wrestler Hulk, is first male victim .

"Dr. Ben Carson drew shouts of 'Run, Ben, Run!' Friday night with a double-barreled attack on the Barack Obama presidency that included slams on his foreign policy decisions. The retired pediatric neurosurgeon, who has attracted a cult-like Republican following – and a presidential 'draft' committee with better fundraising numbers than the 'Ready For Hillary' PAC, that the United States needn't 'stick our nose into everybody's . business, but we do need to lead.' 'We are the pinnacle nation of the . world,' he told a crowd of thousands at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado. 'There's a responsibility that comes with that, and right now the . world is like a third-grade class with no teacher in it. And it's going . like crazy, okay?' Dr. Ben Carson is being prodded to run for president by a PAC that has outraised the 'Ready for Hillary' group that's advocating for Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . Carson said his observations were mostly reflective of the Obama administration's failure to understand Middle Eastern history and intervene on the side of groups and nations that held promise to become American allies. Like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he may or may not be running for the White House in 2016. But he acknowledged the growing chorus of fans who want him to take the plunge. 'There are a lot of people who come up to me and say, ""Doctor, you've gotta run. You've gotta save us"",' he said quietly. 'There are a lot of people who do that.' Carson also knows how leverage his quiet charisma to appeal to red-meat conservatives. 'Our country is in critical condition right now,' the doctor said. 'And if don't do something about it in the relatively near future. It's going to be over.' If Democratic presidents can appoint three more liberal Supreme Court justices, Carson warned, it 'is the end of the United States as we know it.' He raised eyebrows with prescriptions to combat illegal immigration that included the use of unmanned aircraft to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. Under Obama's leadership, he said, 'we don't have the will to secure the border. We have what we need to do that. We have 10,000 drones. You know, we have all kinds of technological things.' Crowd favorites: Live-action painter David Garibaldi splashed his way to a canvas of Dr. Ben Carson in front of a crowd of 3,000 Saturday night, a day after Carson spoke at the same event . He also hinted that entitlements and the promise of free education and other social programs are a electromagnet for border-crossings that should be switched off. 'We have to reduce the incentive for people to want to come here,' he said. 'I guarantee you that if you remove all the goodies, people will find a way to get out of here just as they found a way to get in.' And employers who hire illegal immigrants, Carson told his partisan audience, should be prosecuted criminally upon a second offense. Conceding that immigrant workers often perform jobs that 'Americans sometimes don't want to do,' he said a solution would involve an expanded guest worker program for which applications would only be accepted if they came from outside the United States. 'There's no way that we can put people in line to become American citizens and enjoy the benefits of America who have broken the law,' he said, 'and put them in front of people who have not broken the law. That doesn't make any sense.' The 'Draft Ben Carson' committee, a group laying the groundwork for a Carson candidacy, reported last week that it raised $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. That amount eclipses the more media-savvy 'Ready for Hillary' campaign, which raised $2.5 million in seed money for a Hillary Clinton run. The Carson PAC's under-the-radar approach, attracting thousands of small-dollar donations, lines up with Carson's own quiet approach. Carson was the biggest draw and Friday night's final speaker at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver . In order to combat what he called a federal government that's 'just too big,' Carson steered clear of calling for the aggressive, slashing elimination of entire cabinet agencies. Instead,he said, federal bureaucracies can be brought to heel passively, through attrition, by a four-year freeze on hiring employees to replace government workers when they retire. After four years – coincidentally the length of a presidential term – 'the government will be down to a lean, mean size,' he said. 'They will only have enough personnel to do what they're supposed to do, and they'll keep their big noses out of everybody's business.' He did propose adding a new government department, 'a covert agency,' tasked with monitoring government workers and programs. 'And people who were irresponsible, lazy and unresponsive would find themselves with no job. That's the way it ought to be done.' And overgrown government, he said, feeds off of 'absurd taxation policies' that amount to 'government's boot on the neck of business and industry.' 'People go into business to make money,' Carson said, 'not to support the government.' 'We've gotta get the White House, and we can turn this thing right around.'","Retired pediatric neurosurgeon said the US is 'the pinnacle nation of the world; there's a responsibility that comes with that'

"Bike thefts have been slashed at Newcastle University simply by putting pictures of staring eyes above cycle racks. The two-year experiment was carried out by a security manager at the campus who had seen similar studies suggest that people behave better when they feel they are being watched. Academics found that bike racks which had eyes placed above them experienced 62 per cent fewer thefts than the previous year, while those without eyes saw thefts increase by 63 per cent. Watching you: Bike thefts have been significantly reduced simply by putting pictures of staring eyes above cycle racks, researchers said today . Eyes: The two-year experiment at Newcastle University was mooted by a security manager at the campus who had seen similar studies suggest that people behave better when they feel they are being watched . The crime-fighting idea is now being trialled by British Transport Police (BTP), with train company C2C, on a route between London's Fenchurch Street station and Southend in Essex. Professor Melissa Bateson and Professor Daniel Nettle, of the Centre for Behaviour and Evolution, and Ken Nott, of Newcastle University's security team, talk about their findings in the journal PLoS ONE. For the first year the team monitored the level of bike thefts from all racks across campus for a control figure. Crime fighting: Ken Nott, one of Newcastle University's security team with the signs that the University have put up around their campus . They then placed the eye signs in three locations, leaving the rest of the racks without signs. They monitored all the sites for a year to measure the impact on the level of crime, and noticed a major drop for racks with eyes but an increase at those without. A 2006 study found that staring eyes made people pay almost three times as much into a tea-room honesty box. And research in 2010 showed that people using a canteen were more likely to clear away their tray after a meal when there were eyes watching them. Lead author of the paper Prof Nettle said: 'We don't know exactly what is happening here but this just adds to the growing evidence that images of eyes can have a big impact on behaviour. 'We think that the presence of eye images can encourage co-operative behaviour. One strong possibility is that the images of eyes work by making people feel watched. 'We care what other people think about us, and as a result we behave better when we feel we are being observed.' Mr Nott, who is deputy team leader for security in the estates security service at Newcastle University, said: 'Anything we can do to reduce the level of theft on the campus is very welcome. 'I had followed previous work done by this team and thought it might be able to make a difference to levels of crime, so I decided to suggest this experiment. 'The results were clear and we have now put these pictures up across all the bike racks on the campus.' Barry Sharp, from BTP's London North Area Crime Team, said: 'Research shows that this sign has had some promising results at Newcastle University, and we are always looking at new ways to tackle cycle theft at rail stations. 'As well as signs at stations and increased patrols at hot-spot locations, we aim to crack down on cycle thieves across Essex.'","Two-year experiment was carried out at Newcastle University .

"Jake Newsome - who posted disgusting messages on Facebook after the death of Ann Maguire - has been jailed for six weeks . A Facebook troll who posted sickening messages about the classroom killing of teacher Ann Maguire has been jailed for six weeks. Jake Newsome, 21, wrote that a 15-year-old boy accused of murdering the school teacher  Maguire should have 'p***** on her too'. He took to the social networking site three days after Mrs Maguire died was stabbed at Corpus Christi college in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on April 28. He later admitted posting the messages to police, claiming he empathised with the 15-year-old charged with her murder because he identified with him. Prosecutor Sandra White told Leeds Magistrates Court today: 'This message was posted to the Facebook social network on May 1 from Mr Newsome's phone. 'He wrote: ""Personally, I'm glad that teacher got stabbed up. Feel sorry for the kid, he should've p***** on her too"". 'Four minutes later a comment was posted saying,""That's not very nice"", to which the defendant replied, ""I think it is"".' Angry web users later began posting comments in response and Newsome was arrested. He told police he 'didn't think [the messages] were offensive', the court heard. Ann Glen, for Newsome, said her client had no previous convictions and he understood he would 'reap the consequences, realising that he had offended members of the public'. At a previous hearing she told the court: 'He felt that there were some similarities as to what people were saying about the young man and the background that this defendant has.' Pupils and staff were devastated when Mrs Maguire was killed at Corpus Christi College, Leeds, in April . After Newsome admitted sending an offensive message at a previous hearing he was sentenced by District Judge David Kitson today. The judge said: 'You sent an offensive communication by an electronic device that followed the tragic death of Mrs Maguire who was killed some days previously. 'You're entitled to express reasonable views, as are all of us. What none of us are entitled to do is abuse that freedom. Friends of much-loved Mrs Maguire were left stunned by the sickening messages Newsome left on Facebook . 'What I find particularly offensive - that must have caused distress to all those who knew Mrs Maguire - were the derogatory remarks made saying that you were glad she had been killed and that he should have, and I quote, ""p***** on her too"". 'I can think of little more that can be upsetting or offensive.' Judge Kitson added: 'You clearly came from a troubled background. But this is so serious that nothing more than custodial sentence can suffice.' Newsome, wearing a dark hoodie and blue jeans, looked shocked at the decision and some of his friends sobbed in the public gallery as he was led away. Mrs Maguire, 61, died after she was attacked as she taught a Spanish lesson. The 15-year-old boy has appeared in court accused of murdering Mrs Maguire. He is remanded in custody and is due to go on trial later this year.

"Career in tatters: Jonathan Burrows has resigned from his job with asset managers BlackRock . A high flying city executive who dodged rail fares for five years has been branded as 'greedy' and 'selfish' after his identity was revealed. Jonathan Burrows has been unmasked as the mystery fare dodger of East Sussex who hit the news after settling a £43,000 bill for unpaid tickets over five years. The 44-year-old investment executive is thought to be the biggest fare dodger in history - avoiding the £21.50-a-day fee, despite owning two mansions worth £4million. He had hoped to avoid prosecution and publicity by reimbursing Southeastern trains just three days after being caught by a ticket inspector last November. Law-abiding commuters were outraged when the story broke in April that the rail firm had allowed him to quietly settle the allegations without being prosecuted. Now they have condemned his actions further. Lee Harris from London said: 'Apart from losing his job and getting the publicity that he so badly wanted to avoid, it is the selfish attitude of people like him that makes me sick. 'Did he think that all his honest fellow travelers were mugs? I bet he wishes he could turn the clock back now.' Stephen Kandy, also from London, said: I just don't understand how this man got away with it for so long. 'I know the Hastings/Cannon Street train well - Stonegate is one of the stops on the way - and the ticket inspectors are always on the train, and check tickets after every stop.' Richard Barclay added: 'The guy has the good fortune to earn a spectacular amount of money and he still doesn't want to pay for his rail ticket like everyone else.' Another said: 'Earns over one million a year and scams the transport system of a few thousand a year. Beggars belief how tight people can be. He is said to have told Southeastern he wanted his name kept secret because of the impact the scandal could have on his job.' But the Mail can reveal that his career is in tatters after British Transport Police read the story in the Press and began investigating. The news also came to the attention of City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, with which  Burrows was registered. It started its own probe over concerns that his actions showed a lack of probity that could make him unsuitable for City work. But it wasn’t until last week that he warned bosses at asset management firm BlackRock – who knew nothing of his fare-dodging shame – that they might be getting a call from the regulator. The married father of one was suspended from his job as a managing director and when BlackRock pressed him on the nature of the investigation he quit. Although his resignation brought the FCA probe to an end, the scandal means he is unlikely to be able to work in finance again. A City source told the Mail: ‘Burrows was a very senior fund manager with BlackRock, dealing with hundreds of millions of pounds on a daily basis. But only last week he suddenly told his bosses, “The FCA might give you a call”. ‘He only let slip in passing that it was about this £40,000 fare-dodging payment. They suspended him immediately, but he refused to explain anything at all about the fare-dodging – and when more questions were asked he resigned without a payoff. ‘I’m amazed the FCA aren’t continuing their investigations even though he’s no longer registered with them. If they did, and found he has dodged rail fares for five years, I’d expect him to be barred from the industry for life. Even as it is I doubt he’ll ever be able to work in the industry again. ‘He won’t get much sympathy, but he has lost his livelihood.’ Scroll down for video . Barred for life? One City source told the Mail that Burrows could struggle to find work again . Dodge: Burrows managed to commute from Stonegate to central London for just £7.20 a day because his home station had no barriers . Porsche-driving Burrows owns two huge, mortgage-free mansions in the East Sussex countryside – a £1million house near Wadhurst and his impressive home near the village of Stonegate, which he bought for £2.725million in 2011. He shares the Victorian property – which boasts acres of landscaped grounds, ponds and a tennis court – with his wife Louise and their young child in an isolated spot not far from Stonegate station. Last night a Range Rover and a £30,000 Land Rover Freelander could be seen at the property. His commuting scam was uncovered last year when a ticket inspector at London’s Cannon Street station, close to Burrows’s office, saw him swiping through the ticket barriers with his pre-paid Oyster travel card. The inspector realised Burrows had been charged only £7.20 – the modest penalty imposed when a passenger has failed to swipe in at the start of a journey. Burrows admitted having failed to use his Oyster card to tap in for five journeys between London Bridge – where he got off his train from East Sussex – and Cannon Street, which should have cost him just £2.30 a time. However, further inquiries revealed that until 2008 Burrows had been buying an annual season ticket from Stonegate, which has no ticket barriers, to Cannon Street, which costs around £4,500 a year for standard class. A standard daily single fare is £21.50. Rural: Pictured is Stonegate station, from which Burrows dodged his fares for years . He had then stopped buying season tickets, but simply continued working in London, apparently only paying £7.20 for the brief final leg of his long train journey. Southeastern told Burrows he owed them £42,550 in unpaid fares, plus £450 in legal costs. Burrows paid up promptly, apparently hoping that would be the end of the affair and no one would find out what he had done. But in April the tale emerged, and British Transport Police contacted Southeastern and began a criminal investigation. Last night, BlackRock spokesman Jonathan Mullen said: ‘Jonathan Burrows has left BlackRock. ‘What he is alleged to have done is totally contrary to our values and principles.’ Asked about the case by the Mail, Burrows said: ‘Dunno what you’re talking about.’ British Transport Police and Southeastern said they were still investigating. An FCA spokesman said that when anyone applies for fresh authorisation, ‘past misconduct will be taken into consideration’, adding: ‘That doesn’t have to be a criminal record, it can be anything that calls into question someone’s fitness and propriety to work in the industry.’","Jonathan Burrows, 44, skipped train fare from Kent to London for five years .

"A British teenager has been left fighting for his life after he was stripped naked and 'stabbed 17 times' during an attack in a Turkish holiday resort. The British teenager, named as Dwaine . Ward, was found in a garden . in the Tepe district of Marmaris, a popular holiday haunt for . British tourists. Two men have now been arrested in connection with the incident. The 17-year-old was discovered on Tuesday with at least 10 stab wounds to the body and taken to the intensive care unit of the Marmaris State Hospital. He is reportedly in a critical condition. Suspect: Attila Dincer (blue T-shirt) is led away by police. He is being questioned in connection with the stabbing of  17-year-old Dwaine Ward in the Turkish resort town of Marmaris . Ismail A, 24, the second suspect being questioned. He was arrested on a bus in Konya, 354 miles from Marmaris . Attila Dincer, 26, who works cleaning . cars in the area near to where Dwaine was found, is now being questioned in . relation to the incident. He was arrested in the early hours of . Thursday morning and shortly after Ismail A, 24, from Aksaray, was . arrested on a bus in Konya, 354 miles away. Using information believed to have . come from Dincer, Turkish police in Mugla liased with other forces . across the country - tracking Ismail on a bus heading for his home town. Ismail was taken from the bus at Konya and is being transferred back to Marmaris to undergo questioning. Mr Ward's blood-stained, naked body was spotted and photographed lying in a garden at around 7.30am on Tuesday by local residents. They called the emergency services . and a doctor managed to stabilise the teenager at the scene before he . was rushed to intensive care. Two British men are believed to have died in separate drowning incidents in Turkey, while a teenager is fighting for his life after he was stabbed ten times . Marmaris police immediately launched a major investigation into the . alleged attack andall leave was cancelled as they desperately tried to track down the attackers. Within 48 hours police had checked 217 cameras covering the town's Bar Street and surrounding areas. Careful examination of the camera's showed Dwayne leaving Bar Street and then a few hundred yards further on two men were seen following him and taking hold of his arms. According . to police and hospital reports Dwaine had been stabbed more than a . dozen times including twice in the throat and several times in the . chest. It is said to have pierced his heart. It is said he had also been stabbed in the groin, legs and back and his arms had been slashed with a razor. People on Belcekiz beach called paramedics after noticing that a body, believed to be that of Anthony Gissing, was floating in the sea without moving . The attack took place after the young . man and his older brother, said to be 32, had been out drinking in the . town's Bar Street on Monday night. The brothers had reportedly become separated among the crowds and Darren had returned to their hotel alone. The . brothers are believed to be on holiday with their mother- staying at . the privately run Ali Baba Otel close to the town's busy market place. Speaking . from the Ali Baba Otel, yesterday morning his mother said: 'Dwaine's . facing another operation this morning. His dad's flying out from the UK . to be with him. 'I'm too distressed to talk about it.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed hospitalisation of the teenager. In a separate incident in Marmaris, a British teenager, named as Dwaine Ward, was left fighting for his life after being found naked in a garden in the Tepe district .

"A British gym has become the first in the world to harness the energy of its users to generate its own electricity. Bikes, cross trainers and 'vario' machines at Cadbury House in Congresbury, near Bristol will each feed around 100w per hour back into the building's power supply. The new treadmills will also use 30 per cent less electricity and generate enough energy to power their own information screens. A first: The Cadbury House gym in Congresbury, Somerset is the first in the world to harness the energy of its users to generate electricity . Power: The machines, which use 30 per cent less electricity than usual machines, store energy produced by users in a dynamo . The 42 pieces of equipment, called ARTIS and supplied by Technogym, cost £600,000 and are considered the most energy efficient in the world. Jason Eaton, general manager of the . club said: 'This is the very latest in health club technology in terms . of design, sustainability, connectivity and biomechanical excellence. 'On top of that we're reducing the level of energy needed to power the club which is great for the environment.' The technology works by using a dynamo or holding cell. Once the user has begun to exercise, the equipment will power up - generating electricity from the energy they are producing. Work out: The energy generated by users helps power the machine's screens, pictured . View: The machine's screen shows how much energy is being produced by the exerciser . As soon as the machines have generated enough power to operate, any surplus energy will be stored inside a holding cell, or dynamo, which is then fed back into the building's electricity supply. The treadmills use innovative brushless motor technology, combined with low friction materials, to reduce their energy consumption by 30 per cent. The state-of the-art equipment also allows users to connect to the machines using their smart phones. Users can log on via Quick Response (QR) codes of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and track their own training programme and records. Web bookmarks, apps and social networks are accessible from the machines and gym-goers can even use programmes such as Facebook or even Skype while exercising. Range: There are 42 pieces of ARTIS equipment in the gym, which cost £600,000 to install . Each cycling and running machines have a screen on the front, which can access the internet and various TV services, as well as provide access to training information and professionals. Users can also virtually compete against anyone else around on the Unity system. Outside workouts can also be linked to 'Unity' so users can keep track of bike rides, runs, hill walks or team sports allowing a complete overview of their physical activity. Mr Eaton added: 'The prevalence of smart phones has opened up the way people live their lives and by allowing them to manage their work out and training programme via this sort of technology is a great step forward.'","ARTIS machines at Cadbury House in Congresbury, near Bristol will each feed around 100w per hour back into the building's power supply .

"The Church of Scientology has launched a full-scale assault on a new HBO documentary about the controversial religious sect, specifically targeting its Oscar-winning director and claiming that his late father - an acclaimed journalist - published CIA propaganda. In more than 200 tweets, the church has tried to discredit Alex Gibney and his sources in 'Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief', which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. It has also issued a statement on the website of Freedom Magazine, its news publication, claiming the documentary is 'propaganda', 'one-sided', full of 'false information' and features 'vengeful' sources. And a week before the premiere, it took out full-page ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times to smear the film, based on Lawrence Wright's 2013 award-winning book of the same name. Now, in perhaps its most rigorous attempt to smear Gibney and his production, the church has released a video online, in which it discusses  the director's 'lies' and attempts to discredit his father. Scroll down for video . Claims: The Church of Scientology has launched a full-scale assault on Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney (left) and his documentary, 'Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief'. In a newly-released video, the church claims Gibney's late father - acclaimed journalist, Frank Gibney (right) - published CIA propaganda . Angry: The church (file picture) has desperately tried to discredit  Gibney and his sources in the film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, last month. It claims the production is 'one-sided' Accusations: In its video (pictured: a still from the footage), posted on YouTube, the church claims Frank Gibney 'was part of a covert CIA operation to release propaganda through book publishing and the media' In the video, posted on YouTube on Thursday, it claims Frank Gibney,  who died aged 81 in 2006, 'was part of a covert CIA operation to release propaganda through book publishing and the media.' 'Apparently the apple doesn't fall far from the tree,' a female narrator intones, dryly, over images of the journalist, who was influential in post-World War II America as an interpreter of Japan and its culture. In its argument, the church refers to a December 1977 New York Times story, which reported that Frank Gibney - an author and foreign correspondent who worked for the Chicago Daily News, Time, Newsweek and Life magazine - admitted that one of his books was written directly from CIA memos. The book, The Penkovsky Paper, was about a Soviet spy who was executed in Russia after cooperating with the CIA. It was claimed at the time to be excerpted from Penkovsky's diary. However, a Senate Intelligence Committee report found that the book had been 'published by the CIA' through Double Day, the Times reported. The female narrator claims that director Gibney is similar to his late father in his distribution of 'textbook propaganda', which she says shows 'precious little legitimate investigation and fact-based reporting'. Working together: 'Apparently the apple doesn't fall far from the tree,' a female narrator intones, dryly, referring to alleged 'propagandist' similarities between Aelx Gibney (left) and his father. Gibney's documentary is based on Lawrence Wright's *right) 2013 award-winning book of the same name . 'Staged': The church accuses Gibney of using a 'fake' scene of ants crawling up a wall (pictured) to depict a church facility that former church member Marty Rathbun described in the film as a 'prison camp' Director: On its Freedom Magazine website, the institution adds author Wright and Gibney (pictured) 'cherry-picked expelled, discredited former Scientologists who would help them advance their propaganda' She adds that during the two years that Gibney was producing the film, which makes allegations about the church and blames high-profile members Tom Cruise and John Travolta for not exposing alleged abuses, he failed to contact the church - and ignored 14 requests to meet with members. In his documentary, Gibney interviews former members of the sect, and raises questions about the treatment of Scientology members and the organization's nonprofit, tax-exempt status. One ex-member says of  the church in the film: 'You take on a matrix of thought that's not your own.' Other sources recount Cruise's marriage to fellow A-lister Nicole Kidman in detail in the film. A former top church official claims that Cruise distanced himself from Scientology while married to Kidman, and alleges the church told him to 'facilitate the breakup' of the couple. However, in its video, the church attempts to discredit Gibney's sources, specifically citing 'expelled' member, Marty Rathbun, who it claims now has 'deep-seated anger issues'. On its Freedom Magazine website, the institution adds author Wright and Gibney 'cherry-picked expelled, discredited former Scientologists who would help them advance their propaganda'. It also accuses Gibney of using a 'fake' scene of ants crawling up a wall to depict a church facility that Rathbun described in the film as a 'prison camp' - a 'buzz word' it claims was deliberately used. Facility: In a bid to discredit the allegedly 'staged' ants scene, the church broadcasts an array of images of its California facility (pictured) in its video, including a 500-acre 'audio production facility' and a sound stage 'more than three stories tall and large enough to accommodate four professional basketball courts' Homes: 'Yes this is the spot that Gibney portrays with ants crawling up a wall,' the narrator comments, before describing the homes (pictured) that the church's staff members live in, and their 'state-of-the-art' facilities . In a bid to discredit the allegedly 'staged' ants scene, the church broadcasts an array of images of its California facility in its video, including a 500-acre 'audio production facility' and a sound stage 'more than three stories tall and large enough to accommodate four professional basketball courts'. 'Yes this is the spot that Gibney portrays with ants crawling up a wall,' the narrator comments, before describing the homes that the church's staff members live in, and their 'state-of-the-art' facilities. These include a laundry room, a dining room, a communal pool and barbecue area, tennis courts, basketball courts, sand volleyball courts and a golf course, among other facilities, she said. 'Gibney couldn't have gotten it more wrong,' she concluded, describing it as a 'worker's paradise'. Author: Gibney said he had not been interested in the Church of Scientology before reading Wright's (above) book. The theme of the book Gibney says, explores 'how people become prisoners of faith in various ways' In comments to the New York Times last month, Gibney admitted the film includes a little dramatic reconstruction, some of which harks back to Scientology's early days and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. But it also features scenes that were licensed, filmed in the public domain or adhered to the conditions of fair use, he said, adding he had not been interested in the sect before reading Wright's book. He said he was immediately drawn to the book's underlying theme upon reading it. The theme, in Gibney's own words, explores 'how people become prisoners of faith in various ways'. The director added that he was confident of his documentary's solidity. 'Going Clear' was screened to a packed crowd in Park City, Utah, on January 25. It  attracted so many festival-goers that many were forced to stand outside in the cold. Gibney won an Academy Award in 2008 for best documentary feature for his film 'Taxi To the Dark Side.' He was also nominated in 2006 for 'Enron: the Smartest Guys in the Room.' He is also known for 2013's 'The Armstrong Lie,' about disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong.

"The strongest natural material ever known has been found... in the teeth of a tiny shellfish. Scientists, who made the discovery while examining limpets, say the substance could revolutionise industrial engineering. Researchers at the University of Portsmouth believe it is even stronger than the silk spiders use to make webs, until now thought weight for weight to be the world’s toughest biological material.

Shellfish teeth: Scientists at the University of Portsmouth, who made the discovery while examining limpets, say the substance could revolutionise industrial engineering . The scientists examined the teeth of limpets, which cling to rocks around Britain’s shores, and found fibres of a mineral in them, known as goethite, have evolved to form super-strong structures. This helps the shellfish dig into rocks to stop them being washed out to sea. Professor Asa Barber, who led the research, said: ‘Nature is a wonderful source of inspiration for structures that have excellent mechanical properties. ‘All the things we observe around us, such as trees, the shells of sea creatures and the limpet teeth studied in this work, have evolved to be effective at what they do. Up close: Researchers believe the substance is even stronger than the silk spiders use to make webs, until now thought weight for weight to be the world’s toughest biological material . ‘Until now we thought that spider silk was the strongest biological material because of its super-strength and potential applications in everything from bullet-proof vests to computer electronics, but now we have discovered that limpet teeth exhibit a strength that is potentially higher.’ The study, published today in the Royal Society journal Interface, suggests that the structure could be copied by engineers. Professor Barber added: ‘We discovered that the fibres of goethite are just the right size to make up a resilient composite structure. ‘This discovery means that the fibrous structures found in limpet teeth could be mimicked and used in high-performance engineering applications such as Formula 1 racing cars, the hulls of boats and aircraft structures.’","Researchers believe it's even stronger than silk spiders use to make webs .

"Short bursts of exercise lasting less than 10 minutes give you the same health benefits as slugging it out at the gym for hours. Researchers have found that even walking to the bus stop or cleaning your home can help you lose weight and lower your cholesterol. Activities like mowing the lawn and even fishing can also lower your risk of heart disease. Healthy: The Boston University study found that short bursts of exercise, including household tasks such as cleaning and mowing the grass, can be as healthy as more lengthy exercise . A Boston University study found that so long as the 10 minute bursts make up your daily quota of exercise, you will see the difference on your body. It concluded that ‘some exercise is better than nothing’ and that by adding up the small things you can have big impact. For the experiment the researchers attached a motion detector to to 2,109 men and woman with an average age of 47. More than half were overweight. The sensor - called an accelerometer - allowed them to monitor all their activity, rather than asking them to fill out a questionnaire in which they might not have listed everything they did. The results showed that compared to those who did not do enough exercise, everyone who did so weighed less, had lower BMI and lower cholesterol. Exercising had a stronger impact on cardiovascular risk factors in women than men, possibly because of physiological differences or unmeasured factors. But significantly, the benefits of short bursts of less than 10 minutes yielded the same benefits as those who worked out for longer. Examples of activities which counted included everything from cleaning the garage to badminton and golf. Similar: The study found that short bursts of activity yielded the same benefits as longer workouts . More strenuous activities like hiking, jogging, shovelling counted too. The researchers said the findings may work as an encouragement to those who do not have enough time to work out - or cannot muster the energy to do so after a long day. According to NHS guidelines, adults should get at least two hours and 30 minutes or moderate intensity exercise a week, such as fast walking, or 75 minutes of high intensity exercise such as swimming. The two may be mixed together if a person so chooses, so long as they hit the target. Lead Researcher Professor Nicole Glazer of Boston University School of Medicine, said: ‘I think it’s really important finding - because of the high levels of sedentary behaviour it is crucial to get people to be more active. ‘Going to the gym is not the only thing you can do and things like taking the stairs and walking for the bus do add up. ‘It’s important to exercise even if you do not have time to do so, and you can fit it into your day’.","Short bursts of exercise carry same health benefits, according to scientists at Boston University .

"The Duchess of Cornwall's brother left nothing from his £900,000 estate to his ‘secret’ girlfriend after he died without writing a will, it has been revealed. Mark Shand died unexpectedly in April aged 62 after falling and hitting his head on a pavement in New York. But as he had no will, the sole beneficiary was his daughter Ayesha, 19, from his former marriage to French actress Clio Goldsmith, the niece of billionaire Sir James Goldsmith. Mark Shand (left) died unexpectedly in April aged 62 before writing a will, meaning that none of his £900,000 estate will go to his on-off girlfriend Ruth Powys (right) All of Shand's estate will go to his daughter Ayesha, 19, who is pictured together with him in 2010 . Inheritance laws mean that nothing was inherited by Ruth Powys, 36, who became his on-off girlfriend after his divorce in 2009. Miss Powys, the CEO of Shand's charity Elephant Family, stated after his death that they were no longer in a relationship, but were still 'full of love for each other'. Some commentators claimed that the couple had been 'unofficially engaged'. Shand had his fatal fall while in New York to host a Sotheby's auction of egg sculptures decorated by leading artists in aid of his charity and underprivileged children. The Duchess of Cornwall described her brother as 'charismatic with a devil-may-care attitude to life' Mr Shand married charismatic actress Cleo Goldsmith (left), the niece of James Goldsmith. They had a daughter together, Ayesha (right) The event, attended by Princess Eugenie, raised nearly £1million, and was followed by an after-party at the exclusive Diamond Horseshoe club off Times Square. He reportedly stepped out for a cigarette after leaving the Rose Bar of the Gramercy Park Hotel, tripped and fell backwards as he tried to re-enter through a revolving door. The conservationist was taken to the nearby Bellevue Hospital and put on a life support machine, but died from his head injuries around nine hours later. Miss Powys, an advocate for human rights, revealed that she was at his hospital bedside and had her 'hand on his heart'. In a moving interview after his death, she added: 'Mark was my everything, my inspiration in life, he gave me everything I have, he's everywhere I look. 'We had been together off and on for many years after Mark was divorced, we were not together at this moment. 'I had moved to New York to try and separate myself from him, but we had the deepest love, we were full of love for each other. The former playboy and devoted conservationist pictured with his father Major Bruce Shand (left) He worked alongside Ms Powys, who was CEO of his  charity Elephant Family, for around 10 years . 'Our relationship was low key, we had a shared passion for elephants, we had the same spirit. We were trying to separate, it was such a difficult thing to do - to try and move on, he wanted me to find someone my own age.' Six weeks before his death, he dismissed reports linking him to Strictly Come Dancing star Nancy Dell'Olio, the former girlfriend of ex-England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson. He admitted knowing Nancy through his charity work, but said he would be 'more likely to have an affair with a ripe pomegranate'. Records released last week reveal that the former playboy left £1,579,227 reduced after liabilities to a net estate of £926,543. Camilla who was extremely close to her only brother, has hinted at his careless attitude to personal finance . Camilla, 67, who was extremely close to her only brother, hinted at his careless attitude to personal finance in a tribute to him before his memorial service last month. She described him as 'my charismatic and sometimes infuriating brother' and 'a golden boy, blessed with good looks, charm and a devil-may-care attitude to life'. Shand was a regular at the famously decadent New York nightclub Studio 54 and dated a string of beautiful women including President John Kennedy's daughter Caroline, Bianca Jagger and supermodel Marie Helvin. He bought a neglected elephant called Tara in India in 1988 and rode her 800 miles from the Bay of Bengal to Patna on the Ganges. His subsequent book Travels on My Elephant became a best seller.","Mark Shand died unexpectedly in April aged 62 before writing a will .

"A soldier who survived the Battle of Rorke’s Drift against 4,000 Zulus only to be forgotten on its Roll of Honour has finally been hailed a war hero – thanks to a 130-year-old sketch. Private David Jenkins was among the 150 soldiers who fought in the heroic defence of the small South African missionary outpost in 1879, which was immortalised by the film Zulu starring Michael Caine. Such was the bravery shown by the heavily outnumbered troops that after the battle 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded. Hero: Geoff Rees, great grandson of Private David Jenkins, recognised him in this sketch by Lady Elizabeth Butler. He had fought valiantly in the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift in 1879 . However, Private Jenkins’s name was somehow left out of the Roll of Honour, and for more than 130 years his descendants have tried in vain to have his heroism recognised. But they had no proof – until spotting a sketch of a ‘Private Jenkins’ by a Victorian war artist that was being used to illustrate a competition run by the National Army Museum. The Battle of Rorke’s Drift had been nominated as one of Britain’s greatest battles, and the image chosen to represent it was a pencil sketch by Lady Elizabeth Butler of Private Jenkins. Private David Jenkins' family was determined he should be recognised as one of the soldiers who took part in the historic battle . His great-grandson Geoff Rees  recognised the face instantly and was able to prove to historians that his relative was a long-forgotten war hero. The artist had been commissioned by Queen Victoria to commemorate the battle in her painting The Defence of Rorke’s Drift. Mr Rees said: ‘Lady Elizabeth Butler visited the survivors who returned to Portsmouth in the autumn of 1879 and she was treated to a re-enactment of the battle. ‘She famously used real models who were actually there to paint her war scenes.’ Each soldier who survived the battle had also been given a Bible to commemorate their role. Private Jenkins’s Bible was handed over to the museum’s historians as added proof that he had fought at Rorke’s Drift. Private David Jenkins of 1st Battalion, 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot, has now been reinstated in the battle’s Roll of Honour. A spokesman for the National Army Museum said: ‘When his great-grandson contacted us with irrefutable evidence proving David Jenkins’s presence at the battle and his identity in the museum’s sketch book, we set the record straight.’ Pt Jenkins appears in the bottom left hand side of this picture painted by Lady Elizabeth Butler, titled The Defence of Rorke's Drift . Geoff Rees, Pvt Jenkins' great grandson, said that another Jenkins was at Rorke's Drift but the sketch could not be him because he was killed in battle . Mr Rees, 52, from Swansea, said he was incredibly proud of his great-grandfather’s part in history. He added: ‘It’s nice that the history books have finally been corrected to recognise his role. ‘What I find most inspiring about the battle is that it was won by ordinary men who fought so heroically for one another. 'How exposed must they have felt, yet they defended the outpost to a man over a nightmarish 12-hour period.’","David Jenkins' name was left off Roll of Honour of soldiers who defended tiny outpost .

"Commuters will spend an average 10,634 hours travelling to and from work, research reveals . It may sometimes feel like even longer, but British commuters really do spend more than a year of their lives travelling to work - at a total cost of more than £50,000, new research reveals today (Monday). In London the average is actually even higher - at 18 months and a cost of more than £66,000. The figures are revealed in new research from investment management firm Nutmeg. It calculates that over a lifetime, commuters will spend an average 10,634 hours travelling to and from work. That adds up to 443 days, or nearly a year and three months. It's even longer for those travelling to or in London for work who will spend 18 months (or 13,097 hours) on the move, compared to ten and a half months (7,532 hours) for those travelling for work in Liverpool. London commuters spend most time on the move - enduring an hour and 14 minutes travelling each day on average. They are followed by Manchester (1 hour 4 minutes), Bristol (1 hour), Sheffield (59 minutes), Birmingham (56 minutes), Glasgow and Edinburgh (both 52 minutes), and Cardiff (50 minutes). Those commuting in Leeds and Liverpool experience the shortest commute at just 42 minutes. On average, London workers spend £118 a month travelling to work each month, followed by those in Manchester (£78), and Bristol (£74). Those who travel to work in Glasgow pay the least at £63 a month, just ahead of Birmingham and Cardiff (£64). The Nutmeg report notes: 'Without taking into consideration inflation on train tickets and petrol, over a working lifetime commuters travelling to a major city for work will spend on average £50,000. 'London workers expected to spend the most at almost £66,407. Those travelling in Glasgow city for work experienced the cheapest commute at £35,500.' 'London commuters pay an 88per cent travel premium', it noted. When questioned on their 'biggest bugbears', the cost of commuting tied with traffic jams at the top of the poll, with a third (32per cent) saying these were their biggest annoyances. They were followed by delays (30 per cent), dangerous or bad drivers (27 per cent), journey lengths (17 per cent), overcrowding (17 per cent), other people's personal music (13 per cent), poor commuter etiquette such as hogging two seats (12 per cent) and cyclists (11 per cent). Londoners spend most time travelling, with an average commute of one hour and 14 minutes a day . The report notes that a fifth who commute do so because it is too expensive to buy or rent closer to their workplace. And just over one in five (21per cent) believe they have a better standard of living away from work. Better schools and larger properties for the family was the main reason for not living closer to work for one in eight (12per cent) commuters. On affordability, more than half (51per cent) of Londoners deemed travel costs expensive. Those based in Birmingham were happiest with the cost of their commute, with only a quarter (25per cent) deeming it was expensive. Costs also proved to be too much for almost one in 12 (8per cent) who changed jobs or plan to following an increase in the cost of travel. One in seven (14per cent) have or plan to cut back on the amount put into savings and investments and just under one in 10 (9per cent) have changed or plan to change their route to and from work. It coincides with new research from used car website Motors.co.uk which says more than two thirds of drives (67per cent) would happily take a pay-cut and work locally in a bid to cut the cost of their commute. By contrast just over one in five Britons (22per cent) say they would be willing to commute for an hour or more to receive higher salaries, according to the research polled more than 2,000 adults in Great Britain. Nick Hungerford, chief executive at Nutmeg said: 'Travelling to work is one of the biggest costs of modern living, both in terms of actual expenditure and the time we spend journeying between the home and the office. 'While we may get more property for our money - and more fresh air - by living outside the city we work in, travel costs can quickly mount up and the daily commute can be soul-sapping. 'More than a fifth of people we surveyed admitted they wasted the time they spent travelling to and from work. With the total lifetime commute in London exceeding £65,000 and 10,000 hours, that's a substantial part of your life - and your life savings - that you'll want to make the most of.' Phill Jones, commercial director of Motors.co.uk said: 'The people of Britain have clearly reached the edge of their frustration with the amount of money they sacrifice each year on commuting costs. 'The British public is fed up with having to waste their hard earned cash on things like commuting costs and parking fines when in reality, they urgently need it to heat their homes, feed their families and enjoy a decent quality of life.' British motorists travel an average of 16.7 miles a day to get to work. But with an average car costing up to 50p per mile in fuel, Britain's drivers are predicted to pay as much as £3,048 a year on commuting costs, says the Motors.co.uk report.","Over a lifetime commuters spend average 10,634 hours travelling to work .

"It has been described as 'the poster child' for shoddy British manufacturing and ridiculed for its 'dreadful' handling - but the Austin Allegro has somehow escaped the label of 'worst car ever'. The vehicle came in at number ten on a list voted for by readers of motor magazine Auto Express - with the South Korean-made SsangYong Rodius taking the undesirable top spot. One critic likened its appearance to a 'melted hearse' and said: 'If it were human, not even its mother could love it.' Scroll down for video . Number one: The South Korean-made SsangYong Rodius was voted the worst car of all time . Number two: G-Wiz, pictured being test driven by David Cameron, came in at number two for being 'ugly as sin - a tiny, uncomfortable box' A Top Gear review of the car said: 'Designed by a Brit, the Rodius is a vehicle of such cosmic ineptitude that it must surely have been done via pre-Skype in the days of glitching dial-up modems by a team of visually impaired misanthropes. 'The only thing worse than looking at the Rodius is driving it.' Second on the list of embarrassing motors was the Reva G-Wiz electric car which was described as 'ugly as sin'. Cheap foreign imports have also earned strong places in the list of shambolic vehicles. Bronze medal went to 'ugly duckling' the Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet while fourth on the list was the Polish-made FSO Polonez. Number three: The Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet was slammed by one reader as 'a novelty car that was no fun at all' Number four: The Polish-made FSO Polonez came in at fourth on the list with reader saying it 'lacked any desirability at all' Number five: Rover's City Rover was 'poorly received from the off, with its build quality coming in for particular criticism' Coming in at five on the shameful list was the Rover City Rover which was heavily criticised after being released in 2003. Japan, known for its manufacturing prowess, will no doubt want to forget number six and seven on the list- the Mitsubishi Mirage and Suzuki X-90 - which one reader said had 'zero off-road ability'. Ranked number eight in the worst cars of all time was the Morris Marina, which one reader said had 'terrible handling and poor build quality'. Number nine, the Lada Riva, was also condemned by motor fans with one saying it was 'poor to drive, uncomfortable and basic in the extreme. And last but not least was the Austin Allegro, manufactured by British Leyland from 1973 until 1982. Jeremy Clarkson once candidly said: 'Deciding which one is worse (the Austin Allegro or Morris Marina), is like deciding which leg you'd rather have amputated.' The Allegro was named 'the worst British car ever made' in a 2008 poll by The Sun but Auto Express readers have been kinder to the 1970s model, putting it last in their list. Number six: The Mitsubishi Mirage, another Japanese flop, was said to be overpriced with poor handling . Number seven: The Suzuki X-90 is not a car Japan will be proud of, with readers saying it had 'awful handling' Number eight: The Morris Marina was condemned by Auto Express readers as 'an utterly awful car' Number nine: The Lada Riva, produced in the Eastern Bloc, was said to be 'uncomfortable and basic in the extreme' Number 10: The Austin Allegro was described as 'everything bad about British car manufacturing in the seventies' Below are the top ten worst cars as voted for by Auto Express readers with their comments: . 1) SsangYong Rodius: 'It's time these were taken away and destroyed.' 2) Reva G-Wiz electric car: 'Slow, not very safe and ugly as sin. A tiny, uncomfortable box.' 3) Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet: 'A real ugly duckling. A lack of refinement and driver enjoyment plus poor quality cabin. A novelty car that was no fun at all.' 4) FSO Polonez: 'Cheap, performed poorly and lacked any desirability at all.' 5) Rover City Rover: 'Poorly received from off, with build quality coming in for particular criticism.' 6) Mitsubishi Mirage: 'Poor handling and a very low-rent feel and it doesn't even have a super-cheap price to reflect that.' 7) Suzuki X-90: 'Who wanted a two-seater convertible mini-SUV? Nobody, especially when it had awful handling and zero off-road ability.' 8) Morris Marina: 'Terrible handling and poor build quality meant it was an utterly awful car,' said one reader. 9) Lada Riva: 'Poor to drive, uncomfortable and basic in the extreme. Virtually any car of the same age will trump this in any category.' 10) Austin Allegro: 'The poster child for everything bad about British car manufacturing in the seventies. Looked awful and handled dreadfully.'","Shameful 'worst ever cars' list voted by readers of magazine Auto Express .

"Those pleased with the success of their efforts to shave off the weight in January might want to look away now. Because all of their hard work could be undone by this 1ft tall burger, should they take on the challenge to eat it in just 20 minutes. But those who tackle it can shrug off some of the guilt - because the gigantic test is all for the sake of raising money for a cancer charity. Mounds of meat This is the monster burger challenge that gives you just 20 minutes to try and defeat the massive 2.25lbs burger . Measuring in at a foot tall and loaded with six burgers, six slices of bacon, six onion rings, cheese and salad, this is not one for the faint-hearted . The competitor will have just twenty minutes to plough through six 6oz beef burgers, topped with six rashers of bacon, six deep fried battered onion rings, six slices of cheese and six rings of fresh onion. All the fillings are nestled in a bun with relish, mustard and a hefty portion of spicy chilli beef. They will also have to tackle a portion of Cajun seasoned thick cut chips at the Redditch pub. But there is a healthy side to it - it also contains six mushrooms and six slices of tomato and lettuce. Meat lovers will have 20 minutes to demolish the mountain of food at The Duck Inn pub in Oakenshaw. Since the challenge was launched last month, 12 people have tried to tackle the burger but no one has managed to clear off their plate . Balancing burgers: Chef Scott Emes constructs the burger as customers test their stamina by trying to eat the entire thing . And if they succeed they will be rewarded with a t-shirt, certificate and their photograph will take pride of place on the pub's hall of fame. The owners, Ashley and Louise Gargan, came up with the idea to develop the Man VS Duck Burger challenge because their customers wanted to see bigger steaks and burgers on their menu. But Ashley said people who did not complete the challenge could take their leftovers home, so no food is wasted, The Daily Star reported. The challenge costs £19.50 and must be pre-ordered, with a percentage of the money going to Macmillan Cancer Support. Since the challenge was launched last month, 12 people have tried to tackle the burger but no one has managed to clear off their plate and claim their winning t- shirt. Perhaps competitors could take inspiration from American mother Molly Schuyler. The slender mother-of-four has managed to demolish a five-pound meat sandwich three times - a when Man Vs Food presenter Adam Rickman failed to swallow just one. Mrs Schuyler, 33, from Bellevue, Nebraska, had successfully completed the gut-busting challenge at Jethro's BBQ diner in Iowa, since Mr Rickman's failed attempt in 2010. The female competitive eater chowed down the grease-infused stack - featuring hunks of pork, chicken, bacon, brisket and deep fried cheese - in just seven minutes and 53 seconds.","Burgers, bacon, onion rings, cheese, chips and chilli part of the challenge .

Angel di Maria has claimed Real Madrid ordered him not to play in the World Cup final. Manchester United's new £60million British record signing has already blamed Real Madrid president Florentino Perez for his departure from the European champions, insisting that he originally had no intention to leave this summer. Di Maria was a doubt ahead of the World Cup final against Germany in July with a thigh injury, and he has revealed that the decision for him to miss out was made by Alejandro Sabella, Argentina's then coach, and not Madrid who had sent a letter advising him to sit it out. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria shine in Argetina's 4-2 win over Germany . Back in action: Angel di Maria has claimed Real Madrid sent him the letter on the day of the World Cup final .

'We were playing at 4pm and I was preparing myself to be in the best condition, knowing that I could have got injured. 'As soon as I got that letter, I ripped it up. I did not care, no matter what.' 'What I love the most is playing with Argentina,' said Di Maria. 'I received a letter at 11am from Real Madrid, on the day of the game while I was in physio, trying to be the best I could be for the final, telling me to not play in the World Cup final. I was thinking about playing in the final, although I knew that if I did there was a 90percent chance I’d re-injure myself. When I read it, I ripped up the letter. I suffered a lot that morning. That was the worst thing to ever happen in my life. I didn’t speak to anyone at the club about this. It doesn’t matter. In the end, it was Sabella who made the decision and it was for the best.' Talking to Argentine radio programme America y Closs, Di Maria added: 'I talked with Alejandro and it was his decision. I didn't want to pressure him. I knew I could have to come off after 15 minutes and leave the team, I didn't want that.'

Manchester bound: Di Maria revealed he 'never said I wanted to leave Madrid' and his fellow team-mates . ‘If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' Ronaldo said about Real's summer transfers. 'I have a very clear opinion but I can’t always say what I think.' CLICK HERE to read  what Ronaldo said! Di Maria and Madrid president Perez have been involved in a public row in recent weeks with the 67-year-old suggesting the player moved for the money. Perez, criticised for allowing the Argentine winger to leave, claimed that only Cristiano Ronaldo would have earned more at the Santiago Bernabeu had Di Maria signed a contract extension. Di Maria, who will trigger a bonus payment to Madrid should he win the Ballon d'Or with United, said: 'I saw what he said. To be able to earn what Cristiano earns I would have had to have been the best player at the World Cup or won the Ballon d'Or. It looks like he [Perez] gave that offer to another person. I don't have a clue who he offered that to. I don't have much of a relationship with him. When I signed a new deal he wasn't there either.

'I never said I wanted to leave Real Madrid, I never wanted that, but you have to move when they don't want you. Let them say what they want about me, the millions they received for selling me will help the Real Madrid economy very well.' Di Maria also confirmed reports that Ronaldo wanted him to stay and that the former Manchester United winger could yet lose patience with Perez himself. 'Cristiano was always on my side. I don't know how much he will put up with at Real Madrid.' Di Maria made his Manchester United debut in a goalless draw against Burnley before the international break and maintains that he will need time. 'I'm very happy but still I have to adapt,. I hope we can put Manchester United back where they deserve to be. I had got used to the style of play in Spain, now I have to adapt as soon as possible. 'I don't know how to speak English yet, they have given me a teacher. I call [Juan] Mata so he can help me. Like our Manchester United Facebook page. Waving goodbye: Perez has defended Real's transfer policy after their comings and goings were questioned . Insistent: Perez says Real offered Di Maria the chance to be the second-best paid player at the Spanish club . 'I hope we can put Manchester United back where they belong. I’m still used to the La Liga style of play and I need to adapt as soon as possible.' Di Maria's representative Eugenio Lopez says the winger would have stayed at Real Madrid for less money. Talking to Spanish radio station Cadena Cope, Lopez said: 'The idea was to wait and come to an agreement with Real Madrid in order for him to stay. He wanted to earn what they promised him and he would’ve stayed for much less than Manchester United is paying him. 'He signed until 2018, but he wanted to improve his deal. Which is normal. They brought in Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez. That was a sign that something was wrong. But they didn’t bring in James because Di Maria wanted to leave. They are very different players. 'Before the World Cup there was no offer from Real Madrid. He never asked for £6.3m per year and would’ve stayed for much less, even though there was a club who offered more. 'We started to negotiate, but Real Madrid didn’t budge. I’m speaking in reference of what Florentino Perez said. Ancelotti did everything he could to keep Di Maria. 'When they played Atletico Madrid in the Supercopa, the ovation from the crowd was tremendous.

"A Channel 4 documentary which explored the hidden world of dog fighting has received more than 4,000 complaints from viewers who were outraged by bloody scenes of alleged animal cruelty. Going to the Dogs, which aired last night, sought to expose the culture associated with the controversial sport, which animal charities and police warn is on the rise. But the programme came under heavy criticism today for glamourising the issue - with the RSPCA now calling for the broadcaster to hand over footage so it can investigate those taking part. Scroll down for video . Going to the Dogs: Dylan Duffus is shown talks to professional . dogfighters in the documentary film, which has received thousands of complaints . since it was aired on Channel 4 . After it was aired, Channel 4, which said 470,000 watched the programme, was inundated with complaints from viewers who were horrified by a real-life dog fight between two ferocious pit bull terriers. The channel received 2,000 complaints in less than 24 hours, as well as 600 complaints before the show was aired. In addition to this, another 1,000 complaints were sent to the broadcaster via an automatic template on protestors' websites. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom also said it had received more than 1,000 complaints over animal cruelty allegations. Now the RSPCA is calling for the broadcaster to hand over footage of the show so it can investigate those involved in the murky underworld of the sport. In a statement it said: 'Overall we believe that ‘Going to the Dogs’ was ill-conceived, irresponsible and has done to nothing to help animals, fought or farmed. 'The RSPCA will continue its work to investigate and uncover illegal dog fighting and we are calling on Channel 4 to hand over the footage and reveal the identities of the dog fighters so that we can fully investigate this cruelty.' The programme, which was produced by Latimer Films, saw filmmaker Dylan Duffus, a former gang member, interview those involved in dog fighting - something which in recent years has been described as a growing . problem in the UK's inner-city areas. But those who were interviewed had their identities concealed . for the cameras, as they spoke openly about their dogs, how they train . them for fights and how they deal with injured and dying animals. The programme looked into the hidden criminal world associated with dog . fighting but was accused of glamourising the controversial sport . Footage . was shown of a savage dog fight, battery farming, . the shooting of racehorses and of a game . shoot - all of which were slammed by animal rights activists. There were also interviews with those involved in pheasant shooting and sports such as horse racing, which avoid the kind of . hostility that dog fighting attracts. RSPCA criticised the show for comparing these different sports with dog fighting, saying it was a 'disingenuous red herring designed only to court controversy'. There was also outrage on Twitter during and after the show was aired. ‏@JeanHaines said: 'I couldn't watch ""Going to the Dogs"" and I'm angry that @Channel4 gave air time to an illegal practise, what next?' While ‏@emmafc74 wrote: 'PLEASE EMAIL CHANNEL 4. Abs.disgusting programme, turned off after 10 mins.Sickening.' 'We believe that ‘Going to the Dogs’ was ill-conceived, irresponsible and has done to nothing to help animals, fought or farmed' RSPCA . But Channel 4 defended its decision to broadcast the show, saying it was 'proud' to have shed light on an important issue. Yesterday, the channel refused to budge after an animal rights activist garnered nearly 22,000 supporters in a campaign to have the programme removed from the schedule. Adrian Newsome from Macclesfield took his campaign not to air the . show to Change.org and soon had thousands supporting him. The petition blurb read: 'We as dog lovers do not want to watch such programmes like this they are not showing it to stop dog fighting they are showing it to get ratings!' (sic) A spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'Channel 4 are proud of this authored film which sheds light on an underground activity believed to be on the increase. 'The film raises important issues about animal welfare and blood sports in general and highlights man’s conflicted relationship with dogs and other animals. The audience was made aware of the content in advance of TX.' The outcome of a dog fight is a source of pride between rival gangs and firearms and drugs are never far away. More . young men are apparently being attracted and while there are hot spots, . including South Wales, it's a growing national problem. The simple idea is for the two to maul each other until one is dead or incapacitated.

"A Chinese man has taken his desire for a quiet life to the extreme by living as a hermit in a cave for the past 20 years. Feng Mingshan, 54, has to climb a 50 metre vertical cliff to reach the entrance of his unusual home where he has even fashioned a front door and hung curtains. Feng moved out of Gaoba Town, in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, in 1993 because he did not want to be around other people. Hermit: Feng Mingshan has lived in the cave 50metres from the ground for the past 20 years . Home comforts: The 54-year-old has even installed a front door and hung curtains up in his unusual house . Isolated: Feng has chiselled handholds in the rock to help him get in and out of his remote house . Now he lives in virtual isolation and has eschewed almost every modern convenience - even clothes. Pictures show the hermit climbing nude in and out of cave carrying bundles of sticks. Feng's brother Feng Xueming said: 'My brother has a weird personality. He doesn't like to communicate with others.' Over the past 20 years he has worked at enlarging the interior of his cave and has also chiselled handholds on the rock outside to help him climb up the steep rocks. Local media reported that Feng originally found the cave when he was just a boy. 'It was a small cave when I found it, and I expanded it to its current size using a hammer', he was quoted by The Mirror as saying. Happy home: Feng told reporters he enlarged the cave himself and likes it because it is cool in the summer . Remote: The cave sits 50 metres above the ground and is inaccessible to most people . He added: 'I also cleared the path through the ravine. Summer is cool here and it's good.' Residents in nearby villages said he normally leaves the cave at night but can still make the steep ascent with ease. But while locals are impressed with his climbing and foraging skills, authorities want to put him into a nursing home. He was reportedly diagnosed with intermittent psychosis and did receive a brief course of treatment. Town mayor Xu Min was quoted by The Mirror as saying they are continuing to monitor Feng and will try to persuade him to live in a more conventional home.","Feng Mingshan, 54, moved to the isolated cave in northwest China in 1993 .

"Borussia Dortmund playmaker Nuri Sahin will be out for an estimated two months after undergoing knee surgery on Wednesday, the Bundesliga club said. The 25-year-old Turkey midfielder, who returned to Dortmund in 2013 following unsuccessful spells at Liverpool and Real Madrid, had inflamed tissue removed from his left knee. Sahin signed for Liverpool on loan in the summer of 2012 but failed to establish himself, making just 12 appearances and has since returned to Dortmund for a second spell at the Bundesliga club.

"Drinking, smoking or eating badly could put a baby's health at risk - years before it is conceived . Drinking, smoking or eating badly could put your baby’s health at risk - years before it is conceived. The latest research suggests that a wild lifestyle in your teens or 20s could come back to haunt you if you become a parent later. Scientists say there is now ‘overwhelming evidence’ that poor health can be recorded in a father’s sperm or a mother’s eggs. Obesity or other problems caused by lifestyle can then be passed on to the next generation - making a baby ‘pre-programmed’ for a life of poor health, researchers say. Leading Australian scientists, building on a decade of research into the way health can be passed between generations, said there is a clear message for prospective mothers and fathers: ‘Parenting starts before conception.’ Professor Sarah Robertson of the University of Adelaide said: ‘People used to think that lifestyle didn’t matter, because a child represented a new beginning, with a fresh start. ‘The reality is we can now say with great certainty that the child doesn’t quite start from scratch – they already carry over a legacy of factors from their parents’ experiences that can shape development in the foetus and after birth. ‘Depending on the situation, we can give our children a burden before they’ve even started life.’ The research, published in the journal Science, suggests that babies whose parents had poor lifestyles before conception were more likely to have health problems such as diabetes, heart issues and immune disorders. Professor Robertson said: ‘Many things we do in the lead up to conceiving is having an impact on the future development of the child – from the age of the parents, to poor diet, obesity, smoking and many other factors, all of which influence environmental signals transmitted into the embryo.’ The biggest impact for both men and women is caused by their behaviour in the final three months before conception, when sperm and eggs both undergo final developments. But lifestyle and events that take place many years before could also have a dramatic impact, the scientists think. Until recently, scientific thinking relied on the Darwinian evolutionary theory that a baby’s fate is set in stone many years before the child is conceived. The sequence of two parents’ DNA, itself set by their own parents, effectively predetermined every aspect of a baby’s nature and make-up, the old thinking held. But the latest research has led to a more . subtle understanding of genetics, which accepts that tiny changes are . made to an individual’s genes by smoking, diet and other environmental . factors that we come across in everyday life. Scientists say there is now 'overwhelming evidence' that poor health can be recorded in a father's sperm or a mother's eggs . Those ‘epigenetic’ changes can be passed on to the next generation via the egg or sperm. Scientists think the ability to pass those epigenetic factors to a baby lies in the evolutionary need to adapt to changing environment. It means, for example, that if a man or woman experience a period of famine, their genes are altered by the ‘memory’ of that hard time so their baby is able to cope with less food. But if that baby goes on to eat normal amounts, their body cannot cope with the abundance and they can develop metabolic diseases such as diabetes. Conversely, if a parent overeats in life, the baby adapts to expect lots of food. When they do not get it health problems are the result. Professor Robertson said it is not all bad news for would-be parents. ‘A few lifestyle changes by potential parents and improvements in the right direction, especially in the months leading up to conception, could have a lasting, positive benefit for the future of their child,’ she said.","Drinking, smoking or eating badly could put a baby’s health at risk .

"This cook has taken his love of bugs to the kitchen table, using insects to add crunch to his recipes. Channelling Heston Blumenthal’s argument that cooking with insects can be delicious and sustainable, David George Gordon has created an entire recipe book using creepy crawlies. The Eat-a-Bug Cookbook includes dishes such as curried termite stew, three bee salad and fried green tomato hornworms. Cuisine de creepy-crawly: David George Gordon has created an entire cookbook using insects after bugs became a staple part of his diet . Mr Gordon, 63, started cooking with bugs in 1997 after researching cockroaches for a book about the pest. During his research, Mr Gordon came across numerous articles about the benefits of including insects in food and medicine. Eight legged lunch: Deep-fried tarantula spider is one of Mr Gordon's recipes in the book which he said receives contrasting reviews . Bugged out: Fried green tomato hornworms (left) and three bee salad (right) also feature in the recipe book. Mr Gordon hopes that one day insects will be an accepted part of our normal diet . Inspired, the lecturer and author from Seattle, Washington decided to write a bug-orientated cookbook instead. Now bugs have become a staple part of his diet. He said: ‘People are either repulsed or intrigued - there's not a lot of middle ground. ‘They are usually impressed or at least relieved when they try my dishes. I've actually had people come back for seconds, thirds and in one case fifths for my crickets and orzo pasta dish. Ants in your plants: Mr Gordon was doing researching on cockroaches for a book when he discovered that insects were considered very nutritious and decided to create a recipe book instead (pictured is the pear salad with Chiangbai ants) Come back for more: Mr Gordon (left) says that many people are happy to try his dishes featured in the book (right) and some even come back for second and third helpings . ‘Insects contain large amounts of protein plus vitamins, minerals and amino acids - the so-called building blocks of life. Welcomes insects: Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has also predicted that in time insects will be found on sale in supermarkets . ‘Broadening our diets to include . things other than chicken, beef or pork would take the pressure off the . planet. When you compare bugs to how much it costs to raise a steer . you'd be shocked.’ Mr . Gordon reckons that one day eating insects will be as accepted as eating . other meats - especially if we continue the trend of overfishing the . world's oceans. He said: ‘It will be a while in countries like the US or UK though because we have such a negative view of insects to begin with. ‘But then again, we probably weren't very interested in eating raw fish a century ago. Now you can spend your entire paycheck at a sushi bar.’ Experimental celebrity chef Blumenthal also predicts that insects will one day be found on sale in our supermarket aisles. According to Yahoo! Lifestyle, he said: ‘As long as we can’t see where it comes from, we’ve got no problem eating a prawn. But what about a grasshopper or a cricket? Think about where they live – their conditions are going to be a lot cleaner than a prawn farm.’ On his television program, Blumenthal has cooked wood lice on toast and fried grasshoppers and crickets.","Bugs have been a staple in David George Gordon's diet since 1997 .

"Mitt Romney has condemned Barack Obama's 'angry and desperate Presidency' after Vice President Joe Biden told a largely African-American crowd that the Republicans were 'going to put y'all back in chains'. Vice President Biden made the race blunder while declaring Republicans wanted to 'unchain Wall Street'. But his comment sparked a furious reaction from Romney, who accused the Obama campaign of race-baiting and promoting politics of hate. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Tough talk: Mitt Romney had some unusually strong words for President Obama and his surrogates during a speech in Ohio on Tuesday after Vice President Biden made a race gaffe . Joe Biden drew the ire of the Mitt Romney camp after telling an audience that the Republican would put voters 'back in chains' with his Wall Street financial deregulation plans . Support: Hundreds of coal miners and their families wait to attend Romney's rally . 'Mr. President, take your campaign of . division and anger and hate back to Chicago,' Romney said at an Ohio . event, where hundreds of coal miners and their families had earlier stood in line to attend. 'His campaign and his surrogates have . made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the . Presidency.  Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia. And the White House sinks a little bit lower. 'His campaign has resorted to . diversions and distractions, to demagoguing and defaming others. This is . an old game in politics; what’s different this year is that the . president is taking things to a new low.' Biden . later clarified his comment, insisting he was merely using the same . phrases the Republicans had used - but admitting he said 'unchained' instead of 'unshackled'. His full statement is shown below. The Romney campaign got an energy . boost over the weekend when he announced his selection of Wisconsin . Congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate. Vice President Joe Biden made controversial . statements while in Danville. More than 50 percent of the Virginian . town's population is African American . Bringing it down: Romney criticized Obama, seen here at an event in Iowa, and his surrogates for 'sinking' the White House because of the tone of their discourse on the campaign trail . 'Attack dog'? Paul Ryan was selected as Romney's vice presidential nominee, a role that is typically thought of as the more aggressive of the two . Though the vice president is largely seen as the 'attack dog' in presidential campaigns, in a supposed effort to keep the top-of-the-ticket from appearing too negative, Tuesday night's speech by Romney shows that he is not afraid to throw some punches. The Obama campaign responded in kind, saying that it was not Biden or the president who were disrespecting the Office but Romney with his plethora of negative ads. 'Governor Romney's comments tonight seemed unhinged, and particularly strange coming at a time when he's pouring tens of millions of dollars into negative ads that are demonstrably false,' Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said in response to Romney's speech. Critiques of negative ads have gone both ways, however, as a PAC that supports Obama was widely panned after it released an ad where a retired steel worker blamed Romney's venture capital firm for firing him, prompting him to lose his health insurance, which the man then said caused his wife to die of cancer. 'Whether its accusing Mitt Romney of being a felon, having been responsible for a woman’s tragic death or now wanting to put people in chains, there’s no question that because of the president’s failed record he’s been reduced to a desperate campaign based on division and demonization,' Romney campaign spokesman Andrea Saul said, referencing the Priorities USA Action advertisement. The latest Real Clear Politics composite poll has Obama coming in at 47.6 per cent, leading by 3.7 to Romney’s 43.9 per cent. 'We don't have to imagine any more. The details are there. Here’s what Congressman Ryan said. He said, ""We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy."" 'The Speaker of the House said, used the word ""unshackled"" as well, referring to their proposals. The last time these guys unshackled the economy, to use their term, they put the middle class in shackles. That’s how we got where we are.'Nine million jobs lost. Wage stagnation. Sixteen trillion dollars in wealth you all lost in your home equity, in your 401Ks and your pension plans. You’re the ones that got nailed. All of America, except the very few.'And I’m told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville, Virginia, the Romney campaign put out a tweet. You know, tweets these days? Put out a tweet, went on the airwaves saying, ""Biden, he’s outrageous in saying that."" I think I said instead of ""unshackled"", ""unchained"". 'Outrageous to say that. That’s what we had. I’m using their own words. I got a message for them. If you want to know what's outrageous, it's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class America. That’s what’s outrageous.'

"When most people have their phone stolen, they get angry before moving on. But for Danielle Bruckman, she decided to get even. The woman, from San Francisco, has recreated a number of selfies taken by an eccentric moustachioed man who now has her misplaced phone. Ms Bruckman created this hilarious parody after she lost her phone last New Year's Eve but discovered that pictures taken with it were still being synced to her Cloud backup system. The mystery man has uploaded some 250 photographs, almost all of them selfies. In what has become perhaps an obsessive hobby, she has recreated the man’s 'killer moustache,' donning a fake moustache and chest hair, and replicating the poses and places for her ‘My Cloud Pal’ Tumblr page. Double take? Danielle Bruckman (right) started parodying selfies taken by a moustachioed man (left) after she lost her phone a year ago but still had access to the photographs through her Cloud backup system . Calling it ‘one woman’s journey . through another man’s selfies,’ she wrote: ‘On January 1, 2013 my phone . escaped me and somehow fell into the hands of a man with a killer . mustache. ‘Thanks to Apple and some kinks in the cloud, I receive all of his pictures in my photo stream. ‘Here are his selfies as re-enacted by yours truly.’ Mirrored muscles: She donned a fake moustache and chest hair, and replicated his poses in the hilarious parody which has gone viral .

My take on tan time: Ms Bruckman goes into great details to recreate the photos (note the woman standing just behind the subject's shoulder) Voyeuristic voyage: Along with the hilarious selfie replicas, Ms Bruckman urges people to send her their selfies, suggesting she might even parody them . She said: 'Props buddy. From the selfies we know he totally lost weight.' She has also created various selfie-replicas of Hollywood actor James Franco which include photoshopping herself into crowd scenes and wearing a light brown moustache.

The performance artist Marin Abramovic recently barred visitors to her current exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London from bringing in their devices in order for them to focus on the art she was creating. Many bands find themselves facing an array of cameraphones rather than meeting the eyes of the crowd, while members of the audience further back find themselves staring at the illuminated screens which are held aloft in front of them.

"Spider-Man may regularly swoop in to save Gwen Stacy from his foes, but this time he failed to catch the 'damsel in distress' during a stunt in Times Square ahead of New Year’s Eve celebrations. The superhero dropped Good Morning America reporter Sara Haines as she pretended to faint in his presence, expecting him to catch her. Instead she fell flat on her back and burst into laughter. The botched TV stunt comes as Times Square prepares to welcome one million revellers to watch the famous ball drop at midnight. Scroll down for video . Not-so-superhero: Spider-Man failed to catch Good Morning America reporter Sara Haines (right) as she pretended to faint (left) in a live TV stunt in Times Square for a New Year's Eve celebration story . Nearby, restaurant Applebee’s - the chain best known for two-for-$20 dinner specials – is charging $375 for a New Year’s Eve ticket despite not being able to guarantee ball drop views. The menu for the evening, billed as 'a night to remember,’ will begin at 8pm and end at midnight, at which time guests can 'make their way to the streets of Times Square'. Laugh it off: Despite falling flat on her back thanks to the bumbling superhero, Ms Haines laughed it off, even giving Spider-Man a hug . Applebee’s website states that a viewing of the ball drop is 'subject to NYPD approval.' Ultimately, the NYPD has control over whether or not to allow partiers spilling out of bars and restaurants to move along in order to allow space for people who showed up earlier in the day. Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, said: ‘Security is much more tightly controlled and there are so many people.’ Strike midnight: Workers test the famous ball that will drop at midnight in Times Square . Hope to have a ball: One million revellers are expected to squeeze into Times Square to see the ball drop at midnight, with people queuing in the wintry weather in a bid to get the best view . Patriotic party: Party-goers pose with a living Statue of Liberty as New Year's preparations get underway . Tickets for chain TGI Friday's party range from $225 for general admission which includes trays of chicken fingers and potato skins, to $1,095 for the 'Couples Champagne VIP Package'. For guests who do not mind skipping dinner, Cipriani's New Year's Eve party starts at $150 per person and includes 'premium top-shelf alcohol' and a prosecco toast at midnight - but no food. As revellers start to queue to get the best spot to see the ball drop at midnight, the NYPD have ramped up security, which has increased each year since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Time for 2014: A living Statue of Liberty stands in Times Square, where police are making sure security is tight, searching people for explosives and directing revellers into pens along Broadway and Seventh Avenue . Queue for a view: Just like New Year's Eve in Times Square in 2008 (pictured), people began arriving in Times Square several hours before the celebrations are due to begin in a bid to get the best view . A night to remember: As the clock struck midnight on January 1 2013 hundreds of thousands of party-goers were sprinkled with confetti . According to the New York Daily News, the Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins said: ‘Times Square would be the biggest potential place for any kind of terorist action, kind of like the Boston bombing.’ Revellers will be searched for explosives and other dangerous contraptions as they are directed to pens along Broadway, Seventh Avenue and uptown from 43rd Street to Central Park. Backpacks are prohibited and there are no trash cans on the streets. The roads will be closed to vehicles from 3pm today.

America is set to ring in a very chilly new year with meteorologists predicting bitterly cold weather around the country. Two weather systems are expected to merge and bring a major snowstorm to New England as early as Thursday. It will also bring chilly temperatures and possibly single-digit temperatures to New York City. For revelers in Times Square, temperatures are forecast to plunge through the 20s in New York City on New Year's Eve.

"Global sea levels have risen by 8 inches (20cm) since 1880 and scientists predict they could rise up to 3ft (98cm) by 2100. But despite the UN’s recent threats of war, famine and extreme weather, such a dramatically different world caused by sea level rise can be hard to imagine. To help picture the future, Martin Vargic, an amateur graphic designer from Slovakia, has created a map depicting the planet with sea levels around 260ft (79m) higher than they are today. Martin Vargic, an amateur graphic designer from Slovakia, has created this map to depict how the planet will look with sea levels around 260ft (79m) higher than they are today. Information panels outside the main map show 2013 population by country, 2100 population by country as well as countries with highest and lowest fertility rates . He imagines what Earth would look like if the ice sheets surrounding the North and South poles melted, releasing five million cubic miles of water into the world's oceans. Whilst at first glance it doesn't seem much different to a map of the world today, a closer looks shows huge unshaded areas swamped by water with today's existing coastlines depicted in dotted lines. A close up of Europe reveals how more than half of England would disappear, including towns such as London and Leicester. Amsterdam would also be submerged as would areas further inland such as Berlin in Germany. In the U.S., large parts of the east coast would be submerged including New York, Houston, Miami, New Orleans and Washington. The current coastlines are shown using a dotted line and the areas that will be submerged by water if the ice sheets surrounding the North and South poles melted are unshaded. This close up of Europe shows how more than half of England would disappear, including towns such as London and Leicester. Amsterdam would also be submerged as would areas further inland such as Berlin . In the U.S., large parts of the east coast would be submerged including New York, Houston, Miami, New Orleans and Washington. According to recent studies, there is enough ice in Earth's polar caps to cause a 250-300ft (80-100m) rise in sea level . In October, researchers at the University of Hawaii said that Earth is racing towards an apocalyptic future in which major cities such as New York and London could become uninhabitable. The first U.S. cities to feel the changes would be Honolulu and Phoenix, followed by San Diego and Orlando, in 2046. New York and Washington will get new climates around 2047, with Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and Dallas a bit later. By 2043, 147 cities — more than half of those studied — will have shifted to a hotter temperature regime that is beyond historical records. Meanwhile the Amazon would bursts its banks, becoming a sea and engulfing vast areas of Brazil, and a huge chunk of Australia would be swamped by the Artesian Sea and Murray Gulf. 'I worked on this map for about three months, gathering the data and rendering all the labels,' said Mr Vargic, speaking to MailOnline. 'It was entirely digitally hand-drawn, based on gathered topography data from Nasa. 'I was always interested in the future climate change and human influence on the global warming. I created these maps both to raise awareness about the global warming and also because nobody has yet done this on such a scale . ‘According to recent studies, there is enough ice in Earth’s polar caps to cause about 250-300ft (80–100m) rise of the sea level,’ he said on his website. ‘Result of such an event would be catastrophic to human civilisation and Earth’s biosphere.’ More than 75 per cent of the world’s population lives below 300ft (100m) above the sea level, including the vast majority of all large urban areas. As the warming gradually progresses, scientists predict that we will experience more and more extreme weather events. Hurricanes, typhoons and massive floods will occur more frequently and on a much more devastating scale. The world’s deserts will expand, engulfing areas as large as the entire continent of Australia, including Southern Europe, the Caribbean and entire southeast of Africa. ‘Although this scenario is extremely unlikely to happen within our lifetimes, the truth is, that climate is going to change sharply,’ claims Mr Vargic. ‘Unless we limit our CO2 emissions to bare minimum, Earth will be more than 4°C warmer in the year 2100 as it is now. As the warming gradually progresses, scientists predict that we will experience more and more extreme weather events.

A huge chunk of Australia would be swamped by the Artesian Sea and Murray Gulf. World's deserts will expand, engulfing areas as large as the entire continent of Australia, including Southern Europe, the Caribbean and entire southeast of Africa . ‘Such a rise in temperature would be destructive to environment and human civilisation as well.’ Scientists believe it could take around 5,000 years for temperatures to rise significantly enough to melt all the ice on the planet, but claim the planet is already seeing the beginnings of this. Over the past century, reports suggest the Earth's temperature has increased by around half a degree Celsius and, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this has already caused sea levels to rise by around 7 inches (18cm). The largest concentrations of ice on Earth are found in Greenland and Antarctica but it is also found on exposed areas, on mountain tops and in other regions. The East Antarctica ice sheet, for example, is so large it contains around 80 per cent of all the ice on the planet and its size has protected it previously during warmer periods in Earth’s history. Martin Vargic imagines what Earth would look like if the ice sheets surrounding the North and South poles - which contains five million cubic miles of frozen water - melted. Pictured here is the Antarctic without its polar ice . In Mr Vargic's depiction, the U.S. would shrink dramatically. A separate study found that if climate change continues, the first U.S. cities to feel extreme weather changes would be Honolulu and Phoenix, followed by San Diego and Orlando, in 2046 . This includes during the Eocene epoch - a period of increased global temperatures that lasted from 56 to 34 million years ago. During this period of time, little to no ice was present on Earth and there was little difference in temperature at the equator compared to the poles. Warming oceans are already melting the floating ice sheet in west Antarctica and since 1992, and the sheet has lost around 65 million metric tonnes of ice each year. In October, researchers at the University of Hawaii said that Earth is racing towards an apocalyptic future in which major cities such as New York and London could become uninhabitable. It added that the scenario is too late to reverse and mankind needs to prepare for a world where the coldest years will be warmer than what we remember as the hottest. With the climate change trend continuing, it argued that New York City will begin to experience dramatic, life altering temperatures by 2047, Los Angeles by 2048 and London by 2056. National Geographic recently created a series of maps similar to Mr Vargic¿s, demonstrating the catastrophic effect Earth¿s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas. If these ice sheets melted, the rest of the world would be affected. In Europe, pictured, cities including London and Venice would be lost underwater, as would the whole of the Netherlands and most of Denmark. It would also cause the Mediterranean to expand and swell the Black and Caspian Seas . The last time the Earth was ice-free was 34 million years ago during the Eocene epoch. If this happened again, the entire Atlantic seaboard in the U.S would vanish, wiping out Florida and the Gulf Coast. While the hills in San Francisco would become islands and San Diego would be lost forever . How Britain would look if the ice sheets melted. A large proportion of the country would be left underwater . However, if harmful greenhouse emissions are stabilised, New York would be able to stave off the inevitable changes until 2072 and London until 2088. The first U.S. cities to feel the changes would be Honolulu and Phoenix, followed by San Diego and Orlando, in 2046. New York and Washington will get new climates around 2047, with Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, Austin and Dallas a bit later. By 2043, 147 cities — more than half of those studied — will have shifted to a hotter temperature regime that is beyond historical records - in what is known as Climate Departure. To help depict such changes, National Geographic recently created a series of maps similar to Mr Vargic’s, demonstrating the catastrophic effect Earth’s ice could cause if it melted and flowed into the oceans and seas. These maps show how the entire Atlantic seaboard in the U.S would vanish, wiping out Florida and the Gulf Coast. While the hills in San Francisco would become islands and San Diego would be lost forever. In the east, China and Bangladesh would both be completely flooded, wiping out around 760 million people based on current population levels. The coastlines of India would also be reduced. In South America, the Amazon Basin and the Paraguay River Basin would both become Atlantic inlets and this would wipe out Buenos Aires, coastal Uruguay, and some of Paraguay. The only areas that would survive are mountainous stretches along the Caribbean coast and in Central America.","Martin Vargic created the map to depict the planet with sea levels around 260ft (79m) higher than they are today .

"Shocked: Chad Doss has revealed his rare identical triplet daughters were conceived after his vasectomy reversal . A new father of rare identical triplet daughters has revealed they were conceived naturally after a vasectomy reversal. Chad Doss, 31, from Franklin, Indiana, underwent the procedure in the hope of starting a family with his second wife, Amanda, in 2012 and was shocked with its efficiency. 'It’s beyond [a] miracle . . . It’s unbelievable,' he told Today.com following the birth of his daughters Avery, Cassidy and Bentley Doss on December 30. Mr Doss' urologist gave him about a 66per cent chance of being able to father a child within the first five years of getting his vasectomy reversed. The surgery can take up to three to four hours and prices range from $5,000 to $20,000 depending on its complexity. 'We were thinking, we’ll try for one and grow our family just a little bit,' Mr Doss recalled. His wife said she was overjoyed when she learned she was pregnant. But when doctors confirmed there were three identical girls, '[that] was just the icing on the cake,' she exclaimed. The Doss' newborns are currently at St. Vincent Women’s Hospital . in Indianapolis, where they will remain in the neonatal intensive care . unit for a few more weeks as they continue to grow. Mr . Doss - who has two children, aged nine and 12 from a previous marriage - said : 'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but . then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle. We’re . very blessed.' Come in threes: Avery, Bentley and Cassidy - born on December 30 - defied the one-in-100-million genetic odds .

Dr. Charles Coddington, a reproductive endocrinologist and president of Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, said naturally occurring identical triplets are so rare there are no studies that establish how often it happens. Various experts calculate the odds from one-in-one-million to . one-in-100-million. Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception because the babies shared a placenta and chorionic sac but had their own amniotic sacs. 'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle' Mrs Doss, 27, gave birth at 31 weeks just three months after a routine ultrasound revealed that she was carrying three babies. She told the Indy Star: ‘It was just crazy to see three babies in three beds sitting here and doing well. ‘Seeing . them for the first time was a very overwhelming experience, to feel . them in my stomach for so long and just wonder what they will look like . so to finally be able to see them was the best day ever.’ After . more than a month’s bed rest, Mrs Doss was admitted to hospital in . early December. There she felt contractions but progress was slow until . her waters broke around midday on the 30th. Instant family: Mrs and Mr Doss, who has two children from a previous marriage (pictured bottom with Mrs Doss), have had to trade in their two cars to buy a minivan to make way for their growing family . Within an hour she had given . birth to three baby girls. She said: ‘It was definitely just like in the blink of an eye that it happened.’ The Doss girls were named for their position in the womb though they were not delivered in ABC order. The first to arrive was Avery, who weighed 3lbs 15oz; followed by Cassidy at 3lbs 11oz; and last came Bentley, the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz . The Doss', who married in 2011, have traded in their two cars to purchase a minivan for their suddenly big family. 'I can’t wait to have [the girls] home and to be the mom and take care of my babies,' Mrs Doss concluded. 'I’m ready to take over.'","Chad Doss, 31, from Franklin, Indiana, underwent the procedure in the hope of starting a family with his second wife in 2012 .

"It can be easy to dismiss talks on global warming if your part of the world is feeling colder than usual. But a new study claims that while the world is getting warmer, the heating effect on the Earth has not been uniform across the planet. The research provides the first detailed analysis of global land surface warming trends over the century. A new study claims that while the world is getting warmer, the heating effect on the Earth has not been uniform across the planet. This graphic shows how temperatures have changed from 1910-2000 over different latitudes . ‘Global warming was not as understood as we thought,’ said Zhaohua Wu, an assistant professor of meteorology at Florida State University. Professor Wu used a newly-developed analysis method on historical temperature records to examine land surface temperature trends from 1900 onward for the entire globe, minus Antarctica. Previous work by scientists on global warming could not provide information of non-uniform warming in location and time due to limitations of analysis methods. Pictured is Fitz Roy mountain om Patagonia, Argentina. From 1910 to 1980, while the rest of the world was warming, areas south of the equator - near the Andes = were cooling down according to the study . The research comes as UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, urges the world's policymakers to do more to address the threat of climate change . A spike in Pacific Ocean sea . temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have . increased fears that this year's El Niño could be one of the strongest yet. El . Niño - a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific - affects . wind patterns and can trigger both floods and drought in different parts . of the globe. Although previous research has suggested extreme El . Niño events could occur later this year, experts claim this recent rise . hints they are likely to be more significant than first thought. Dr Wenju Cai, a climate expert at . Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research . Organisation, said the rises in Pacific Ocean temperature were above those seen . in previous El Niño years. ‘I think this event has lots of characteristics with a strong El Niño,’ said Cai. He based his conclusions on studying data released by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The research team found that noticeable warming first started around the regions circling the Arctic and subtropical regions in both hemispheres. But the largest warming to date has been at the northern mid-latitudes. The research team also found that in some areas of the world, cooling had occurred. ‘The global warming is not uniform,’ Professor Eric Chassignet said. ‘You have areas that have cooled and areas that have warmed.’ For example, from about 1910 to 1980, while the rest of the world was warming up, some areas south of the Equator, such as those near the Andes, were cooling down, and then had no change at all until the mid-1990s. Other areas near and south of the Equator didn't see significant changes comparable to the rest of the world at all. The detailed picture of when and where the world has warmed or cooled will provide a greater context to global warming research overall, Professor Wu said. The research comes as UN secretary-general urges the world’s policymakers to do more to address the threat of climate change. The largest warming to date has been at the northern mid latitudes, according to the Florida State study . Speaking to hundreds of international delegates at the start of a climate gathering in Abu Dhabi, Ban Ki-moon warned that time is running out to reduce harmful emissions and that political leaders need to offer bold commitments to drive meaningful change. ‘If we do not take urgent action, all our plans for increased global prosperity and security will be undone,’ he warned. Ban was in the United Arab Emirates capital to mark the start of a conference meant to lay the groundwork for a climate summit he has called for world leaders in September. The aim of the process is to get governments to agree to cut emissions after 2020 to keep warming below 1.2 degrees Celsius compared to today's levels. Global temperatures already have risen 0.8°C since record-keeping began in the 19th century.","From 1910 to 1980, study found areas south of the equator cooled down .

"Major industries will quit Britain if fracking is not made an urgent priority, peers claim. Shale gas drilling has been held up by complex rules and exaggerated environmental fears, a report by the Lords Economic Affairs Committee says. Its chairman Lord MacGregor said: ‘Potentially it’s a remarkable opportunity for this country. We believe the Government needs to get its act together.’ A 100-page report has been highly critical of the Government¿s failure to get fracking under way, despite the claim by Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, to be 'all out for shale' Industries using large amounts of energy – steel, petrochemical and heavy manufacturing – could leave Britain in the search for cheaper supplies, putting 250,000 jobs at risk, the report said. Peers also backed moves by the Government to change trespass laws so that shale companies could drill under people’s property without their permission. The 100-page document is highly critical of the Government’s failure to get fracking under way, despite the Prime Minister’s claim to be ‘all out for shale’. Lord MacGregor, said: ‘Here in the UK we have not yet left the starting gate. ‘Developing a successful shale gas and oil industry in the UK must be an urgent national priority.' Not a single application to hydrologically fracture has been received by the Environment Agency since a moratorium on the industry was lifted in 2012, the peers said. A test drilling site for shale gas near Banks on the outskirts of Southport, Lancashire, pictured in 2011. There are fears that major industries will quit Britain if fracking is not made a priority . They also backed moves by the Government to change trespass laws so that shale companies could drill under people’s property without their permission to ensure development could go ahead ‘without undue delay or cost’. And they said the successful development of shale gas and oil in the UK could reduce the country’s reliance on energy imports from places such as Russia and improve energy security. The industry could also ‘dampen’ expected gas price rises, they concluded. Their report says: ‘Substantial shale gas production in the UK could help retain and develop energy intensive industries and provide feedstock to petrochemical plants. ‘If however there is no prospect that the UK’s shale gas resource will be developed within a reasonable timescale, energy intensive industry is likely to move elsewhere.’ Exploring for shale gas has been held up by a 'dauntingly complex' regulatory system and 'much exaggerated' environmental fears, sparking protests like the ones seen here in Balcombe, West Sussex . The report cited Tom Crotty, executive director of energy firm Ineos, who had told the committee: ‘Energy intensive users employ almost a quarter of a million people in this country, and I believe that without this sort of development we will no longer be able to do that in 10 or 15 years’ time.’ Greenpeace UK chief scientist Dr Doug Parr criticised the report, warning fracking was a ‘non-solution’ that would not deliver for many years, if at all. Ken Cronin, chief executive of the UK Onshore Operators Group, which represents fracking firms, said: ‘The onshore oil and gas industry is ready and willing to step up to the challenge set by the Lords of developing a shale gas industry that can be of great benefit to the UK economy.’ Michael Fallon, the energy minister, said the report would be considered 'carefully'. 'This report . sets out that shale gas development has huge potential to provide the UK with . greater energy security, investment and jobs,' he said. 'This government . has made great progress creating a tax regime and simplifying regulation in a . way that fosters the UK’s emerging shale gas industry and protects the public.'","Major firms could leave Britain if fracking is not made priority, peers warn .

"You might think that storms and rising sea levels are the greatest threat to the survival of coastal cities. But in many waterfront megacities the ground is now dropping up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising, experts have warned. The sinking of cities such as Jakarta and New Orleans is largely caused by humans pumping for groundwater and action must be taken for the cities to survive. Sinking cities: Many coastal megacities such as Jakarta (pictured) and New Orleans are sinking up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising, experts have warned. This is largely caused by humans pumping for groundwater and action or the cities will suffer regular and dramatic flooding . The ground of some coastal cities is going down up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising and experts have blamed the extraction of groundwater. The practice saw Tokyo sink by two metres before it was stopped. Land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction is contributing to larger and longer floods. Experts are advising cities such as Jakarta and New Orleans to sop pumping for groundwater as a source of drinking water. In Venice, where pumping has stopped, the restoration of buildings which are made heavier is also contributing to subsidence. This also occurs naturally in coastal cities as the soil is weaker. Megacities on the coast have already sunk below sea level and more are set to follow suit, resulting in increased damage from flooding. Scientists at Deltares Research Institute in Utrecht studied subsidence in five coastal ‘megacities’: Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New Orleans, Dhaka and Bangkok, which they said will sink significantly unless action is taken. They found that in north Jakarta, the city has sunk 4 metres in the last 35 years - a fall of 10 to 20cm per year. Tokyo sank by almost 7ft (2 metres) until the practice of extracting groundwater from beneath parts of the city was halted and Venice also experienced major subsidence in the last century for the same reason. Geologist Gilles Erken at the university, told BBC News: ‘Land subsidence and sea level rise are both happening, and they are both contributing to the same problem - larger and longer floods, and bigger inundation depth of floods. At risk: Experts have warned that subsidence is a greater risk than rising sea levels for megacities on the coast. The cities have already sunk below sea level and more are set to follow suit, by sinking between six and 100millimetres per year (pictured) ‘The most rigorous solution and the best one is to stop pumping groundwater for drinking water, but then of course you need a new source of drinking water for these cities. But Tokyo did that and subsidence more or less stopped, and in Venice, too, they have done that.’ The total damage due to subsidence worldwide is estimated at billions of dollars a year and is set to increase. However, the problem is largely underestimated by governments. Dr Erkens, who presented the study to the European Geosciences Union, explained that the consequences of floods increase due to subsidence, as areas remain deeper under water for longer. The risk to humans is elevated as well as the economic cost of cleaning up the mess. Movements in the ground also lead to expensive repairs for roads, railways, water pipes and buildings. He believes that the extraction of water to quench the thirst of rising populations in the vast cities is the primary cause of serious subsidence, while the five cities studied also naturally experience subsidence as they are built upon weaker soil. Venice under water: Tokyo sunk by two metres until the practice of extracting groundwater from beneath parts of the city was halted and Venice also experienced major subsidence in the last century for the same reason. The Italian city is experiencing less flooding (pictured) since stopping the extraction of ground water . The study shows that subsidence only occurs in the places where the groundwater is being extracted so the solution is to source clean water from elsewhere to stop structures sinking. ‘Government bodies and inhabitants are often not aware that subsidence is an urgent problem,’ the report says. While the natural reaction to flooding is often to build a barrier, if flooding is caused by subsidence, barriers will be of little help as the cause of the problem – the extraction of groundwater – has not been addressed, it says. The scientists recommend that subsidence should be included along with water safety in planning to keep coastal cities functioning in the long term. ‘In their future scenarios, many governments only target the consequences of sea level rises, but subsidence is an equally urgent issue. The sea is rising by 3 to 10mm a year; the ground may sink up to 100cm a year,’ they said.","Ground is dropping up to 10 times faster than the sea level is rising in coastal megacities, a new study says .

"When it comes to booking a cruise, the myriad choice of ships can leave holidaymakers feeling overwhelmed. Now a cruise company has produced an infographic that explains the options on offer, along with some staggering cruise-related facts. Cruise1st's graphic has been released to coincide with the final episode of ITV's The Cruise . Ship. The four-part documentary goes behind the scenes on board the passenger ship Royal Princess, which was launched last June by the . Duchess of Cambridge. Royal seal of approval: The Duchess of Cambridge launches the Royal Princess ship in June last year . The infographic reveals that a record 1.79 million British holidaymakers took a cruise in 2013 and 21.7 million people worldwide plan to book a trip this year. Passenger figures have risen by 21 per cent in the past five years and the average cruise lasts 7.2 days. The Caribbean is the top destination, followed by the Mediterranean and Europe. Far-flung destinations in Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Asia and South America are also a hit with travellers. Passengers . said they enjoyed cruising because it offered value for money, . ‘amazing’ destinations, fine dining, and meant that they could travel . far but only had to unpack once. They . also like the fact that the ships were a 'floating resort for all' and . they could choose to do little or a lot on their trip. Cruise giant: Royal Caribbean International's Allure of the Seas is the world's largest cruise ship . Floating resort: Allure of the Seas is as big as three and half football fields and nearly four times longer than Big Ben clock tower . The majority of modern cruise ships are at least twice the size of the Titanic but the so-called ‘megaships’ tower above the competition, carrying over 6,000 passengers on board. At 362 metres, Royal Caribbean International's Allure of the Seas is the world’s largest cruise ship, equal to . three and half football fields and nearly four times longer than Big Ben . clock tower. Weighing a staggering 225,300 tonnes - the equivalent of 9,000 warrior army tanks - it can carry 6,296 guests and 2,384 crew, has 2,700 rooms, and required 158,503 gallons of paint . to decorate it.

"Residents of Toledo, Ohio have been warned not to take a shower because of the toxicity of the water. The Toledo-Lucas County Health Department announced on Saturday that people with liver disease and those who get their water from the city of Toledo's water treatment plant shouldn't shower. New tests on Sunday showed that some toxins were still contaminating Lake Erie. CBS reports that according to the Centers for Disease Control, people with sensitive skin should also avoid showering as it could cause dermatitis or skin irritation. Scroll down for video . Looking toxic: A sample glass of Lake Erie water is photographed near the City of Toledo water intake crib today . Unhealthy: Collin O'Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, gestures as he talks about algae near the City of Toledo water intake crib today . Residents were originally told it was safe to shower or bathe but things have changed in the past few days. The mayor said that before residents can shower safely, more tests need to be done on Toledo's water supply. 'This is not over yet,' said Mayor D. Michael Collins. New water samples have shown lower levels of toxicity which is a positive outcome. Toxins . possibly from algae on Lake Erie fouled the water supply of the state's . fourth-largest city last Saturday, forcing officials to issue warnings . not to drink the water and the governor to declare a state of emergency . as worried residents descended on stores, quickly clearing shelves of . bottled water. 'It looked . like Black Friday,' said Aundrea Simmons, who stood in a line of about . 50 people at a pharmacy before buying four cases of water. 'I have . children and elderly parents. They take their medication with water.' The . city advised about 400,000 residents in Toledo, most of its suburbs and . a few areas in southeastern Michigan not to brush their teeth with or . boil the water because that would only increase the toxin's . concentration. Not fit to drink: Collin O'Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, holds a sample glass of water as he talks about algae near the City of Toledo . Mean Green: Algae is seen near the City of Toledo water intake crib on Sunday . Unsafe water supply: Birds fly near the City of Toledo water intake crib today . The mayor also warned that children should not shower or . bathe in the water and that it shouldn't be given to pets. Toledo issued the warning just after midnight after tests at one treatment plant showed two sample readings for microsystin above the standard for consumption. Algae blooms during the summer have become more frequent and troublesome around the western end of Lake Erie, the shallowest of the five Great Lakes. The algae growth is fed by phosphorous mainly from farm fertilizer runoff and sewage treatment plants, leaving behind toxins that have contributed to oxygen-deprived dead zones where fish can't survive. The toxins can kill animals and sicken humans. Scientists had predicted a significant bloom of the blue-green algae this year, but they didn't expect it to peak until early September. Gov. John Kasich's emergency order issued last Saturday allowed the state to begin bringing water into the Toledo area. Large containers were being filled with water at a prison near Columbus and trucked about 130 miles north to Toledo, said Joe Andrews, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Public Safety. The state also asked major grocery chains to divert as much water as they can to northwest Ohio, Andrews said. Stocking up: Aundrea Simmons stands next to her minivan with cases of bottled water she bought after Toledo warned residents not to use its water . Cant drink tap water: Sharon Green loads bottled water into her car she bought after Toledo warned residents not to use its water . As truckloads of water came in from . across the state, Toledo leaders set up distribution centers at schools . around the city, limiting families to one case of bottled water. Some . stores were receiving new shipments of water and putting limits on how . much people can buy. 'We're going to be prepared to make sure people are not without water,' said Toledo Mayor D. Michael Collins. He . said the city hopes to know last Saturday night how long the warning will . stay in place, and he pleaded with residents not to panic. There were no . reports yet of people becoming sick from drinking the water, Collins . said. Sample of water were . flown to the federal and state Environmental Protection Agency offices . in Cincinnati and Columbus and a university in Michigan for additional . testing, officials said. Police officers were called to stores as residents lined up to buy bottled water, bags of ice and flavored water. 'People . were hoarding it. It's ridiculous,' said Monica Morales, who bought . several cases of bottled water before the store sold out of water a . half-hour after opening. Stores . in cities up to 50 miles away were reporting shortages of bottled . water. Some neighboring communities that aren't connected to Toledo's . water system were offering their water to people who brought their own . bottles and containers. Operators . of water plants all along Lake Erie, which supplies drinking water for . 11 million people, have been concerned over the last few years about . toxins fouling their supplies. Almost . a year ago, one township just east of Toledo told its 2,000 residents . not to drink or use the water coming from their taps. That was believed . to be the first time a city has banned residents from using the water . because of toxins from algae in the lake. Most . water treatment plants along the western Lake Erie shoreline treat . their water to combat the algae. Toledo spent about $4 million last year . on chemicals to treat its water and combat the toxins.","Those with liver problems and sensitive skin are especially advised not to shower .

"Heidi the cross-eyed opossum has been put down in Germany to ease her suffering. The visually challenged critter who became an Internet sensation - she had three times as many Facebook fans as Chancellor Angela Merkel - passed away today. 'The cross-eyed opossum Heidi has closed her eyes for ever,' said the zoo in Leipzig, eastern Germany. Scroll down to see a video of the famous opossum . Heidi the opossum has died, Leipzig Zoo have confirmed . The animal, aged three-and-a-half, had been treated for health problems for weeks and zoo officials decided to put her down 'to spare her further pain and suffering'. Heidi’s distinctive eye problem was thought to be due to a poor diet before she was abandoned in the United States, or because she is overweight, leading to fat deposits behind her eyes. Leipzig Zoo said she suffered badly . from arthritis.  While treatment for her maladies increased in recent . weeks, putting her to sleep was seen as the kindest option. The cross-eyed opossum is shown sitting in her enclosure in December (left) and a picture in June shows that Heidi has not been well (right) The zoo's director, Jörg Junhold, said the decision had been made 'in the interests of the animal.' In recent weeks, Heidi had hardly moved, as a result of her arthritis. 'We carried out all possible . examinations and treatments,' Junhold said. The only explanation, he . added, was old age, something that the veterinarians could do nothing . against. Leipzig Zoo first presented Heidi, . who was born in May 2008 and had previously lived in Denmark's Odense . Zoo, to the public in December 2010. She quickly became a media sensation . because of her cute cross-eyed look, and was the star attraction of the . zoo's 'Gondwanaland' tropical house, which opened in July 2011.

"A beer can fanatic has turned his collection of more than 83,000 cans into a tourist attraction, charging guests $379 a night to sleep in his house. Jeff Lebo, 51, has been collecting cans since his early teens and has amassed thousands of unique tin cans from around the world. Now the beer can collector has turned his record-breaking collection into the draw card for his guest accommodation, with guestrooms decorated with wall-to-wall cans at his Brewhouse Mountain Eco-Inn, in the forest of the Conewago Mountains, Pennsylvania. Top tipple: Beer can fanatic Jeff Lebo has turned his collection of more than 83,000 cans into the main attraction at his guesthouse, The Brewhouse Mountain Eco-Inn . With five bedrooms and two bathrooms, the inn sleeps up to 10 holidaymakers among his can collection. Mr Lebo has kitted out each room with all of the usual home comforts but decorated each with themed beer cans from various regions including America, Europe and Asia. Beer in bed: The five bedrooms are filled with walls of beer cans from various regions such as the Swedish Room . The ultimate boozer: Mr Lebo charges $379 per night for the entire guesthouse which can sleep up to 10 holidaymakers . The guesthouse even has its own bar. Mr Lebo said: ‘I started collecting vintage beer cans and ‘breweriana’ [collectible items with a brewery name or label] back in 1975 when I was 13-years-old. ‘Over the years, the collection grew by leaps and bounds. I always wanted to have a place where I could display the collection and in 1998 I finally built this place. ‘It's an incredible place for people to stay and generally people love it because it is so unique. ‘A place like this requires a person who is able to think outside of the box in order for it to be fully appreciated.’ Serene sip: Mr Lebo said that the house, in the forest of the Conewago Mountains, is 'incredible' and a 'unique place to stay' Trash to treasure: Mr Lebo started collecting cans and 'breweriana' when he was just 13-years-old and always wanted somewhere to show-off his collection and so built the guesthouse in 1998 . The house and beer can displays were built with the help Mr Lebo’s father Fred, friends and other family members. Guests have travelled from around the world to stay at the bizarre boozer and many even bring additional cans to add to the collection. He said: ‘We have had guests from all over the world as well as a number of American tourists so it's been a great deal of fun. Family effort: The house and the beer displays was built with the help of Mr Lebo's father, friends and other family members . ‘I specialize in rare beer cans from around the world and America and I'm always on the hunt for new additions. ‘I always say to people to never throw their cans away - I will take any and every collection.’ Individual rooms, such as the Pacific Room, German Room and African Room, are priced at $78 per night or you can have exclusive access to the Inn for $379 a night.

"The father of the British tourist, who is on the run after a young Cambodian woman was found brutally murdered, has begged his son to turn himself in to police. The naked body of the 20-year-old was found with her throat cut, hidden under a bed at the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in the capital Phnom Penh. Police said they were searching for Stuart James Green, who is believed to still be in the country. Murder: The woman was found at the Bolyna Palace Hotel in Daun Penh district, Cambodia . His 69-year-old father Barry, of Eccles, Greater Manchester, said today that his son was a loner and did have a temper. He . told The Sun: ‘If I could speak to him I would say, “Stuart, hand . yourself in immediately,” but I’m not confident about the state he’ll be . in.’ The man had heard from . his 47-year-old son a few weeks ago when he called and said he had met a . woman. She spoke briefly to Barry and he was glad to hear his son was . happy. He said: ‘He has a temper but he normally wouldn’t hurt anybody, particularly a woman.’ Foreigners . living in the country said today that Green, from Manchester, would be . hungry and desperate after five days in hiding as the intense police . search got under way. His . photo and passport details have been issued to police posts on main . highways, officials at all airports have been placed on alert and hotels . and guest houses have been ordered to report him should he try to check . in.

Another wrote that the hotel was a two-minute stroll from Golden . Soriya, a shopping mall, 'which as we all know is ground zero for . scuzzy, dissolute foreign men.' The . woman, who has yet to be formally identified as her body now remains in . a Buddhist temple, was described by police as being aged about 20 and a . little over 5ft tall. She was said by local people to have been seen in the past walking with foreign men beside the Mekong River in Phnom Penh. Cambodia: The man had been staying at a restort in the country with the unnamed woman . One . expatriate wrote on the discussion page that he believed Green had been . living in Cambodia for six months, although that would have required . obtaining a special visa or applying for an extension of his stay. 'There . is no indication that he has been able to leave the country,' Lieutenant Colonel Mom Sitha, of Phnom Penh's foreigner police . department, said last night. ‘We . have made checks at all the obvious exit points and there is no listing . for him.' There is speculation that Green might simply have taken a . motor bike 'taxi' to a remote area and fled into the jungle where he . might have found accommodation in a village where the locals would have . not heard about the police hunt for him. A regular writer on the discussion page wrote: 'I doubt that he left by air. ‘That . requires spending more money, using the internet, going to a travel . agent, possibly having a credit card, going through computerised exit . immigration, name being on passenger manifest, etc. Murder: Police today released details of what they said was a shocking crime .

Ditto.' 'Made it back to Europe . (unlikely)? He'll be arrested.' Police sources said that to remain on . the run, Green would need cash, food and water, all of which would . require him to make contact with people. And the more the word spread . that he was wanted, the greater the chances of him being apprehended.

"Climate scientists have backed Britain’s shale gas revolution – saying it could help to slow  global warming. The world’s leading experts on climate change say fracking will cut greenhouse gas emissions and should be made central to the country’s energy production. It will help the UK move away from ‘dirty’ coal and contribute to saving the environment, according to a report by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report added that shale gas may provide electricity and heat for decades to come if scientists can safely develop a technology that traps CO2. A young protestor holds a placard at the entrance gate belonging to a site run by Cuadrilla Resources . The report says it is ‘quite clear’ that fracking is ‘very consistent with low-carbon development’ and the technology could ‘significantly’ reduce emissions. The unexpected endorsement from 235 eminent United Nations scientists and economists will be a welcome boost to David Cameron, who is a keen advocate of the new technology. It is also a blow to green activists, who seek cuts in greenhouse gas emissions but are concerned about the effects of fracking. The IPCC report, published yesterday in Berlin, says natural gas has a role to play for at least the next 35 years as a ‘bridge technology’ while the UK expands its use of wind and solar power. And it says shale may provide electricity and heat for our homes long beyond that if scientists can safely develop an emerging technology that traps carbon dioxide and stores it underground. It is also a blow to green activists, who seek cuts in greenhouse gas emissions but are concerned about the effects of fracking . The scientists say that wind, solar and hydroelectric power need to triple or even quadruple in scale over the next 35 years if global warming is to be safely controlled. But natural gas – whether drilled from conventional wells or extracted from fractured shale deep below the ground – also has a role because it emits roughly half the volume of greenhouse gases as coal. Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chairman of the IPCC authors, said: ‘The shale gas revolution can be very consistent with low-carbon development – that is quite clear. It can be very helpful as a bridge technology.’ The IPCC document is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change. It will inform the policy decisions of governments around the world and will also be used as a bargaining tool before next year’s UN climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally-binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions. Britain is thought to have vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground that can be extracted by firing water and chemicals to fracture rock. Campaigner Bianca Jagger with Vanessa Vine, Manna Mori, and Natalie Bennett leader of the Green Party England & Wales attending an anti-fracking protest in Westminster . Mr Cameron last month said he wanted shale gas wells to be up and running by the end of the year, although industry sources say commercial extraction is not likely until the end of the decade. But there have been fierce protests against the technique, with exploratory drilling near the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, abandoned last year after the site was overrun by demonstrators. The IPCC report is the third of three it has prepared on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. The first concluded that humans are almost certainly the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring’ across the world. Yesterday’s report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is taken. It calls for massive investment in low-carbon alternatives worldwide of around £90billion a year and says governments will need to pour subsidies in to get systems off the ground. Nuclear power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply’, the report finds, but says ‘operation risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety of barriers’. Last year in Britain, coal provided 36 per cent of electricity, gas provided 27 per cent, nuclear 20 per cent, oil 1 per cent and renewable sources 15 per cent.","World’s leading experts say fracking will cut greenhouse gas emissions .

"A set of extremely rare identical triplets have been born in Indiana, defying one-in-100-million genetic odds. Triplet girls Avery, Cassidy and Bentley Doss were born on Monday at St. Vincent Women’s Hospital in Indianapolis without assisted fertility treatment. Parents Chad and Amanda Doss from Franklin have become one of several sets of parents to make headlines for giving birth to identical triplets this year after couples in the UK and America welcomed trios to their families. Come in threes: Avery, Bentley and Cassidy - born on December 30 - defied the one-in-100-million genetic odds . Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception because the babies shared a placenta and chorionic sac but had their own amniotic sacs. The odds of producing identical triplets without fertility drugs range from one-in-one-million to one-in-100-million according to various experts. The rarity makes it difficult to accurately calculate the frequency of such births. 'The best day ever': Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception in Mrs Doss' (pictured holding Bentley) womb . Mrs Doss gave birth at 31 weeks just three months after a routine ultrasound revealed that she was carrying three babies. A . year ago, Mr Doss – who has two children, aged nine and 12 from a . previous marriage – had a vasectomy procedure reversed as the couple . starting trying for their own baby. According to the Indy Star, Mrs Doss said: ‘It was just crazy to see three babies in three beds sitting here and doing well. ‘Seeing . them for the first time was a very overwhelming experience, to feel . them in my stomach for so long and just wonder what they will look like . so to finally be able to see them was the best day ever.’ After more than a month’s bed rest, Mrs Doss was admitted to hospital in early December. There she felt contractions but progress was slow until Monday when her waters broke around midday. Within an hour she had given birth to three baby girls. She said: ‘It was definitely just like in the blink of an eye that it happened.’ Avery, who was born weighing 3lbs 15on, and Bentley, born 4lbs 3on, can be held by their parents while Cassidy, who weighs 3lbs 11on, still requires of feeding tube through her umbilical cord.While Mrs Doss was discharged today, the babies are likely to remain in hospital for the next eight weeks. The couple have traded in their two cars to purchase a minivan for their suddenly big family. In November Hannah and Tom Hepner, of Quincy, California gave birth to a rare set of naturally conceived identical triplets at Sutter Memorial Hospital. Laura and Kevin Stier, of West Allis, Wisconsin weren’t even trying to get pregnant when they conceived their triplets, giving birth in October with their three babies having a collective body weight of less than 7lbs. Instant family: Mrs and Mr Doss, who has two children from a previous marriage (pictured bottom with Mrs Doss), have had to trade in their two cars to buy a minivan to make way for their growing family .

"We all have a bad hair day from time to time but this emu didn’t let its straggly locks get it down. Blissfully unaware, the bird paraded around its enclosure at Toronto Zoo with its tufts of messy curls wafting in the wind. Photographer and web designer Tetyana Kovyrina spotted the scruffy Australian native while visiting the zoo and caught its bad hair day on camera. Bed head: This emu seemed to be blissfully unaware of its straggly locks as it paraded around its enclosure at Toronto Zoo . The Ukrainian said: ‘They looked like they had just woken up and so just ignored us. ‘The birds weren’t paying any attention to the people in the zoo. 'I decided to take a few test shots and got really lucky - for a short moment the emu expressed some interest in the clicking sound of my camera's shutter and turned towards me.’ Ms Kovyrina said her photos had amused many. She said: ‘Men's typical reaction is something like “Oh, that's my wife/girlfriend/mother in the morning"". Bad hair day: Photographer Tetyana Kovyrina captured the Australian native's tufts of messy curls while visiting the zoo . Sleepy head: Ms Kovyrina thought the bird looked as if it had just woken up and after looking at her pictures, many men agree, saying it looks like their girlfriend, wife or mother after they've woken up in the morning . ‘I try to trigger people emotions with my works; try to stir up their memories. ‘Photography became my passion about five years ago. The camera gives me an ability to freeze time, capture the mood, the lights and the atmosphere of the moment.’ The emu is part of the Australasia Outdoor Exhibit at the zoo which is home to more than 5,000 animals. Biggest bird: The emu is one of more than 5,000 that live at Toronto Zoo (pictured) and is the largest native bird in Australia and the second largest in the world by height after the ostrich . The species is the largest native bird in Australia and second largest in the world by height after the ostrich. They grow to 60-70 inches tall and can weigh up to 115llbs. They tend to live in sparsely wooded plains, desert and grasslands in eastern and southern Australia. Their eggs weigh 1.5-2lbs, equivalent to up to 12 normal chicken eggs. The female usually leaves the nest after laying the egg, showing no further interest in the egg or her mate. The male then sits on the egg and incubates it for about 55 days without eating, drinking, defecating or leaving the nest.","The emu was captured on camera by photographer Tetyana Kovyrina .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his 29-year marriage to his his wife, Lyudmila, was over - after removing his wedding band as they watched the ballet together. The 60-year-old and his 55-year-old wife broke the news of the end of the 29-year marriage in an obviously staged TV interview after a night at the ballet. Before the ballet at the Kremlin Palace, . Putin was pictured wearing his wedding ring, but he must have removed . it during the performance because he was not wearing it by the time he . left and was interviewed. Scroll down for video . Russia's President Vladimir Putin and his wife Lyudmila share a smile in happier times in 2008 . Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and his wife Lyudmila, seen in March last year . Asked on Rossiya-24 television about . longstanding rumours that the Putins no longer lived together, the . 60-year-old Putin said: 'That is true.' Lyudmila Putin said it had been a 'our common decision. And our marriage is over due to the fact that we barely see each other.' Asked whether they were divorced, Lyudmila said it was a 'civilised divorce'. But neither clarified whether they were legally divorced and Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not know. The obviously staged interview made no mention of Alina Kabayeva, a 30-year-old former gymnast who is rumoured to have been Putin's mistress for years. Alina Kabayeva, 30, Putin's rumoured mistress, has appeared at the Olympics twice and done modelling work . The former gymnast, seen performing during the 2004 Athens Olympics, is alleged to be Putin's mistress . Rumours about an affair between the Russian president and Miss Kabayeva have dogged them for years . Miss Kabayeva, who is alleged to have given birth to Putin's lovechild, is now a politician after retiring from a glittering career in gymnastics in which she represented her country at the Olympics twice. Rumours about Putin's alleged affair with Miss Kabayeva first surfaced five years ago when a Russian newspaper owned by the oligarch Alexander Lebedev reported that Putin wanted to marry his gymnast mistress. Putin angrily denied the story, and the newspaper was closed down shortly afterwards, which many attributed to Putin's rage.  Further stories later emerged claiming that Miss Kabayeva had had a baby by the president, but both sides denied them. Mr and Mrs Putin had last been seen in public together at Putin's inauguration to his third presidential term on May 7, 2012. Married just a few weeks short of 30 years, the Putins announced the decision on state television after attending a ballet performance Thursday evening in the Kremlin. In April speculation was mounting as to why the first lady of Russia was rarely seen by his side . Lyudmila Putin said that the split had been a 'our common decision. And our marriage is over due to the fact that we barely see each other' His wife has rarely been seen in public during her husband's long tenure at the top of Russian politics. 'I don't like publicity and flying is difficult for me,' she said. In the televised announcement of their divorce, Putin appeared reserved and Lyudmila smiled tentatively. 'We practically never saw each other. To each his own life,' Putin said. Lyudmila Putin said, 'We will eternally be very close people. I'm thankful ... that he supports me.' There were no immediate indications of how the move would be perceived by the public. Divorce is common in Russia, and nearly 700,000 pairs dissolved their marriages in 2009, according to UNICEF. Russian President Vladimir Putin greets British Prime Minister Tony Blair as his wife Lyudmila greets Blair's wife Cherie at the start of the G8 summit in St Petersburg in 2006 . Unfounded - and vehemently denied - rumours suggested that the president had conducted affairs with other women . Russian leaders, unlike their . counterparts in the West, generally keep their personal lives well out . of public view. Mikhail Gorbachev's wife Raisa raised many Russians' hackles by her visibility, flair for fashionable dress and forthright . comments. But Putin also has made a point of supporting traditional social values and appearing at holiday masses of the Orthodox Church. The . church permits divorce under some circumstances; it is not clear if the . Putins sought pastoral advice or permission before the split. The pair, who married in 1983 and . have two daughters, recently attracted attention after they were never . seen in public together. Russia's First Lady Lyudmila Putin met her British counterpart Cherie Blair in July, 2006 . Seen here with Laura Bush, U.S. President George W. Bush and her now ex-husband Vladimir Putin, Lyudmila has rarely been seen in public during her husband's long tenure at the top of Russian politics . An official family portrait has been . issued, and photographs of their daughters Maria, 27, and Yekaterina, . 26, have never been printed by the Russian media. In April speculation was mounting as to why the first lady of Russia was rarely seen by the president's side. Unfounded . rumours suggested the president had an affair with spy-turned-lingerie . model Anna Chapman, which has been strongly denied, was behind the . former Aeroflot-hostess' disappearance from public view. In October 2010 the Putins tried to quell rumours they had divorced by posing for pictures as they jointly answered questions for the national census. The high-profile politician has been a constant fixture in leading the country. He was re-elected to to the role of President in May last year, and he previously held the post from 2000 to 2008. In between his these offices, he was Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012. The Russian office of first lady demands the attendance of many official ceremonies and functions of state - either by the side of the president or to represent him. Russia heavily frowns upon the First Lady holding outside employment while occupying the office.","Putin, 60, and 55-year-old wife announce that their 29-year marriage is over .

"Guilty: Joyce Porterfield claimed almost £24,000 of benefits after she told officials she was not married but was caught when her husband applied for a loan . A benefits cheat who managed to swindle £24,000 by claiming she was unmarried was ultimately undone by someone very close to home - her husband. Joyce Porterfield, from Wythenshawe, near Manchester, took council tax and housing tax benefits she was not entitled to for six years. Authorities did not pick up on the scam until they discovered the 57-year-old's husband had been applying for loans from the same address. She denied two charges of failing to notify a change in circumstances but was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court, after illegally claiming the benefits between April 2006 and 2012. Porterfield claimed she was separated from  husband Robert Porterfield and that they were living apart when she made the benefit claims. But the court was told that he made applications for personal loans from the same address and confirmed she was his wife in the loan forms. The offences were uncovered by council checks and their bank accounts were subsequently investigated. On one occasion both of them signed a loan document at the house in the presence of an agent who acted as a witness, the court heard. Mr Porterfield had been working at the time but suffered a stroke in 2011, the court heard. His wife then became his carer. Porterfield was given a jail sentence of six months, suspended for 18 months. She will also have to abide by night curfew which will be monitored by an electronic tag. She has started paying the money back in deductions from benefits which she is now legally entitled to. Judge Richard Mansell QC told her: ‘You were in receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit based on the false premise that you were separated from and not living with your husband, Robert Porterfield. ‘Robert Porterfield was making loan applications at that same time as your husband from the same address. Secret uncovered: Porterfield claimed she was separated from her husband Robert Porterfield and that they were living apart when she claimed the benefits but was found guilty and given a six-month suspended sentence . ‘You were motivated by wanting a better lifestyle. The message has to go out that those who defraud the taxpayer of benefits would ordinarily go to prison. The only thing that prevents me is a change in your domestic circumstances.’ The court heard the exact sum for council tax benefit was around £3,500 and more than £20,000 in housing tax benefit. Alistair Reid, defending, said her husband was very vulnerable. He added: ‘There are no concerns from the Probation Service about any on-going criminality. Deductions are already being taken.’ Just last week topless model Nicola Haighton, 25, was exposed as a benefits cheat when investigators found pictures of her wedding on Facebook. 'Wanted a better lifestyle': Judge Richard Mansell QC at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) told her that usually those 'who defraud the taxpayer of benefits would ordinarily go to prison' but as her husband's carer, she was given a suspended sentence . She had pocketed almost £4,000 in income support by claiming she was a single parent. The model, who has posed for FHM as a 'High Street Honey', failed to tell officials she got married in a lavish £6,000 ceremony in Clitheroe, Lancashire. When she was confronted, she said she'd split from her husband just two days later. The mother, who had a breast enhancement treatment to help with her modelling career, said she had married on a ‘whim’ and regretted it straight away. However the model, from Accrington, Lancashire, pleaded guilty at Blackburn Magistrates Court to failing to notify a change of circumstances which affected her entitlement to income support, council tax and housing benefit. She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £100 costs.","Joyce Porterfield claimed almost £24,000 of council tax and housing tax benefits over six years .

"A New York man started an online campaign this week to stop his mother's killers from being released from prison on parole. Jason Minter was just 6 years old when he witnessed his mother's rape and murder 37 years ago. His mother Bonnie Minter had brought him along to a friends house where his 3-year-old sister was on a playdate and the family walked in on a break-in. Putting up a fight: Jason Minter was just 6 years old when he witnessed his mother's grisly murder. He is now attempting to block her killers from getting out of jail on parole . Samuel Ayala, James Walls and Willie Profit held Mrs Minter, her friend Sheila Watson and the children at gun point while they ushered them upstairs. The men put the children in one bedroom while they took the women to the other, raped them and shot them dead. Thought he was just a child, Mr Minter tried to fight back and protect his mother. But one of the men, Ayala, pushed a gun to his head and ordered: 'Shut the f*** up, kid'. 'The last words I heard my mother say were her begging for the life of her children,' Mr Minter wrote in an online campaign he launched last week. While all three men were given life sentences after the crime, they came up for parole in 2002 and have been applying for release every two years since. Campaign: Mr Minter currently owns Indian Road Cafe in Inwood, New York. As of Tuesday evening his campaign had nearly received its goal of 3,000 signatures . Up until now they have been unsuccessful but Mr Minter fears that Ayala may get out this time since his family has begun writing on his behalf. 'He personally raped my mother. He personally shot my mother. He laughed about it as he left the house,” Minter told the New York Post. 'I heard him as he got into the (getaway) van and joked about his sexual prowess. 'He thought it was funny,' Mr Minter added. 'He’s a monster who should never ever get out of prison.' As of Tuesday night, Mr Minter's campaign had nearly reached it's goal of 3,000 signatures. He hopes the petition will stop the parole question once and for all. 'To have to do this every two years is torturous,' Mr Minter told DNAinfo.","Jason Minter witnessed his mother's rape and murder when he was just 6 years old .

"This man looks to be falling from outer space as he skydives to Earth in this stunning video. You could be forgiven for thinking that the television commercial was filmed using special effects and a green screen as the skydiver looks weightless in the slow motion clip. The incredible video for Sony A7R cameras was filmed in just nine one-minute jumps. Scroll down for video . Weightless above the world: This skydiver looks weightless in this stunning television commercial . The advert was filmed at Skydive Nagambie in Victoria, Australia, featuring performers Sharky (Jaak Saega), Sas (Simon DiSiascio), Simon Chaberka, Adam Long and Rob Douthat. Director Jeff Gaunt said it was not a typical skydiving commercial. He said: ‘We won’t be standing there watching the actors on the monitor next to the DP [director of photography]. Outer atmosphere: The clip, for Sony A7R cameras, was shot in nine one-minute skydives which captured 125 frames per second . Mid air shoot: In each of the nine jumps, they tried to get two or three shots as the skydivers plummet to the earth . ‘We actually won’t even be able to see the actors when we are shooting, mainly because they’re going to be about 15,000 feet away right up there in the sky.’ Shot at 125 frames per second, the skydivers look to be floating through the air in the clip by cinematographer Simon Hammond. The skydivers even manage to change lenses in mid air as they plummet. Serene scene: To rehearse the shots, the skydivers did a 'dirt dive' to perfect exactly what was needed . Skydiving skill: The skydivers even manage to change a lens on the camera as they free fall . Smile: Sony used the advert to emphasise the importance of avoiding exposing the sensor and glass of the camera to the elements for too long, particularly when you are in a situation that 'isn't so ideal' Mr Gaunt said: ‘We were allocated nine jumps to do the whole commercial. ‘In one minute we tried to get two to three different shots so basically we had nine minutes to shoot this TV commercial.’ The team of highly-skilled skydivers rehearsed for the shoot on a ‘dirt dive,’ practicing the shots to work out exactly what they needed. The commercial mirrors the amazing feat done by daredevil Felix Baumgartner, the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the Earth reaching speeds of up to 834 mph before his parachute opened, in October 2012. In the stunt for Redbull, the Austrian landed back on solid ground five minutes later to have completed the highest and fastest skydive in history. Mr Baumgartner made his death-defying jump from a tiny capsule that took him up to the edge of space, which took him two-and-a-half hours to travel 128,177ft above the New Mexico desert - and less than ten minutes to land.

"Thirty brides shared their big day to make sure they got their fairy tale wedding in the snow. The couples from China all said ‘I do’ among the snow and ice in the state of Chongqing, southwest China last weekend, a tradition which has become so popular that prospective bridal parties must go in a ballot to win a coveted slot. With accommodation in short supply, newlyweds even resort to sleeping in tents in the cold conditions on their wedding night just to make the ceremony. White wedding: Thirty Chinese couples got married on an ice field this weekend in this popular winter tradition . The ceremonies were inspired by the traditional ice and snow festivals held in the country near Siberian borders where locals create spectacular sculptures using their abundance of ice and snow. Such an idyllic backdrop has become a big draw card for an increased number of couples wanting to tie the knot.

Get cosy: With accommodation in short supply, most newlyweds must spend their wedding night in a tent . Most newlyweds set up camp on the ice field but do not seem to mind according to organisers. Ceremony spokesman Kong Pai said: ‘I am sure it won’t be a problem for them to keep warm.’ The brides all wore dresses designed to look their best in the icy conditions. One bride even wore red because she wanted to stand out from the completely white backdrop. Bride Wan Ts’ai said: ‘It’s wonderful to get married with so many people together and it will be our eternal memory of a wonderful day.’ Lady in red: This bride decided that a red wedding dress would be most striking against the winter wonderland backdrop . Winter wardrobe: Many brides wear designs that look best on the ice field . Celebrating snow and ice is a popular winter tradition in China with festivals such as the Harbin Ice and Snow Festival in which spectacular ice statues are built each year. This year a remarkable tower - standing at about 20 storeys high – built entirely of ice was one of the main attractions as thousands of tourists flocked to the city of Harbin near the Russian border. According to event organisers, 10,000 people were employed to complete hundreds of ice and snow sculptures at the event - some areas of which are already open to the public. Some of the pieces measure more than 26 metres tall and 117 metres wide. Overall, the whole site is well over 600,000 sq metres. Lifelong memories: One bride said the ceremony will be an 'eternal memory of a wonderful day' In the evening, some of the structures are lit up in a beautiful light-show display with numerous palaces, towers and monuments in the festival lit up in every colour of the rainbow. In the New Year, tourists can enjoy the artwork for themselves in addition to the Ice Lantern Garden Party, skiing, figure skating and theatre performances.

"Mongolian fisherman braved -22C temperatures to catch the fish first of the winter season yesterday. Through holes cut in the ice of the frozen Chagan Lake in Jilin Province, northeast China, members of the Chinese Mongolian ethnic group used a centuries-old technique to catch carp and other edible fish in their nets. The first catch of winter is considered auspicious and this year fetched about 288,888 Chinese Yuan (£28,900) as part of the annual Ice and Snow Fishing and Hunting Cultural Tourism Festival. First catch: Fisherman from the Chinese Mongolian ethnic group pull in fish in the first catch of winter in -22C temperatures . Each year, record-breaking hauls are caught by fisherman, rugged up in fur hats and sheepskin coats, using nets. Crowds of up to 20,000 people watch each year in the belief that the catch brings good luck. Some 936 tonnes of fish were caught at last year’s event at Chagan Lake, the seventh largest freshwater lake in China and home to some 70 species of fish. Catch of the day: The fisherman use primitive fishing techniques, cutting holes in the ice of Chagan Lake and using nets, to haul in the auspicious catch . Brave the cold: The first winter catch at the lake is thought to bring good luck, with fish fetching around £28,900 and attracting a crowd of up to 20,000 visitors . Record-breaking haul: Each year, as part of the Ice and Snow Fishing and Hunting Cultural Tourism Festival, the fisherman catch huge amounts of fish while rugged up in fur hats and sheepskin coats . The winter fishing technique at the lake is the most primitive Mongolian fishing method and dates as far back as 10,000 years ago when the Chagan Naoer people were hunting there. The practice, now considered a national cultural celebration, brings together various ethnic groups.

"For everyone who has ever slammed down their computer mouse in frustration, Apple believes it may have a solution. A recent patent filed by the Cupertino-based company suggests the firm may be working on a mouse that is more responsive by working like a games controller. The ‘Force Sensing Mouse’ patent suggests that the mouse would be able to sense exactly how hard and where the user presses down on a button. A recent patent suggests Apple may be working on a mouse that is more responsive like a games controller . It will then respond to the user with its own sensory feedback, such as vibrations, driven by electromagnets or motors, according to Mikey Campbell at Apple Insider. The result could do away with clumsy drags and double clicks and instead provide a far more controlled way to use a computer. In practice, the device would mean a user moves the cursor over an icon and presses a button to select it, in the same way that they do now. But they can choose how hard to press the button to provide different types of commands to the computer, like closing a document.

The mouse could then respond with a vibration to help the user navigate different types of documents. The patent includes details for left, right and central buttons that would have this sensory feedback capability. It was first filed in 2013 and credits James E. Wright and Keith J. Hendren as its inventors. It is not known whether Apple will put a product like this into production, but the patent certainly shows that they may be considering it. Its current Magic Mouse design is almost five years old. The device replaced the Mighty Mouse after the multi-button device had been on the market for four years.

Apple and Samsung have finally decided to call an end to their four-year battle over patent infringements. In a joint statement, the two tech giants said they have agreed to drop all suits against each other in countries outside of the US. However, the companies added they will continue to pursue the existing cases currently going through the American legal system. Countries where both companies have launched legal action in the past include South Korea, Japan, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Reports of a potential truce began in May, and the claims followed shortly after a jury awarded both companies damages during a high-profile court battle. This was said to have made it easier to resume talks. The brief statement, sent to journalists by Samsung Electronics Australia said: 'Samsung and Apple have agreed to drop all litigation between the two companies outside the United States.","Apple is working on a mouse that is more responsive to a users touch .

"An airliner came within just 80ft of colliding with a quadcopter drone after it was 'deliberately flown' at the passenger plane as it flew over Essex, an official report reveals. The 74-seater aeroplane was travelling over Southend when the pilot spotted the remote-controlled quadcopter 'very close' to the right wing-tip. An investigation launched into the incident recorded the risk of collision as 'high', in what is believed to be the first ever near-miss between a passenger plane and a drone in the UK. This diagram,  which was provided for the UK Airprox Board's investigation, shows the passenger plane (ATR72) on its flight path (blue line) over Southend in Essex and the estimated closest point of approach (CPA) The UK Airprox Board report into the incident, which emerged this week, revealed how the ATR72 twin-engine turboprop airliner was travelling at 1,500ft as it came in to land at Southend Airport when the pilot noticed the drone. The report revealed how the pilot informed the control tower at Southend Airport over the sighting and told the operator how the object was 'too close' to the plane. He told the tower that he thought he had seen a 'remote-control helicopter with a very small engine' before confirming it was a black and red quadcopter. The tower responded by informing the pilot there had been 'a couple' of quadcopters reported in the area at the time of the incident in May. The co-pilot told the UK Airprox Board investigation that his impression was that the quadcopter had been flown deliberately close to the plane. The report revealed that it had not been possible to trace the drone nor its operators since the incident and concluded that it was disappointing that no one had come forward to take responsibility of the quadcopter. The co-pilot of the airliner told the UK Airprox Board investigation how he believed the remote-controlled quadcopter drone had been flown at the plane 'deliberately' during the incident in Southend, Essex  (file picture) The following transcript, as revealed in the UK Airprox Board report, reveals the conversation between the airliner's pilot (AT72) and the control tower at Southend Airport (ATC) during the incident. AT72: '…for information when we were on the glide just about to intercept the glide er seen on the right side kind of er you know remote control helicopter er very small engine flying on the right side same altitude' ATC: 'That's understood roughly what range when you saw that was it' AT72: 'Just before we intercept the glide was black and red' ATC: 'That's understood er I'll make a note of that' AT72: 'Was not sure it was you know a helicopter it looks like it's a brand new thing that are flying around now on remote control' ATC: 'Oh a quadcopter type thing maybe' AT72: 'Say again sorry' ATC: 'Perhaps something like a quadcopter er we've had a couple of those around here er been reported' AT72: 'Yes exactly that' ATC: 'Understood' ATC: '(AT72)c/s do you know roughly how far away the erm model was from you' AT72: 'er from my point of view it was too close' ATC: 'Understood' Concluding its investigation, the UK Airprox Board said: 'The board were content that the AT72 pilot had clearly seen the quadcopter but, unfortunately, there was too little information available to make a meaningful analysis of the occurrence or to accurately assess the risk. 'Members were disappointed that someone would fly a quadcopter so high on the extended approach path to an airport, and that no had come forward to help with the analysis. 'It was unanimously agreed by the Board that the cause of the Airprox was that the quadcopter was flown close enough to the ATR72 to cause its pilot concern; because there was too little information to assess the degree of risk accurately, it was graded as D.' Remote-controlled drones can be bought for as little as £225 in the UK and security fears are increasing over the risk they pose to other aircraft. British pilots are demanding better protection for the public against the risks of drones and the airline pilots' association Balpa is set to call for tougher rules for the use of larger remote aircraft. Balpa, which will give evidence before a House of Lords committee tomorrow, wants drones - officially known as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) - which share airspace with passenger and freight airliners, to meet the same safety standards as piloted aircraft. The near-miss occurred as the passenger plane came in to land at Southend Airport in Essex (pictured) This includes only being flown by operators with pilot-equivalent training and being subject to tougher security measures at ground level. Balpa believes a full public consultation must be carried out before the Government sets rules on how larger commercial RPAS, for example carrying cargo, will operate over villages, towns and cities in Britain. General secretary Jim McAuslan said: 'The UK should become a 'safe drone zone' so we can make the most of the major business and leisure opportunities offered by remotely piloted aircraft, while protecting passengers, pilots and residents. 'The technology is developing quickly and we could see remote aircraft the same size as a Boeing 737 being operated commercially in our skies within 10 years. 'Large unmanned aircraft, when they come, should be as safe as manned aircraft and the British public should be fully consulted before companies fly large, remotely-piloted aircraft over their homes alongside passenger planes.'","Plane came within 80ft of colliding with drone as it went to land at Southend .

"A mystery woman is yet to be identified almost three months after she was hit by a car. The woman, who police are calling ‘Jane Doe,’ was struck by a car as she walked with a shopping cart through a busy intersection in Santa Ana, Los Angeles on October 15. She was taken to Western Medical Center in a very critical condition and has not been able to communicate with staff since her admission. Jane Doe: This woman is yet to be identified almost three months after she was critically injured in a road accident in Santa Ana . Two and a half months on from the collision, she remains totally dependent on hospital staff. The woman was hit at the intersection of 4th and Lacy streets and her shopping cart contained many belongings, suggesting she may be homeless the Santa Ana Police said. According to the Los Angeles Times, police spokesman Cpl Anthony Bertagna said: ‘But until we find out who she is, we will not know that.’ No trace: The woman's fingerprints did not return a match on local, state or federal databases and her description did not match missing persons reports . Her fingerprints did not return any . matches on the local, state or federal databases and she did not match . any missing persons reports in the area. Police do believe that she lived close to the intersection where the collision occurred. Investigators are now appealing for anyone who recognizes the woman to come forward with any information. In a separate case, a woman who was found abandoned in a hospital waiting room in Alabama was identified after three years with no identification. In August this year, the woman was unable to speak and was found wearing only an adult diaper and hospital gown. A tip off finally led authorities to discover that she was Edith Allen. Now her carer Cathy Jean Thomas, of Douglasville, Gerogia faces charges of claiming more than $25,000 in Ms Allen’s social security checks over the past three years. Because Ms Allen, who was named Sally by the medical staff who have cared for her since she was found in August 2010, did not have an identity she was unable to qualify for Medicaid.

"Manchester United flop Shinji Kagawa has completed his return to Borussia Dortmund for £6.3million - just two years after leaving the German side. Kagawa will sign a four year contract with the Dortmund, who sold the Japanese playmaker to United in 2012 for £12million. But injuries have stunted the midfielders progress, and after failing to fit into David Moyes' side last season, he has now been deemed surplus to requirements by new manager Louis van Gaal.

"Facebook announced it was splitting its messaging services (Messenger app pictured) in April, and the changes have begun rolling out to users worldwide . Facebook has begun forcing people to use Messenger after announcing its split for the main app in April. Members have been left annoyed and outraged by the changes, and have flocked to the Android app store Google Play to complain. This is in addition to concerns being raised about the app’s permissions, that give Facebook access to send texts and make calls on the user’s device. According to Google Play, the app has access to find accounts on the device, read contacts, access the user’s, as well as edit, read and receive text messages. Other permissions give Facebook the ability to directly call phone numbers, modify or delete files on USB storage, take pictures and videos, record audio, download files without notification, control vibration and change network connectivity. This has led to user’s complaining the app violates their privacy. Earlier this week, the app was averaging a one-star rating on the Play Store, but has since risen to 4.1 – this is despite 90 per cent of the first 100 reviews rating it as low as possible. Reviews on the store include: ‘I DO NOT want this messenger. Seriously. Why is Facebook forcing this on everyone? This application sucks. Bigtime.’ Another reads: ‘Why does it need to have access to your phone data, audio, USB files, and network when you're not even using it. Oh and it can listen to your conversations and turn on your camera/recorder even when you're not using it. Uninstalling immediately. Big brother!’ One reviewer said: ‘I like Messenger, I just hope it’s not true what they are saying that it's not private anymore.’ And another added: ‘Calm down people! Of course it needs access to your camera, how else would it allow you to take and send pictures and videos through the app.’ Sam Fiorella, partner at Sensei Marketing wrote: 'I'm prepared to give up some personal data for the right to access a game, content, or social network for free and to have an improved advertising experience while enjoying that free service. 'However, the current situation goes too far. It's time we stood up and said ""no!"" Take the first step by deleting this app.' Facebook recently responded with a blog post explaining why it needs certain permissions. It said: ‘Almost all apps need certain permissions to run on Android, and we use these permissions to run features in the app. ‘Keep in mind that Android controls the way the permissions are named, and the way they’re named doesn’t necessarily reflect the way the Messenger app and other apps use them.’ Scroll down for video . Users have been left annoyed and outraged at the changes, and have flocked to app stores to complain. Experts have also raised concerns about the vast number of permissions the app asks for on the Android versions (pictured). These give Facebook access to send texts, make calls , access USB storage and more . Find accounts on the device. Read your own contact card. Read your contacts. Your approximate and precise location. Edit, receive and read your text messages. Directly call phone numbers. Read call log. Test access to protected storage. Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage. Take pictures and videos. Record audio. View Wi-Fi connections. Read phone status and identity. Receive data from internet. Download files without notification. Run at startup. Prevent device from sleeping. View network connections. Install shortcuts. Change your audio settings. Read Google service configuration. Draw over other apps. Full network access. Read sync settings. Control vibration. For example, it states that the picture and video permissions allow users to take photos and recordings within the app, and send to friends. It wants access to text messages to let people add mobile numbers using confirmation codes. Facebook’s ‘call phone numbers’ permissions means people can call a contact from within a message thread. Jack Kent, principal mobile analyst at IHS Technology told MailOnline that these permissions apply to Facebook’s main app, and many of them are standard for social media apps of this kind. He added the permissions Facebook is asking for are needed for the app to be able to work in the way its users want. ‘If you’re going to add voicecalls at some point, you’ll need to access and sync your contacts. ‘If you want to take photos, the app will need access to your gallery. These are needed, however Facebook probably could have communicated this better.’ Other users have complained as to why iOS permissions aren’t so comprehensive, but this is due to the way the two different operating systems work. Android automatically asks for permissions for all the actions the app is likely to take now, or in the future. By comparison, Apple software checks permissions on a task-by-task basis. Facebook Messenger isn’t new, it originally launched in 2011. When asked why Facebook decided to separate its apps, Mr Kent said: . ‘Facebook split the app so it could have a dedicated messenger app. This reduces the different ways in which Facebook has to handle message in its standard app. 'Voice calling has been ramping up, and by separating the apps, Facebook can make this feature available. It would be too cumbersome to add to the standard app. 'This also makes voicecalling easier to deploy in other countries. ‘With a portfolio of apps, there’s more room to manoeuvre; you don’t have to use Facebook anymore. Earlier this week, the app was averaging a one-star rating on the Play Store, but has since risen to 4.1 (pictured) This is despite 90 per cent of the first 100 reviews rating it as low as possible.

For users annoyed with the change, there is an alternative way to use Facebook messages, by accessing them through a mobile browser (pictured) ‘Facebook doesn’t always get it right, though, it tried to launch a dedicated phone and home launcher, and they really didn’t get a positive response.’ Analyst Brian Blau, research director of Consumer Technology and Markets at Gartner added: ‘As with most changes that Facebook makes, users are typically not happy in the beginning and they don’t understand the motivations as to why the changes are being made. ‘And, as with most changes we see from Facebook users will accept the change and just move on. ‘This issue probably won’t impact Facebook over the long term.' For users annoyed with the change, there is currently an alternative way to use Facebook messages, by accessing the site through a mobile browser. This lets users access and responded to messages without using the Messenger app.","Facebook announced it was splitting its messaging service in April .

"A Massachusetts lawyer is concerned that it will be difficult to find impartial jurors for an upcoming murder trial given his client’s unique appearance, namely, implanted horns and a satanic tattoo. Caius Veiovis, 33, is the third suspect to face trial in the August 2011 slayings of David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell. Veiovis' signature look includes two rows of bumps resembling horns protruding from his forehead, a ‘666’ tattoo between them, and other facial and neck tattoos. He also had surgically altered the shape of his ears to make them elf-like. Serious charges: Caius Veiovis, 33, is facing kidnapping and murder charges in the torture, killing and dismemberment of three men in 2011 . Scary: The suspect's attorney is concerned his 'unique appearance' could prejudice potential jurors . Inspired by the occult: The 33-year-old has 3D horns implanted into his forehead, a 666 tattoo and additional body art on his face and neck, as well as surgically altered 'elf' ears . After discussing the matter, a Hampden Superior Court judge on Thursday told defense lawyer James Reardon Jr. he would ask potential jurors if there was anything about the Veiovis’ appearance that would keep them from being fair. The trial is scheduled to start September 3. Veiovis has pleaded not guilty to counts of murder, kidnapping and witness intimidation. The heavily inked man is accused of helping David Chalue and Adam Lee Hall kidnap, torture, murder and dismember David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell in Berkshire County on August 28, 2011. The victims' mutilated remains were later found in a ditch in Becket, Masslive.com reported. According to investigators, the co-conspirators killed Glasser because he was expected to testify against Hall, a member of the Hell’s Angels biker gang, in an unrelated assault case. Defense lawyer James Reardon Jr brought up his client's appearance out of concern that it could influence the outcome of the trial . Victims: Veiovis is accused of playing a role in the kidnapping, torture, murder and dismemberment of David Glasser (left), Edward Frampton (center), and Robert Chadwell (right) The two other men were murdered because they witnessed Glasser’s abduction. Adam Hall, 37, was convicted in February of first-degree murder and kidnapping, and sentenced to three consecutive life terms, plus 42 years. Chalue also has been found guilty and sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison for his role in the triple homicide. During the pre-trial hearing Thursday, Veiovis’ attorney asked the presiding judge to move the trial to a different location due to publicity, but his motion was denied. Accomplices: David Chalue (left) and Adam Hall (right) have been convicted of the murders and sentenced to three consecutive life terms . 'There's a serious factor of curiosity and concern when the jury first sees him,’ James Reardon Jr said in Hampden Superior Court. The lawyer then brought up the issue of his client's appearance out of concern that jurors may find it challenging to be impartial because of the horns and tattoos. ‘I think we have to get it out there,’ the lawyer stated. Berkshire District Attorney David Capeless responded that he was not planning to parse through the meanings of the body art, or try ‘to connect them to the charges.’","Caius Veiovis, 33, charged with kidnapping, murder and witness intimidation in 2011 triple homicide .

"The first commercial passenger flight from Key West to Cuba in 50 years has landed in Havana, finally reuniting the two islands separated by just 90 miles of water. U.S. Customs and Border Protection gave the final approval for the flight on Monday morning and the nine-passenger aircraft departed 90 minutes later at 10 a.m. from Key West International Airport. The first flight of the short route – which could allow residents to fly to Havana for lunch and be home in Key West in time for dinner – finally took off despite being approved by federal officials back in October 2011. First flight: Key West Mayor Craig Cates enters the first aircraft to fly the 90 miles from Key West to Havana, Cuba in 50 years . Charter operators said they had trouble getting all of the required approvals from U.S. and Cuban authorities. They have also struggled with capacity issues. Key West is currently only approved to process 10 passengers and crew from Cuba at a time. Key West International Airport director Peter Horton said: ‘This is just a test run. Whether this is going to come and be a regular service I don't believe has been determined yet.’ Quick trip: Residents could be in Havana for lunch and be back home in time for dinner in Key West on the route which has been troublesome for charter operators because of difficulty getting approvals from U.S. and Cuban authorities . Cuba and Key West have a long and interwoven history. Before the 1959 revolution, there was regular flight and ferry service to the island. Residents could fly to Havana for lunch and be back in Key West in time for dinner. The Cessna Conquest II aircraft departed the Florida island carrying nine passengers, five of which planned to participate in a licensed ‘people-to-people’ trip focusing on Cuba's culture and environment organized by the Florida Keys Tropical Research Ecological Exchange Institute. The Obama administration re-instituted . the cultural exchange licenses in 2011 allowing organizations to take .

Carolann Sharkey, the institute's trip organizer, said: ‘We're doing some really meaningful things there, working with botanical gardens, scientists, researchers, all the people there to help preserve their environment and ecology.’ Opening up opportunities: The Obama administration re-instated cultural exchange licenses in 2011 to promote understanding and exchange with Cubans . Key West Mayor Craig Cates flew to Cuba with the group, but returned Monday without venturing beyond the Havana airport terminal. Mr Cates said: ‘We haven't had flights over there in 50 years. 'It's going to be great for the city of Key West - cultural exchange, historic exchange, to be able to go back and forth directly from Key West. ‘We're closer to Cuba than Miami.’ The milestone flight comes just weeks after Cuba announced that it will ease restrictions on car imports for the first time in half a century, marking the end of an era that made icons of the island's vintage automobiles. The official newspaper Granma said the decision to allow cars to be imported for sale at market prices on the island was taken by Cuba's council of ministers. It said the decision will gradually . free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles- automobiles, vans, . trucks and motorcycles- and end the practice of granting some Cubans . special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege. The changes are a long-awaited element of President Raul Castro's attempts to gradually liberalize Cuba's Soviet-style economy. The government in September 2011 allowed Cubans and foreigners living on the island to sell their used cars to one another. More cars on the road: Cuban streets have seen very few new cars over the past 50 years because of the embargo against foreign importers but they are set to ease restrictions on car imports .","The flight left Key West International Airport with nine passengers on board .

"Every woman needs a beauty regime to keep her looking her best and this female gorilla is no exception. In a bid to keep her hair silky smooth, and her skin and nails immaculate, Effie the 210lbs gorilla is taking vitamins and supplements meant for humans. And since her daily dose of skin care supplement, she’s started attracting the attention of a potential suitor, the silverback Kumbuka. Beauty of the beast: Zoo keepers have been giving Effie the gorilla a daily dose of multivitamin supplements to keep her hair silky, and her skin and nails immaculate in a bid to attract a mate . Keepers at the London Zoo have been giving her multivitamin supplement Vitabiotics Perfectil Plus Skin for the last year and since then her hair has got thicker and her skin improved. Zoo keeper Dan Simmonds said: 'Effie has a big, charismatic personality, but for the last year or so, she had some dry skin, which was causing her some irritation. 'We always provide the best care for our animals, and we are absolutely delighted that Effie’s skin has shown signs of great improvement since she began her daily Vitabiotics’ Perfectil. 'As well as her skin, we have also noticed an improvement in the condition of Effie’s hair – it is now thicker and much healthier-looking.' Silverback Kumbuka arrived at the zoo earlier this year from Paignton Zoo in Devon and has been spotted giving Effie the eye. But despite his size – he is seven foot tall and weighs in at 406lbs – Effie is yet to give him the time of day. Daily beauty routine: The supplements have improved Effie's skin and hair and given her a 'nice boost' according to a zoo spokesman . Made for humans: Effie (right) has been taking multivitamin Perfectil Plus Skin (left) in a bid to attract the attention of Kumbuka, the 406lbs silverback at the zoo . While no one's looking: Effie is the 'teenager' of the Gorilla Kingdom group and has a reputation for stealing the others' food when they are not looking . In a bid to perk her interest, zoo keepers decided to work on Effie’s appearance after they used multivitamins to keep her companion Mjukuu healthy during and after her pregnancy. Effie, the ‘teenager’ of the group at London Zoo, has a reputation of stealing the other gorillas’ food while they are not looking to satisfy her large appetite. Originally from the forests of central Africa, Effie arrived at the zoo in 2007 after a stint at a German zoo. Effie's supplements have been checked and approved by zoo vets. Kumbuka, a western lowland gorilla, was introduced to the zoo's Gorilla Kingdom to help boost numbers of the critically-endangered species in the European breeding programme. He had not encountered females before arriving at the zoo in May this year. Gorillas are the largest of all primates and adult males weigh between 350-600lbs while females weigh between 150-300lbs. They live in family groups and are led by a dominant male known as a ‘silverback’. Western lowland gorillas live up to 35 years in the wild while in zoos they have an average lifespan of 35-45 years. The oldest gorilla on record died at 54-years-old.

"Halal and kosher slaughter of animals should be outlawed, Britain's leading vet said today. John Blackwell, president-elect of . the British Veterinary Association, has argued the ritual killing of . poultry, sheep and cattle by cutting their throats causes unnecessary suffering to animals. Traditionally, Jewish and Islamic slaughter practices involve animals having their throats slit and the blood drained because it is 'humane' But Mr Blackwell, who has been accused of 'inflaming prejudice' by religious leaders, says animals must be stunned before the cut because some will be conscious for up to two minutes before death. 'Permitted': Halal foods are those that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shari'ah . The Danish government has been . accused of religious persecution after it banned the religious . slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat. Despite huge pressure from the Muslim and Jewish communities not to, the practice was banned last month as the country's . Minister for Food, Dan Jorgensen, maintained that 'animal rights . come before religion'. Campaign: John Blackwell, president-elect of the British Veterinary Association, has argued the ritual killing of animals causes unnecessary suffering to animals . Mr . Blackwell said British abattoirs should follow Denmark's example. 'Our view has always been that animals should be stunned. They should be imperceptible to pain as death supervenes,' he told Radio 4's Today programme. 'We are looking for a meeting of minds to review the evidence base which clearly shows that slaughtering animals without stunning compromises welfare. If that can't happen then I would like labelling at the point of sale that gives the consumer informed choice. If that is not possible we would be looking for a ban for killing without stunning. 'There is no insensibility for these animals by cutting its throat and these remain conscious for seven seconds for sheep and two minutes for cattle and that is not acceptable. As a vet and scientist welfare is top of our list'. Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, responded: 'I really regret John Blackwell's remarks, which are completely misleading . Animals that are killed for the Jewish or Muslim markets do not bleed to death. Animals that are killed for the general market or the Muslim and Jewish market are killed in exactly the same way. 'A large animal has its throat cut and this renders it insensible to pain and unconscious. The Jewish method is designed to bring that about instantly, and using tendentious language is not helpful. T . The Jewish religion focuses on the most humane way of bring death. If you eat meat you have to accept that an animal that is live is then killed and the most important thing to do is to do it humanely. Animal welfare organisations have shown it fails to stun in between nine and 31 per cent of cases. When an animal is mis-stunned it suffers enormous pain and distress. When you eat your chicken from the supermarket you need to know it has been carried by an industral conveyor belt and dumped in a bath of electricute water. We don't do that and we wouldn't. 'In Denmark you had a political act designed for populist reasons because of prejudice against Muslims and I am worried Mr Blackwell is speaking in ways that inflame prejudice. Argument: The Jewish community says that the kosher method of killing animals like in this abattoir is more humane than stunning . The new leader of Britain's vets has called for the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat to be banned . Mr . Blackwell said the way halal and kosher meat is created, through the . throat being slit, resulted in 'five or six seconds' of pain for the . animal. 'They will feel the cut,' he said. 'They will feel the . massive injury of the tissues of the neck. They will perceive the . aspiration of blood they will breath in before they lose consciousness.' He told the newspaper the issue was 'one of the most important on our (vets') radar.' HALAL . Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. KOSHER . According to the laws, in order for a meat to kosher it must come from an animal that means the kosher rules. These are the animal must be ruminant and have split hooves. Ruminant animals chew food once and swallow, before regurgitating it and chewing again. Animals that Jews can eat include cows, sheep, goats and deer. They cannot eat pigs despite the fact it has split hooves because it is not a ruminant animal. Before slaughtering, the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe, causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness. Jews believe this is a way of killing that shows 'respect and compassion' as set out in Jewish law. More than 6,000 animals are killed in religious abattoirs every week in Britain. The halal meat market is believed to be worth up to an estimated £2billion. Charities including Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA also support the move to ban the slaughter of animals without stunning first. However, it is feared far-right groups could use Mr Blackwell's comments to support their campaigns on the issue. Lewis Grant, of the Veterinary Public Health Association, said cuts left over from animals which have been slaughtered for halal and kosher meat often enter the general meat trade and people do not realise they are eating it. The Jewish practice of slaughtering animals is known as shechita. Shimon Cohen, of Scechita UK, said if the government labelled meat which had been slaughtered for religious reasons it should also inform consumers if their meat had been 'shot, gassed, electocuted or drowned. He also said banning the religious slaughter of animals had been a way of driving out Jewish and Muslim populations in the 19th century. Last week the Danish government was accused of being anti-Semitic after passing the law which banned the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat. The change has been described as ‘anti-Semitic and ‘a clear interference in religious freedom’ by a group petitioning against the change. Under European regulations, animals . are required to be stunned before slaughter unless an exemption can be . found on religious grounds. Animals must be conscious when killed for the meat to be kosher under Jewish law and halal under Islamic law.","Muslims and Jews are asked to use more 'acceptable' methods of killing .

"Less than a month after they launched in the U.S., Amazon has announced it is bringing its new top-of-the-range Kindle Fire HDX tablets to the UK. The 7-inch model costs £199 and will go on sale 13 November, while the 8.9-inch version will be available on 13 December for £329.

PPI: 339 . Weight: 374g (down from 544g) Thickness: 8mm (down from 9mm) Price: Starts at £329 . Additionally, to help people who have not owned tablets before, the new Kindles come with a feature called 'Mayday', which lets users speak to a live customer service representative in a video window when downloading apps or using certain features. The helpers can explain new features or troubleshoot problems while guiding users with on-screen hand scribbles. They can even take control of the device remotely. CEO Jeff Bezos introduced the feature at the U.S. launch, saying it is 'completely unique' and takes advantage of Amazon's massive cloud computing and customer service infrastructure. This image shows the new 8.9-inch Amazon Kindle HDX tablet, centre, the 7-inch Kindle HDX, left, and an updated Kindle HD, right. The HDX models are four times faster at handling graphics. The new Kindle HD has a magnesium alloy case but has the same processor as older Kindle Fire models . The 'Mayday' feature lets users speak to a live customer service representative in a video window when downloading apps or using certain features (pictured top right). The helpers can troubleshoot problems while guiding users with on-screen hand scribbles . 'You shouldn't have to be afraid of your device,' Mr Bezos said. In a demo, Mr Bezos asked an on-screen customer service representative to recommend an app. The rep suggested Angry Birds: Star Wars II, while also giving instructions on how to set time limits on various activities for children. While the new Kindles are upgraded in several ways, Amazon also cut the price on what will be its entry-level, updated 7-inch tablet, the Kindle Fire HD with 8GB of memory now costing £119 in the UK. The new Kindle Fire HD has a magnesium alloy body, like the HDX models, but has the same screen resolution and processing power of the older models. Stephen Baker, a consumer technology analyst with research firm NPD Group, said the price cut to the Kindle Fire HD will do more to help Amazon compete in the tablet market than the added features on the newer models. Technology and Science reporter Victoria Woollaston gives her verdict on the tablet: . 'Google's Nexus 7 has dominated the budget tablet market for some time, but Amazon's new Kindle Fire HDX range is a serious contender to challenge this. 'The most immediately impressive feature - on both devices - is the high quality screen, which really has to be seen to be appreciated . 'Both screens are on par with the stunning clarity of Google's latest Nexus 7 and even when compared to high-end HD screens, the colours are noticeably brighter. 'During my brief hands-on with the two tablets, apps loaded immediately and switching between pages and applications was seamless. Amazon claims the devices are three times faster than previous models but this couldn't be qualified. 'However, the quality of the screen combined with this speed did make watching video clips seem effortless. 'I was a little cynical about how useful the Mayday feature - which is a free 24/7 technical support team accessible from the tablet's homescreen - would be, but during a demonstration I was impressed at not only how simple it is to use and how approachable the customer support member was, but the range of features available. 'The helper can draw on the screen, show or tell users how to do things by taking them through various menus and explain more about the features. The feature can also be muted, or screen sharing can be disabled simply by asking. 'Other notable features I was briefly shown include the X-Ray feature when watching Amazon-bought titles. This is an IMDB widget that sits to the left of the screen and shows details about the actors currently on screen. 'Viewers can also switch to bloopers and other significant scenes at the touch of a button from the IMDB X Ray Trivia tab, plus buy related tracks. This latter feature wasn't working  when I used the device, but Amazon claims it will be available from launch. 'Another feature that will appeal to parents is Kindle Free Time. This is an easy to setup feature designed especially for children that comes with parental controls pre-enabled. 'The price of the 7-inch tablet is aimed directly at Google's latest tablet and for £199 there is a lot to get excited about. The £329 price for the 8.9-inch device does seems a little steep though. 'Although I only used the devices briefly, I didn't think there was enough different about the larger model to warrant the extra £130 and it will mainly appeal to people who think the 7-inch screen is just a little small. 'Having used and loved Google's Nexus 7, I'd be torn between this and Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX. Yet Google would win, at a push, because its operating system seems slicker and is pure Android, rather than a skinned version.' 'That's where that model needs to be priced,' Baker said, explaining that there are numerous manufacturers with tablets with screens that measure seven inches diagonally, all priced around the same mark. 'A big focus in that 7-inch category is just price.' Between May and July, Kindles accounted for 17 per cent of all tablets sold in the U.S. compared to 48 per cent for Apple's iPad and 8 per cent for Samsung's Galaxy line, according to NPD. Globally, Amazon's shipments between April and June were down 59 per cent from a year earlier, at 470,000. The tablets are available to pre-order from today and are said to be three times faster than the previous generation . This is compared to 14.6 million for Apple's iPad, down 17 percent from a year ago, and 10.8 million for Samsung's Galaxy line, up 539 per cent. Amazon sells most of its Kindles around the Christmas holidays, Baker said. Beyond the improved specifications, Amazon also unveiled more features that incorporate data from its IMDb movie database partner. With the newer tablets, users who turn on the 'X-ray' feature can see a small window that lists the name of a song that is playing in some TV shows and movies. One tap brings up the option to buy the song. Users can also look for all music in a show and zip to the exact spot where a particular song is playing. People who have set up Amazon's video player as an app on their TVs or through game consoles can also follow along in real-time on their tablets, getting information on actors and trivia related to the shows on their larger screen. Music lovers can see song lyrics when they play songs bought from Amazon, lyrics are highlighted as they are sung and tapping on the lyrics will zip to the appropriate point in the song. Bezos said these services are only possible because Amazon provides the hardware, operating system, applications, cloud infrastructure and services for the devices. The 'hardest and coolest' services such as its Mayday service lie at the intersection of 'customer delight' and 'deep integration through the entire stack,' he added. Amazon also unveiled new 'origami covers' that lie flat when closed over the screen but can be folded and snapped into place as a stand that works both in horizontal and vertical position. They'll come in seven different colours in the U.S for between $45 and $70. The 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HDX, pictured, starts at £329 for 8GB memory.

"Tragic: Zheng Gang, 23, was found dead in a private booth  after nurses noticed he was spending longer than usual producing his sample . A Chinese medical student died of a heart attack while looking at a 'sexy magazine' in a sperm bank - on his fourth visit to the centre in just over a week. Zheng Gang, 23, was found dead in a private booth of a fertility clinic at Wuhan University after nurses noticed he was spending longer than usual producing his sample. Two hours after he first entered the cubicle, medics broke in to find him lying unconscious on the floor. Despite frantic efforts to resuscitate him where he lay, doctors pronounced him dead at the scene. The tragic death - which happened in February 2012 -  only came to light after the young man's family took the sperm bank, in Wuhan city, Hubei province, eastern China, to court saying that they were responsible for his death. But the court has now ruled that Zheng, who had started studying at the University to become a doctor in 2010, was entirely capable of making his own decisions about his life, including whether he wanted to take part in the sperm bank programme. The court heard that the young trainee doctor signed up for the programme in January 2011 and in ten days had made four visits to donate sperm for the universities sperm bank program. His family had demanded almost half £1 million in compensation, saying that they had pressurised him into agreeing to take part and had not handled the situation properly when he was found unconscious. A lower court had only awarded the family £19,000 plus £8,000 in funeral costs, and the family had appealed. But the High Court has now upheld the lower court decision. Scroll down for video .

'Not responsible': The tragic death came to light after the young man's family took the sperm bank at Wuhan University (pictured) to court saying that they were responsible for his death . Zheng had donated his sperm on four previous occasions before his death and had even solicited others to donate their semen in the interests of society, according to reports. The father asked the university to hold an autopsy but this request was rejected. The son was cremated the day after he died. Zheng's wife, Wu, who is also a student at the school, was compensated with a 20,000-yuan (£2,000) reduction in her tuition bill at the top university as well as help finding a job, said the Changjiang Times .","Zheng Gang, 23, found dead in private booth of clinic at Wuhan University .

"Don't forget to flush: Doogal demonstrates the LitterKwitter, which allows cats to use the toilet . Sick of clearing out your cat's litterbox? An inventor has come up with a pet accessory that can train a cat to use a toilet like a human. Jo Lapidge came up with the novel idea after watching a comical scene in the Hollywood film Meet the Fockers, showing a cat sharing a lavatory with one of the characters. The 48-year-old Australian made a special training device out of plant pots and toilet seats and successfully taught her own moggy, Doogal, to use the bathroom like a human. She abolished the need for a litter tray and has since developed her makeshift prototype into a product that is now sold sold worldwide. The LitterKwitter is a set of different sized plastic 'seats' that are used to train cats, and starts with a litter tray on the floor near the toilet. It is then placed on top of the toilet seat and eventually swapped for different size discs with holes in the middle that fit with the rim of the lid, before being removed altogether. The Sydney resident said: 'A few years ago I bought a little Blue Burmese kitten we named Doogal. 'Not long after Doogal's arrival I soon got sick of his smelly litter tray and his frequent, toilet-going ways. As soon as I cleaned it he would go straight in and use it again. 'A girlfriend and I went went to see Meet the Fockers which featured a cat called Mr Jinx, who shared the toilet with Ben Stiller in one funny scene.

"The new U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic arrived in the country with his husband this week after a torrent of abuse from local religious groups about being openly gay. James 'Wally' Brewster arrived in Santo Domingo despite calls for protest from groups in the Dominican Republic, explaining his future proposals in a promotional video. In the video, posted on the U.S. Embassy website, Mr Brewster said: ‘My spouse, Bob, and I have travelled the world, from the far reaches of Asia to the stunning coastlines of southern Europe.’ Scroll down for video . Brought hubby with him: James Brewster (left), the new U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, arrived in the country last week and said he brought his husband Bob Satawake (right) with him, in a promotional U.S. Embassy video . While the Dominican Republic government accepted the new ambassador with open arms, some have been very critical about the appointment. The Dominican Evangelical Fraternity in the country called for a ‘black Monday’ protest, urging locals to tie black ribbons to their cars to show their opposition to Mr Brewster, according to local media. Rev. Cristobal Cardozo, leader of the church, said Mr Brewster's presence in Santo Domingo would be 'an insult to good Dominican customs'. 'Hello, my name is Wally Brewster': The new diplomat has faced months of opposition from religious groups in the Dominican Republic because of his sexual orientation . 'Insult to Dominican customs': One evangelical church has called for locals to have a 'black Monday' protest in response to Mr Brewster's (pictured with Mr Satawake) arrival . A 'blunder': Roman Catholic Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez Rodriguez (right) has spoken out against Mr Brewster (left) on several occasions, calling the appointment by Obama a 'blunder' According to CNN, Father Luis Rosario, the director of youth ministries for the church, said: ‘He has not considered the particularities of our people. Mr Brewster being sworn in to his new diplomatic position by Vice President Joe Biden . ‘The United States is trying to impose on us marriage between gays and lesbians as well as adoption by these couples.’ But national newspaper El Nacional this week urged people to focus on the ambassador’s plans outlined in the video rather than focus on his sexual orientation which had ‘generated more attention than his diplomatic mission,’ the paper reported. Mr Brewster is the seventh U.S. ambassador in history to be openly gay. The first was philanthropist James Hormel, appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg by President Bill Clinton in 1999. In the Senate last month, Mr Brewster said: ‘I have already begun to see the challenges and controversies I will face in this job but the rewards of representing the American people, creating a more prosperous hemisphere, and strengthening democracy through our evolving relationship with the Dominican Republic will be far greater than any challenge or controversy I will ever encounter.’ In his promotional video, the new ambassador said: ‘We are both thrilled to be coming back to our second home in the Dominican Republic where I’m honored to serve as U.S. ambassador.’ Earlier this year during a press conference in which Roman Catholic Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez Rodriguez was being asked about Mr Brewster before shifting to a question on agriculture, he said: 'We went from faggots and lesbians to chickens now?' Welcome: Gay Pride marchers in Santo Domingo held signs earlier this year reading (R) 'Welcome Mr Ambassador James ""Wally"" Brewster' just days after Cardinal Rodriguez called Mr Brewster the Spanish equivalent of 'faggot' during a press conference . President's backing: Obama spoke of Mr Brewster's 'knowledge and dedication' when he announced the appointment in June . He also called the appointment of the nation’s top emissary from Washington D.C. a ‘blunder’. Cardinal Rodriguez, the country's archbishop, said: 'It's the government's job to accept them. They are interested in advancing their agenda, but they have to know there are many people in the world who are against that, both in Christian and non-Christian governments.' 'Ask the Muslim world what they think about that, in addition to Christians and Evangelicals.' Some journalists in the Dominican Republic predicted broad resentment toward the U.S. over Mr Brewster's nomination. Gay pride is there: In June, a gay pride parade in the Dominican Republic's capital city was a minor show of political power in a very conservative Catholic country . Writing in the newspaper Acento, columnist Jose Alberto Ortiz said: 'Obama knows that a large majority of the Dominican population rejects [the idea] that two people of the same sex can unite in matrimony and form a family.' The first: James Hormel was the first openly gay U.S. ambassador  posted in Luxembourg during the Clinton presidency . 'As it is not possible to convince the population of his ideology, he has opted to impose it - a typical act of an imperialist government.' U.S. President Barack Obama spoke of Mr Brewster’s ‘knowledge and dedication’ when he announced the appointment back in June. A 2010 U.S. State Department survey found that the Dominican Republic is 68.9 per cent Roman Catholic and 18.2 per cent Evangelical Christian. Just 10.6 per cent say they practice no religion. President Obama has nominated five gay men to top diplomatic posts in the past month alone. They include Brewster, former Obama for America finance chief Rufus Gifford (Denmark), Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Baer (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe), former Office of Personnel Management director John Berry (Australia) and former HBO executive James Costos (Spain). Costos and his partner, decorator Michael Smith, bundled more than $1.1 million in donations for President Obama's re-election. Brewster, too, was in that exclusive $1 million-and-over club. Other than the Dominican Republic, Spain is the only other majority-Catholic country among those expected to welcome gay U.S. ambassadors this year. But gay marriage has been legal in Spain since 2005, following moves by that country's socialist government to liberalize social policies. President Obama famously declared his support in 2012 for the right of gay couples to marry in the United States, citing issues of fairness and equal protection under the U.S. Constitution.","James 'Wally' Brewster arrived in Santo Domingo this week as U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic .

"A father-of-three has collapsed and tragically died in front of his family during a Boxing Day rugby match. Vincent Francis, 48, had substituted himself off the pitch at the Caerau Ely RFC match in Cardiff when he felt unwell but he collapsed on the side line with a suspected heart attack soon after. His daughter Sophie, 20, and other family members who were also watching the game, rushed to his side and despite treatment from paramedics, Mr Francis could not be saved. Boxing Day tragedy: Vincent Francis (centre at a previous game) collapsed and died of a suspected heart attack at a friendly rugby match after leaving the pitch feeling unwell . The father, who lived in Ely, Cardiff had come out of rugby retirement to play the friendly match. Club chairman and lifelong friend Mike Meredith said: ‘I spoke to him in the changing rooms before the game. ‘He was fine and looking forward to playing and looking forward to getting on the pitch. ‘He made a quip saying it was no excuse me not playing because I had my baby grandson with me. ‘I didn't see him collapse because my grandson was getting fractious so I'd walked away with him. He had just come off the pitch substituted and felt a bit ill and collapsed on the side line. It was a suspected heart attack.' ‘He was a personal friend. It is a sad loss to the club and we will all miss him.’ Known by his team mates as ‘Vince the Prince,’ Mr Francis had played for Caerau Ely RFC in Cardiff for 30 years, joining as a teenager, and playing and coaching as a senior. He played regular first team rugby until last year and had pulled his boots back on to take part in the club's annual Boxing Day match between the senior and junior teams. Mr Meredith said: ‘He was always there at the club, everybody knew him. ‘He was just an ordinary bloke who loved his rugby and his family. He was a nice bloke. He was a Wales and Cardiff supporter.’ On the rugby pitch: Mr Francis (centre playing in a previous game) had come out of rugby retirement to play the Boxing Day friendly and was known by his team mates as 'Vince the Prince' Mr Francis, who was widowed several years ago, worked for Rentokil. He leaves daughter Sophie, and sons James, 24, a Welsh Guardsman, and Ross, 18. James has played for the Caerau Ely RFC first XV alongside his beloved father. Close friend John Lovell, who was playing alongside Mr Francis during the game, said he was a great supporter of the local club. He said: ‘A lot of people called him “Vince the Prince”. He was a good-looking chap and he also had the gift of the gab. ‘He was definitely a cheeky chappy, but he was also a great player who was a member of the club for 30 years. ‘He has been one of the longest serving players and he was still playing up until last year. His family are doing okay but it will take some time to get over such a tragedy.’ Mr Francis became captain of Caerau Ely RFC Youth in 1983 and starred as outside half for the first team. He was the club captain between 1992 and 1995 and remained involved in the club as assistant coach and backs coach. A minute's silence was held at Caerau's home match on Saturday.","Vincent Francis had substituted himself off the pitch and was watching from the side lines when he collapsed .

"Police admitted that the fatal shooting of a mental patient armed with scissors could have been prevented if the road sergeant equipped with a Taser had been at the scene in time. Michael Eligon, 29, was walking toward police with the weapon and a ‘blank stare’ when he was shot three times by an officer in Toronto, an inquest heard. A chilling video of the dramatic shooting shown to the inquest captured Mr Eligon’s last moments as he walked toward police who had their guns drawn and yelled ‘drop it’ on February 3 last year. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Scroll down for video . Police shooting: An inquest was shown footage of Michael Eligon (far right) walking toward police armed with a pair of scissors and a 'blank stare' moments before he is shot dead by an officer . Under cross examination, Constable Scott Walker told the inquest that a Taser would have been a less lethal option of subduing Mr Eligon but that the sergeant carrying one was not on the scene at the time, according to the Toronto Sun. Mr Eligon had escaped from Toronto East General Hospital, where he was being treated for depression, earlier that day wearing just socks and his hospital gown. The police hunt for Mr Eligon began after he stole two pairs of scissors from a convenience store, stabbing the attendant in the hand as he tried to stop the escapee. 'Out of touch with reality': Officers told the inquest that a Taser would have been a less lethal option but that the road sergeant armed with one was not at the scene in time when Mr Eligon was shot . Hospital escapee: Mr Eligon had escaped from hospital earlier in the day and had stolen scissors from a convenience store, attacking the attendant in the process, before police found him wandering the streets and shot him dead (pictured) Mr Eligon then tried to steal car keys off two different women but was scared away and took shelter in residential backyards. Police finally found him wandering down Milverton Boulevard in East York and surrounded him with guns drawn. In the footage, captured by a police car’s dashboard camera, police are heard yelling ‘drop it’ as Mr Eligon walks toward them and appeared ‘out of touch with reality,’ Const. Walker told the inquest according to the Toronto Sun. Const. Walker said: ‘I remember looking into his eyes. ‘He seemed disoriented, he seemed as though he had lost touch with reality and he had a blank stare.’ Justifiable action: For several moments before Mr Eligon was shot, he walks toward police (out of screen on the left) as they yell 'drop it'. Constable Andrew Boyd told the inquest that he 'could have lunged forward in a fraction of a second' Unperturbed, Mr Eligon continues towards police, who back away until one officer backs into a parked car. As Mr Eligon advances to within four to six feet of the policemen, Constable Andrew Boyd screamed ‘shoot him’ and one officer obliges, firing three shots. Mr Eligon crumples to the ground. Const. Boyd told the inquest on Wednesday that the police’s actions were justifiable as their lives were in danger. He said: ‘Mr Eligon could have lunged forward in a fraction of a second.’ The officer who pulled the trigger has been cleared by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) but is expected to testify next week. He had been on the force just nine months. The inquest is also investigating two other fatal police shootings of mental patients.

"The British security services may be guilty of killing recently pardoned code-breaker Alan Turing for being gay, a human rights campaigner has claimed. Peter Tatchell has written to the Prime Minister insisting that the Government launch an investigation into the famous mathematician’s 1954 death by cyanide poisoning. Turing, who was pivotal in cracking the German Enigma codes during World War Two which gave the Allies vital information about the Nazi’s movements, was convicted of homosexual activity which was illegal at the time. Maybe murder? Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell (left) says the British security services may have murdered recently pardoned code-breaker Alan Turing (right) for being gay . It was thought that Turing died after eating a cyanide-laced apple but Mr Tatchell says that the alleged apple was never tested and that the original inquest was ‘perfunctory and inadequate’. He said: ‘Turing was regarded as a high security risk because of his homosexuality and his expert knowledge of code-breaking, advanced mathematics and computer science. ‘At the time of his death, Britain was gripped by a MacCarthyite-style anti-homosexual witch hunt. Gay people were being hounded out of the Armed Forces and the civil and foreign services. ‘In this frenzied homophobic atmosphere, all gay men were regarded as security risks - open to blackmail at a time when homosexuality was illegal and punishable by life imprisonment. Doubts were routinely cast on their loyalty and patriotism. Turing would have fallen under suspicion.’ 'A new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death - including speculation that he was murdered by the security services (or others). 'I think murder by state agents is unlikely. There is no known evidence pointing to any such act. However, it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated. Even if the security services did not kill him, did they pressure him and did this pressure contribute to his suicide?' Mr Tatchell’s comments come as Turing . was posthumously pardoned by the Queen under the Royal Prerogative of . Mercy. The pardon is only the fourth since the Second World War . Historians . credit the work of Turing and his fellow code-breakers at Bletchley Park . in Buckinghamshire with shortening the war by up to two years, saving . countless lives. Turing is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. But . in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity, which was illegal at . the time. To avoid prison, Turing agreed to ‘chemical castration’ – . hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. Convicted of homosexuality: Turing (centre front in his youth with friends), who was pivotal in cracking the German Enigma codes during WWII, was convicted of homosexuality in 1952 which at the time was illegal . Wrong: Mr Tatchell said that singling out Turing (right), who invented a machine which broke the Nazi's codes revealing their position (left), to be posthumously pardoned by the Queen was wrong because at least 50,000 other men were convicted under the same law . As well as physical and emotional damage, his conviction had led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for GCHQ, the successor to the Government Code and Cypher School, based at Bletchley Park. Mr Tatchell said that singling out Turing for a royal pardon because of his fame and achievements was ‘wrong’. He said: ‘At least 50,000 other men were convicted under the same law. They have never been offered a pardon and will never get one. Selective redress is a bad way to remedy a historic injustice. ‘An estimated 15,000 men convicted of the same offence as Alan Turing are still alive. ‘An apology and pardon is due to the other 50,000-plus men who were also convicted of consenting, victimless homosexual relationships during the twentieth century. These men were criminalised for consenting behaviour that was not a crime between heterosexual men and women.’ Turing was granted a pardon after a long campaign to rehabilitate his reputation. Pardons are usually given when someone has been found to be innocent after the event, but government sources said Turing was being pardoned because he was ‘a truly exceptional man who saved Britain’. In 2009 the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology for his treatment but did not secure a pardon. On Christmas Eve, the day Turing was pardoned, Mr Cameron said: ‘Alan Turing was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country. ‘His action saved countless lives. He also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements, often being referred to as the father of modern computing.’ Icon: The code-breaker was previously honoured with a statue in Manchester's gay village . On 8 June 1954, Turing's cleaner found him dead. A post-mortem examination determined that he had committed suicide. Several scholars, and even his family, have suggested Turing's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy. When his body was discovered, an apple laid half-eaten next to his bed. It was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does. Some more peculiar theories suggest Turing was 'obsessed' with fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story. The theory was supported in an article in The Guardian written by Turing's friend, the author Alan Garner, in 2011. However, later evidence suggested that Turing habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. His mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental, cause by her son's storage of chemicals in his home. Speaking on the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth on 23rd June 2012, Professor of Philosophy Jack Copeland, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954. He said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death. He added that Turing's career was at an all-time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself. He pointed out that his friend Robin Gandy stayed with Turing a week before his death and he remarked how happy Turing seemed. Finally, the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that Turing could even have been murdered. Although it is unclear who would have wanted to murder him Mr Copeland said his work at Bletchly Park was under strict secrecy until well after his death. Dear David Cameron, . One big issue thrown up by Turing’s . pardon is: Why him alone? Singling out Turing for a royal pardon just . because he was a great scientist and very famous is wrong in principle. The law should be applied equally, without fear or favour, regardless of . whether a person is a well-known high achiever – or not. Selective . redress is a bad way to remedy a historic injustice. Turing . and the other 50,000+ men were convicted under the same ‘gross . indecency’ law that sent Oscar Wilde to prison in 1895. It remained on . the statute book until 2003, classified in the penal code under the . heading ‘unnatural offences.’ Likewise, the law against ‘buggery’, which . was legislated in 1533 during the reign of King Henry VIII, was only . repealed in 2003. The second point I want to raise is the . case for a new inquiry into the circumstances of the death of Alan . Turing. Although it is said that he died from eating an apple laced with . cyanide, the allegedly fatal apple was never tested for cyanide. Moreover, he was in an upbeat mood at the time of his death and making . plans for the future – not the typical profile of a person who takes . their own life. A new inquiry is long . overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his . death – including speculation that he was murdered by the security . services (or others). I think murder by state agents is . unlikely. There is no known evidence pointing to any such act. 'Major failing': Mr Tatchell writes that all gay men were considered as 'security risks' at the time of Turing's death . However, . it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or . investigated. We know Turing was… regarded as a high security risk because of his homosexuality and his expert knowledge of code-breaking, advanced mathematics and computer science. At the time of his death… gay people were being hounded out of the armed forces and the civil and foreign services. In this frenzied homophobic atmosphere, all gay men were regarded as security risks. Doubts were routinely cast on their loyalty and patriotism, especially following the unmasking of the bisexual and gay spies, respectively Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. The security services were certainly fearful that Turing was vulnerable to blackmail and probably anxious that he might pass information to the Soviets. There was an irrational, paranoid fear that other leading scientists, perhaps including Turing, might also aid the Soviets; in Turing’s case may be as revenge for the way he’d been mistreated. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Yours sincerely,Peter Tatchell .","The code-breaker died in 1954 after eating a cyanide-laced apple .

"An Indonesian grave robber has admitted stealing the bones of twin babies for black magic spells which he believed would enable him to fly and be invisible, police said today. Police detained Resi Rokhis Suhana, 27, in the south of the main island of Java on Sunday, following reports that bones had been stolen from graves. He was arrested in a banana plantation in Cilacap district in possession of bones, ripped white shrouds of the type used in Muslim burials, women's underwear and a sickle, police said. Grave robbing for magic: Resi Rokhis Suhana (pictured centre in red top) being questioned by police after he was found to be in possession of the bones of twin babies to use for black magic spells he believed would make him invisible and able to fly . Local police chief Andry Triaspoetra said: ‘In preliminary questioning, he admitted robbing the graves to perfect a magical power called “Ultimate Magical Knight”.’ Following his arrest, Suhana was admitted to hospital to evaluate his mental health. Some still believe in black magic in Muslim-majority Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago of more than 17,000 islands inhabited by a kaleidoscope of different peoples. In 2003, a man was arrested for eating the flesh of a freshly buried old woman in what he believed was part of a ritual to make him invincible. The perfect supernatural power: In police questioning, Suhana said he wanted to cast the 'Ultimate Magical Knight' spell. Police have since admitted him to hospital for mental evaluation . Earlier this year the justice ministry proposed banning ‘black magic’ that causes death or suffering, an offence which would carry a five-year prison sentence. ‘Black magic’ is thought to be still practiced widely in Indonesia and rituals vary from incantations to ward off a common cold, to murder and grave robbing to access body parts to enhance supernatural powers. There have been various cases of grave robbers stealing the bodies of children. Dead virgin teenage girls are particularly sought after and many families guard their children’s bodies for 40 days after the burial to protect their graves. On an auspicious day in the Javanese calendar, babies have been known to be kidnapped and beheaded by sorcerers who believe that burying the head in front of their house will bring their families wealth and luck. To bring good fortune: A British citizen was arrested in Bangkok last year trying to smuggle foetuses, which had been dry roasted and painted in gold leaf, into Taiwan to sell to wealthy customers online . Local witch doctors, known as ‘dukuns’ are often hired to control the weather especially to stop rain during weddings and big public ceremonies. Magical talisman, spells, oils and clothes with magical properties can be found at local markets. Black magic is practiced in other parts of Indonesia and Asia as well. Last year British citizen Hok Kuen Chow was arrested in Bangkok after six foetuses were found stuffed into travel bags. Chow, 28, a Briton born in Hong Kong of Taiwanese parents, was held in the city’s Yaowarat area after police received a tip-off. He . is suspected of trying to smuggle the foetuses – from two to seven . months – back to Taiwan to sell to wealthy customers online. Chow has reportedly admitted buying the bodies, which had been roasted dry and painted in gold leaf, for 200,000 baht (£4,040). Back . in Taiwan he could have sold them for six times that amount to rich . clients who believe the foetuses will bring them good fortune. ‘The . bodies are between the ages of two and seven months,’ said Wiwat . Kumchumnan, of the police’s children and women protection unit. Black magic profits: Hok Kuen Chow could have sold the foetuses for six times what he paid for them had he successfully smuggled them to Taiwan .","Resi Rokhis Suhana was arrested in Java following grave robbing reports .

"Major technical problems could become a regular occurrence for website users because the internet is running out of space, experts have warned. An online breakdown caused chaos on Tuesday, costing the economy millions of pounds in lost trade and effectively closing access to a number of huge websites. Online auctioneer eBay was out of action for most of the day, with buyers and sellers inundating the site with complaints about lost business after being unable to log onto their accounts. An online breakdown caused chaos on Tuesday, costing the economy millions of pounds in lost trade and effectively closing access to a number of huge website (file picture) Hundreds of thousands of users were unable to log on and the auction site was flooded with traders demanding compensation. The problem is understood to have been caused by the crucial ‘nuts and bolts’ of the internet – called the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Internet companies and large networks use this ‘route map’ - consisting of hundreds of thousands of complex paths through the web - to send information to each other. When visiting a website, users rely on machines called routers to remember how to navigate trusted routes through the ever-expanding internet. Steve Rawlinson, managing director of web hosting experts Tagadab answers the main questions about the internet outage. What caused this issue? As traffic travels around the internet, it's directed by routers which know where to send individual packets on the basis of a 'lookup table.' This table has groups of IP addresses to help direct traffic to the right places, like postcodes in a sorting office. The number of groups of IP addresses that can be held in the very fast type of memory required for this job is limited to 512,000 in some routers. Once this number is exceeded, those routers stop working properly. The cause of this issue was that a major American networking company took one large group of IP addresses and split it into 15,000 smaller groups. This took the total number of prefixes (packets of IP addresses) from about 500,000 to 515,000 so this pushed past the limit and meant that routing stopped working in parts of the US. This was fixed in about 10 minutes but it still caused significant disruption to internet users and some major sites like eBay.'Why were eBay and Amazon affected in particular?People take more notice when these high profile sites go down. Many more sites would have been affected, they just weren't as noticeable. 'We were always going to hit this limit, the prediction was that it would happen by October. Cisco, one of the world's biggest manufacturers of routers, notified all of its customers of this potential issue back in May. It's possible that internet service providers (ISPs) thought they still had more time before this would become an issue. Will it become more widespread? Will more websites be affected?The limit will certainly be reached again. Whether or not the web is brought to its knees depends on how many network providers make the necessary upgrades before the limit is reached permanently. IPv4 exhaustion is contributing to this problem because as IPv4 resources get more limited they are handed out in smaller groups which makes the number of prefixes increase. So the very slow take-up of IPv6 is having an indirect effect on the speed with which we hit this limit, and the likelihood of this issue happening again soon.What will happen if everyone does nothing, and will the situation get worse?'If this problem isn't fixed, we will see a catastrophic repeat on a much larger scale. This news might act as a catalyst for networking companies to act, but their track record on updates is far from encouraging. But older routers are finding it difficult to manage with newer technology – such as smartphones and tablets which have drastically increased the number of people online and the time spent online. They have imposed a huge volume of extra traffic onto the web, leaving some routers struggling with lack of memory and processing power. Some machines impose an arbitrary upper limit of 512,000 different routes, a number that experts say is out of date. The . system is similar to the human brain being unable to cope with . remembering ‘all the back streets’ on a long car journey, said Dr Joss . Wright, a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute. Online . auctioneer eBay was out of action for most of the day, with buyers and . sellers inundating the site with complaints about lost business (file . picture) In order to deal with the increase in web traffic, routers need to be updated with more memory and processing power. But experts said some machines are starting to become badly dated. Dr Wright told The Daily Telegraph: ‘It’s really a case of the routers being overloaded due to more and more devices and more and more fragmented Internet landscape of lots of little networks.’ James Gill, chief executive of Internet traffic monitoring firm GoSquared, said: ‘This is likely to happen more and more the devices there are and the less the infrastructure is going to be able to cope. This definitely won’t be the last we hear of BGP outages.’ Weekly Internet retail sales averaged £729 million in June - meaning more of these problems could see online retailers losing millions of pounds of trade in the future. Richard Perks, from the market analysts Mintel, said: ‘Online firms build up their reputations on trust, on delivering a flawless experience to their customers. ‘If such problems become a regular feature, then that is a serious problem both for firms and for the economy in general.’ Video courtesy of Maron Structure Technologies .","Technical problems could increase as web runs out of space, experts say .

"A YouTube video showing a man taking five steps up a flow of lava on Mount Etna in Sicily has been analysed by a geoscientist who has confirmed it IS possible to walk on lava. Erik Klemetti, from Denis University in Ohio, has explained in his Eruptions Blog that when boiling hot lava hits the cool air, it forms a dark crust that can be stood on - albeit for a short period of time. And although lava appears to flow like a stream, it is more viscous than water, which Klemetti claims means it can withstand a small amount of pressure. A YouTube video showing a man walking across a flow of lava on Mount Etna in Sicily has been analysed by a  geoscientist from Ohio. In a blog post, volcano expert Erik Klemetti confirmed how this daredevil carried out the stunt - but strongly advised against anyone else giving it a go . The word lava can be used to describe molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the rock that solidifies and cools after an eruption. When first erupted from a volcano, lava is a liquid and its temperature ranges from 700 to 1,200°C. It is up to 100,000 times as viscous - thick and sticky - as water. A 'lava flow' is when lava flows from a volcano and is created during a 'non-explosive effusive eruption.' When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock. Explosive eruptions create a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra, rather than lava flows. During the 40-second clip, a man - described in the video's caption as a 'lava art craft worker' - is shown running up a small channel of flowing lava. A colleague stands and watches from the sidelines. As the walker's right foot takes his final step, a small flame is shown coming from the sole of his shoe. Klemetti claims that the walker's foot probably 'combusted' from the heat of the flow. In his blog, Klemetti said: 'Taking a look at the video, the lava . flow in question is moving pretty slow and has a dark crust on it. 'This . means it is likely pretty cool. 'In fact, it looks like [the lava] is called ""a'a lava"", . which is even more viscous than the pahoehoe many people associate with . lava flows. 'Crust forms quickly on lava flows because there is a high . temperature gradient between the lava (at ~1000°C) and the air (~25ºC), . so the lava hardens into a semi-flexible crust. During the 40-second YouTube clip, the man takes five or six steps up a flow of lava on Mount Etna. On his final step a flame appears under his right foot. Klemetti claims that this was the sole of the walker's shoe combusting from the heat of the flow . 'Based on where the guys . [in the video] are standing, the lava flow isn’t likely very large because the guy who . doesn’t run up the flow doesn’t seem concerned to be standing only a few . feet away. 'The flow itself looks confined to a small channel surrounded . by solidified lava. My guess is that this little flow is fairly far . from the vent (source).' Klemetti continues that if a lava flow has a 'decent' crust, if it is moving slowly and if the walker moves fast enough, their weight isn't enough to make them sink into the flow. Yet he warns that if the crust is uneven or thinner in certain parts the walker could end up falling into the lava. There are two main types of lava - pahoehoe and a'a. Pahoehoe is Hawaiian for 'smooth, unbroken lava'. and is shown in the centre of this image. A'a is Hawaiian for 'stony rough lava'. It flows slower and cools quicker. This lava is shown on the right-hand side of the image and is the lava Klametti thinks is in the 'Lava run' video . In a previous blog post, Klametti explained that falling into lava would cause the water inside a human body to boil, turn to steam and the person would 'explode from within.' Commenting further on the 'lava man' video, Klametti said: 'Apparently this video was taken by 'lava artists' during some recent activity at Mt. Etna. Lava flows from Etna can travel far downslope in channels, forming thick crusts that could support a person - as they did here. 'Running up a lava flow is possible without much in the way of dire consequences if you (a) pick the right lava flow - cool and slow; (b) you step lively and (c) get lucky. 'This hobby is up there with base jumping from tall buildings and surfing a volcano in terms of smart ways to spend your time, but really, lava flows are some of the least dangerous of the hazards from a volcano.'","The 40-second YouTube clip shows a man running up a stream of lava on Mount Etna in Sicily .

"A creative make-up artist has brought some of the world’s most famous works of art to life – by literally painting them onto human faces. Rather than using oil and canvas, Valeriya Kutsan recreated iconic works by top artists Leonardo da Vinci, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Piet Mondrian with face paint and make-up. Through the clever use of bold colours and outlines, her creations appear to be two-dimensional. Masterpiece to make-up: Creative make-up artist Valeriya Kutsan has recreated some of the world's most famous works of art, literally painting them onto models' faces . She created the designs by using bold colours to give the impression of bright paint on a canvas and outlined edges in thick black pen like a cartoon. One model's skin was covered in small red dots and her hair was painted with a canary yellow colour to look like one of Lichtenstein's comics. A play on dimensions: Bold colours and thick black outlines were used to make this model (right) look like one a cartoon from Roy Lichtenstein's comic-style artworks (left) Time-consuming process: To complete each photograph, up to four hours was spent on make-up and up to five days in post-production . Canvas of a different kind: The make-up artist researched various images and spent up to four hours painting each model including this one (right), painted to recreate Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (left) Another recreates Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece the Mona Lisa. Others were covered in newspaper cuttings, lashings of watery paint and brush strokes to make them appear like 2D pictures. Ms Valeriya began by researching the images and then spent up to four hours painting each model. The stunning series of images are called ‘2D or not 2D’ and were taken by photographer Alexander Khoklov from Moscow. Mr Khoklov, 31, said: ‘It was Valeriya's dream to make the project in the style of pop-art. Artist dream: Ms Kutsan's dream was to create pop-art-inspired photo shoot using many different images, sketches and patterns . The human canvas: This model is painted to imitate an Angry Birds character from the popular video game franchise . ‘Valeriya decided to use different techniques of make-up to create our own posters with model faces so even the Mona Lisa in our project is digitalized and looks modern. ‘First of all we began the shoot inspired by pop-art and Andy Warhol pictures, and after that we found a lot of creative pictures, images, sketches and patterns. ‘We worked with classical images of Roy Lichtenstein, Piet Mondrian and even Leonardo DaVinci. Optical illusion: Ms Kutsan used paint and make-up to create make the models' faces seem two-dimensional . Devil in the detail: Each photograph took three steps according to photographer Alexander Khoklov - choosing the image, doing the make-up and transforming it in post-production . ‘We also used the images of modern artists - for example the mask face is inspired by the imagery of Tom Lane. ‘There were three steps for each image, picture choosing, make-up and post-production. ‘It was a long process and took about two to four hours for each models' make-up and up to five days of post-production to make the pictures perfect.’ Real live art: The incredible series of images, photographed by Mr Khokhlov,  is called '2D or not to 2D' Max make-up: The models were covered in lashings of paint and make-up as well as newspaper to give the impression of a bright canvas .

"A Brooklyn tattoo artist has been criticized by animal rights groups after he inked a design on his dog while it was sedated at the vet. Mistah Metro, who works for NY Ink star Chris Torres, posted an image of his dog on Instagram, showing the animal still under sedation after having surgery. But his tattoo has led to backlash online, with animal lovers condemning Mistah Metro for marking the dog for his own amusement. Ink: Artist Mistah Metro tattooed a heart on his dog while she was under sedation after having an operation . Mistah Metro, who works at the Red Legged Devil tattoo parlor Torres opened after starring in the hit reality show, put a red heart with an arrow through it, and the names Alex and Mel, on his dog's shoulder. In a boastful Instagram post, he wrote: 'One of the many reasons my dog is cooler . than yours! She had her spleen removed yesterday and the vet let me . tattoo her while she was under.' Although it is not illegal to tattoo a dog, the ASPCA condemns the practice for anything other than identification purposes. 'Tattooing an animal for the vain sake . of joy and entertainment of the owner without any regard for the . well-being of the animal … is not something the ASPCA supports,' a spokesman for the group told the New York Post. Torres, who has tattooed actors and musicians including Marky Ramone and Anna Paquin, also moved to distance himself from the tattoo, saying his shop played no part in it. Post: Mistah Metro posted the picture on Instagram, explaining his dog had just had to have her spleen removed . Backlash: Tattoo artist Mistah Metro has been condemned for inking his dog . 'The dog wasn’t tattooed at the shop - what [employees] do on their own time isn't my business,' he told the Gothamist. Torres opened the tattoo parlor where Mistah Metro works, after the reality show he featured in came to an end. Clients pay up to $200 an hour to get a tattoo there. Animal welfare scientist Emily Patterson-Kane, of the American Veterinary Medical Association added: 'We can't say a tattoo is going to do enormous damage to an animal, but we do look at whether a procedure is therapeutically necessary first - if it's not, that's not the vets goal.' Defense: Chris Torres, star of NY Ink and owner of the tattoo parlor where Mistah Metro works, says his shop played no part in the artist's actions . Many Twitter users were appalled by the tattoo, calling for the dog to be taken away from his owner and making threats against Mistah Metro. 'How does a vet let u tattoo ur dog while still under anesthesia?? Pic is either edited or you're sick & shouldn't have a dog!' @MTLCanadiensTV tweeted. 'I can't believe you're a tattooer and I genuinely hope you never work again,' another Twitter user, @xsylveon, said.","Brooklyn artist Mistah Metro tattooed design on pet's shoulder .

Millionaire's motor: The £1million supercar was spotted outside London's exclusive Dorchester Hotel after being flown over this week . An uninsured driver was left red-faced today after police sold his £218,000 Lamborghini - and kept the cash for themselves. Officers from the Met Police pulled over the motorist when they spotted him driving the orange Lamborghini Aventador without a front plate. After carrying out a number of checks they found the driver, who was not the registered owner, did not have insurance. Second supercar: This Lamborghini Aventador, which was seized by police, sold for £218,000 at auction in Colchester, Essex, today . They seized the 217mph supercar, which cost around £350,000 new, as part of the Operation Cubo, the Met’s crackdown on uninsured vehicles. Incredibly, the owner of the Lamborghini decided not to come forward and provide the correct paperwork so the police put it up for sale at auction. It went under the hammer at the Manheim auction house’s Colchester sale with the winning bidder paying £218,000. The auction house said it was the most expensive police seized vehicle that they had sold. Police crackdown: They seized the 217mph supercar, which costs around £350,000 new, as part of the Operation Cubo . Seized: Police took this Lamborghini because it was uninsured and being driven without a licence - and amazingly the owner never came forward to claim it so it was sold . The aggressive-looking Lamborghini Aventador is the Italian car maker’s latest supercar and is powered by a 6.5-litre V12 engine. This gives it a 0-62mph time of just 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 217mph - making it one of the world’s fastest supercars. The money from the sale will go to funding frontline policing in the capital. Operation Cubo was launched by the Met Police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe in October 2012. Over the past six months, police have seized a number of flash supercars including two from the Qatari Royal Family. One of these, a Tron-style purple Lamborghini Aventador, was put on show outside the force’s New Scotland Yard as a deterrent. Officers involved in the crackdown have seized more than 11,500 cars in 12 months.","Black and gold Bugatti Veyron parked outside Dorchester Hotel in London .

"A woman, under the influence of marijuana, sliced a man’s genitals with a box cutter after accusing him of molesting her two-year-old son. Bonita Lynn Vela, 35, was arrested after holding the 18-year-old man captive for three-and-a-half hours with the help of two others at a trailer park in Franklin, Indiana. The man, believed to be the boyfriend of Vela’s daughter, told police that the woman was ‘out of control’ and ‘extremely mad’. He adamantly denied her accusations of molestation. Sliced penis: Bonita Lynn Vela was arrested after she allegedly sliced an 18-year-old man's genitals, accusing him of molesting her toddler son . Vela admitted that she had smoked marijuana and was unsure whether she had taken any other drugs according to a Johnson County Sheriff report. She told police that she had been at a friend’s house when she took the drugs and by 3 a.m. she became angry and demanded that one of her friends retrieve the 18-year-old to confront him. Held captive: The man was held down by two people as Vela allegedly threatened and cut him at a trailer park on this street in Franklin, Indiana . Two people held the young man down as Vela threatened him, saying she would ask friends to ‘take him out’ with guns by tying him to a tree, shooting him in the head and leaving his body to be eaten by animals, the victim told police. Vela then allegedly gave him an ultimatum – allow her to cut his penis or be killed or have his penis cut completely off. 'Out of control': The victim told police that Vela gave him an ultimatum: allow her to cut his penis with a box cutter or be killed (file photo) According to the police report she said she ‘wanted to scar him so that he would have to look at it every time that he had sex in the future’. As the confrontation went on, Vela got increasingly angry, shouting at him to admit to the abuse of her son. He begged them not to call the police, denying her angry accusations. She said that if ‘didn’t have anything to hide then he should let her “cut him”,’ and that whatever happened he was never come back. The 18-year-old said he thought the trio would ‘go to great lengths to hurt or kill him’ and that one of them had filmed the incident which left him with a deep cut to the penis. Vela told investigators that she only meant to scare the young man and never intended to hurt him. He was taken to Johnson Memorial Hospital for his injuries caused by the weapon, which is usually used to cut tape that holds boxes together. Vela remains in the Johnson County Jail with $28,000 bond charged with criminal confinement with a deadly weapon and battery with a deadly weapon. No other arrests have been made but investigations into Vela’s molestation accusations are underway.

"Health experts are warning about the the serious health problems that can be triggered by wearing an ill-fitting bra. They say that seemingly unrelated conditions including skin rashes, tendonitis and even indigestion can be caused by poorly fitting undergarments, especially if you have large breasts. It is thought that four in five women wear an ill-fitting bra because they tend to underestimate the width of their back, while overestimating their cup size. Ill-fitting bras can trigger a wide range of conditions - from indigestion to tendonitis  - because the underwear affects posture and the positioning of internal organs . Lorna Mills, a chiropractor practising . in Oldham, said: ‘Women come into my clinic on a regular basis showing . rounded shoulders, curves in the back, indigestion due to the diaphragm . and lungs being restricted, marks from straps and underwires, dents in . the shoulders: all the signs of an ill-fitting bra.' She says that one of the biggest problems is that women are regularly fitted with bras that are far too big in the cup. 'This . then means the straps are too big so they are continually tightened, . which then pulls the shoulders and neck down, curving the spine and . creating tension and discomfort. Retired school teacher Shirley Brailey suffered a hiatus hernia because of an underwired bra . 'The . underwire can creep up because of straps that are too tight and pressure builds around the stomach and lower oesophagus. Tissues that end up being . pushed and pulled in unnatural directions.' One . woman who has suffered the effects of an ill-fitting bra is Shirley Brailey. Shirley, a 62-year-old retired teacher from North London, said her hiatus hernia, IBS and indigestion were all caused by wearing an ineffective underwired bra. ‘For years. I have suffered from a range of complaints which, after speaking to specialists, I now realise are largely a consequence of wearing bras that never properly supported me. ‘I have suffered from hiatus hernia, heartburn, IBS and indigestion that I can pinpoint as starting when I first started wearing underwired bras. 'I have indents from the straps that have even affected how my clavicle bone ‘sticks up’.’ Shirley was also told that her back had been flattened by her bra because the muscles down the front of her body and legs had shortened as her chest pulled her forward. Shirley, who practised pilates and T’ai Chi to in a bid to remedy her problems, also suffered from tension headaches and neck pain, tendonitis in her shoulders and elbows and pins and needles. Richard Moore, a consultant osteopath and sports massage therapist in Nottingham, said: ‘On many occasions I have been able to link women’s back and neck complaints directly to badly-fitted bras that not only offer limited or no support but creating visible problems in posture, resulting in pain and tension. Bras can affect posture, which often leads to back pain and even indigestion. Straps that are too tight can also trap nerves and cause headaches . ‘Traditional bras are often too tight around the ribs, creating a pivot point in the middle of the back, dividing it into two smaller areas that can’t work as effectively. ‘The lack of support at the front can also bring the upper back forward and to compensate for this, many women end up tilting their heads backwards. STRAPS . CUPS . UNDERWIRES . ‘All these slight but continuous maladjustments put unnecessary pressure on the diaphragm, which if you are sitting at a desk for hours each day, affect the breathing mechanism and can also be a direct link to digestion problems and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). ‘Overly tight straps not only cause skin irritations but reduce blood flow, affecting the nerves and contribute to tension headaches.’ Shirley’s problems have now disappeared after she was properly fitted with a new bra called Optifit. She said it has even helped her breathe more easily. Designed by NHS bra fitter Sue McDonald and consultant plastic surgeon Atul Khanna, the bra is fitted 'three-dimensionally'. Conventional bra fittings involve two measurements: one around the ribcage under the bust, and another around the fullest part of the breasts. But Optifit is based on three measurements taken with a patented elastic strap using colour, letter and number combinations to define frame, depth and volume. Product developer Mr Khanna said that well-fitted bra could negate the need for breast-reduction surgery: 'Many women present to surgeons with back and shoulder pain, even sores or welts from straps and underwires digging into their skin. 'They blame the size of their breasts and wish for a surgical reduction. 'But in almost all of the cases I see, the problems stem from not having the right support which has, over time, led to very negative posture that is creating huge discomfort.' Chiropractor Lorna said that she had recommended the new bra to some of her patients too. ‘One of my patients is in her seventies, suffers from arthritis and we have been working on the curvature in her spine. 'After discovering Optifit, I recommended she get measured and fitted and even I was astonished at the difference. 'By simply changing her bra, her spine straightened by a quarter of an inch, which may not sound like a lot, but in anatomical terms it is very impressive. ‘By wearing something that does the right job, the posture improves because the muscles are working in a different yet correct way and it enables and encourages you to stand properly.’","Estimated that up to 80% of women wear a bra that doesn't fit them properly .

"The fourth teenager fighting for survival after being shot in the head in the Marysville school shooting has died, bringing the final death toll to five with just one survivor. Andrew Fryberg, 15, has clung to life for 15 days since his brother-like cousin Jaylen Fryberg fired a bullet into the back of his head at point-blank range. His girlfriend Zoe Galasso, 14, died at the scene in Marysville-Pilchuck High School's cafeteria, where 15-year-old Jaylen also turned the gun on himself on October 24. The four remaining victims were rushed to hospitals nearby in Everett, Washington, but only one - Andrew and Jaylen's 14-year-old cousin Nate Hatch - was upgraded from a critical condition to serious. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Andrew Fryberg (left) has died 15 days after he was shot in the head by cousin Jaylen Fryberg (right) Gia Soriano, 14, was taken off life support two days later on October 26. On October 31, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, also succumbed to her injuries. Tonight, the Fryberg family issued a statement from the ward at Harborview Medical Center to reveal that Andrew's wounds were too grave to overcome. 'We express our thanks for the amazing support from the community, as well as from everyone around the world that have been praying for us all through this tragic event,' the family said. 'We also want to say a special thank you to all the amazing staff that have cared for our son and brother here in the pediatric intensive care unit at Harborview. 'Our family is overwhelmed with the love and care that has been provided to our loved one during this time and you all will forever hold a special place in our hearts. 'But we also ask that you respect our privacy at this time of our deep loss.'

Andrew, Jaylen and Nate all grew up together in the Tulalip Tribe, one of the biggest and most successful Native American settlements in the United States, about 30 miles from Seattle, Washington. Nate, the only one shot in the jaw rather than the back of the head, was upgraded from critical to serious condition days after the shooting and is now recovering in Harborview Medical Center, where he has been able to walk and communicate with people. It has emerged Jaylen lured the victims - his five closest friends - to the same table in the cafeteria at an early lunch break by texting them. The group, who friends and family described as inseparable, had celebrated their homecoming dance together days before, and posed for smiling photos arm-in-arm. Only survivor: Nate Hatch was the only one of the group to overcome his injuries to a serious, not critical, state . Lured his victims: Jaylen texted his five closest friends saying to meet him in the cafeteria where he shot them . Community shaken: Gabby Soriano, cousin of Gia, is embraced by her mother Gay by a tribute wall . The Tulalip Tribe: Jaylen, Andrew and their cousin Nate Hatch - the only survivor - were tribe members . But tweets posted on Jaylen's Twitter feed in the run-up to his cold-blooded attack revealed a temper and underlying sense of frustration. It is still not known what led him to open fire, but theories include the suggestion that he was infuriated by an allegedly racist comment made during a football match. Jaylen, a popular player on the school's football team, got in a fight with teammate which resulted in his suspension. It was days after he returned to play that he unleashed his attack. Friends and relatives have refuted another theory that he was crushing on Andrew's girlfriend Zoe, although many maintain that could be a reason.","Andrew Fryberg, 15, was the only teenager still fighting for life 15 days after his brother-like cousin opened fire in Marysville-Pilchuck High School .

"Fashionistas with a conscience can now make an eco-statement with their jewels by buying a precious ring made from Beijing's densely polluted air. Scientists will suck dirty air from China's capital city with a revolutionary machine and . compress it for around half a day to make the 'smog stones'. Jewellers will then set the stone within a band made from a high-quality locally sourced metal to make the smog ring. Profits will go towards micro-financing the city's first smog-free parks. A prototype of the smog ring shows a clear stone with black dust particles embedded in the centre . Each ring is made from - and in turn removes from the atmosphere - 1 cubic kilometre of polluted air. The rings are the first phase in the SMOG Project, the brainchild of artist . and innovator Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer, 35, is currently in Beijing having . talks with the mayor, urban planning and city executives . to iron out fine details. Together with the city's governing bodies, Roosegaarde hopes to realise the first of many smog-free parks in Beijing. One million rings will . go on sale at the end of the year in various outlets worldwide for a . cost of around £8-£80. Early prototypes show a clear stone with the black dust particles . embedded in the centre, though the ring is still in the design process. Another prototype shows a chunkier version of the ring and in three different sizes . 'I always try to make things which improve life,' Roosegaarde tells MailOnline. 'I . want to show that people they can be . part of the solution.' 'The rings may not be the solution but they can bridge the gap between where we are now and where we need to be.' Roosegaarde's background is rooted in creating social designs that explore the relation between people, technology and space. Right now, he and his team of experts are in the process of developing a safe, energy-friendly installation - the world's largest - to capture the smog and create . clean air. It will use patented ion technology and a nano air purifier to create the cleanest, smog-free space in Beijing. A four-meter vacuum tower will use ionic filters to charge and remove smog particles, blowing fresh air out . Continued press interest has inspired large numbers of students, . artists, designers and engineers to come forward with ideas on smog . reduction. Roosegaarde will collect 100-150 of these initiatives for the second phase in The SMOG Project. He . will use them to populate an exhibition in Beijing, showing . 'what is possible when we co-create our environment'. The show is planned for October 2015. The third stage of the project will be the opening of the park in late 2015. A 4m vacuum tower will sit in the centre of the park, explains the New York Times. Ionic . filters charge and remove smog particles, blowing fresh air out of the . tower’s side vents. This creates a high-pressure zone, which . Roosegaarde’s main technical partner estimates can create a bubble that . consistently has 75 percent less smog than elsewhere. The aim is to build a number of smog-free parks in Beijing that harvest smog particles from the environment.

"A girl born as Britain's smallest baby ever has celebrated her tenth birthday by being made captain of her school football team. Aaliyah Hart was just seven inches long and weighed 12oz when she was born three months prematurely in 2003. Doctors gave her a one per cent chance of survival when they found that her lungs had not developed properly. Aaliyah Hart was born three months prematurely weighing just 12oz. She was given a one per cent chance of survival because her lungs were not yet fully developed . When she was born she was just seven inches long. Her mother was told that she might die in the womb . But Aaliyah - who was small enough to sit in the palm of her mother's hand - astounded medics by surviving. When she started school five years ago her mother, Lorriane, 47, was nervous she would be knocked over in the playground because she only weighed the same as a two year old. But the youngster has since grown into a healthy schoolgirl and is now a similar size to her classmates - standing at 4ft and weighing 4 stone. Amazingly, sporty Aaliyah now loves nothing more than playing football against a team of boys and has been named captain of the girl's football team at the independent Rosslyn School in Hall Green, Birmingham. Ms Hart, who was told her daughter might die in the womb, said she was amazed at how Aaliyah had taken to sports. She said: ‘Aaliyah's a little tomboy - she loves playing with the boys and she's developed a really sporty side recently. Aaliyah (pictured with her mother, Lorraine) is now a healthy ten-year-old and is a similar size to her classmates . Aaliyah is a very keen footballer and says that she particularly loves the social side of being in her school's football team . ‘She's very good at running, she likes rounders and gymnastics. ‘Over the last six weeks she's really got into her football and has been made captain of the girls' team. ‘It's 50/50 at her school so they usually have the girls against the boys. ‘The social side really appeals to her, everybody loves Aaliyah.’ She added: ‘It's just nice to see her doing normal things, getting involved and jumping around, happy with a smile on her face. When Aaliyah started school at the age of five her mother was worried that she would be knocked over in the playground as she was the same size as a two-year-old . When she was born she was so small that she could fit in the palm of her mother's hand . ‘And to see the other kids running towards her at the end of a game and all the teamwork that goes on is great. ‘When she was born ten years ago I didn't imagine she'd be running around a football pitch. ‘She's defied the odds to even be here today let alone captaining a girl's footy team.’ Social worker Ms Hart added that Aaliyah - who turned ten last month - had moved from a state to an independent school in 2009 to help her schoolwork and build her confidence. She added: ‘As she was always smaller than her friends her confidence had suffered. ‘But it's much better than it used to be now - she's the same size as her classmates, although she's quite thin. Aaliyah is now four feet tall and weighs four stone. She has just been made the captain of her school's girls' football team . Aaliyah's mother, Lorraine, 37, says that she never imagined she would see her daughter running around a football pitch as a healthy ten-year-old . ‘She's been given lots of responsibilities at school such as milk monitor, it allows her to assert herself. ‘She really has come a long way - it's been one hell of a journey.’ Aaliyah said she enjoyed getting a chance to play football with friends and her idol was Wayne Rooney. She said: ‘I really like playing football, it's a lot of fun playing with my friends. ‘Being the captain makes me feel very proud. I like school but I really love sports. ‘I know I'm a bit smaller but I try not to let it make a difference. ‘My favourite team is Manchester United, I really like Wayne Rooney.’ Aaliyah says that her favourite football player is Wayne Rooney and that she is very proud to be the school team's captain . Headteacher Jane Scott said Aaliyah was showing good progress at school and was delighted to see her playing football. She said: ‘She really is holding her own and it's wonderful to see. ‘She is progressing well academically and is a very popular little girl. She is full of confidence and has a wonderful character. ‘To see where she has come from to playing football with the boys in the playground is an incredible story considering she was only given such a slim chance of survival.’","Aaliyah Hart weighed 12oz and was seven inches long when she was born .

"A teenage student accused of making bombs in his home told police he took a stolen handgun to his Maryland school last week, but was too drunk to carry out a deadly shooting attack, records show. Sash Alexander Nemphos, 16, wrote in his journal that he planned to kill his parents, as well as students, teachers and a police officer at the Towson school in Baltimore, court documents state. The student took the .38-calibre revolver in his backpack to the George Washington Carver Center for the Arts and Technology on Halloween but forgot the explosives for the deadly attack he plotted. 'Talented artist': Sash Nemphos (pictured), 16, had planned to carry out the attack on the George Washington Carver Center for the Arts and Technology on Halloween but told officers he had drank whisky before classes . Plot: During a police interview for vehicle break-ins, Nemphos allegedly revealed he had explosive devices at his home and wanted to kill people at George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology (pictured) Nemphos, described as a 'shy and talented artist', said he drank whiskey before classes that day and was too drunk to go ahead with his plans, the documents show. He said he intended to try again on Monday – two days after he was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of car break-ins in Monkton, according to the Baltimore Sun. But during an interview with Baltimore County police, he told officers he had explosive devices at his home for his plot to kill people at the Towson school. He was later charged as an adult. Nemphos' arrest stunned students, staff and parents at the arts school. Wednesday was Carver's first full day of school this week since the arrest was announced, and counselors were made available to speak with students, according to the school's spokesman. Police documents show Nemphos told officers he had been bullied for years and had told teachers, but he said they took no action. Suspect: Nemphos (pictured in his Google Plus  profile) told officers he planned to carry out the shooting spree last Monday  and had even practiced taking a gun to the school inside his backpack in the Towson school . Spokesman Mychael Dickerson said he could not discuss the case because of student privacy laws, but said county schools have procedures that teachers must follow if they get reports of bullying. 'Teachers work with counselors immediately,' Dickerson said. He said staff also are trained to take note of students exhibiting abnormal behaviors. Police were first alerted to Nemphos after three employees at the Monkton Grille on Saturday said someone stole items from their unlocked vehicles in the back lot while they worked. One worker told the officer dispatched there that she had seen a teenage boy hanging about the restaurant around the time of the break-ins. A worker at a nearby local shop said a boy fitting the same description often tried to buy cigarettes there. The employee had written down the tag number of a vehicle he once saw the boy enter. Charged as an adult: The teenager was originally charged as a juvenile on suspicion of the possession of a destructive device and a handgun violation. But on Monday, the suspect's status was changed to 'adult' Proud: Earlier on Monday, Baltimore Police Chief, Jim Johnson, said the first responding officer who had interviewed Nemphos 'did an exceptional job of police work'. Above, a Baltimore Police tweet says the same . It belonged a vehicle owned by Nemphos' father, and police tracked it to the family's home on Quiet Oaks Lane. In a police search of Nemphos's house in Monkton after his arrest, officers apparently found three crude, homemade explosives, hazardous materials and a gun, according to the Baltimore Sun. They then called their Hazardous Devices Team, who dismantled the devices , made from 'readily-available. The teenager reportedly told police he had taken the handgun from his father's job. Search: During a search of Nemphos's house (pictured) in Monkton, police reportedly found three crude, homemade explosives, hazardous materials and a gun that Nemphos allegedly took  from his father's job . At one point during his interview with police, the boy's father pulled the officer aside and told him a handgun at his business in Baltimore had been stolen a few months ago, and he was worried his son might have had something to do with it. Police said Nemphos eventually admitted he had stolen the gun and hidden it in a plastic container in his bedroom, the documents state. Chief:  In an online statement: Baltimore Police Chief, Jim Johnson said thanks to the responding officer's 'diligence, we intervened in what could have been an extremely serious situation' at the school in Towson . When asked what he planned to do with the weapon, the teen said he was going to kill his parents and then drive to the school and shoot the school police officer. He said he planned to take the school officer's gun and kill as many students and teachers as he could, according to the documents. Shooting: It comes just 10 days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg (pictured) shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing three girls and injuring the three others . Nemphos faces charges including possession of a destructive device, theft and a handgun violation. He is being held at the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School in Parkville. No attorney is listed for him in online court records, and his parents could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, a Carver administrator told the newspaper there were no 'red flags' that could have alerted staff to the student's deadly intentions. 'At this point, nothing has been shared with us [from the school] to give us any indication that this could have happened,' said Maria Lowery. 'We had no reason to suspect we had an issue.' Parents of students at Carver - a premier arts school that is considered one of the top-performing insitutions in the country - were notified of the suspect's charges on Monday. School guidance counselors are currently on hand to help students who have concerns or are distressed about the allegations against Nemphos. The teenager, who was initially taken for a mental health evaluation, is being held at the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, a detention center for male youths, without bail. He is also charged with theft in relation to the car break-ins he had reportedly carried out. It comes just 10 days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing three girls and injuring the three others . The unsuspecting teens were all seated at a lunch table when 15-year-old Fryberg pulled out a .40-caliber Beretta handgun and shot each one, before committing suicide. Last week, investigators said the shooter had lured his victims to the scene by text message before launching the deadly attack. And on Monday, another alleged plot for a school shooting was thwarted by police when a 17-year-old girl was arrested in Radnor Township, suburban Philadelphia. The senior at Radnor High School allegedly wrote in a notebook that she was influenced by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and wanted to become a mass murderer, . She was arrested and will be charged as a juvenile for making terrorist threats.","Sash Nemphos, 16, took a .38 revolver to his Maryland school on Friday .

"Vice President Joe Biden ran afoul of the nation's two most prominent fact-checkers on Thursday by claiming there's a 'large, very identifiable Somali community' in his home town, and many of them drive cabs. He said Wednesday during the White House's 'Countering Violent Extremism' conference that riding in so many Somalis' cabs after train trips home helped him understand efforts by Minnesota officials to help Somali-American Muslims avoid turning into violent extremists. 'If you ever come to the train station,' he said of WIlmington, Delaware, 'you may notice that I have great relations with them, because an awful lot of them are driving cabs, and are friends of mine.' Religious and community leaders, largely Africans and Muslims, let out uncomfortable chuckles as he insisted: 'For real. I'm not being solicitous, I'm being serious.' The Washington Post's Fact Checker column gave that claim 'Four Pinocchios.' The Tampa Bay Times' PolitiFact website rated it 'Pants on Fire.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . YEAH! STEREOTYPES! Vice President Joe Biden got Four Pinocchios from the Washington Post for saying there were lots of Somali cab drivers in his native Delaware . Biden has attracted the wrong kind of attention with a series of gaffes over the years, including Tuesday's manhandling of Stephanie Carter, wife of the new Defense Secretary Ash Carter, during his swearing in ceremony . The Post's fact-checker gave Biden a 'Four Pinocchios' rating – its worst on a truthfulness scale, noting that CNN was unable to find WIlmington cab companies that hired Somali-American drivers. 'I don't think I've seen any in Delaware,' one taxi entrepreneur from Sierra Leone told the cable network. 'I see some Guinean(s), but no Somali drivers.' One LIberian immigrant said he had driven Biden, whom he described as 'a nice guy. He's a very good man.' But no Somalis, and no wonder: PolitiFact looked at U.S. Census data and found 'a whopping 15 Somalis in the entire state of Delaware.' 'That’s less than two one-thousandths of 1 percent of the state’s population.' The Post looked at data from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement and found that of the 75,000 Solamis resettled in the U.S. since 2000, 'exactly zero have arrived to live in Delaware.' Somali-Americans are concentrated mainly in in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota region, in Seattle, Washington, and in Columbus, Ohio. 'The vice president’s office did not even acknowledge our queries' about Biden's statements, the Post notes. Biden's meander into a stereotype is reminiscent of a similar 2006 Biden gaffe involving Indian-Americans. ARE THEY SOMALIS TOO? Biden posed Wednesday with longshoremen at the South Carolina Ports Authority terminal in Mount Pleasant, SC . During a Delaware campaign appearance, he told a supporter who appeared Indian that 'in Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India.' 'You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.' He said later on MSNBC that the somewhat racist quip 'was meant as a compliment.' Racial insensitivity was also a problem for the vice president during his last presidential campaign, even affecting his comments about his future boss. Biden said in 2007 of Barack Obama, then a U.S. Senator, that the future president was 'the first sort of mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and nice-looking guy.' The vice president is trying to fashion himself as a viable presidential candidate in 2016, heading to New Hampshire next week to gauge his chances in the early primary state. He visited Iowa last week and spent time in South Carolina on Wednesday as part of an official trip to promote the White House's bid to spend heavily on infrastructure projects. In Concord, New Hampshire, he will deliver an economic policy speech at The Warren B. Rudman Center for Justice, Leadership & Public Policy. Then he will take part in a round-table discussion on higher education issues at Manchester Community College.","Vice president was trying to praise Minnesota officials for helping Somali-American commuinity avoid Islamist radicalism .

"She was one of the first people to advocate the hot-right-now vegan lifestyle and has a best-selling cookbook, It's All Good, so it makes perfect sense for Gwyneth Paltrow to launch a cookbook club. The mother-of-two, who is known for her strict diet and rigorous exercise regime, is encouraging her Goop followers to start their own foodie book clubs, just as she and her pals have done. Writing on her lifestyle blog, the 40-year-old said: 'This was not my idea. The cookbook club. Which is probably why it’s so good. Foodie fan: Gwyneth Paltrow has just started a cook book club with her friends and shared some of her favourite recipes from this week's tome on her Goop . 'While I have always liked the idea of a book club (sorta) I am just not that type of gal. Until one of my gorgeous girls suggested we do a different book club of sorts. A cookbook club! Now, as someone who gets in bed and reads cookbooks cover to cover as if they were novels, this idea was scintillating.' Gwyneth, 41, says when she her girlfriends set up their club and sought the perfect first cookbook, they searched for 'something challenging, beautiful, and with the possibility of becoming a classic'. The actress says she chose Roberta's Cookbook, by Brooklyn-based chef Carlo Mirachi, because it's full of 'challenging' and . 'inventive' recipes that she and her friends would probably never have attempted at home until pushed. And . how right she is. What on earth is 'maltagliati and sungold tomato'?

"A chemist accused of faking drug test results, forging paperwork and mixing samples at a state police lab was arrested today in a scandal that has thrown thousands of criminal cases into doubt. Annie Dookhan, 34, was led by police from her home in Franklin, Massachusetts about 40 miles southwest of Boston. Dookhan’s alleged mishandling of drug samples prompted the shutdown of the Hinton State Laboratory Institute in the city last month and resulted in the resignation of three officials, including the state’s public health commissioner. Failures: Disgraced chemist Annie Dookhan has thrown the verdicts of thousands of criminal trials in Massachusetts into doubt after she was accused of faking drug results . Flawed: Dookhan, 34, lied about having a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts . State police said Dookhan tested more than 60,000 drug samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab. Defense lawyers and prosecutors are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the fall-out. Since the lab closed, more than a dozen drug defendants are back on the street while their attorneys challenge the charges based on Dookhan’s misconduct. Many more defendants are expected to be released. Authorities say more than 1,100 inmates are currently serving time in cases in which Dookhan was the primary or secondary chemist. Dookhan is charged with two counts of obstruction of justice, a charge that is formally called witness intimidation. That charge is punishable by a maximum of ten years in prison. She is also charged with pretending to hold a degree for a college or university, punishable by as much as a year in jail. Attorney General Martha Coakley said . the obstruction charge accuses Dookhan of lying about the integrity of . drug evidence that she analyzed at the lab in two instances. The other charge accuses her of lying under oath about having a . master’s degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. Shoddy work: More than a dozen defendants facing drug charges were back on the street after lawyers challenged Dookhan's work . Dressed in a grey hoodie and jeans, Dookhan was taken to state police barracks in Foxborough to be booked before her scheduled arraignment in Boston Municipal Court on this afternoon. It is unclear whether anyone else will face charges, but Dookhan’s supervisors have faced harsh criticism for not removing her from lab duties after suspicions about her were first raised by her co-workers and for not alerting prosecutors and police. 'I think that all of those who are accountable for the impact on individual cases need to be held accountable,' Governor Deval Patrick said on Thursday. Co-workers began expressing concern . about Dookhan’s work habits several years ago, but her supervisors . allowed her to continue working. She . was the most productive chemist in the lab, routinely testing more than . 500 samples a month, while others tested between 50 and 150. Shut down: Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Boston was closed over the mishandling of drug samples by a state chemist . One . co-worker told state police he never saw Dookhan in front of a . microscope. A lab employee saw Dookhan weighing drug samples without . doing a balance check on her scale. In 2010, a supervisor did an audit of Dookhan’s paperwork, but didn’t retest any of her samples. The audit found nothing wrong. The . same year, a chemist found seven instances where Dookhan incorrectly . identified a drug sample as a certain narcotic when it was something . else. According to state police he told himself it was an honest mistake. In an interview with police late last month, Dookhan allegedly admitted faking test results for two to three years. She told police she identified some . drug samples as narcotics simply by looking at them instead of testing . them, a process known as ‘'dry labbing'. She also said she forged the . initials of colleagues and deliberately turned a negative sample into a . positive for narcotics a few times. Defense attorneys for drug suspects were not surprised by Dookhan’s arrest. ‘I hate to say it - it’s more than . appropriate,’ said attorney Bernie Grossberg, who has already had one . client released from prison and has been deluged by calls from other . clients since news of the scandal broke. Fall-out: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said he expects criminal charges will be brought against Dookhan for her work that has jeopardized thousands of criminal trials . Attorney John T. Martin, who has a client who was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea based on concerns over Dookhan’s work, said: ‘I think it’s rather tragic ... that she finds herself in the same position as the people she was testifying against. 'I hope the system isn’t treating the evidence against her the way she treated the evidence against several thousand defendants.’ Dookhan was suspended from lab duties after getting caught forging a colleague’s initials on paperwork in June 2011. She resigned in March as the Department of Public Health investigated. The lab was run by the department until July 1, when state police took over as part of a state budget directive. After the lab’s shutdown, police asked a lab supervisor why Dookhan would take samples from an evidence room without logging them out. Elizabeth O'Brien told investigators that Dookhan was going through personal problems that included a miscarriage in 2009. The lab supervisor also alluded to a 2009 Supreme Court decision known as Melendez-Diaz that said it was a violation of a defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights if the accused didn’t have a chance to cross-examine the chemists who prepared reports against them. The high court’s review of what started as a Boston drug case put prosecutors in a bind across the state, resulting in an order that chemists had to be present for cross-examinations at every drug trial. O'Brien told police: 'Annie was going through personal problems, then court, and Melendez-Diaz was tough at first on her. In 2009 she had a miscarriage and other personal problems. Perhaps she was trying to be important, by being the ''go-to person.''' Dookhan said she just wanted to get the work done and never meant to hurt anyone. 'I screwed up big-time,' she is quoted as saying in a state police report. 'I messed up bad; it’s my fault. I don’t want the lab to get in trouble.'","Annie Dookhan tested more than 60,000 drug samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab .

"President Barack Obama is said to have begun quietly backing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren as a potential successor in what would be a snub to his one-time rival and later Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The president has remained publicly mum about who he would back in the 2016 race for the White House, but reportedly he has expressed concern that Ms Clinton - who has long been the unofficial frontrunner for the Democratic nomination - would undo many of his policies. Senator Warren, a former Harvard law professor and administration aide, could energize the left wing of the Democrat Party more than the centrist Ms Clinton would, in the same way President Obama did in 2008, Edward Klein argues in the New York Post. Warren also helped set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011. President Barack Obama wraps his arm around Senator Elizabeth Warren in 2012 during a fundraiser before her election. Obama is said to have quietly thrown his support behind Warren in the 2016 race for president . Klein, who is the author of author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, wrote that sources told him President Obama has quietly promised Senator Warren his support if she runs and has authorized his chief political adviser, Valerie Jarrett, to convince her to join the race. Ms Jarrett has held a series of secret meetings with Senator Warren in recent weeks, arguing that she be more likely to carry on President Obama's legacy after he departs the White House. 'Barack, Michelle and Valerie have been talking about Elizabeth Warren for quite some time,' an Obama administration source told Klein.

She is a committed progressive who, like Obama, wants to transform America into a European-style democratic-socialist state.'

And a 'well-informed Democratic Party operative' Klein talked to 'pooh-poohed' the suggestion that the president was backing Senator Warren. 'It’s all b******t' he said.

"One evacuee has raised questions . about the experience asking did they want 'to save the gene pool?' Yale University has been accused of trying to create a super race of British children during War World Two, it emerged today. The university offered to evacuate children of Oxford University staff in 1940, but it appears there could have been a sinister motive behind their seemingly kind offer. There are now concerns that leaders of the eugenics movement at Yale University may have extended the invitation because they planned to repopulate a devastated Britain with a race of intellectually superior children. Hidden motive: Accusations have emerged that when a U.S. university offered refuge to 125 children of Oxford University staff during World War Two, there was a sinister motive (file pic) 'Was Yale hoping to save the offspring of the British academic elite, . protecting those 125 children because it saw them as future leadership . class, especially deserving of preservation?' asks Jonathan Freedland in The Sunday Telegraph. As the threat of invasion loomed and the terror of Nazi bombs continued, Yale University sent a letter to both Oxford and Cambridge universities, offering children of their fellows and dons evacuation refuge in the U.S. Calling itself the Yale Faculty Committee for Receiving Oxford and Cambridge University Children, 125 Oxford children and 35 mothers took up the offer, boarding the SS Antonia from Liverpool to New Haven, Connecticut on 8 July 1940. Oxford University: Yale University sent a letter to both Oxford and Cambridge universities, offering children of their fellows and dons evacuation refuge in the U.S. Yale university: But Jonathan Freedland asks 'Was Yale hoping to save the offspring of the British academic elite, protecting those 125 children because it saw them as future leadership class, especially deserving of preservation?' The children missed their parents, but enjoyed the new world they have found themselves immersed in. They found the American classrooms less rigid than English schooling and reveled in new experiences during their five year stay. Ann Spokes-Symonds who was evacuated with her younger brother, describes the trip as 'the camaraderie between educated people' 'that connected two prestigious universities,' reported The Sunday Telegraph. But Juliet Hopkins, who was also evacuated, and thoroughly enjoyed her time at Yale, has raised questions about the experience asking did they want 'to save the gene pool?' Yale University only offered refuge to Oxford and Cambridge, but Cambridge rejected the offer, concerned that 'this might be interpreted as a privilege for a special class,' reported The Sunday Telegraph. Evacuee Juliet Hopkins discovered that the man who had taken in her family, Ellsworth Huntingdon, was not only the Professor of Geography at Yale - he was also the former president of the American Eugenics Society . Dr John Fulton of Yale Medical School . was a driving force behind the rescue and said the committee 'hoped to . save some of the children of intellectuals before the storm breaks.' In the pre-war period, the idea that society should aim to breed a better quality of human stock was popular -  those who were deemed intellectually superior were encouraged to have more children, and those with a lesser intellect were urged to have less offspring. Charles Darwin's son Leonard, saw the human race as no different to animals and similarly, 'weak' humans should not be encourage to breed. This suggest that before the war Yale was captured by an idea which seems uncomfortably close to Nazism. Gaddis Smith, Emeritus Professor of History at Yale, describes Yale's president James Angell, who ruled in 1937, as 'a fanatic eugenicist in the worst meaning of that word.' He also said the university was anti-Semitic at that time and has seen documents that there was discomfort when it emerged a mother of one of the Oxford evacuees was 'a Jewess.' Mr Freeland used the story as a backdrop of his new novel Pantheon, and once his book was finished, he sent a copy to Juliet Hopkins. She discovered that, the man who had taken in her family, Ellsworth Huntingdon, and paid for their private education out of his own pocket was not only the Professor of Geography at Yale - he was also the former president of the American Eugenics Society.","Yale University only offered children of Oxford and Cambridge university staff an evacuation to the U.S.

"Excess: Syria's first lady Asma Assad has carried on shopping as the killing in Syria spreads. She orders Western food for her three children because she doesn't want them to have a Syrian diet . She was once described as ‘a rose in the desert’, a long-limbed, London beauty who used her elegance and Western style to mask the increasing brutality of her husband’s murderous regime. But as Asma Assad shelters in a bomb-proof bunker to avoid the horrors erupting within Syria – and to escape the US missiles expected soon to rain down on the country – she has become more of a Marie Antoinette figure, shopping for extravagant designer goods, food and health products online as the country collapses around her. While more than 100,000 men, women and children have been killed and nearly two million Syrians have fled the country since March 2011, Asma, 38, recently splashed out on some Bohemian crystal chandeliers from Prague. She also regularly orders Western food in bulk for her three children as she doesn’t want them to eat only Syrian food, according to an insider. And in photographs posted on her Instagram account only last week, she is shown wearing a new blue £80 Jawbone UP on her right wrist – a device designed to help wearers keep track of how many steps they take and calories they burn. The spending seems to have accelerated along with the killing in Syria. Last year, leaked emails showed she had ordered furniture – including five chandeliers – worth £270,000 from a shop on London’s King Road as her husband’s brutal quelling of the Syrian rebellion intensified. Because of sanctions, the goods are imported to Syria through Lebanon. But until very recently, Asma travelled to Lebanon herself to meet up with her London-based parents Fawaz Akhras, a consultant cardiologist, and mother Sahar, a retired Syrian diplomat. They still spend part of the year living in the pebble-dashed West London semi-detached house where their only daughter and her two brothers grew up. Mrs Assad studied at King’s College London, then worked as a banker at JP Morgan when she met her future husband who was training in London to become an eye surgeon. They married in 2000. Mrs Assad’s parents are now spending more time in Lebanon. ‘It’s a short drive from Damascus and the parents are spending most of their time there so they can stay in touch with their daughter,’ said Ayman Abdel Nour, a former adviser to Asma’s husband. Mr Nour told The Mail on Sunday that Asma had lived a remarkably sheltered life in Damascus since she married Assad in a secret ceremony on New Year’s Day 2001. ‘She is at the centre of a fool’s court,’ he said. Bashar has been branded ‘a thug and a murderer’ by US Secretary of State John Kerry, but Asma ‘continues to view herself as the respectable wife of a president’ according to Mr Nour. Blow out: Intimate family photographs show the President, first lady and their three children celebrating a birthday. A former adviser to the Assad family said a life of luxury is all that matters to Mrs Assad . Extravagant: Asma Assad's (pictured with her children) outrageous spending came to light last year when she ordered a £270,000 chandelier as her husband's brutal quelling of the Syrian rebellion intensified . He added: ‘She is convinced her . family will rule Syria for years to come. And she is particularly . interested in growing the family wealth and making sure they keep it. 'She . wants to be certain her son, Hafez, will take over as president one . day, even if this means hiding him in a school or college in Switzerland . or Britain for a time.’ Of . her recent purchases, Mr Nour said: ‘Asma Assad has no heart. She is . obsessed by how chic and beautiful she looks. She continues to lead a . life of utter luxury. That’s all that matters to her.’ Other . insiders, who do not want to be named, claim that Asma now travels with . at least three Republican bodyguards whenever she goes out and is . prevented from seeing any Western news, or from surfing the internet, in . case she finds coverage of the Syrian crisis ‘depressing.’ Another . critic of the regime, who cannot be named for political reasons, said: . ‘Asma still loves her shopping and buys as much as she can to keep her . mind off the chaos around her. The idea that she is under Assad’s . control and can’t leave is nonsense, but her ability to watch Western . media is strictly controlled.’ It is a far cry from March, 2011, when Vogue magazine published a . fawning piece in which the Assads were portrayed as a ‘wildly . democratic’ couple who had made Syria ‘the safest country in the Middle . East’. Dictator: US Secretary of State John Kerry branded Mr Assad a 'thug and a murderer' this week as the attacks in Syria worsened . The article, arranged and managed by . an American PR company, paid for by the Syrian government, revealed . Asma’s love of crystal-encrusted Christian Louboutin shoes and Chanel . dresses and painted her as a fragrant, caring first lady, in the style . of the late Diana, Princess of Wales. It claimed she cared about art, children, and ‘women’s issues’, and implied she was breathing new life into the region. Yet . at the time of the interview, Syrian police had just fired live rounds . and tear gas at up to 4,000 demonstrators in the southern city of Deraa. Local reports claimed hundreds of protesters were killed. The piece was pilloried and withdrawn from Vogue’s website. The author, Joan Juliet Buck, later wrote a more critical review of her visit to Damascus in Newsweek. In the family: President Assad as a child(second left) with his father and former Syrian President Hafez al-Assad (centre) She never once saw her eat, she said, and told how on one occasion, when opening a youth centre, Asma had told the assembled children it was to close for lack of funding. When the children cried in disappointment, Asma laughed. She was just testing them, she said, to see whether they ‘cared enough’ about the project she was setting up. Andrew Tabler, an American scholar who worked with Asma on the government-funded magazine Syria Today believes she is in fierce denial. ‘There are two sides to Asma Assad,’ he said. ‘She is a modern woman, definitely apart from other wives of Arab leaders. ‘But she also wants to be a princess. She’s standing by her man.’","Asma Assad, 38, orders Western food so her children don't eat Syrian cuisine all the time .

Obama, who met his wife while working at a Chicago law firm in 1989, commented on their marriage during a visit Millennium Steel Service in Princeton yesterday, according to USA Today. The 53-year-old described the First Lady, 50, as 'very patient', telling workers at the steel plant: 'Twenty-two years she's been putting up with me!' During the visit, held on what the administration dubs 'National Manufacturing Day', he also said the economy is improving, but the benefits are not as widespread as they should be.

In one, Mrs Obama is said to have even drawn up divorce papers after deciding her husband's burning political ambition was ruining their chances of domestic happiness. In 2009, veteran Washington reporter Richard Wolffe claimed that the marriage almost collapsed nine years earlier because of Obama’s political drive and the family’s shattered finances. And earlier this year, under the headline 'Obama Divorce Bombshell!', the National Enquirer claimed the Obamas' marriage had dissolved in a string of ugly fights. It said the disagreements were partly prompted by Obama taking a 'selfie' with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial.

"Tranquilised, strapped down and shut inside reinforced trucks, a group of rare elephants has been saved from what campaigners say would be certain death. The endangered African forest elephants had torn up farms and crops in villages in Ivory Coast, triggering fears that farmers would shoot them. So an animal rights charity has saved the creatures the only way possible - by driving them 250 miles away to a national park. Scroll down for video . Jumbo task: The first forest elephant to be rescued in Ivory Coast is loaded onto a huge reinforced trailer yesterday. The creatures have been forced from their habitats onto farms by logging and mining . Tranquilised: Workers from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) had to bring a crane and a giant box in which the elephants wake up - along with two litres of washing up liquid to help move them . Thankless tusk: Forest elephants are prized by poachers as the illegal ivory trade booms in countries like China . Pests: Forced out of their habitat, the creatures had torn up farms near Daloa, which has 170,000 people . Unusual cargo: Locals were fascinated, and just like in the rest of the world, they filmed it on their phones . The mission by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) was no easy task, as the dense forests of the elephants' habitat made them almost impossible to track. Just 100,000 or so of the creatures are left in the wild after logging and mining forced them from their habitats and into conflict with farmers. Unlike larger savannah elephants, they live only in the jungles of central and western Africa, torn up by wars and heavy industry. Despite weighing up to five tonnes they are not even safe in national parks, as poachers seize on the booming trade of illegal ivory to countries like China. To save the elephants yesterday experts tracked them through jungle near the town of Daloa, then shot them with tranquiliser darts. Rescue mission: The charity hopes to save about a dozen elephants in total which have settled near Daloa . Team member Neil Greenwood said: 'You are dealing with a dangerous animal. Those elephants are silent and you can literally take a corner and walk into one of those and that's where injuries and deaths will occur from' Wide load: Locals help the rescuers lift the elephant weighing up to five tonnes onto their truck using a crane . Elusive: The elephants hide in forest canopies 60 metres high, and seeing one at close quarters is rare . Operation: A truck transports another of the rescued elephants yesterday, halting traffic on a busy country road . Rescue: Once captured, the elephants are driven 250 miles away to the Azagny National Park . They had to bring chainsaws and pickaxes to hack through the trees - and two litres of washing-up liquid to slide the sleeping elephants onto a trailer. Then there was the huge crane which lifted the beasts onto a car recovery truck. Team member Dr Andre Uys said: 'There's no way we can perform a traditional elephant caputre here like we do in the savannah. Mission: Usually the rescuers use helicopters, but were thwarted by the dense African jungle . 'The primary forest canopy is 60 metres high. It makes it impossible to operate with the helicopter. It's going to be a mammoth task. His colleague Neil Greenwood added: 'You are dealing with a dangerous animal. Those elephants are silent and you can literally take a corner and walk into one of those and that's where injuries and deaths will occur from.' In all the charity hopes to rescue about a dozen elephants, which experts will rehome in the Azagny National Park and fit with GPS collars to track their movements. The Ivory Coast government pleaded for the charity's help to avoid the elephants being killed. IFAW director Céline Sissler-Bienvenu said: 'The elephant is the national emblem of . Côte d'Ivoire. This is why, at the request of the Ivorian authorities, . the villagers have shown patience so that a humane alternative to . culling could be found. 'Having examined all of the available solutions, we proposed this last resort to move the elephants to safety.' 'If we are to save these endangered elephants, we have to act now, during the dry season. This jumbo rescue mission resolves a major conservation problem and contributes to the safety and well-being of both animals and people.' The number of forest elephants is . impossible to determine exactly because the creatures are so reclusive. Instead scientists have to count the amount of dung in each area. It is not the first time the charity has run a jumbo evacuation, however. In 2009, IFAW evacuated 83 savannah elephants which were caught in deadly human-elephant conflict in Malawi. You can donate towards the mission here. Easy does it: The last stage before the elephants can be moved involves easing them into a giant steel trailer . Once they reach their destination, the elephants will be able to wake up in the boxes as the drugs wear off . IFAW director Céline Sissler-Bienvenu said: 'If we are to save these endangered elephants, we have to act now, during the dry season.' The charity is appealing for donations to help with the mission from the public .","Animals forced out by logging have clashed with farmers in Ivory Coast .

"It might not be the most likely place to find a duchess. But as Sarah Ferguson gathered in a huddle with dozens of schoolchildren around tennis star Novak Djokovic, who was busy planting trees, she looked entirely at ease. The Duchess of York was in the small Serbian town of Kadina Luka, near Ljig, with the tennis champ as the two opened a new primary school for underprivileged local children.

"Former model Simone Farrow has pleaded guilty to importing crystal methamphetamine into Australia but has denied having being the ringleader of the international drug ring. Instead, the 39-year-old has claimed in court she was unknowingly set up by some employees who had obtained complete control of her bank, phone and email accounts and ran the drug ring behind her back. Despite the former Penthouse Pet pleading guilty at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court, she has requested a contested facts hearing in an attempt to obtain a lesser sentence, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Simone Farrow has pleaded guilty to importing crystal methamphetamine into Australia while in the US pursuing her modelling career . The 39-year-old has requested a contested facts hearing. She claims some of her employees ran a drug ring under her name and behind her back . Ms Farrow's lawyer told the courtthat if buyers believed she was behind the syndicate, it was because her employees would have imitated her way of speaking in order to pass off as her. The Australian Federal Police arrested Ms Farrow in 2012 at the Gold Coast before extraditing her to Sydney. Prosecutors maintain that she controlled the drug ring while pursuing a career in the United States as Simone Starr. Prosecutors claim they have video footage of Ms Farrow smoking drugs and claimed in court she personally intimidated buyers who owed her thousands of dollars by threatening to send bikies to manhandle them. The court also heard from a number of Farrows buyers who claimed they dealt directly with her, paying her $7000 per ounce. The Australian Federal Police maintain that she is behind the international syndicate and claim to have video footage of Ms Farrow smoking drugs . A man said to be her drug dealer and whom he claims she referred to as 'dad' told the court: 'no one would [know to] call me ""dad"" [besides her] and no one would know the things we know,' the Sunday Telegraph reported. He claimed the former swimsuit model was always asking him for more money and exploited their business relationship. Mr Muratti, another witness from Melbourne who allegedly bought ice from Ms Farrow, and also claimed to have spoken directly to her.

"A candidate standing to be on the ruling council of the RSPCA has been criticised after likening the treatment of farm animals to the holocaust. Peta Watson Smith made the comments as candidates standing in the election are in the final push for votes, which have to be cast by Tuesday. But the Jewish Vegetarian Society says even though they too oppose 'factory farming', using the word holocaust will only offend and alienate people from their cause. Peta Watson Smith said some animals are being treated abysmally on farms and likened their treatment to the holocaust (file picture) Mrs Watson Smith said some animals are being treated abysmally on farms and said people weren't always aware of the 'holocaust' happening to animals. She is one of six candidates standing to be on the charity's council, with five seats available on the 25 member body. According to the RSPCA website, the council is an integral part of the charity and elected members are responsible for providing leadership and direction as well as making sure their resources are being used to benefit animal welfare. But speaking to the Times, Mrs Watson Smith said: 'I don't think people always appreciate what is the holocaust going on behind closed doors. 'You talk about the Jews. This probably sounds like animal rights, but if you recognise animals as sentient beings, why are we treating them so abysmally on farms?' But Lara Smallman director of the Jewish Vegetarian Society said that her comments will not help the vegetarian and animal cause. She added: 'We are passionate about using positive messaging to spread awareness. Our focus, therefore, is very much on highlighting the many benefits of adopting a vegetarian diet. Gavin Grant, who stood down as the chief executive of the RSPCA in February . 'Whilst we share Peta Watson Smith's opposition to factory farming, we do not believe anything positive can come from making comparisons with the holocaust. 'Using the word 'holocaust' is not going to advance the vegetarian cause, rather, it will only serve to offend, divide, and quite possibly, alienate people. 'The emphasis should always be on engaging and educating the public in a responsible and meaningful way. 'The Farmers' Union of Wales also said her comments were disrespectful to the Jewish community. The results of the RSPCA council election will be announced at the charity's annual general meeting later this month. It is thought that the election could prove to be a turning point for the charity who hope to appoint a new chief executive by early next year. In February, Gavin Grant announced he would be stepping down with immediate effect after a controversial two years in the post. Mr Grant, 59, attracted heavy criticism for the decision to spend £326,000 prosecuting the Heythrop Hunt in Oxfordshire for illegal foxhunting, the hunt David Cameron used to ride in before the ban. Critics said the ‘staggering’ expense of bringing the case at the end of 2012, which was successful, was nonetheless a waste of the money donated by members of the public. He was also under fire last year for suggesting farmers who participated in the badger cull - permitted by the government to try and control tuberculosis in cattle - should be ‘named and shamed’. His unexpected departure as chief executive was due to ‘medical concerns about his health’, the animal charity said in a statement at the time . Mrs Watson Smith's comments come after earlier this year the singer Morrissey claimed 'If you believe in the abattoir then you would support Auschwitz'. The Smiths frontman made the remark in a Q&A session on his fan site - True To You. The controversial singer has long been known as an animal rights activist.","Peta Watson Smith made comments while standing to be on RSPCA Council .

"Two schoolgirls have spoken of their ordeal after they were seduced by their teaching assistant who groomed them on Facebook. The teenagers, aged 14 and 15, admit they fell for paedophile Sam Bradley, 23, who persuaded the girls to send photographs of themselves of a sexual nature. The youngest was even coerced into sending a video footage of herself performing a sex act. After he was finally caught, it was revealed the classroom assistant had also been having sexual relationship with a former 16-year-old pupil who had recently left the South Yorkshire school. Sam Bradley seduced three pupils from his South Yorkshire school - the youngest was just 14 . Now his two youngest victims have . described the moment he contacted them through the social network site . before obtaining their mobile telephone numbers. Rebecca, now 16, whose name has been changed for legal . reasons, admits she still has feelings for the vile man who would text her from under his desk in class. 'I can't help how I feel about him. I . was just so happy he'd chosen me above all the other girls who fancied . him.' Bradley said Rebecca, who wears braces and looks younger than her age, was the prettiest girl in the year before finally getting her telephone number. At first the texts started off chatty but before long he asked the teenager to send a picture of herself in her underwear. In return, the predator would send back images of himself in an aroused state. Rebecca had no idea that he was also in contact with Gemma, who was 15 when she first got approached again through Facebook. As a present for her 16th birthday, he gave Gemma his telephone number and again requested the teenager send a picture in her underwear. She ended up going to a party at his house where she drank alcohol and endured Bradley touching her outside her clothes. In the morning she woke up to find him lying next to her in just his boxer shorts. He began touching her again, this time inside her trousers. It was only when a friend Gemma had said she was staying with called her home and her mum picked up that Bradley's life as a paedophile was exposed. Gemma's mother made her daughter explain what had been going on, at which point the school was alerted and police called. After officers confiscated Bradley's phone, it was revealed he had also been having a sexual relationship with a former pupil who was 16. Sarah, whose name has also been changed and is now 18, is still coming to terms with the fact she was seduced by a paedophile. She would meet Bradley, who she described as sex obsessed, every Wednesday for about a year. One of the things he wanted to do before he died was have a threesome, he told Sarah. 'Hearing he was getting a 14-year-old to send him pictures and videos makes me feel sick. I thought he was a player but now I know he was a paedophile. Rebecca broke down in tears as another of his victims told of how Bradley seduced her the same way . The case echoes how the schoolgirl lover of jailed teacher Jeremy Forrest fell for him. Most recently it was reported that . she had been left devastated after she was banned from making contact . with him until she reaches adulthood. The girl, who was 15 when she fled to . France with Forrest, vowed to wait for him 'for ever' when he was . jailed in June and has made several attempts to contact him in prison. The teenagers' parents now face picking up the devastation caused to these girls' lives. Rebecca's mother, 35, said: 'Sam has taken away my daughter's innocence. That's something we can never get back. Bradley was jailed for three years at Sheffield Crown Court last month after admitting eight offences - one of sexual activity with a child, three of making indecent images, two of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust and two of causing a girl to engage in sexual activity.

"The U.S Air Force’s highly secret unmanned space plane was supposed to stay in space for nine months, but it’s now been there for a year and three days – and no one knows what it’s doing. The experimental craft has been circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour and was due to land in California in December. However the mission of the X-37B orbital test vehicle was extended – for unknown reasons. Mystery tour: The mission of the X-37B space plane was extended after it spent nine months orbiting the Earth . The plane resembles a mini space shuttle and is the second to fly in space. The first one landed last December at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California after more than seven months in orbit. The 29-foot, solar-powered craft had an original mission of 270 days. The Air Force said the second mission was to further test the technology but the ultimate purpose has largely remained a mystery. The vehicle's systems program director, Lieutenant-colonel Tom McIntyre, told the Los Angeles Times in December: 'We initially planned for a nine-month mission. Keeping the X-37 in orbit will provide . us with additional experimentation opportunities and allow us to extract . the maximum value out of the mission.' Questions: The unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the U.S. Air Force - but its purpose has never fully been explained . Finishing touches: Scientists in protective suits inspect the solar-powered craft prior to its mission . However, many sceptics think that the vehicle's mission is defence or spy-related. There are rumours circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new Chinese space station, Tiangong. However, analysts have pointed out . that surveillance would be tricky, since the spacecraft would rush . past each other at thousands of metres per second. Preparing for lift off: The Air Force said the craft is being used to test space technology but there have been suggestions it is being used to spy . Keeping watch: An artist's rendition of the X-37B shuttle orbiting the Earth . And Brian Weeden, from the Secure World . Foundation, pointed out to the BBC: ‘If the U.S. really wanted to . observe Tiangong, it has enough assets to do that without using X-37B.’ Last May, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which . included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for . surveillance. Other industry analysts have . speculated that the Air Force is just making use of the X-37B’s amazing . fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show . off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts. Enlarge . This undated image released by the U.S. Air Force shows the X-37B spacecraft. Its mission and cost are shrouded in secrecy .

After all, under budget cuts for 2013 to 2017 proposed by the Obama administration, the office that developed . the X-37 will be shut down. According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 and 500 miles above earth. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles.

"More and more people have been going on vegan detoxes since Beyonce and Jay-Z announced they were giving up eating animal products for 22 days . We have all heard of ‘Dry January’ but now some people are taking New Year’s resolutions a step further and giving up all animal products for a month. A growing number of people are swapping to a vegan diet for a few weeks each year in a bid to ‘cleanse’ their bodies. The diet gained popularity after singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z went vegan for 22 days at the end of 2013. The Vegan Society says more and more people are now signing up to ‘Veganuary’, the BBC reports. It says 40 per cent more people followed the diet in the first two months of 2013 than in the first two months of 2012. People adopt the diet temporarily for a range of reasons, including to shed their excess Christmas pounds and to detox. Juliet Gellatley, director of the vegan and vegetarian group Viva, says most people do it either because of health concerns or because they have developed greater awareness of animal rights. She told the BBC: ‘People might be prone to heart disease or want to get their cholesterol down. ‘Or it might be because they've seen something on factory farming. But once people turn to veganism, they usually open their minds to the other issue too. ‘The third factor, which is more unusual, is environmental reasons such as global warning or deforestation.’ The Vegan Society estimates that about 150,000 people in the UK are vegan. This means they don't eat anything that comes from an animal: fish, meat or anything containing animal fats. They also avoid dairy products such as cows’ milk, cheese and yoghurt and also eggs or products containing eggs. One person to go vegan for a month is Rachel Hollos, a marketing director from London. She says she is doing ‘Veganuary’ for the health benefits after reading that people do not really need dairy products and that cows’ milk contains hormones that put human hormones out of sync. Venus Williams says her overall health has improved dramatically since she stopped eating animal products . She says the diet is easy to follow during the week but that she struggles when eating out at weekends. She also admitted to missing the cakes and chocolates she had to give up because they contain butter, eggs or milk. Ms Hollos said the diet makes her feel more energetic and less bloated but that it has also left her feeling hungry. A vegan diet is primarily made up of grains, beans, fruits and vegetables. Vegans do not eat anything that comes from an animal. Therefore, they do not eat fish, meat or anything containing animal fats. They also avoid dairy products such as cows’ milk, cheese and yoghurt. They do not eat eggs or products containing eggs. They also avoid foods processed using animal products - such as refined white sugar and some wines. They . tend not to wear clothes made from animals - such as leather and wool - . and using beauty products and medicines that have been tested on . animals. Ms Gellatley says people, especially men, used to be macho in their desire to eat meat but that many influential men are now admitting they believe a vegan diet is healthier. She says this is making the diet more socially acceptable. As a result, she explained there has been a ‘seismic shift in attitude’ towards going vegan and that it is ‘no longer seen as alien’. The increasing acceptability of a vegan diet has been fuelled by a number of celebrities admitting they have adopted it. Tennis ace Venus Williams says her overall health has improved dramatically since she stopped eating animal products. She has Sjogren's syndrome, an auto-immune illness that causes muscular pain and fatigue, and giving up meat, she says, has eradicated the worst symptoms, including joint pain and swelling. But she recently said: 'I think it's pretty well known that I'm a cheagan (a vegan who occasionally eats meat). I'm not perfect but I try.' British singer Leona Lewis has also announced she has become a vegan. Increasing evidence suggests a vegan diet has health benefits for everyone- from easing painful creaky joints to lowering cholesterol and boosting heart health. People who eat a lot of red meat are more likely to develop arthritis, they are also at greater risk of high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease. But some experts argue there are many nutrients we can only get from meat - and that a vegan or vegetarian diet can have serious implications for our health. For example, some people believe vegans risk a deficiency in vitamin B12 - which is crucial for maintaining energy levels - and in protein which is essential for maintaining muscle health.","More and more people are now doing 'Veganuary' - giving up animal products for the whole of January in a bid to 'cleanse' their bodies .

"A 10-year-old schoolgirl died after being shot as she was walking home from a bible study class in Egypt. Jessi Boulus died from the single shot to the chest as she made her way through the streets of Cairo on Tuesday. Her death is yet another example of rising tensions against Christians in the country after supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood started to target Egypt's Christian minority, holding them partly responsible for his removal. Attack: In April footage emerged of men shooting guns, wielding machetes and hurling stones laid siege to the Coptic cathedral in Cairo . In the grainy footage from earlier this year a man is seen wielding a machete before he is filmed attacking the church . Jessi's mother told the BBC News she believes her daughter was targeted due to her religion. 'She was my best friend, my everything. Jessi was just becoming a young woman,' she said. 'Every woman dreams of becoming a mother, and for 10 years I was lucky enough to be a mum. I'll miss Jessi calling me mum - I know I won't ever hear it again.' Jessi's father told the website:  'Jessi was everything to us. Her . killers didn't know that Jessi was my life - my future. They killed our . future. I lived for her. We both did.' Her parents said that they had noticed rising tensions in recent months and had discussed emigrating but had decided to stay in Egypt as it was their home. Clashes: Egyptian Coptic Christians women mourn during the funeral service for four Christians killed in sectarian clashes in Al-Khusus at al-Abbassiya Cathedral in Cairo, Egypt, in April . Aggression: Egyptians throw stones towards Coptic Christians in April . Tension: Clashes began in and around the Cathedral grounds after a funeral procession for two coptic protesters . In April, a Muslim mob attacked the main cathedral of the Coptic Orthodox Church as Christians held a funeral and protested there over four Christians killed in sectarian violence the day before. Pope Tawadros II publicly blamed Morsi for failing to protect the building. Egyptian security forces stood by during a brutal attack on Coptic Christians in Luxor days after Mohamed Morsi’s removal, according to Amnesty International. Accusations: The leader of Egypt's Coptic Christians Pope Tawadros II accused police of not helping Christians . During the 18-hour-long attack on 5 July, the security forces left six besieged Coptic Christian men - four of whom were then killed and one hospitalised - to the mercy of an angry crowd. An angry mob armed with metal bars, knives, tree branches and hammers attacked Christian homes and businesses in Nagah Hassan, 11 miles west of Luxor, after the dead body of a Muslim man was discovered near the homes of Christian families. Despite local residents’ and religious leaders’ repeated calls for help, security forces on the scene made only half-hearted attempts to end the violence and sufficient reinforcements failed to arrive. The violence began at 3am, shortly after the Muslim man’s body was found in the vicinity of Christian homes. His family blamed the death on a . local Coptic Christian and by mid-day more than 100 Christian homes had . been attacked, with scores of them looted or torched. Local residents . reported calling the police and army’s hotlines throughout the day in . vain, and local religious leaders also approached security officials. The . attack went on for 18 hours, and there was not a door on which I did . not knock: police, army, local leaders, the Central Security Forces, the . Governorate. Nothing was done,'said Father Barsilious, a local priest . from Dab’iya. The . security forces evacuated women and children trapped inside a house . surrounded by an angry mob but left six men behind, apparently following . demands from the crowd that the men remain. Four of the abandoned men . were later stabbed and/or beaten to death and another required hospital . treatment. Three other Christian men were hospitalised in separate violent incidents. One woman said she had begged police officers to save her sons who were left behind, but they ignored her pleas: . 'I kissed the police officer’s hands and legs and begged him to protect my two sons and take them out … he completely ignored me and said he would only take women and children ... I buried my two sons in one day,'she said. Other female relatives said they had given men their abayas (gowns) to try to disguise them as women so that they could escape.

"A cement truck driver is lucky to be alive after the coastal highway he was driving on in Mexico cracked and sunk some 300 feet down a mountainside into the sea near the U.S. border. The driver was rescued by heavy machinery before his truck, along with a 300-yard section of the road, which leads to port city Ensenada on the Baja California peninsula, slid into the Pacific Ocean. While it remains unclear what caused the landslide, fractures in the Tijuana-Ensenada toll road were seen after several small earthquakes ranging from 1.3 to 4.3 in magnitude shook the area on December 19, according to some media reports. By Saturday morning huge cracks appeared in the cliff-side, exacerbated by heavy rain, before it slid into the sea. Scroll down for video . Cliff-side cracks: A cement truck driver was rescued from his vehicle after huge section of the Tijuana-Ensenada toll road cracked and slid 300 feet into the Pacific Ocean . The landslide caused gaping holes, one more than 40 feet deep and 200 feet long. The collapse occurred about 58 miles south of the American border, closing the scenic road near the San Miguel toll booth. Some media reports suggest that the road may remain closed for up to a year with vehicles advised to use a smaller, alternate freeway. Fault line: Days before the road collapsed, several small earthquakes were recorded in the area and cracks started to appear in the road . Caved-in construction: The landslide caused gaping holes in the road up to 40 feet deep and 200 feet long . Gilberto Hirata, the mayor of Ensenada, has blamed the national road authority CAPUFE for not closing the road sooner after pictures and reports of fractures were posted on social media according to SanDiego6.com. He also said that discussions were underway to build a replacement highway after years of recurring damage on the route. The day before the landslide, the road authority and the Ministry of Communications and Transport announced that work to strengthen the asphalt had begun on sections of the troublesome highway in sloped areas according to El Mexicano. The road closure could prove devastating for Ensenada which is home to the third busiest cruise ship terminal in Mexico and the major access point to Baja by sea. Delayed reaction? The mayor of Ensenada blamed the road authority for not acting sooner after pictures and reports of cracks in the road were posted on social media days before the collapse .

"New laws aimed at reducing the suffering of millions of chickens in abattoirs have been put on hold by the Government after Muslims complained they would undermine their rights to slaughter the birds according to Islamic rituals. To the dismay of animal welfare groups, the laws were unexpectedly delayed just days before they were due to be implemented last month. Senior vets and campaigners said that the delay was ‘outrageous’ and some have now threatened to report ministers to the European Commission for failing to implement  the EU-wide rules. Masood Khwaja, a Muslim food consultant, said: 'In order to meet the religious requirements of halal, light stunning should be done but not enough to kill the animal' They would have forced many abattoirs to use a more powerful electric shock than they do now to stun chickens before they are killed. The move follows research that suggests that many birds are still conscious and suffer pain when they are slaughtered, but that higher levels of shock would guarantee they were insensible. However, Muslim leaders said that the new levels could kill birds before they could be slaughtered, meaning they would no longer be halal. According to Islamic rituals, the birds have to be alive when their throats are slit so their hearts are still pumping and their blood is properly drained. For meat to be halal the slaughter must be performed by a male Muslim who precedes slaughter by invoking the name of Allah and then saying three times Allahu akbar. The animal must be slaughtered by cutting the throat, windpipe and the blood vessels in the neck, causing the animal's death without cutting the spinal cord . Halal producers had been planning a judicial review to try to prevent the Government implementing the new laws after the Halal Food Authority, which certifies abattoirs that follow the correct rituals, warned they may be forced to abandon all pre-stunning of chickens. The Department for Environment halted the new Welfare Of Animals At The Time Of Killing rules on  May 19. A spokesman said last night: ‘We realised that our regulations might have unintended consequences in that they could limit religious freedoms. 'This is a complex area and we need to get it right.’ The spokesman stressed that ‘robust’ existing regulations surrounding welfare remained in place. British Veterinary Association president Robin Hargreaves, who campaigns for better conditions in abattoirs, said: ‘Failure to implement the new regulations risks a percentage of chickens being ineffectively stunned, thus compromising animal welfare.’ A spokesman for the Compassion in World Farming pressure group said the decision meant thousands of chickens could daily be enduring ‘horrific’ deaths. Some supermarkets stock halal food as do some restaurants like Subway and Pizza Express . ‘It is outrageous for the Government to beat about the bush while chickens are suffering illegal slaughter,’ he added. Norman Bagley of the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, which represents halal producers, said that he welcomed the delay as there was no evidence the present system used in abattoirs was inadequate. Masood Khwaja, a Muslim food consultant, said: ‘In order to meet the religious requirements of halal, light stunning should be done but not enough to kill the animal.’ There have been problems in implementing the new law in some EU countries, including Germany, but others such as Denmark have taken a tough line.","Campaigners have  threatened to report ministers to European Commission for not implementing the EU-wide rules .

"'Yes it is real': Canon Andrew White, pictured, has seen atrocities from inside Iraq . I have just returned from a secret visit to Qaraqosh – once the largest Christian town in Iraq, but no longer. Today, Qaraqosh stands 90 per cent empty, desecrated by the gunmen of the fanatical Islamic State terror group now in control. The majority of the town’s 50,000 people have fled, fearing that, like other Christians in this region, they will be massacred. The militants, in a further act of sacrilege, have established their administrative posts in the abandoned churches. My visit, under the noses of the gunmen, was frightening – but that is nothing to the terror of the poor souls left behind. Since I went to St George’s Anglican church in Baghdad in 2003 – the only Anglican church in the city – I have seen countless terrible things. Many of my congregation have been killed or mutilated in the years of violence. But I have never witnessed anything on the scale, or which has affected me quite so dreadfully as on this visit to the north of Iraq. In the nearby city of Irbil, I found many of those Christians who had fled. Some 30,000 refugees are packed into the Kurdish capital, forming a new Christian suburb. I spoke to one woman who had survived the massacres in Qaraqosh. She had a bandaged left hand. When IS soldiers could not remove her gold wedding ring, they had simply hacked off her finger. She wept as she told me. The refugees are now penniless, robbed of their homes and possessions. Christian houses were daubed with the letter ‘N’ for Nazere and given to Muslim families. I met Hana, who used to be the caretaker of my church in Baghdad, and fought to stay dry-eyed as he told me the fate of his youngest son, aged five. The boy was chopped in half in front of Hana’s eyes during an IS attack. Hunted: Iraqi Christians - whose ties to the land are ancient - have been hounded from their homes and threatened with death if they do not convert . The family had moved north to Qaraqosh when Hana, who was a founding member of my church, retired. I baptised his remaining children there in Irbil. The murdered little boy had been named Andrew, after me. I cry now every time I think of him. People say to me: ‘Is it really as terrible as this? Can these atrocities be real?’ I tell them: ‘Yes. It is as real and terrible as this.’ Qaraqosh has become a place of terror. Its people were shot and some – already dead – were ‘crucified’, a final humiliation and an outrage against the individual, and the faith they had refused to abandon. I am sorry to say that I have seen the pictures printed on these pages, and am sickened. Now Irbil fears it too will fall to the Islamists, as they expand what they claim is a new caliphate. And without Irbil there is no hope for the Christians. They are running out of places to go. What is happening in northern Iraq is almost unimaginable. Part of my purpose on this journey was to help feed and clothe this desperate population, using £300,000 from the Anglican Church in the UK, and other generous individuals. Persecuted: Iraqi Christian families forced to flee their home shelter in the St. Joseph Church in Irbil, northern Iraq . Yet it feels that we are alone. Where is the response of the British Government? We have seen nothing on the ground. Members of the worldwide Anglican Communion are praying over this devastating situation. But there is a desperate need for practical action, too: these people need mattresses, clothes, blankets and food. Children are starving. Families are crammed into churches to sleep on the floors. We must also ask: ‘What next?’ Iraq’s Christians can’t stay in Kurdistan forever. At some point they must be rescued and relocated. They will flee to Turkey, then Canada, Australia or America. Britain has said it will not take one Iraqi refugee. The people of this region have had their homes burned and destroyed before. Each time the Christians have survived and fought back, returning to rebuild desecrated churches and their lives. It is hard to see, however, that this will happen this time. Where is their protection? It is a terrible thing to wish, but I now believe that military action of some sort is necessary, if only to reduce the movement of IS tanks, their soldiers, and their power and authority on the ground. Even this is not the solution in the long run. We need money, and we need prayer. Without those we have nothing.

"Boiling water attack: A teenage boy poured boiling water over a schoolgirl's face after she un-friended him on Facebook just weeks before . A schoolgirl has suffered severe burns after an older boy poured boiling water over her face because she un-friended him on Facebook. The boy broke into the teenage girl’s house and locked her and her mother in a room before attacking the girl with a pot of boiling water in the city of Muzaffarpur in northern Bihar, India yesterday. Just weeks before the attack the girl had un-friended him on the social networking site because he starting posting strange comments on her Facebook wall. While he held the mother and daughter captive, he boiled some water in the kitchen then proceeded to pour it over the girl’s face. Police have now begun a manhunt for the boy, an intermediate student, who fled the scene. The pair became friends on Facebook about a year ago until early December when he started acting weirdly toward her on social media. The victim, an Indian class eight student, was taken to a local hospital for treatment. In another case of Facebook stalking, earlier this month handyman Jonathon Swift, 32, had his prison sentence for stalking his ex-girlfriend extended after he threatened to kill her in front of a judge. Swift, from Longton in Stoke-on-Trent, subjected Carrie-Ann Lockett, 29, to an eight-month campaign of harassment which saw him steal her clothes and set them on fire, send her hundreds of texts and log onto her Facebook account to look through her messages. The pair had been friends who met at school and struck up a relationship in February last year after they got back in touch through Facebook.

Long, who has won 12 gold medals at . three Paralympics, was born without heels, ankles and fibulas as well as . most of the bones in her feet, a condition known as fibular hemimelia. Her legs were amputated when she was just 18-months-old and she learned . to walk with prostheses. Before she met her parents in Siberia, Long visited the orphanage in Bratsk on the trip she called ‘life changing moments’. Natalia and Oleg had their second daughter Nastya a year after Long and despite being born with a similar condition, infantile cerebral paralysis, but they decided to keep her. They also now have twins, a boy and a girl. Long's mother works as a cleaner in the village school and Oleg drives a logging truck. During their reunion, Natalia gave her daughter the local delicacy of pickled cucumbers. Long gave her mother a necklace and a Russian-language bible to Oleg, her father. Long was just 12-years-old and the youngest competitor on the U.S. Paralympic team when she won three gold medals at the 2004 Paralympic Games in Greece. She is currently the world record holder in 13 Paralympic events.","Long travelled to the Siberian village of Tem to meet her biological family for the first time .

"Despite having never canoed before, an adventurous student travelled a gruelling 3,000 miles across Europe with a friend in a two-man boat. Nathan Wilkins, 21, and friend James Warner-Smith, 22, completed their epic 21-week journey from Nantes in France to Istanbul in Turkey. They believe they may be the first to ever cross Europe purely by water, travelling through ten countries in their £1,500 two-man canoe. Conquering by canoe: Two students have travelled almost 3,000 miles across Europe in their two-man canoe, passing landmarks such as the parliament building on the River Danube in Budapest, Hungary . Mr Wilkins, a law graduate from Kent, said: ‘We didn't do much training. I had never . been in a canoe until two weeks before the trip and had never camped . until our first night. ‘It was such a long trip but a great experience. I really enjoyed it and I missed it straight away when we got back. The University of Warwick graduates . travelled a total of 2,954 miles in 146 gruelling days which included a . run in with Bulgarian police and travelling across a military firing . range. Intrepid travellers: (Right to left) James Warner-Smith and Nathan Wilkins, who had never canoed before, believe they could be the first to ever cross Europe purely by water in their gruelling 21-week trip . Tough challenge: Mr Warner-Smith (pictured in front of a vineyard on the River Main in Germany) said there was no easy passage across Europe and had to take many detours and routes to reach their destination . Mr Wilkins said: ‘It was challenging every day and my favourite part was that we did such a variety of things and met a lot of funny and helpful people who helped us with directions. ‘We managed to stay friends throughout which surprised a lot of people. ‘I loved the Danube River but my favourite country was France as the food was so good. I did not like Romania - the whole experience there just gave me a bad experience of the place. ‘I start a job in London soon so I don't think we will be doing another trip unfortunately.’ Serene seas: The young men canoed through the Black Sea Canal in Romania at sunrise . Adventure of a lifetime: Mr Wilkins had hardly done any canoeing before their trip and had never camped before which saw them travelling through the Rhone-Rhine Canal in France (pictured) In Bulgaria the pair accidentally walked across a naval firing range. Mr Wilkins said: ‘It is probably the funniest story of the trip but quite scary. ‘We went out to test the water to see if it was too stormy to paddle. It was bad and dangerous so we stopped and pulled over to get out the boat. ‘Unfortunately we got out and walked across a military firing range. We got into a lot of trouble for that and had to get a local to bail us out.’ Plenty of stories: The students accidentally walked across a military firing range in Bulgaria where police caught up with them (right Mr Wilkins pictured) and through many places where most travellers would not normally go such as entering a lock on the River Saone in France (left) Tricky navigating: The students met many interesting people along the way who gave them directions when their trusty map failed them (pictured Mr Warner-Smith on the River Danube in Serbia) The young men travelled through France, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. Mr Warner-Smith, a philosophy graduate from Hertfordshire, said: ‘I thought it would be an interesting challenge. It was incredibly tough but we loved it. ‘Neither of us had much canoeing experience although I did a trip in Canada in 2010. ‘With few connecting rivers there is no easy passage across Europe by canoe so it made it a real challenge. We had to go out of direction so many times to stay on the water. The route we undertook is a network of rivers and canals with hundreds of miles to battle upstream as well as challenging coastlines and industrial locks to overcome. ‘I enjoyed it and would do it again. There are so many funny memories.’ The duo secured sponsorship from the Lord Rootes Memorial Fund at Warwick University to pay for their trip, which cost more than £6,000. Would do it again: Despite the challenges, Mr Warner-Smith said he would do the epic trip again if he could . Best buddies: Mr Wilkins (left having some lunch in Hungary) said he missed the adventure as soon as he returned home to Kent and the pair (right en route) managed to stay friends throughout their adventure he said .

"Announcement: Barack Obama said his new policy on immigration was 'the right thing to do' Barack Obama’s decision to allow up to allow up to 800,000 young illegal immigrants to remain in America has divided Republicans and was met with silence by his 2012 opponent Mitt Romney for nearly six hours. The Obama administration’s announcement that it would stop deporting and begin granting work permits to younger illegal immigrants who came to the US as children and have led law-abiding lives caught Romney by surprise. Eventually, Romney came out and said in almost conciliatory language that he believed Obama had addressed an ‘important matter’ with a short-term measure but the way it had been done ‘makes it more difficult to reach that long-term solution. He said that he supported a statement by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had been working on a proposal that Obama appeared to have hijacked. Romney’s belated and muted reaction underlined just what a bind Republicans had been placed in. Speaking in the Rose Garden about the announcement, Obama said it was a ‘just’ thing to do but not a permanent solution to the immigration issue. ‘This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It is not a permanent fix.’ By bypassing Congress and acting via executive order, Obama’s move is designed to tie Romney to an unpopular Capitol Hill as well as courting Latino voters, a key bloc in swing states like Florida, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado. With some conservative sympathetic to Rubio’s proposal, not yet formally presented, and other against it, the Obama administration’s surprise announcement laid bare a split in the Republican party. In a measured statement, Rubio, of Cuban parentage and a leading vice-presidential candidate for the Romney ticket, said it was ‘welcome news for many of these kids desperate for an answer’ but Obama was guilty of ‘ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress’. Obama’s executive order was a ‘short term answer to a long term problem’, he added. ‘There is broad support for the idea that we should figure out a way to help kids who are undocumented through no fault of their own, but there is also broad consensus that it should be done in a way that does not encourage illegal immigration in the future. ‘This is a difficult balance to strike, one that this new policy, imposed by executive order, will make harder to achieve in the long run.’ Mandate: The President, speaking in the Rose Garden at the White House had used executive order to bypass Congress . Supporters; Immigration activists gather in front of the White House to celebrate the announcement . Rick Santorum, runner up to Romney in . the Republican primaries blasted Obama. ‘Here we are again on a Friday . afternoon on a quiet summer weekend with no one paying attention and . President Obama announces yet another abuse of power - a decision to . stop deporting and grant work permits to nearly one million immigrants . who entered or remained in the United States illegally as children,’ he . said. Representative Steve King of Iowa, a . favourite among conservative hardliners, said the change in the law . ‘signifies to potential illegal aliens that border agents will turn a . blind eye’. Senator Lindsey Graham of South . Carolina, said via twitter: ‘President Obama’s attempt to go around . Congress and the American people is at best unwise and possibly . illegal.’ He added: ‘This type of policy proposal, regardless of motivation, will entice people to break our laws.’ Emotional: Lorena Tule-Romain, right, wipes tears away after Obama's announcement on immigration . Joy: Undocumented UCLA students who came to the US as children celebrate after hearing the announcement on the day of their graduation . Obama’s order bypasses Congress and . partially achieves the goals of the so-called DREAM Act, a long-sought . but never enacted plan to establish a path toward citizenship for young . people who came to the United States illegally as children but who . attend college or join the military. It came a week before Obama’s address . the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials' annual conference in Orlando, Florida. Romney is due to speak there on . Thursday. Under the administration plan, . illegal immigrants will be immune from deportation if they were brought . to the US before age 16 and are younger than 30, have been in the . country for at least five continuous years, have no criminal history, . graduated from a US high school or earned a GED, or served in the . military. Should illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children but now lead law-abiding lives be allowed to stay? Should illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children but now lead law-abiding lives be allowed to stay? Now share your opinion . They also can apply for a work permit that will be good for two years with no limits on how many times it can be renewed. Janet Napolitano, Homeland Security . Secretary, said in a memorandum: ‘Many of these young people have . already contributed to our country in significant ways, Prosecutorial . discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially . justified here.' The policy will not lead toward . citizenship but will remove the threat of deportation and grant the . ability to work legally, leaving eligible immigrants able to remain in . the US for extended periods. Obama's extraordinary move comes in an election year in which the Hispanic vote . could be critical in swing states like Colorado, Nevada and Florida. While Obama enjoys support from a majority of Hispanic voters, Latino . enthusiasm for the president has been tempered by the slow economic . recovery, his inability to win congressional support for a broad . overhaul of immigration laws and by his administration's aggressive . deportation policy. Activists opposing his deportation . policies last week mounted a hunger strike at an Obama campaign office . in Denver, and other protests were planned for this weekend. Campaign trail: Republican Presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was at an event in Scamman Farm, New Hampshire, today . Significant pause? Romney did not use the opportunity to speak about Obama's immigration announcement . The change is likely to cause an outcry from congressional Republicans, who are sure to perceive Obama's actions as an end run around them. Republicans already have complained that previous administration uses of prosecutorial discretion in deportations amount to back-door amnesty. Romney and many Republican lawmakers want tighter border security measures before considering changes in immigration law. Romney opposes offering legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college but has said he would do so for those who serve in the armed forces. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last . month found Obama leading Romney among Hispanic voters 61 percent to 27 . percent. But his administration's deportation policies have come under . fire, and Latino leaders have raised the subject in private meetings . with the president. In 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement . deported a record 396,906 people and is expected to deport about 400,000 . this year. Plan: Obama's policy is the same proposed by Senator Marco Rubio . A December poll by the Pew Hispanic . Center showed that 59 percent of Latinos disapproved of the president's . handling of deportations. The . changes come a year after the administration announced plans to focus . on deporting serious criminals, immigrants who pose threats to public . safety and national security, and serious immigration law violators. One . of the officials said the latest policy change is just another step in . the administration's evolving approach to immigration. Under . the plan, immigrants whose deportation cases are pending in immigration . court will have to prove their eligibility for a reprieve to ICE, which . will begin dealing with such cases in 60 days. Any immigrant who . already has a deportation order and those who never have been . encountered by immigration authorities will deal with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The . exact details of how the program will work, including how much . immigrants will have to pay to apply and what proof they will need, . still are being worked out. In . making it harder to deport, the Obama administration is in essence . employing the same eligibility requirements spelled out in the proposed . DREAM Act. The . administration officials stopped short of calling the change an . administrative DREAM Act — the name is an acronym for Development, . Relief and Education for Alien Minors — but the qualifications meet . those laid out in a 2010 version that failed in the Senate after passing . in the House. They said the DREAM Act, in some form, and comprehensive . overhaul of the immigration system remained an administration priority. Illegal . immigrant children won't be eligible to apply for the deportation . waiver until they turn 16, but the officials said younger children won't . be deported either. Last . year, Napolitano announced plans to review about 300,000 pending . deportation cases and indefinitely suspend those that didn't meet . department priorities. So far, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has . reviewed more than 232,000 cases and decided to stop working on about . 20,000. About 4,000 of those 20,000 have opted to keep fighting in court . to stay in the United States legally. For the people who opted to close . their cases, work permits are not guaranteed.","Obama: This is not amnesty, this is not immunity... this is right thing to do .

"Children who play video games for less than an hour a day are better adjusted than those who have never used them or play them to excess. Researchers found that young people who indulged in a short spell of gaming were very sociable and were most likely to say they were satisfied with their lives. In contrast, those who spent more than half their free time playing electronic games were less well-adjusted, the University of Oxford scientists found. Better adjusted: Researchers found that young people who indulged in a little video game playing (illustrated with a stock image) were very sociable and were also most likely to say they were satisfied with their lives . The study, published today in the journal Pediatrics, found that three in four British children and teenagers play video games on a daily basis. Those who play for less than an hour a day - less than one third of their daily free time - also appeared to have fewer friendship and emotional problems. They also reported less hyperactivity than the other groups. Researchers found that young people who indulged in short spells of video game playing were very sociable. Those . who played for less than an hour a day were also most likely to say . they were satisfied with their lives, compared to those who have not . played the games. They also appeared to have fewer friendship and emotional problems and reported less hyperactivity than the other groups. Young people who spent more than half their daily free time playing electronic games were less well-adjusted. Experts found that video games had no positive . or negative effects for young people who played ‘moderately’ - i.e. between one and three hours a day. The research is thought to be the first to examine both the positive and negative effects of gaming using a representative sample of children and teenagers. It involved nearly 5,000 young people - half male and half female - drawn from a nationally representative study of UK households. The participants, aged from 10 . to 15, were asked how much time they typically spent on console-based or . computer-based games such as the Nintendo Wii or Sony PlayStation. The same group also answered questions . about how satisfied they were with their lives, their levels of . hyperactivity and inattention, empathy, and how they got on with their . peers. The findings show that the influence of . video games on children - whether for good or bad - is very small when . compared with more enduring factors, such as whether the child is from a . functioning family, their school relationships and whether they are . materially deprived. Sociable: Those who played video games for less than an hour a day - which made up less than one third of their daily free time - appeared to have fewer friendship and emotional problems (stock image) ‘These results support recent laboratory-based experiments that have identified the downsides to playing electronic games,' said the study's author, Dr Andrew Przybylski, of the Oxford Internet Institute. ‘However, high levels of video game-playing appear to be only weakly linked to children's behavioural problems in the real world. 'Likewise, the small, positive effects we observed for low levels of play on electronic games do not support the idea that video games on their own can help children develop in an increasingly digital world. ‘Some of the positive effects identified in past gaming research were mirrored in these data but the effects were quite small, suggesting that any benefits may be limited to a narrow range of action games.'","These young people were 'very sociable and more satisfied with life'

"Only a handful of participants actually make it, out of around fifty people a week who take on the challenge . The chicken is laced with the infamous 'Naga Viper' chilli . It may sound like a breeze at just six chicken wings in 10 minutes - but Britain's hottest 'hot-wing challenge' is so tough participants must sign a waiver before taking part. Each wing is laced with the infamous Naga Viper chilli - a pepper 250 times hotter than a jalapeno. Around 50 diners take on the challenge, and, like Tomasz Piatkowsk pictured here, must sign a waiver-form before they brave the feat. Tomasz Piatkowski takes on the chilli chicken wings challenge at Red Dog Saloon on Hoxton Square . It registers a huge 1.3m on the Scoville scale for chilli heat and is so corrosive it has to be handled with gloves. The challenge is a mainstay on the menu at the Red Dog Saloon in Hoxton, London. Owner Tom Berk said the recipe - which also contains garlic, lime, orange and butter - was inspired by 'taste, adrenaline and euphoria'. Tomasz Piatkowski signs a waiver form before he takes on the chilli challenge . 'There are very specific rules for the Hot Wings Challenge, which are the same for everybody and which we are very tough on,' he said. 'There are six hot wings and 10 minutes to eat them. 'By eating them you have to pick them up and eat them off the bone - you are not allowed to remove the meat from the bone first. 'You are not allowed to leave the table, you are not allowed anything to drink. 'Once you have eaten the wings we stop the clock and start a fresh clock and there is a five minute burn-time where the same rules apply. 'You do all that and you become a champion.' Out of all the people who take on the hot wings challenge each week, only about two or three succeed. The restaurant's other challenge is 'The Devastator Challenge'. This pits hungry diners against an 8in burger, large fries and milkshake in 10 minutes.","Only a handful of participants actually make it, out of around fifty people a week who take on the challenge .

"President Obama has reiterated that he stands by the decision to exchange five Taliban prisoners for the release of Bowe Bergdahl and 'would do it again' as sources have revealed that the American soldier was physically abused while in captivity. The latest insight into the five years Bergdahl was held as a prisoner by the Taliban comes from an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity as the 28-year-old is treated in an American military hospital in Germany. The unidentified official told CNN that Bergdahl tried to escape from his captors but was caught and forced into a cage or box as punishment. Making a break for it: Bowe Bergdahl was physically abused during his captivity and tried to escape twice during the five years he was held by the Taliban . The Daily Beast revealed that Bergdahl attempted to escape twice in his five year ordeal, and once in 2011 he was briefly successful because his captors had stopped paying close attention to him. He reportedly was on his own for three days after fleeing their hold, though he was eventually found in a trench that he had dug with his bare hands. 'He fought like a boxer,' a Taliban source told The Daily Beast, who added that he was eventually overpowered and then dragged back to their compound in shackles. President Obama has repeatedly defended his administration's decision to strike a deal with the terror group in order to orchestrate Bergdahl's release. 'We have a rule, a principle, that when . somebody wears our country’s uniform and they’re in a war theater and . they’re captured, we’re gonna do everything we can to bring ’em home and . we saw an opportunity and we took it,' he told NBC's . Brian Williams during an interview that was held at the World War II . cemetery in Normandy, France on the anniversary of D-Day. 'I make no apologies for it. Standing by his decision: President Obama said that the Bergdahl exchange came as a result of American principles that dictate that no soldier should be left on the battlefield . Opening up: The President was interviewed following the D-Day anniversary celebrations in Normandy . 'It was a unanimous decision among my principals in my government and a view that was shared by members of the joint chiefs of staff. 'This is something that I would do again and I will continue to do wherever I have an opportunity. If I have a member of our military is in captivity- we're going to try to get 'em out.' One of the biggest criticisms of the approval process was that a key group of congressional leaders who are typically notified before such significant international deals are struck was kept in the dark about the Bergdahl negotiation. 'The main concern was that we had to act fast in a delicate situation that required no publicity,' Obama said. 'The fact is we are ending the war in Afghanistan. We have released- both under my administration and previous administrations- a large number of former Taliban fighters, some of whom returned to the battlefield. But by definition, you don't do prisoner exchanges with your friends, you do them with your enemies.'","Bowe Bergdahl was forced into a box or cage when he was caught after trying to escape .

"A man who claims to suffer from an extremely rare medical condition in which he was born with two penises has posted a picture online, attracting thousands of questions. The anonymous man - who goes by the moniker 'DoubleD*ckDude' - spent more than six hours answering questions online after uploading the pictures to Reddit. He claimed to suffer from a condition known as diphallia - where a boy is born with two fully-functioning penises, each capable of operating independently from the other - and included two pictures with the time and date. Posted on forum: the anonymous man spent six hours answering questions after he posted this photograph on Reddit of his penile duplication . The condition affects around one in every six million boys in the U.S. but most have one removed at an early age. When he was asked how people react to his condition, he replied: ‘It varies from girl to girl. ‘Some have been like “wow”. Some have been like “that's fake!” Some have freaked out like, called me names. ‘Most are pretty curious but I don't have casual sex anymore, I stopped a few years back.’ Another asked whether he had ever considered having one penis removed. He replied: ‘In my mid-teens, yeah. Now, hell no.’ He said he was glad his parents chose to . not have one surgically removed, adding: 'Besides the ego boost it . really makes a person feel special knowing there is likely no one else . like you alive right now.' He also said he has a great mom and his parents were helpful and supportive growing up. The . man, believed to be American, revealed in an 'Ask Me Anything' thread . that he has one pair of testicles which split into two fully-formed . penises that are individually able to achieve erection and climax. Flooded with questions: The man spent six hours answering people's questions telling readers that some people thought it was fake and that he would not get one penis removed (file photo) The unnamed man, who is in a bisexual polyamorous relationship with a man and woman, explained that he could urinate or ejaculate simultaneously. He met his now boyfriend and girlfriend when they were in a monogamous relationship and the three have been together, exclusively, ever since. Having an extra penis has led to a range of sexual encounters with men and women, and he claimed that heterosexuals had been curious enough to take part in encounters. 'Mostly straight guys, and they always at the very least touch and play with them a little,' he posted. He added that having an extra penis had opened him up to group sex encounters, and said he can use both at the same time, in two different lovers or the same person. When asked about his most memorable sexual encounter he detailed an act involving six other people - three women and three men. One of the only downsides of his condition, he said, was that it means his prostate gets full of seminal fluid that has to be released every few days. When he was younger a urologist would perform the procedure, which involves reaching inside his anus and pressing on the prostate, but he said he can clear it himself now or has his boyfriend do it.","Man uploads picture to Reddit forum, attracting thousands of questions and comments .

"Revealed: Edward Snowden has leaked documents which say the NSA are creating a computer that could break the world's strongest encryption tools . The National Security Agency plans to create a quantum computer that could break the strongest encryption tools in the world, according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden. The former NSA contractor-turned whistleblower has provided documents which suggest that the NSA is on a code-breaking mission which could have revolutionary consequences for almost every type of encryption which protects records used by governments, banks and hospitals. The NSA plans to build a ‘cryptologically useful quantum computer’ as part of its $79.7 million research project, ‘Penetrating Hard Targets,’ through various classified contracts at a College Park laboratory in Maryland, according to the Washington Post. The leaked internal NSA document said: ‘The application of quantum technologies to encryption algorithms threatens to dramatically impact the U.S. government's ability to both protect its communications and eavesdrop on the communications of foreign governments.’ The computer, which would be exponentially faster than a traditional computer, would be able to complete tasks in seconds whereas normal computers would usually take years to solve. Comparing NSA’s progress - which is kept top secret - to the best civilian labs has long been attempted by computer scientists and physicists. Multi-million dollar project: The NSA (pictured is the San Antonio complex) plan to build a 'cryptologically useful quantum computer' as part of its $79.7 million research project, 'Penetrating Hard Targets' It seems the agency is keen to keep up with quantum computing labs sponsored by the Swiss government and the European Union, who have made impressive progress in the last decade, striding ahead of American efforts. One leaked NSA document said: ‘The geographic scope has narrowed from a global effort to a discrete focus on the European Union and Switzerland.' Cure disease? Google bought quantum computer D-Wave Two which can perform tasks 3,600 times faster than normal computers . In their bid to keep their progress . secret, the NSA conducts some of its research in ‘Faraday cages,’ metallic . structures which stop the entry or escape of electromagnetic energy to . ‘keep delicate quantum computing experiments running,’ according to a . NSA document. In theory, a quantum computer can solve . problems much faster than a classic computer, which is only capable of . doing one calculation at a time. A quantum computer is able to avoid some calculations which are deemed unnecessary to solve the problem, . making the process substantially more efficient. A working quantum computer would be capable of breaking a standard known as RSA which works to encrypt messages making it unreadable without a shared password. It is used most commonly by secure financial institutions, website browsers and in encrypted emails. Recently Google bought a quantum computer called D-Wave Two which can perform tasks 3,600 times faster than normal computers. The company is hoping to use it to find cures for diseases, fix climate problems and help robots better understand human speech, for example. The company is hoping to unlock the power of the computer, which was built by Canadian company D-Wave, at the new Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, housed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California.

Thanks to 2012 superhero team-up movie, 'The Avengers,' 'Iron Man' has also became the highest-earning superhero on the big screen of all time, raking in a combined figure of $3.8 billion. The huge success of high-grossing winners such as 'Iron Man 3' and 'Fast & Furious 6' have managed to offset the year’s high-profile flops including 'The Lone Ranger,' 'After Earth,' 'R.I.P.D.' and 'Turbo'. Hollywood is expected to have a banner year at the domestic box office, coming in just shy of $11 billion, the largest annual take ever. But because of higher ticket prices, actual attendance at North American theaters remained flat after a decade of decline. With the current domestic box-office tally nearly 1 per cent ahead of last year at this time, 2013 could surpass 2012's overall haul of $10.8 billion by more than $100 million, according to box-office tracker Rentrak.","'Despicable Me 2' came in second with $918 million total takings .

"The Welsh government has been accused of a ‘culture of waste’ after it was revealed that it spent more than £100,000 on pot plants in just three years. Critics have expressed dismay that so much money has been devoted to plants and floral arrangements at a time when the country has been in one of its worst economic crises and suffered from years of budget cuts. In one year alone the Welsh Government spent nearly £40,000 on potted plants and other decorative fauna, according to a Freedom of Information request. Growing estate: The government says that the increased cost is due to a growing estate since then-First Minister Rhodri Morgan (left) brought bodies including the tourist board into the civil service but Matthew Sinclair (right) from the Taxpayers' Alliance says the spend is 'outrageous' and a 'culture of waste' The figures show that in 2010/11 the Government spent £38,240 on potted plants and other decorative fauna. It spent £28,010.91 in 2011/12, £28,591 in 2012/13, and has spent £8,069 to date in 2013-14. The government claims that the increased . spending was ‘largely due to the increase in size of the Welsh Assembly . Government’s administrative estate’. A spokesman for the Welsh Government Permanent Secretary said: ‘This expenditure relates mainly to the cost of maintaining internal plants at key Welsh Government administrative offices. ‘Planting is mainly limited to public and principal communal areas including reception, conference/meeting spaces and restaurant areas. ‘There are also minor costs associated with the provision of floral arrangements and other plant compositions for key events and functions.’ A Freedom of Information request revealed that in 2010/11 the Government spent £38,240 on plants and other decorative fauna, £28,010 in 2011/12 and £28,591 in 2012/13. The government assembly building is pictured above. In contrast to the amount of money made available for pot plants, the financial outlook in Wales remains a struggle with household costs rising and house prices remaining low. The Welsh government's budget has been cut by 10 per cent in real terms since 2010 equivalent to an unprecedented £1.7billion. Cuts include local councils who will have 5.81 per cent less revenue available to them next year. In response to the Autumn Statement last week, Finance Minister Jane Hutt said: ‘After three and a half years of budget cuts, and the weakest and slowest recovery in history from recession, we still face tough decisions in delivering our priorities of growth and jobs, tackling poverty, protecting the vulnerable and ensuring high quality services for people across Wales.’ Office greens: The government said the costs relate mostly to maintaining pot plants in indoor communal areas such as reception and conference rooms . Speaking out on the pot plant spending, Conservative Shadow Assembly Finance Minister Paul Davies said: ‘Spending £100,000 on floral displays is difficult to justify at any time - let alone in the current climate. ‘Cultivating frontline services should be the priority - not cultivating plants. ‘Taxpayers will rightly greet this bill with disbelief and Labour ministers should apologise for frittering away their money. ‘Making a comfortable environment for visitors is one thing. Spending this much on buying, watering and feeding plants is pretty unforgiveable.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s outrageous that so much of our money has gone on pot plants across the Welsh Government. This spending should be pruned and contracts renegotiated to ensure that taxpayers are getting better value for their money. ‘It’s urgent that the Welsh Government tackle the culture of waste that appears to have grown out of control.’ The amount spent by the Welsh Government on plants has fallen significantly in recent years. In 2005/06, £24,000 was spent, rising to £39,000 in 2006/07, climbing to £41,000 in 2007-08, £48,000 in 2008-09, and then falling to £43,000 in 2009-10. The government estate has increased in recent years after organisations that had previously been Assembly Government Sponsored Bodies have been incorporated into the government. The Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency were brought into the civil service as part of then-First Minister Rhodri Morgan’s ‘bonfire of the quangos’. However, the Welsh Government said that no money had been spent on paintings since April 2010 in its Freedom of Information response to the Welsh Conservatives. Difficult to justify: Conservative Shadow Assembly Finance Minister Paul Davies said the government should apologise for 'frittering away' taxpayers' money .","Government blames the cost on the expanding of its administrative estate .

"American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (pictured) has defended GMOs, saying that people should 'chill out' Supporters of genetically modified food claim they it help feed the world and eradicate disease, while their opponents believe they could contaminate natural food and even harm people. Now, American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who presents the TV documentary Cosmos, has defended controversial genetically modified organisms (GMOs), saying that people should just ‘chill out’. He claims that practically every type for food for sale is genetically modified in some way already and that there are few ‘wild’ crops and animals left. The scientist, who has already spoken out against critics of evolution and climate change, gaves his opinion in a video first spotted by Mother Jones. He can be seen answering a question about his views on GM food, to which he replied: ‘I'm amazed at just how much objection genetically modified foods are receiving. 'It smacks of the fear factor that exists at every new emergent science, where people don't fully understand it or don't fully know or embrace its consequences and are therefore rejecting it. ‘What most people don't know, but should, is that practically every food you buy in a store for consumption by humans is genetically modified food. ‘There are no wild seedless watermelons; there's no wild cows…You list all the fruit, and all the vegetables, and ask yourself: “Is there a wild counterpart to this?” If there is, it's not as large, it's not as sweet, it's not as juicy, and it has way more seeds in it. Dr Tyson said: 'We have systematically genetically modified all the foods, the vegetables and animals that we have eaten ever since we cultivated them.' He explained that it is the process of articicuial selection and the ability to modify food in labs (a rice crop in conical flasks are pictured) is an extension of that . ‘We have systematically genetically modified all the foods, the vegetables and animals that we have eaten ever since we cultivated them. It's called artificial selection. That's how we genetically modify them. So now that we can do it in a lab, all of a sudden you're going to complain?’ He suggests that opponents to GM food should eat apples that grow in the wild that are small and sour, unlike the sweeter and larger types that are sold in supermarkets. ‘We are creating and modifying the biology of the world to serve our needs. I don't have a problem with that, because we've been doing that for tens of thousands of years. So chill out,’ he said. It is not clear from the video at which event the scientist made his remarks and when it took place. Supporters of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) claim they could help feed the world and eradicate diseases, while their opponents (pictured) believe they could contaminate natural food and even harm people . While government organisations and other top scientists may have stopped short of telling protestors to ‘chill out,’ many institutions, including the National Academy of Sciences and the European Commission say that GM food is not unsafe. Some people question the wisdom of tampering with nature, but a number of prominent scientists believe that GM crops are the key to feeding the world's rapidly expanding population. By manipulating the genes in wheat and potatoes, experts have managed to make them resistant to fungal infections, which leads to food shortages. 'Super bananas' laced with vitamin A could be on sale in 2020 in a bid to tackle deficiency in Africa, while scientists believe that GM mosquitoes could be the secret to wiping out dengue fever. A new project to create a more nutritious banana is currently underway (crop being grown in Uganda shown). Queensland University of Technology is making a 'super banana' that will help address the consequences of vitamin A deficiency, which is said to kill up to 700,000 children worldwide each year . The world's first human trial of 'super bananas' will start soon in the hope of providing a more nutritious source of food to Ugandans and East Africans. The bananas will be enriched in pro-vitamin A, which the human body can break down into 'regular' vitamin A, to tackle the consequences of vitamin A deficiency in the regions. And, if the trial is successful, it's hoped farmers could begin growing the enhanced food by 2020. It is what is known as a biofortification project, which is the process of improving the nutritional value of crops by selective, or genetic engineering. While the outside of the 'super bananas' will look just like any other banana, the inside will be different. 'The banana flesh of a pro-vitamin A enriched banana is orange rather than the cream colour we are used to and in fact the greater the pro-vitamin A content the more orange the banana flesh becomes,' lead researcher Professor Dale said. 'We are aiming to increase the level of pro-vitamin A to a minimum level of 20 micrograms per gram dry weight in order to significantly improve the health status of African banana consumers.' Vitamin A is typically found in cheese, eggs and yoghurt. Deficiency of the vitamin is common in poorer countries where access to these foods is limited. Poorer countries also have higher levels of disease, which can be a drain on a body's vitamin A reserves. Symptoms include night blindness and the deficiency can make people more susceptible to other illnesses.","The American astrophysicist defended genetically modified organisms, saying that they are just an extension of artificial selection .

"Kelly Brook 'tore strips' off her on-off lover for crashing a van-load of dead badgers while working as part of an animal cull, it emerged today. David McIntosh - formerly 'Tornado' in TV series Gladiators - had been employed to take dead badgers for disposal as part of the controversial cull in Gloucestershire. But his animal-loving girlfriend, who once appeared in an advert for animal rights activists Peta, was reportedly furious to discover he was part the government-backed scheme to reduce TB in cows. Former couple: Kelly Brook's on-off boyfriend David McIntosh (pictured together on Monday) had been employed to take the dead creatures for disposal as part of the badger cull in Gloucestershire . A friend of the model told The Sun: . 'David didn't tell Kelly about the incident, hoping it would pass. But . she tore strips off him when she found out because of her history with . Peta.' Mr McIntosh told the paper: 'I love animals. I wasn't part of the cull. I was transporting them.' Magistrates . heard that as the 28-year-old former Royal Marine drove his VW . Transporter van to a furnace in the middle of the night, he swerved and . smashed into a bus stop. He . claimed to have lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on . intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under . the brakes, Stroud Magistrates’ Court heard. But . a witness told the panel that McIntosh may have crashed after falling . asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am . on September 29. He admitted driving without due care and attention and not having a valid licence. Making their point: Anti badger-cull protestors outside Stroud Magistrates' Court where McIntosh was fined . Passenger . John Parker - who suffered bruised ribs, thigh, face and wrist in the . crash - told the court he was checking Facebook on his phone when he . felt the van change direction. Reading . Mr Parker's statement, prosecutor Graham Dono said: ‘I looked up after . feeling the vehicle change direction to see a bus stop. ‘I . can't say if he was asleep on not, but when I looked at David both of . his hands were on the wheel, but his head was on his chest. I believe . his eyes were shut.’ The court heard McIntosh, of Altrincham, . Cheshire, had managed to get the job as a driver despite having his . licence for that class of vehicle suspended for running a red light in . 2005. Mr . Parker said during the incident he shouted and grabbed the wheel, . shocking McIntosh into action, who hit the accelerator and smashed into . the bus shelter. In a . statement read out in court, McIntosh, a former Royal Marine driver . said: ‘I was carrying badger carcasses to the furnace as I was involved . in the cull. ‘The radio was . always kept in the vehicle on the dashboard so we could easily hear and . keep up with police as to where the protesters were. It was blocking the . clutch and the brake. 'Before I retrieved it I was heading off the road. I started to brake but it was too late.’ District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai said: ‘It is either that he has fallen asleep or been distracted.’ Unemployed McIntosh was fined £91, plus a £20 victim surcharge and £30 prosecution costs. He was given six penalty points. Scene: The bus shelter in Gloucester which was damaged when a van load of culled badgers crashed into it . He claims to have lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under the breaks . McIntosh crashed after falling asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am on September 29 . McIntosh is a TV personality, model, bodybuilder and former ‘security operative’. He . has served in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland, Somalia, and the Persian . Gulf. He was deployed to Afghanistan in October 2008 for six months. Despite . claims he was dumped by Miss Brook for being too fame-hungry - . something he denies - McIntosh was pictured together with her heading to . her London bar Steam & Rye on Monday night. Around a dozen anti-cull protestors attended the hearing and waved placards outside court. They . were angered an alleged ‘collusion’ between the police and cull workers . via radio, and also that McIntosh was able to get a job without a valid . licence. Steve Tomlin, 64, . who spent 100 nights out in Somerset and Gloucestershire during the . cull, said: ‘Why wasn't he breathalysed? This is a case of a politically . motivated blind spot.’ Jude . Walker, 58, of Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting, added: ‘It . certainly goes against what we have always been told about the police . being even handed. And what happened to the badgers?’ Police . have denied McIntosh's claims that he was in contact with officers via . radio. 'At no point did police communicate the location of protesters to . any contractors,' a spokesman told The Sun. The address given in court for McIntosh in Greater Manchester matches the business of his company, Next Generation Fitness Ltd. Miss Brook has previously posed for campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) - who opposed the cull. Relationship: McIntosh, 28, is known for appearing in TV series Gladiator as 'Tornado' (left). Miss Brook, his on-off girlfriend, is pictured (right) modelling Ultimo underwear . Natural England authorised two pilot culls of badgers, which were paid for by farmers. A . spokesman for the public body said that it issued licenses to culling . companies which in turn employed their own marksmen. He added: ‘Daniel . McIntosh is not a Natural England employee.' The court heard the van was travelling from Tewkesbury to Maisemore in Gloucestershire. McIntosh . contacted the DVLA after the incident and was told his licence was . revoked in 2005 for going through a red light, it was said. His . letter to the court said: 'I have had numerous hire cars and have been . stopped by police for random checks and not once was it flagged up.' District . Judge Rai said: 'I have heard that this was part of the badger cull . operation. I have to exclude anything to do with the badger cull. I am . looking at the driving of an individual.' Neither Mr Parker nor McIntosh were in court. Curvaceous: Miss Brook has previously posed for campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) - who opposed the badger cull that McIntosh was working for when he crashed the van . Whose skin are you in? Miss Brook adorned in snake-skin patterned body paint for her Peta advert . A . spokesman for McIntosh said last night: 'David McIntosh was in a minor . car accident last year that did not involve any other vehicles.  At the . time David worked as hired security for various companies and . assignments. ‘Specifically . in this case, he was hired to provide secure transportation in the . operation of badger culling where firearms were being used. ‘He . was there to prevent any intervention as to insure the safety of staff . as well as the safety of protesters by preventing any altercations. ‘David . was not involved in the culling operation or process he was merely . doing the job assigned to him of security and transportation. ‘David . loves animals and his personal views are against the practice of . culling badgers - but as an ex-military, David knows to separate between . his personal beliefs and feelings to the legal task or job at hand he . was hired to do. ‘The matter of the accident was resolved in court where David had to pay a fine for the traffic violation.'","David McIntosh, 28, is known for appearing in Gladiator as 'Tornado'

"Debbie Vincent arrives at Winchester Crown Court for her blackmail trial. She had been accused of being one of Europe's most dangerous animal rights fanatics . A former British soldier was unmasked yesterday as one of Europe’s most dangerous animal rights fanatics. Debbie Vincent, 52, spent a decade masterminding attacks on suppliers of the continent’s largest animal testing laboratory. She was behind a relentless onslaught of threats and violence designed to destroy Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) in Cambridgeshire. Vincent and her accomplices created a chilling ‘climate of fear’ as they used ‘any means necessary’ to stop those trading with the company. Homes were attacked with fire bombs, employees were falsely accused of paedophilia and items supposedly contaminated with the AIDS virus were sent in the post. An urn containing the ashes of a former company chairman’s mother was stolen from a graveyard. It was never recovered. Vincent, who became a militant animal rights extremist following a sex change, was told she faces a long jail term after she was convicted of conspiracy to blackmail. Winchester Crown Court heard Vincent was a key member of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac), which is linked to the Animal Liberation Front. It blackmailed companies that traded with HLS by threatening to post their details online – helping others to mount attacks – unless they agreed in writing to stop. Based at a small cottage in the village of Little Moorcote in Hampshire, members plotted their campaign with military precision, compiling detailed dossiers on their targets. Most of the crimes commited against the Huntingdon Life Sciences research centre were trying to destroy it. Some of the incidences were incredibly violent crimes, including blackmail and allegedly trying to infect people with the AIDS virus . They funded their attacks with £1million raised from high street collections and groomed middle-class teenagers to become senior members of their network. Among them were a former prefect at a girls’ public school and the sons of a building society manager. Shac’s reach extended to the US as well as all over Europe, including Switzerland, Holland, Sweden, France, Belgium and Germany. Vincent first became involved in the group in 2001 but gradually took centre stage as its leading members were arrested and finally jailed in 2009. Shac specialised in attacking the ‘supply lines’ to HLS after its work to target the laboratory itself was frustrated by UK authorities. A core of up to 15 extremists obtained company details by deception and threatened to post them on shadowy website Bite Back, a magazine for the radical animal rights movement. Debbie Vincent, 52, the animal rights activist who has been found guilty of being involved in a 'menacing' conspiracy to blackmail a major animal testing company . Others then used the information to launch attacks on company buildings and the homes of senior employees. Vincent travelled to Germany to meet the head of security at healthcare giant Novartis in a bid to stop its trading with HLS. Workers at Novartis HQ in Basel, Switzerland, as well as those in Germany and France, had suffered escalating attacks over two years. The words ‘paedophile’, ‘scum’ and ‘Drop HLS’ were emblazoned on homes and businesses, two vehicles were set on fire and a sport pavilion in France was razed to the ground. The campaign culminated in July 2009 in the theft of the ashes of former chairman Dr Daniel Vasella’s mother from a graveyard in Austria. Vincent told the court Shac had ‘no control’ over what people did once information was in the public domain. ‘We think the police have been very ill-advised,’ she said. ‘We are not terrorists at all, we are just everyday people. We are compassionate, we have a different way of looking at things, we think of humans and all things, not just human health.’ A clip of a BBC Inside Out documentary was shown to the jury in which she said animal rights groups are ‘upping the ante’, adding: ‘Yes, we will up the ante because if nobody is going to listen to what we say then all we have got is protest.’ Vincent joined the Army aged 16 in a bid to escape her ‘Victorian family’ and was posted to Germany. But she left two-and-a-half years later after military police found women’s clothes among her belongings and exposed her cross-dressing. The activist, who was born Peter Vincent Rogers, broke down in court as she told the jury how she had wanted to be a girl from the age of seven, but married a woman and had a son before undergoing a sex change. Two other suspected Shac members, Sven Van Hasselt and Natasha Simkins, are fighting extradition from Holland to the UK to face trial. Vincent, of Easton, Bristol, was convicted of conspiracy to commit blackmail between November 2001 and August 2011, for which the maximum penalty is 14 years in jail. She will be sentenced on April 17. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Debbie Vincent been attacking animal testing labs for over ten years .

"Ruby Walsh has hit back at the individuals who sent him death threats during the Cheltenham Festival and rasied concerns for his children. Walsh, who broke his arm after a heavy fall in the opening race of the final day, created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after Our Conor suffered a fatal fall on Tuesday. The 34-year-old insisted that his comments had been misunderstood but nonetheless stood by his comments. Star jockey Ruby Walsh (above) has received death threats after he played down the death of a horse during a race. Above, Walsh on Faugheen celebrates victory in the Neptune Investment Management Novices' Hurdle during Ladies Day at Cheltenham on Wednesday . 'It’s spineless people that tweet, I’m 35 so I can ignore it,' he told the Irish Independent. 'But . I would worry for my kids that people could tweet them. Bullying on . Twitter is a serious problem. There is no place for bullies. 'I . don’t apologise for what I said and stand over it,' he insisted. 'Horses are animals and you keep them out your back door, you don’t keep . your family out your back door. You can replace a horse. You can’t . replace a human being. That’s my feeling on it. 'There’s . a big difference between you going home tonight and something’s . happened to your dog, and you go home tonight and something’s happened . to one of your kids. There’s a huge difference.' Following his initial comments animal rights campaigners accused the 34-year-old Irishman of being callous, while others bombarded him with threats. One tweeted: ‘Ruby Walsh I hope you get your skull crushed by one of the horses you’re so heartlessly flippant about. Animals should not die for sport.’ Another added: ‘Shame more jockeys aren’t killed instead of beautiful horses!!!!!! All jockeys are complete c**ts!! No horse is replaceable!’ Ruby Walsh created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after Our Conor suffered a fatal fall at Cheltenham on the first day of racing. Above, Our Conor (right) ridden by jockey Daniel Mullins . While another wrote: ‘@Ruby Walsh Don’t worry if you die in a race, there’ll be someone to replace you too.’ Dene Stansall of campaign group Animal Aid told the Mail: ‘He has shown callousness for the animals that have earned him a good living. ‘It’s completely disrespectful. To treat the death of a horse in such a way shows that they are merely machines for people to make money. ‘Ruby Walsh is the leading jockey at Cheltenham and wants to support the event as much as he can, but you cannot disregard the lives of horses just because they are not humans. ‘We would expect more from him. This shows he has got little empathy for a horse that really suffered before it died.’ 'Lacking respect': Ruby Walsh, seen after taking a record sixth Mares' Hurdle title at the Cheltenham Festival on Tuesday, has been attacked by animal rights activists . Ingrid Newkirk, founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), said: ‘Walsh’s comments expose the true emotion behind horseracing: greed. They are deeply offensive to anyone who has ever loved and lost a horse or other beloved animal companion. ‘Unlike Walsh, horses are not unfeeling but experience joy, anxiety, fear and affection, just as human beings do.’ One user, with the profile name Amy, wrote: ‘Do you hate horses because you are so short and this makes you angry?’ In a world of pain: Walsh fell during the JCB Triumph Hurdle Race and suffered a broken arm . Another posted: ‘YOUR (sic) AN IDIOT!! ‘A horse can be replaced’ really??? So can jockeys so I hope you fall off a horse & get trampled!’ Since the furore, Mr Walsh’s father, trainer Ted Walsh, has compared Britain’s attitude on the issue to that in Ireland. He said of the UK: ‘It’s a funny country. They can remember the names of horses that got blown up by the bombs in London but not the names of the people riding them.’ The British Horseracing Association went on to stress that the welfare of horses is ‘paramount’ at races such as Cheltenham. A spokesman said: ‘Cheltenham Racecourse employs eight veterinary surgeons, whose sole responsibility it is to provide care to the horses throughout their time at the racecourse. ‘In the event of an incident on the racecourse, any horse affected will receive immediate attention and treatment from the racecourse’s veterinary team. ‘Qualified paramedics and doctors are also on hand in the case of any incident involving a jockey. ‘If necessary, horses and riders will be transported from the course to receive further treatment at the most appropriate equine hospital or Accident & Emergency hospital. ‘British Racing is open and transparent about the risks involved in the sport - the BHA Veterinary team monitors injury rates at every licensed racecourse. Over the last 15 years, the equine fatality rate has fallen by one third to 0.2 per cent of all runners. ‘Despite the best efforts of all involved, as with participation in any sport involving speed and athleticism, there remains an inherent risk of injury.’","Ruby Walsh concerned for children's welfare after receiving death threats .

"Resourceful Claudio Vieira de Oliveira knows more than a thing or two about overcoming adversity. Medics told the now-37-year-old's mother to let him starve to death after he was born with a rare condition of the joints that left him with severely deformed limbs ... and an upside-down head. But despite his physical limitations, Claudio, from Monte Santo, Brazil, has defied doctors' doubts to become an accountant and inspirational public speaker. Scroll down for video . Resourceful: Claudio Vieira de Oliveira has a rare degenerative disease of the joints that has left him without the use of his limbs ... and an upside-down head . 'Since I was a child I've always liked to keep myself busy and work - I don't like to depend totally on other people,' he said. 'I do a bit of accounting, research for clients and consulting. 'I have learned to turn on the TV, pick up my cell phone, turn on the radio, use the internet, my computer - I do it all by myself.' Claudio types with a pen held in his mouth, operates phones and a computer mouse with his lips and has specially made shoes that allow him to shuffle around town. Survivor: Doctors told his mother, Maria Jose Vieira Martins (far left), to stop feeding him as a newborn as they believed he had no chance of survival (pictured with her and members of his family) Popular: Claudio has never let his disabilities prevent him from enjoying a full and busy life (pictured with a friend in December last year) His independence saw him succeeding at school and qualifying as an accountant from the State University of Feira de Santana. When Claudio was born, doctors told his mother Maria Jose he would not be able to survive. Maria Jose said: 'People started saying 'the baby is going to die' because he could barely breath when he was born. 'Some people would say: 'Don't feed him, he is already dying'. Motivational: His independence saw him succeeding at school and qualifying as an accountant from the State University of Feira de Santana where he regularly returns to give motivational talks (pictured) Independent: He cannot use a wheelchair because of his unusual shape, making it hard for him to be independent outside the home - but he begged his mother to be allowed to go to school and learn with the other children . Rare disease: Doctors have recently diagnosed him with a rare condition called congenital arthrogryposis, which they say left him with multiple joint contractions in his legs and arms meaning they cannot extend properly . 'But there's only happiness now. Claudio is just like any other person - that's how he was raised in this house. 'We never tried to fix him and always wanted him to do the normal things everyone else does. 'That's why he is so confident. He is not ashamed of walking around in the street - he sings and he dances.' At eight years old, Claudio, who had previously been carried everywhere, began to walk on his knees. Congenital arthrogryposis is a rare condition that causes curved joints in several areas of the body at birth. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a deformation of the joints themselves, but one of the tissue that surrounds them, thus fusing joints in place. It is caused by a number of factors, including lack of space in the uterus, muscle abnormalities, nerve abnormalities, blood circulation problems and maternal illness. The condition is present in about one in every 3,000 babies and is usually detected before birth. Treatment options include physiotherapy, splinting and surgery. His family had to change the floor of the house so he could walk around without injuring himself. Claudio's bed, plugs and lights had to be made lower so that he could do things for himself without asking for help. He cannot use a wheelchair because of his unusual shape, making it hard for him to be independent outside the home - but he begged his mother to be allowed to go to school and learn with the other children. Doctors have recently diagnosed him with a rare condition called congenital arthrogryposis. They believe he has multiple joint contractions in his legs and arms which mean they cannot extend properly. Claudio said: 'Throughout my life I was able to adapt my body to the world. Right now, I don't see myself as being different. I am a normal person. 'I don't see things upside-down. This is one of the things I always talk about in my interventions as a public speaker. 'Nowadays it's much easier to deal with the public, I'm not afraid of it anymore and I can say that I am a professional, international public speaker and that I receive invitations from all over the world.' He is not the only person with the disease who has refuse to let it overcome his life. In February, MailOnline told the story of Leanne Beetham who became a celebrated photographer and artist whose paintings  of wildlife - which she creates by holding a paintbrush in her mouth - have sold for hundreds of pounds. Miss Beetham, who has a degree in applied animal behaviour, uses paint and graphite to make her images, which can take more than eight hours to complete at a sitting. In 2006 one of her paintings was sold for £750 at Christies in London in aid of the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation. Her exhibition last year in Hull raised money for the Withernsea RNLI, helping to replace equipment which had been stolen.

"The Israeli military used their Iron Dome missile defense system to successfully shoot down a rocket launched at a Red Sea resort town near the border with Egypt today, an army spokesman said. The incident, which comes after days of tension along the Egypt-Israel border, was the first time the system has intercepted a rocket in the area around the resort of Eilat. The al-Qaida-inspired militant group Ansar Jerusalem, . based in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, claimed . responsibility for launching the rocket. Scroll down for video . The Israeli military shot down a rocket aimed at a holiday resort on the Red Sea using their Iron Dome missile defence system (file picture) The army said the rocket was intercepted early Tuesday and that there were no injuries. It didn't provide more details and declined to comment on the origins of the projectile. Ansar Jerusalem, a little known group, is hostile to both Israel and Egypt and was behind an attack in August 2011 near Eilat that killed eight people. In Cairo, Egypt's state MENA news agency quoted an unnamed security official as saying authorities could not confirm that the rocket was launched from Sinai. The report said Egyptian forces were investigating. Most Iron Dome batteries have been . deployed along Israel's border with Gaza, and the missile defense system . intercepted rockets during Israel's fighting with Gaza militants in . 2012. An Israeli military spokesman said it was the first time the missile defence system has been successfully in the area of Eilat, a resort on the Red Sea . Other batteries have been placed on Israel's border with Lebanon. Last Thursday, Israel briefly closed the Eilat airport in response to unspecified security warnings. The following day, five suspected Islamic militants were killed in Egypt's volatile Sinai Peninsula, and a rocket launcher there was reportedly destroyed, according to Egyptian officials. Ansar Jerusalem said four of its men were killed in the strike and blamed the deaths on Israel. The discrepancy between the group's death toll and the one offered by Egyptian authorities could not be reconciled. Egyptian security officials attributed Friday's strike to a drone fired from the Israeli side of the border, but Israel has remained silent about the attack, likely out of concerns about exposing Egypt's military to domestic criticism over an Israeli strike on its soil. Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, but many in Egypt still view Israel with suspicion.","Attack on resort of Eilat follows days of tension along Egypt-Israel border .

"Eight months after he ordered the destruction of Osama bin Laden's camp in Afghanistan and a suspected chemical weapons facility in the Sudan, President Bill Clinton doubted that the al-Qaeda leader posed a serious threat to the United States, judging from a hand-written note mad public Friday. The William J. Clinton Presidential Library released its latest trove of documents, including a hand-written note from the president to his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, on April 14, 1999. Clinton was reacting to a New York Times story the day before that questioned whether bin Laden was behind a pair of August 7, 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 'Sandy – If this article is right,' he wrote to Berger, 'the CIA sure overstated its case to me – what are the facts?' In this April 14, 1999 hand-written note to then-National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, President Bill Clinton questioned whether the CIA had oversold its intelligence showing the threat to the U.S. that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had become . Bill Clinton (L) announced on 20 August 1998 during his Martha's Vineyard vacation that US forces had attacked terrorist bases in Afghanistan and a suspected chemical weapons facility in Sudan. His note eight months later to National Security Adviser Sandy Berger (R) betrayed his lack of confidence about his decisions . Osama bin Laden, killed in a Navy SEAL raid in 2011, was top-of-mind in 1998 when Clinton bombed his terror training camps, but a year later the president questioned the CIA's intelligence . Berger is now co-chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a commercial consultancy he runs with Clinton Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and George W. Bush Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez. 'Intelligence on those responsible for the embassy bombings in Africa was continually developing,' he told MailOnline. 'At the time of the attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan, we were confident that it was al-Qaeda.' That position likely colored Berger's followup communications with his two National Security Council underlings most . closely associated with Middle East issues and transnational threats, . Richard Clarke and Daniel Benjamin. Those conversations were redacted when the library released the documents on Friday since they were classified. Clarke and Benjamin couldn't be reached for comment. Reactions online and in print to the publication of Clinton's 1999 note have generally been negative, focusing on Clinton's indecisiveness in the face of a mortal enemy who would mastermind the deaths of thousands of Americans a few years later with the 9/11 attacks. 'While al Qaeda was planning the Sept. 11 attacks, President Clinton dashed off a note doubting that Osama bin Laden was a major threat,' author and Middle East expert Richard Miniter told MailOnline. Al-Qaeda also bombed the U.S.S. Cole in October 2000, killing 17 American sailors. Miniter's 2004 best-seller 'Losing Bin Laden' chronicles the Clinton Administration's earlier failures to corral the bin Laden, including its refusal of a back-channel offer from Sudanese intelligence to hand him over in 1996. Susan Rice, then a junior State Department officer, was involved in those discussions. They culminated, Miniter writes, with Sudan's vice president asking a U.S. intelligence official if the United States wanted bin Laden. It's unclear if Clinton himself was ever made aware of the overture. But bin Laden had publicly declared war on the U.S. six times between 1995 and 1998, making some of those declarations in public press conferences. Two weeks after the August 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa, the president green-lighted a series of cruise missile attacks against six terror camps in Afghanistan. Bin Laden was uninjured. He was at the time operating in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban. In August 1998 a bomb blast at the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya (L) killed 213 people and injured more than 4,000. Another blast occurred simultaneously at the U.S> embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, leaving 11 dead and injuring 85 . Early al-Qaeda: The October 12, 2000 bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in the port of Aden in Yemen killed 17 American sailors . No WMDs: Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan, killing one worker; his administration believed falsely that the facility was used to produce nerve gas for al-Qaeda . Clinton also ordered a missile attack on the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan. One worker died under the rubble. 'Today, we have struck back,' Clinton said that day. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters then that there would be 'no sanctuary for terrorists and no limit to our resolve to defend American citizens and our interests.' The White House argued at the time that al-Qaeda was using the Al-Shifa factory to produce VX nerve gas that its militants could use against Western populations. Clinton's spokespeople said the plant was heavily guarded, but that soil samples collected outside indicated the presence of EMPTA – short for O-ethylmethylphosphonothioic acid. That toxic chemical compound, U.S. intelligence officials said then, was a nerve gas component that had no known commercial use. A British engineer who worked in the plant later told reporters that EMPTA was used at Al-Shifa, but to manufacture antibiotics and fungicides. And the administration later walked back claims from Cohen, who had said after the factory was leveled that bin Laden had 'a financial interest in contributing to this particular facility.' The most damning criticism Clinton received at the time came from dovish Democrats in Congress, who suspected that he had ordered the attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan to draw attention away from his sex scandal that had monopolized newspaper headlines and news broadcasts. In Washington, the attacks were widely seen as a 'Wag The Dog' episode, a name drawn from a popular movie about a political consultant who distracts voters from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood filmmaker to create and film a fake U.S. war with Albania. 'Wag The Dog' premiered just weeks before Clinton's own sex scandal, about a White House intern he had seduced, made international news. Clintons' sexual dalliance with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public in January 2008, and by mid-year the White House was eager to refocus the news media on other topics . Life imitates art? Washington insiders believed the film 'Wag The Dog,' about a political consultant hired to create a fake war to distract the public from a sex scandal, provided a template for Clinton's cruise missile order, and his 1999 note to Berger suggests he wasn't sure he did the right thing . Clinton's 1999 note to Berger indicates that he doubted the intelligence that preceded his cruise missile order. It may also lend credence to the 'Wag The Dog' scenario, since it suggests that Clinton ordered the cruise missile attacks despite lacking what he considered a complete intelligence assessment. A U.S. intelligence source told MailOnline on Friday that Clinton 'certainly saw the CIA's evidence that bin Laden was behind the first World Trade Center bombing' in 2001. 'Clinton saw everything they had, at least what they could prove,' he said. The agency quickly established a section dedicated to finding the terror ringleader in 1996, the same year mid-level talks with Sudan fell through, once that information was deemed authentic. On June 8, 1998, two months before the embassy bombings, a federal grand jury issued a sealed criminal indictment against bin Laden and other terrorists including Ayman al Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's current leader. The indictment, which made national news, charged them with six crimes including 'conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against nationals of the United States.'","In a hand-written note to his national security adviser, Clinton questioned in 1999 whether bin Laden was behind terror attacks against the U.S.

"The worst she ever risks is a bruised ego. So Gwyneth Paltrow faced heavy criticism yesterday after she compared being slated online to fighting in a war. The Hollywood star said of comments posted about her and her celebrity friends on social media: ‘It’s almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanising thing.’ Shot down: Gwyneth Paltrow sparked ridicule after she compared herself to a soldier fighting in a war . Military mother's wrath: Cindy McCain, wife of ex-POW Senator John McCain, mother to two soldiers (left), blasted Gwyneth Paltrow's (right) suggestion that actors ridiculed on the internet are like soldiers at war . But her remarks caused an immediate backlash. Cindy McCain, the wife of US war veteran and former presidential candidate John McCain, attacked Miss Paltrow as ‘a joke’. She said: ‘Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a joke! My two sons serving in the military should talk to her.’ The US organisation Veterans For Peace said that the 41-year-old actress ‘doesn’t understand what it means to be in real danger’. Miss Paltrow was said to have made her comments outside a conference in Los Angeles at which she made a surprise appearance on Tuesday. The Oscar-winning Shakespeare In Love . star was reported as saying: ‘You come across [comments] about yourself . and about your friends, and it’s a very dehumanising thing. 'It’s almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanising thing, and then something is defined out of it.’ Not holding back: McCain's tweets came after Paltrow's comments while speaking at a tech conference. She's was surprisingly uncensored for a politician's wife . Miss Paltrow – who infuriated working  mothers earlier this year by suggesting they had it easier than famous acting mothers – added: ‘My hope is, as we get out of it, we’ll reach the next level of conscience. 'It’s taken me a long time to get to the point where I can see  these things and not take it as a personal affront and a hurt. ‘I see myself as a chalkboard or a whiteboard or a screen, and someone is just putting up their own projection on it.’ Mrs McCain responded on Twitter: ‘Perhaps Gwyneth Paltrow should go out on patrol with some soldiers. Kind of like a Red Carpet in her mind I guess!’ Senator McCain’s plane was shot down . by friendly fire over Vietnam in the 1960s. He was taken prisoner by the . Communists and suffered five and a half years of horrific abuse. He . returned home to be awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart . and Distinguished Flying Cross before he launched his political career. 'Consciously uncoupling': Gwyneth and Chris announced their split after 10 years of marriage in March . The spokesman for Veterans For Peace said Miss Paltrow, who is famously estranged – or ‘consciously uncoupled’ – from her husband, Coldplay singer Chris Martin, ‘doesn’t understand what it means to be in real danger’. The veterans’ spokesman added: ‘Not someone talking to you on the internet, but actually having bullets shot at you. ‘I’ve gone to war and had that kind of fear. She’s not in a situation where she can compare the two. ‘She hasn’t had to fear for her life and not know whether she’d make it home.’ Miss Paltrow also used a military analogy a few weeks earlier when she responded to criticism with a blog on her website headlined Ending The Mommy Wars. ‘Why do we feel so entitled to opine, often so negatively, on the choices of other women?’ she wrote. ‘As the mommy wars rage on, I am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women.’","Paltrow said internet abuse is 'bloody' and 'dehumanising' like warfare .

It is a twin track ride which sees two trains 'compete' with each other on parallel 6,600ft tracks at speeds of up to 50mph. The ride is 62ft high and rides last just under two-and-a-half minutes.  It is themed around the Grand National, with riders racing through Beecher's Brook and ending at the Winner's Post. In May 2004 it was badly damaged by a fire along with two other rides at Blackpool Pleasure Beach.  It was repaired and returned back to service in October that year.","Robert Sycamore is on a life support machine after freak accident on ride .

"Slowing down: Doug Gregory has been advised to stop flying for decades but only now, at the age of 90, is he retiring . Britain's oldest stunt pilot Doug Gregory has reluctantly given up his daredevil aerobatics but insists he will continue to take to the skies. The 90-year-old former RAF and commercial pilot said is selling his homemade 1917 replica stunt plane because it is too difficult to operate. The pensioner said giving up his dangerous manoeuvres was a difficult decision to make because of his lifelong passion for flying. Mr Gregory said: 'I will miss it terribly and it is very sad to see it go. But it is difficult to get in and out of and very hard to start. His replica wartime plane cost £5,000 . pounds to build between 1983 and 1987. 'It . was a brilliant plane for doing stunts and lovely at aerobatics. 'When . you get up there turning upside down and everything it is no trouble at . all. It all comes out alright in the end. 'It . was quite a special moment when it was completed and I was so pleased. 'It has been super and always great fun it really was.' After survivng 67 missions into Germany in World War Two and a brain haemorrhage in 1947, Mr Gregory said he defied naysayers who told him to give up his hobby. He was told he would never fly again after his illness. Mr . Gregory said: 'The inspiration to make my own plane was being told I . would never fly again. I never believed it and of course they were . wrong. 'It . was obvious I could never do commercial flying after my record of being . hospital but it wasn't very long before I started flying again and I . never stopped. Lifelong passion: During his time in the RAF, Mr Gregory survived 67 missions into occupied Germany . Creation: The stunt pilot in his RAF uniform beside the plane he built himself and has now put on the market . 'After my retirement I knew exactly what I wanted to do and very glad I did it.' The pilot, who flies to WW1 memorials . in France spent four years constructing his own . aircraft, which he flew for nine years in the Great War Display Team. 'When I was old enough I joined the .

I don't . do any other kind of sport. Flying is quite enough to keep me going.' Former school teacher Doug has been . taking to the cockpit for over seven decades and still holds all the . relevant licenses making him one of Britain's oldest pilots.

"Isaiah Brown missed an early penalty and had to wait until extra-time for redemption as his cool finish set holders Chelsea on their way to the last four of the FA Youth Cup. The England Under-19 forward saw his weak spot-kick saved by man-of-the-match Freddie Woodman after just four minutes but, following an entertaining stalemate in normal time, he made no mistake when sprung clear to break the deadlock in front of 11,664 inside St James’ Park. Brown – the second-youngest player in Premier League history having made his debut with West Brom aged 16 – is well thought of at Stamford Bridge and has already won promotion to Jose Mourinho’s first-team squad this season.

But the senior boss will not be impressed when he sees replays of the under-cooked penalty which should have set them on their way to a comfortable victory, such was their first-half dominance. As it was the brave Magpies took the Blues to an additional 30 minutes and, after Brown’s opener, fellow frontmen Dominic Solanke and Tammy Abraham settled an absorbing tie. Chelsea were all over their hosts during a frenetic opening and had their penalty when left-back Jay Dasilva burst into the penalty area before accepting the invitation of Michael Newberry’s outstretched leg and toppling to the turf. It looked a soft award and justice was served when Woodman – shootout hero in the previous round at Sunderland – guessed right and dived low to his left to smother Brown’s tame effort. The West Londoners were looking quicker and stronger than their hosts and Solanke headed wide from Fikayo Tomori’s delivery soon after – the England Under-18 should, on reflection, have tested Woodman. Solanke must have thought he was about to open the scoring on 23 minutes when Abraham drew back towards his unmarked feet eight yards from goal. Newcastle anchorman Ben Drennan, however, had read the unfolding danger and slid in to steal and clear. The dreadlocked Abraham – on the books since the age of eight - was proving chief tormentor and he fashioned half a yard for a shot on the edge of the area before dispatching towards the top corner. Woodman, though, is highly rated on Tyneside and it was easy to see why as he readjusted his feet to dive and fist clear. Tammy Abraham was unlucky with this effort before hitting the target in extra-time . Abraham, who has been with Chelsea since he was eight years old, caused the Magpies problems . Brown (centre)  impressed first-time manager Jose Mourinho, earning a call up to the first team this season . Within 60 seconds Abraham was taking aim once again, this time lashing over from 12 yards after spinning to connect with Solanke’s dinked delivery. Chelsea had one final chance to break parity before the interval but again Woodman was equal to it, Charly Musonda’s dipping free-kick smuggled clear by the inspired gloveman. Musonda - the Belgian midfielder formerly of Anderlecht – was catching the eye with his daring runs from the middle of the park and shortly after the restart he slalomed into United’s area only for his low poke to be flipped around the upright by Woodman. The win meant holders Chelsea  reached their sixth successive FA Youth Cup semi-final . Newcastle had rarely ventured from their own half during the opening hour but, perhaps buoyed by the good fortune which kept the tie goalless, set after a breakthrough of their own. Sean Longstaff dissected the visiting rearguard with a cute pass to free the front-running right-back Jamie Cobain and his rising drive was helped over the crossbar by the previously untroubled Bradley Collins. Home striker Adam Armstrong – with nine senior appearances this term – then chopped one way and the other inside the penalty area to work room for a shot but his stab was repelled by the well-placed Collins. With legs beginning to tire and the game becoming stretched there were chances to be had. Chelsea were next to threaten and Solanke – unguarded just six yards from goal – somehow headed wide when Kyle Scott landed a free-kick on his brow. Brown then blazed over from 18 yards and Solanke, likewise, located the lower tier of the Leazes End when executing a spectacular bicycle kick in stoppage-time. But after a goalless 90 minutes the Blues were in front within four of the restart, Brown sprung clear before rounding Woodman and coolly slotting home. Solanke then got his goal with a cheeky dink over Woodman and Abraham settled the contest in injury-time with Solanke the provider. It was belated, but deserved.","Isaiah Brown broke the deadlock for Chelsea three minutes into extra-time .

"Alan Pardew will start work at Crystal Palace without his right-hand man Andy Woodman after it emerged he is still at Newcastle United. Pardew wants Woodman, a former Palace youth-team keeper, with him at Selhurst Park as part of his technical team but Newcastle want to keep the respected goalkeeping coach. Palace still claim to be working on the final details of Pardew's appointment as manager and he has been discussing potential new arrivals with chairman Steve Parish. Alan Pardew (right) will begin life at Selhurst Park without his trusted right-hand man Andy Woodman . Pardew is set to be confirmed as Crystal Palace's new manager after deciding to leave Newcastle United . Newcastle want to retain goalkeeping coach Woodman so are not keen to let him move to Palace . Now Neil Warnock has departed, Pardew (left) will take the reins at Selhurst Park - his old club . Age: 43 (DOB: 11/08/71) Position: Goalkeeping coach (Newcastle United, 2010-) Previous jobs with Pardew: West Ham United (2006-07), Charlton Athletic (2007-10) Clubs played for: Crystal Palace (1989-94), Exeter City (1994-95), Northampton Town (1995-99), Brentford (1999, loan), Brentford (1999-2001), Peterborough United (2000, loan), Southend United (2000, loan), Colchester United (2000, loan), Colchester United (2001-02), Oxford United (2002, loan), Oxford United (2002-04), Stevenage Borough (2004-05), Redbridge (2005), Thurrock (2005), Rushden & Diamonds (2005-06) Woodman has worked with Pardew at three different clubs - Newcastle, West Ham United (2006-07) and Charlton Athletic (2007) - and is regarded as one of the ex-Southampton boss' most-trusted lieutenants. Although Sportsmail initially understood the compensation figure for Pardew was £2million, sources at Newcastle claim it is £4m. Pardew is believed to have already met the existing coaching staff, Keith Millen and Ben Garner, on Wednesday night as they prepared Palace for the trip to face Aston Villa on Thursday. His initial plan was to be in the dugout but the delay in formally announcing him as the new Palace manager means he is more likely to watch the game from the stands. Newcastle goalkeeping coach Woodman is the father of Freddie Woodman, the club's 17-year-old stopper, and that could be a factor in determining whether or not he wishes to relocate back to his home area - just as Pardew has done.

"A top advisor to Mitt Romney has accused Colin Powell of endorsing the US president because they are both black - amid new evidence of a widening racial gap in the battle for the White House. John Sununu said he did not believe General Powell, the former Republican Secretary of State under George W Bush, switched parties and endorsed Barack Obama because he likes his policies. He said: ‘Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder whether that’s an endorsement based on issues or whether he’s got a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama.’ Scroll down for video . Support: Colin Powell (left) voted for Barack Obama (right) in 2008, and has announced he will do so again this year. The race for the White House has polarised voters along racial lines . Claim: John Sunumu has suggested that Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama's presidential campaign because they are both black . Asked to explain what he meant by Piers Morgan on CNN, he said: 'Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you’re proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.' Mr Sununu, a former chief of staff under President George W Bush, later backed away from his racially-charged comment on Thursday night. But it immediately sparked outrage among Democrats just hours before a new poll showed a growing black-white divide in America’s viciously polarised politics. The mixed-race Mr Obama successfully sold himself in  2008 as a 'post-racial' president who would bridge America’s historic black-white divide. But a tracking poll for the Washington Post shows the president is struggling to connect with many of the white voters who supported him four years ago. Revelation: Mr Powell, a former general, made his endorsement during an interview on CBS This Morning . While Mr Obama is still supported by the vast majority – some 80 per cent - of black and Hispanic voters, his share of whites has fallen from 43 percent in 2008 to 37 percent this year. This puts him 23 points behind Mr Romney among white voters. The survey shows that Mr Obama’s dwindling popularity since he was trounced by Mitt Romney in their first TV debate has been particularly severe among white voters in three categories - men, people without university degrees and those who describe themselves as politically uncommitted. That last section is particularly important as both sides are aware that it is America’s relatively small number of swing voters who are likely to decide the election. Attack: John McCain has criticised Mr Powell for giving his support to the Obama campaign . The survey provided additional good . news for Mr Romney, seeing him pull ahead of Mr Obama overall by 50 . percent of the national vote to 47 percent. Despite the exodus of white voters from the Democrats, the tracking poll showed that they still distrust Mr Romney. Forty eight percent of white voters said . a Romney presidency would do more to help the rich while most of them . believe Mr Obama will do more to assist the middle class. Mr Sununu's comments followed an attack on Mr Powell by former presidential candidate John McCain who said he has . 'harmed his legacy' by turning away from the Republican Party. Worry: Mr Obama's support among white voters is flagging, according to a new poll . Change: Mr Powell has criticised Mitt Romney's shifting position on many foreign policy issues . A poll by Time magazine also showed . Mr Obama doing badly among white voters in Ohio, widely seen as the . state that Mr Romney must win if he is to have a chance of taking the . White House. According to the survey, the . president is trailing the Republican by six per cent among whites in the . state even though Mr Obama rescued a US car industry that is one of . Ohio’s main sources of jobs. Compounding alarm for the Democrats, . there is growing concern that many African-Americans have lost . enthusiasm for the once-inspirational president and may not turn out on . polling day. Mr Powell served in the Vietnam War before entering public life as President Reagan's National Security Advisor. He oversaw the conduct of the Gulf War as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was Secretary of State during the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.

"When Graham Wilkinson’s 12-year-old son got out of his van as he stopped at a zebra crossing, he thought nothing of it. But the seven-second stop, which also allowed pupils to cross the road safely, has landed him with a parking ticket and a potential £70 fine. Council officials say Mr Wilkinson was ‘parked’ during the brief stop outside Shoeburyness High School in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. The incident was captured on film by one of the council’s two spy cars. CCTV image from Southend Council's spy car showing two children using the zebra crossing as Graham Wilkinson's son Joel alights. Graham Wilkinson showing his £35 parking ticket for stopping at a zebra crossing outside Shoeburyness High School, Southend alongside his son Joel, 12. The image provided on the penalty . notice shows Mr Wilkinson’s white van stopped at the crossing as . children cross the road and his son Joel, a Year 8 pupil at the school, . gets out. Mr Wilkinson, from . Shoebury, Essex, said: ‘I’ve been getting quite worked up about it. It’s a ludicrous decision – it’s not like I have parked up and got out. ‘I even spoke to a police officer to see if I was breaking some road traffic law but they said I wasn’t. ‘You can clearly see the kids walking across, I couldn’t have driven on even if I’d have wanted to. ‘My son got out at that point but only because we were already stopped at the zebra crossing.’ The zebra crossing outside Shoeburyness High School where Mr Wilkinson received his £35 fine. Graham Wilkinson believes Southend Council was wrong to fine him £35 as he had to stop at the zebra crossing to allow two children to pass . Council chiefs are planning a massive increase in the number of CCTV spy cars to fine Britain's hard-pressed motorists. The move is despite a pledge by local government secretary Eric Pickles to outlaw the controversial cars. Motorists claim that the cars are a 'cash cow' and are being used to raise extra revenue. There are currently in excess of 100 of the cars (above)  on Britain's roads. Drivers, like Graham Wilkinson, have been forced to hand over at least £30 million in fines over the past 12 months. However, 44 per cent of the 2,500 motorists who appealed the CCTV evidence had the fines overturned. Drivers can take their case to a Traffic Penalty Tribunal to consider their case. Local government minister Brandon Lewis came out to support motorists claiming: 'They are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale. 'They undermine natural justice, as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal.' Mr . Wilkinson received the fixed penalty notice from the council on Friday, . March 7. It orders him to pay £35 within 21 days or face a £70 fine. Zulfiqar . Ali, the council’s strategic highways and traffic manager, said: ‘There . is an appeals process if people wish to challenge a penalty charge . notice they have been issued with. ‘We look at each case on its own merit based on the evidence and representations made.’ The . council’s two spy cars have raked in almost half a million pounds in . their first two years  in operation. The Toyota iQs, each equipped with a . rotating CCTV camera on the roof, issued 15,256 tickets between July . 2011 and March 2013, generating £485,950 for the local authority. Bill . Cook, of Cook’s Coaches which provides a school-run service in the . area, says the fines are making jobs at nearby Chase High School and . Lancaster School uneconomical. It . is believed some schools have even resorted to paying fines on behalf . of the firms just to keep the coach service running. Mr Cook said: . ‘There needs to be a little common sense coming into these decisions. ‘It is as simple as that, but those in power cannot see it. It is just a money game.’ Nick . Pickles, director of civil liberties and privacy pressure group Big . Brother Watch, said many councils ignored rules which say CCTV cars must . be used only where it was dangerous for a traffic warden to work. He . added: ‘The huge numbers of tickets given out in error and later . dropped highlights the risk to innocent people of these  spy cars. ‘When . people see the multi-million-pound enterprise that CCTV cars have . become they will rightly be asking if this is less about public safety . and more about revenue raising. ‘Equally, the high revenues highlight what a lousy deterrent CCTV is – even when it is a blindingly obvious spy car. ‘Councils . should be working to solve the underlying problems of congestion around . schools and understand why so many children arrive by car.’ Last September, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to ban the controversial vehicles. Mr . Pickles said he wanted to ‘rein in over-zealous and unfair rules’, and . that traffic wardens with cameras could do the job instead.","Graham Wilkinson's son Joel, 12, got out while stopped at the crossing .

"These terrifying images show a group of holiday caravans dangling on a cliff edge above a 200ft drop. The mobile homes at the Porthkerry Leisure Park, near Barry, in the Vale of Glamorgan, are now being moved from the dangerous positions amid fears that a landslip may cause them to plummet to the beach below. In 2011 owners and holidaymakers had to be evacuated after part of the cliff collapsed, causing 34,400 tonnes of rock to spill onto the beach below. Scroll down for video . Dangling precariously: The caravans at Porthkerry Leisure Park in Barry are hanging 200ft above the beach . Precaution: The homes were left teetering on the edge when part of the cliff collapsed in 2011, they will now be repositioned because geologists fear more of the land could fall away . One woman was nearly killed when the ground underneath her suddenly gave way. After a detailed investigation, the caravans were repositioned in a safe location near the cliff edge. But now they will be moved back again after a geologist detected ground movement. Site co-owner Sally Edwards said: 'It could be nothing, but we're not risking people's lives.' Since then, warning signs have been put up on site and regular checks are undertaken by a geologist. Ms Edwards said a 15mm (0.6in) movement in the ground was detected in the last inspection. She said: 'There has been nothing for two and a half years, but we, as a company, feel that we are just not prepared to take any risks and so we are being proactive and shutting the road down. Dangerous: Geologists detected land movement at the site, prompting the owners to take drastic action . 'It could be something, it could be nothing. It could be two years, it could be 20 years, but we are not prepared to take that risk so we are . moving the caravans away from the edge and repositioning.' Work on removing the caravans and closing down part of the site will begin today. Ms Edwards, co-owner of the site for the last 16 years, said about £1m had been spent on monitoring and equipment. With the latest changes, she said about 25 per cent of the leisure site park had been lost. Aftermath: A terrifying aerial shot of the park in 2011 shows how two caravans had to be moved following the landslip, which saw 34,000 tonnes of rock spill onto the beach below . Reaction: Around 25 per cent of the park has been lost to the ground below since the first incident in 2011 . Warning signs: The land movement has been threatening the residents in the holiday park in the last three years . She said caravan owners would be offered an alternative pitch on site, or a refund for the remaining site fees for this year. One caravan owner, who returned from holiday to find the area around her caravan cordoned off, said: 'Many of my belongings are in the caravan and now I cannot get to them. 'I don't know what might happen to them. Some caravan owners have food in the fridges and they are concerned what will happen to that.' The owner, who asked not to be named but lives in Cardiff, said: 'We have not been told what will happened or where we will be put.' She said she and other owners would be at the site today hoping to talk to the owners. Encroaching: Since the landslip in 2011 (pictured) the land has moved closer to the mobile homes, sparking fears they could fall off . Coastal erosion is caused by the waves crashing against the rocks over a long period of time. Sediment is eventually worn away, but sometimes the process is made quicker by wind or extreme weather. The Blue Anchor Bay in Minehead, west Somerset, which was built in the 15th century, is facing a similarly uncertain future because the cliff face has fallen away. It has already been forced to close its children's play area because it is dangerously close to the crumbling cliff face, . At Birling Gap in East Sussex, a stretch of chalk cliff has seen erosion, which would normally take over seven years, happen in just a few months. Part of the footpath down to one of the best beaches in the world at Rhossili on Gower in south Wales has also been washed away. Strong winds have left some of the 270 beach huts at Studland on the Dorset coast vulnerable to being lost to the sea.","Mobile homes in Porthkerry Leisure Park are dangling above a 200ft drop .

"Following Paul Lambert's sacking at Aston Villa, England's top flight finds itself without a Scottish manager for the first time since 1984 – almost unthinkable for a country that sent down Sir Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, Kenny Dalglish, George Graham and Sir Alex Ferguson to enrich the old First Division and Premier League. Four years ago, Glaswegians Fergie, Dalglish, David Moyes, Alex McLeish, Owen Coyle and Steve Kean traded blows with each other in the Premier League. Paul Lambert was soon to join them, Malkay Mackay and Billy Davies were at the top of the Championship, with Mackay also leading Cardiff to a major cup final. Scotland's reputation for producing the finest football managers in the world was at its peak and people studied what made them so successful. For such a rapid decline in their status is a huge blow to national pride north of the border. Paul Lambert's sacking means there are no Scottish managers left in the English top flight . Lambert's reign at Aston Villa was a testing time for the former Scotland and Celtic midfielder . Lambert's Aston Villa side managed just 12 goals in 25 Premier League games this season . McLeish, Coyle, Kean and Dalglish were sacked, Moyes followed later after swapping a big club for an even bigger one. Fergie retired and on Wednesday night the axe swung down on Lambert at Aston Villa, whose side have scored just 12 goals in 25 matches. It leaves no Scottish presence in the hot seat since Don Mackay took over at Coventry City on December 28, 1984. The following summer Dalglish became the player-manager at Liverpool and blazed a trail for Graham, Ferguson and Moyes that has been uninterrupted before now. While the English national team had to look abroad for managers because of a lack of domestic candidates, Scotland was spoilt for choice. Sir Alex Ferguson is still the No 1 and his Treble of Champions League, FA Cup and Premier League in 1999 remains his greatest achievement during his time in charge of Manchester United . Ferguson chose David Moyes to succeed him at Old Trafford but it never worked out for him . Coyle, who managed Burnley and Bolton in the top flight and is now in charge of MLS franchise Houston Dynamo, spoke proudly of his roots growing up in the Gorbals area of Scotland's largest city. 'Growing up where we did in Glasgow, you are never handed anything. You have to go and earn and make sure along the way, you look after yourself,' he said. 'I remember my father, God rest him, saying to me, never ever be afraid of hard work. And he's right, if it doesn't go your way, you will accept that because you know you've given it your best shot. Matt Busby's Manchester United were the first English club to win the European Cup - in 1968 . Bill Shankly was no stranger to wining silverware and is pictured here with the FA Cup back in 1974 . Scots have FIVE places in the list of the top 10 most successful managers in English league history . 'There is a passion, a drive, ambition from everybody to be the best and push everybody on. Whether it is social skills in growing up with people, trying to get the best of others, I don't know. 'But what I do know is I know the other Glaswegian managers personally, they have a real fire in their belly to do their very best.' But as the game moves on, the current generation of Scottish managers don't seem to have moved with it even though their coaching set-up at Largs is first-rate and used by everyone from Jose Mourinho downwards. Glaswegians Steve Kean (left) and Owen Coyle are no longer plying their trade in the Premier League . Rule changes in football have generally suited the attackers, leaving well-organised coaches like Moyes vulnerable at clubs like Manchester United where you are expected to win every week. Lambert was constantly criticised at Villa for being overly-negative and just trying to catch teams on the break. Also, the passion that Scots have for football may not be replicated elsewhere. Men like Dalglish were seen as old-fashioned by certain people within their club as overseas bosses like Mourinho, Arsene Wenger and lately Ronald Koeman brought in new methods and often a different way of motivating players. The highest-ranked Scottish manager now is Alex Neil at Norwich City, just outside the play-off places in the Championship. Maybe Villa should try to bring Fergie out of retirement. TROPHY-WINNING SCOTS WHO FOLLOWED ON FROM BUSBY AND SHANKLY IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ERA.. KENNY DALGLISH (LIVERPOOL AND BLACKBURN) He won the League and FA Cup double with Liverpool in his first season as player-manager in 1985-86 and then built a new title-winning team around the likes of John Barnes and Peter Beardsley. Quit Liverpool in 1991 but later returned to win the Premier League with Blackburn and though a second spell at Anfield wasn't as successful, he still led them to the 2012 League Cup – the club's only trophy in nine years. Kenny Dalglish (left), with Mark Lawrenson, got his hands on the FA Cup and First Division crown in 1986 . SIR ALEX FERGUSON (MANCHESTER UNITED) Won an unprecedented 49 trophies with Manchester United, including a record 13 Premier League titles and three European crowns (two Champions League and one European Cup-Winners' Cup). The son of a shipworker from Glasgow's Govan dockyards, he will go down as the greatest football manager of all-time, having turned Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney into superstars. Fergie also led United, with Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks, to Champions League glory in 2008 . GEORGE GRAHAM (ARSENAL AND SPURS) Lifted Arsenal from the doldrums and twice made them league champions, most famously at Anfield in 1989 with a last-minute goal from Michael Thomas. He built his sides around a mean defence and homegrown youthful players like Tony Adams and Paul Merson. After a spell at Leeds – he was sacked by Arsenal for financial irregularities - he returned to the Gunners arch-enemies Tottenham and won a League Cup there.

GRAEME SOUNESS (LIVERPOOL) After starting his managerial career with Rangers, Souness returned to Anfield where he had starred as a player. Although his term lasted less than three years, and he subsequently admitted trying to change things at the club too quickly, Liverpool did win the 1992 FA Cup under his stewardship, Souness leading his team at Wembley against Sunderland against the advice of his doctors who had recently performed triple heart by-pass surgery.

ALEX MCLEISH (BIRMINGHAM CITY) McLeish, a former player under Ferguson at Aberdeen, led Birmingham to the biggest day in the club's history when they shocked Arsenal at Wembley to win the League Cup with a late goal from Obafemi Martins.

"A cyclist has filmed a motorist swearing at him 25 times in just 35 seconds in a heated road rage row. Eddie Bell, 38, a railway maintenance planner who shot the footage on his iPhone, claims he was almost cut-up by the driver of a Jaguar XF S worth £51,000 on a road in Eastbourne, East Sussex. It led to a roadside confrontation in which the man let off a tirade of abuse, including f******, s***, c***, and w*****. Mr Bell reported the incident to police and has now published the video online. Scroll down for video . Shouting: A railway maintenance planner who shot the footage on his iPhone claims he was almost cut-up by the driver (pictured) of a Jaguar XF S worth £51,000 on a road in Eastbourne, East Sussex . He hopes viewers will identify the balding, stocky motorist, whom he has labelled the ‘raging cockney’. The incident happened on Sunday at 11.05am, when he was coming to the end of a 52-mile ride. Mr Bell - who is a British Cycling-qualified coach - claims he was sat at a red traffic light on his Trek Domane carbon road bike when the black car pulled up alongside him. The father of four said a row developed after the motorist allegedly crept into the green box and up to the advance stop line for cyclists. Then, two miles on, he claimed the man lashed out at him. He added: ‘I was at the advanced stop . line for cyclists, within a green box, which is designed to keep us safe . and give us a chance to get a head start. Swearing: The incident happened on Sunday morning, when the cyclist was coming to the end of a 52-mile ride . ‘This car pulled up alongside me in the box and got intimidatingly close. I asked him what he was doing, but he did not hear me because his window was up. 'I let him know I was filming but it did not seem to deter him - he just went mental. I’ve never heard somebody swear so much and get so enraged in my life' Eddie Bell . ‘However, his wife saw me and attracted his attention. He wound down the window, we exchanged a few words and then he darted left across my path, as if he was desperate to beat me. ‘If I had not held back he would have wiped out my front wheel and sent me tumbling. As he drove off I gave him a cheeky wave, which I think wound him up. ‘I did not make any gestures and was not . aggressive. About two miles down the road he came past me again, having . turned around, and was barely 6in from my elbow. Pointing: Mr Bell hopes viewers will identify the balding motorist whom he has labelled the 'raging cockney' ‘He continued off into the distance, parked up, got out of his car, and was standing at the side of the road waiting for me. ‘I prepared myself for a confrontation and got my phone out ready to record it because I feared for my safety. I let him know I was filming but it did not seem to deter him - he just went mental. ‘I’ve never heard somebody swear so much and get so enraged in my life. I cycled all the way home on the pavement because I thought there was a chance he would come after me.’ Mr Bell added: ‘I was absolutely . terrified because he was a big man, and rather menacing. It left me . shaking with fear as I rode away. I’ve shown the footage to friends who . could not believe it. Father-of-four Eddie Bell (pictured) - who is a British Cycling-qualified coach - said the row developed after Baldwin, who is from Kent, allegedly crept into the green box and up to the advance stop line for cyclists . ‘He had a real London accent, so we’ve called him the “raging cockney”. With a huge, expensive car like that, he probably pays a lot of road tax and assumes he has more rights on the road.’ His Domane bike is worth £3,200, weighs 7.4kg and has a top speed of 30mph. The Jaguar has a 3-litre engine, top speed of 155mph and can accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 5.9 seconds.

"A day after the Premier League’s £5.136billion TV deal raised the stakes, Aston Villa decided they could not afford the possibility of relegation. Villa finally sacked beleaguered manager Paul Lambert on Wednesday night after slipping into the drop zone following their dismal 2-0 defeat at Hull City on Tuesday night. When there is even more money for the clubs at English football’s top table, decisions like that become a whole lot easier. Aston Villa have sacked manager Paul Lambert after their woeful Barclays Premier League form . Goals - 12 - ranked 20th in the PL . Chances created - 188 - 19th . Shots - 186 - 19th . Conversion rate - 6 per cent - 20th . Shots on target - 67 - 20th . Shooting accuracy - 36 per cent - 20th . The 45-year-old’s final game in charge was Villa’s 10th Premier League match without a win and came after more supporter protests. Fans have wanted him out for weeks, frustrated by a lack of points, goals and style. The trip to Hull was their 15th league match of the season without scoring. Christian Benteke, Ron Vlaar and Tom Cleverley — considered three of the better players — were left on the bench. Villa supporters unveiled a ‘Lambert Out’ banner. His departure came on the day the Birmingham Mail called for Villa to immediately axe the Scot with a piece entitled: ‘Birmingham Mail says: Lambert must go!’ But it comes a fortnight after Villa chief executive Tom Fox insisted they would not bow to fan pressure. Tim Sherwood and Jurgen Klinsmann are two of the early contenders to take over. The Birmingham Mail called for Lambert's sacking with this hard-hitting message . Lambert with Scott Sinclair during Villa's latest defeat, a 2-0 reverse at Hull on Tuesday . Christian Benteke (right) shows the strain during the Hull defeat as the club dropped into the relegation zone . A statement on the club’s website read: ‘Aston Villa has parted company with manager Paul Lambert. First-team coach Scott Marshall and goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall will continue to prepare the squad for Sunday’s FA Cup tie with Leicester City at Villa Park.’ The players are believed to have been left out of the loop over the sacking and found out via television and social media. Most of them have relegation clauses in their contracts for wage cuts of between 30 and 50 per cent in the event of relegation, so the club are sure to expect an immediate reaction to the change at the helm. In the short-term, goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall, who has been increasingly vocal in training of late, is likely to play a big role in trying to rally the squad. Lambert’s Premier League record with Villa is woeful. Their 12 goals scored, six per cent shot conversion rate, 67 shots on target and 36 per cent shooting accuracy ranks them worst in the top flight. Villa supporters unveiled a 'Lambert out' banner at the KC Stadium with feeling mounting against the boss . That led to the Birmingham Mail campaign, which urged: ‘Aston Villa is a proud and noble name in English football. It is an historic club at the heart of our community, a founding father of the beautiful game. But this great club is now on its knees and the Holte End is hurting — and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen. ‘Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the board: sack the manager.’ Former Villa striker Andy Gray also called for change on talksport, saying: ‘I really worry for my old club. I am not one for seeing people lose their jobs, but sometimes change is necessary. It is all right to say ‘‘our business plan is that we don’t sack people mid-season’’, but if that’s the case you might be playing in a different league next year.’ Chief executive Fox had previously insisted it would be wrong for him and owner Randy Lerner to sack Lambert, which would be a gamble no different to ‘flipping a coin’. A place in the bottom three brought a swift change of heart. Peter Withe, who scored Villa’s European Cup winner in 1982, said on Wednesday night: ‘The most important thing is to get someone in who is right until the end of season; someone with a feeling for the club, who can bring the fans back and inspire them.’ Aston Villa is a proud and noble name in English football. It is an historic club at the heart of our community, a founding father of the beautiful game. But this great club is now on its knees and the Holte End is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen. Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the Aston Villa board: sack the manager. Paul Lambert is not the man to save this club from relegation and the long-term damage that disaster will bring. We do not say this lightly, nor do we take any pleasure in saying that Lambert should go. The Birmingham Mail has been as patient as many of the claret and blue fans, standing by and hoping things will improve. Despite the results, despite the performances. But time is now up. No progress has been made under Lambert. In fact, this once mighty club is now staring relegation in the face. A relegation that would cost the club a lucrative share of the new £2 billion Sky and BT television deal. Dropping down a division would be a disaster financially, and one from which Villa may never recover. As custodian of the club, Randy Lerner must ensure it doesn’t happen. Lambert has presided over just two Premier League victories in 20 matches since agreeing a bumper new four-year deal in mid-September. The poor, and too often dull, performances mean the team is last on Match Of The Day nearly every week - and at this rate destined for an even later Saturday night slot on the Football League show next season. That’s why Villa must act now - before it’s too late. Awful football, declining attendances, and post-match excuses that beggar belief. Aston Villa should not be aiming to survive - they should be aiming to strive, to compete in the higher reaches of the league. Long-ball football has been replaced by an equally unsuccessful possession-based style of play. Now the manager says his side must play ugly football to get themselves clear of relegation - and they will, he says. We don’t believe Lambert anymore. He is out of ideas, there is nothing left for him to say to his players that he hasn’t said already. We respect his integrity and loyalty, but the fans don’t want him. The fans deserve better. Enough is enough.","Aston Villa 'part company' with manager Paul Lambert on Wednesday night .

"On loan Aston Villa striker Darren Bent claims a new manager with a 'fresh approach' will give the whole club a lift following the departure of manager Paul Lambert. The pair endured a strained relationship during their time together at Villa Park before the former England international was sent on a series of loan deals that has concluded with Derby County until the end of the season. Lambert was sacked after a 2-0 defeat to Hull City left the Villa in the relegation zone without a Premier League win in 10 games dating back to December 7 - and Bent believes the club can move on under the right guidance. Darren Bent insists Aston Villa can move on following the departure of manager Paul Lambert . Lambert's reign as Aston Villa manager finally came to an end following a 2-0 defeat by Hull City .

Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: 'Aston Villa are a massive football club, a fantastic football club, and it is a shame where they are in the table. I'm sure whoever comes in will do a good job and get them out of there because they have good enough players for them to do that. 'There are some top, top players there who are maybe low on a bit of confidence but, on any given day, they can beat anyone, especially with the supporters there. With some big games coming up, I am sure the players will be able to turn it around and start looking in the right direction in the league table. 'I think maybe they just they need a fresh approach really. I don't know who they have got in mind to become their new manager but someone needs to go in there with a bit of freshness, mix things up a little bit, and just try something new.

'It is nice to be getting minutes under my belt. Me going back to Aston Villa is out of my hands, to be honest. I am a Derby County player at the moment and I am enjoying my time here – it is nice to be playing.'

"Former Rangers boss Alex McLeish has told the current Ibrox team to copy the example set by Bradford and Middlesbrough as they set out to stun Celtic. Kenny McDowall's Scottish Championship side are as long as 6-1 with the bookmakers ahead of next Sunday's Scottish League Cup semi-final clash. It is doubtful the odds have ever been stacked so high against one side going into an Old Firm encounter. Ex-Rangers manager Alex McLeish believes his old side can beat Celtic in the Scottish League Cup semi-final . But McLeish insists the Light Blues can topple their fiercest rivals and urged them to use the same self-belief which helped both the Bantams and Boro inflict their respective shock FA Cup upsets on Chelsea and Manchester City at the weekend. The Genk boss - who won eight of the 20 Old Firm games he bossed between 2001 and 2006 - said: 'Normally Celtic should win because of the difference in quality. But it's a cup tie and an Old Firm game. Rangers will probably raise their game big time. 'We've seen the big FA Cup upsets in England over the weekend. There is no reason why Rangers can't do that. 'You have to believe. There is no point going out onto the pitch thinking: 'I'm intimidated. I'm overawed by this.' 'You have to go there and give everything - perhaps even a couple of per cent that isn't in your make-up consistently. 'For this game, I'd like to think they will step up. If Rangers get everything right tactically, they can upset Celtic.' Mark Yeates (front) scored Bradford City's fourth in a memorable 4-2 win at Chelsea in the FA Cup . Middlesbrough players celebrate with their travelling supporters after beating Manchester City on Saturday . And McLeish believes old-stagers like Lee McCulloch and Kenny Miller will be vital to the Ibrox cause as they take on the Hoops at Hampden. Seven of the current Light Blues crop - McCulloch, Miller, Steven Smith, Lee Wallace, Richard Foster, Kyle Hutton and Kris Boyd - have tasted Old Firm action before, just one fewer than Celtic can boast. 'The important players for Rangers next week are going to be the experienced players,' said former Scotland boss McLeish, who was back at Ibrox on Sunday as he managed a team of retired Rangers players in Fernando Ricksen's charity match. 'Those lads will be key. They could be the catalyst for an upset. 'Because it is Rangers, we all think they should still be able to beat Celtic. But you have to be realistic. 'At the same time, it's a great chance for these boys to get their names in the history books.' McLeish says Kenny Miller (left) and Lee Wallace's (right) previous experiences in Old Firm games will be vital .","Celtic host Old Firm rivals Rangers in the Scottish League Cup semi-final .

"Mo Farah’s training set-up is under urgent review after it emerged he was training alongside a convicted doper. British Athletics have admitted to The Mail On Sunday that they have been using a coach heavily connected with a drugs cheat to organise the double Olympic champion’s trip to Ethiopia and provide running partners for his sessions. Jama Aden, described as an ‘unofficial facilitator’ to the governing body during Farah’s seven-week stay in the high altitude town of Sululta earlier this year, provided athletes, including former world junior 1500m champion Hamza Driouch, to train with Farah. This picture, posted by Hamza Driouch, that appears to show the athletes travelling in a minibus . Mo Farah and Driouch are pictured training together on the latter's Facebook page . Farah celebrates breaking the world record for the Mens two miles final at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix . Driouch, 20 is currently serving a two-year IAAF ban for irregularities in his biological passport, which date back to August 2, 2012, when he was being trained by Aden. The ban began on New Year’s Eve but was only made public last week. Aden was Driouch’s coach intermittently since 2011 but he denies knowingly allowing a doper to train alongside Britain’s most decorated and celebrated track star. British Athletics’ performance director Neil Black and head of endurance Barry Fudge were with Farah in Ethiopia but also deny knowing who Driouch was. Farah delighted the crowds in Birmingham as he crossed the line in record time at the Barclaycard Arena . A British Athletics spokeswoman said: ‘We have already sought assurances and Jama states that he didn’t hear of the ban until over a week after Driouch’s departure [from Ethiopia] about the ban relating to his blood passport and is obviously very unhappy about the situation. ‘Of course we will be looking into it further, but that’s what we know right now. Neil and Barry were not concerned by anything while out there. It’s too early to say it’s raised concerns but understandably they will review the whole set-up.’ While there is no suggestion that Farah is involved in any wrongdoing, it is another damaging blow to his image just a week after he was involved in an unseemly Twitter spat with Great Britain team-mate and rival Andy Vernon. The training spell in Ethiopia helped Farah's condition, and he said he was in the 'best shape' of his life . The IAAF are likely to investigate why Driouch, who was born in Morocco but competes for Qatar, was partaking in formal training at all, apparently contravening rules which state banned athletes are prohibited from ‘participating in any capacity... in a training camp, exhibition or practice’. Although Farah, who won Olympic golds at 5,000m and 10,000m in London in 2012, will not face any action from the IAAF, he could be embroiled in any investigation as a witness. Farah’s camp made an attempt to distance themselves from Driouch, claiming he did not even know who he was running alongside much of the time and implying Driouch had ‘jumped in’ on his session. The double Olympic champions poses back on the track where he won gold in London earlier this month . Several pictures later emerged showing them running, travelling back from the track and dining together but a source close to Farah said: ‘He is so focused on his training that he often doesn’t know the identity of other athletes around him.’ Allowances do have to be made for the cultural differences between training in the UK or US and in East Africa, where things are more relaxed and young children and animals often run alongside elite athletes on the trails. But those charged with protecting Farah’s clean image surely have to take more care about the background of athletes he is being exposed to, even if they could not reasonably be expected to know about Driouch’s ban. Driouch (third right) competes for Qatar at the Olympic Games at London's Olympic Stadium in 2012 . There will be awkward questioins for Aden, given that Driouch was only 17 when the abnormalities in his biological passport first occured. Many will want to know who he got performance enhancing substances from. British Athletics came under fire in 2013 for sanctioning Farah to have a training session with controversial sprint coach John Smith., who led Maurice Greene to 100m gold in Sydney in 2000, but was named in official documents connected to the BALCO drugs scandal that brought down Dwain Chambers and Marion Jones.","Pictures taken during training camp show Mo Farah with Hamza Driouch .

"Andy Murray has found it increasingly hard to defeat Novak Djokovic of late, and now the British number one's wannabe compatriot is going to give it a try. Aljaz Bedene is the 25-year-old Slovenian settled in Welwyn Garden City with a pop star girlfriend who is a protégé of the renowned music producer and tennis nut Jeff Wayne. The fast-rising world No 116 hopes to receive his passport and represent Great Britain this year, but for now must concentrate on his first round against the world No 1 and outright favourite for the Australian Open. Aljaz Bedene, who hopes to represet Great Britain, will face world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Tuesday . Slovenia tennis star Bedene lives with his pop star fiancee in Hertfordshire, England . The season's first Grand Slam was due to begin on Monday morning, with Murray beginning his campaign against Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri. James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Heather Watson play on day two, and then there is Bedene. Since 2008 he has lived in an area more associated with producing outstanding golfers, such as Sir Nick Faldo and Ian Poulter, and he now sees himself as part of the Hertfordshire scene. He has even represented the county at tennis, under the non-playing captaincy of Wayne – best-known for his War of the Worlds musical adaptation – who works with Bedene's girlfriend Kimalie, another who seeks British citizenship. At present the player is not known much beyond the tennis cognoscenti, although he is reckoned to have top 50 potential and his ranking is falsely low due to injury problems sustained last year. His profile would skyrocket with an upset of Djokovic, who might be more vulnerable than usual as he has been battling a virus and has had his preparations for this event disrupted. Bedene – an athletic baseliner who has already been in the world's top 75 - has had an immigration lawyer pressing for a passport for two years, but is trying to ignore any distractions as he prepares to face the formidable Serb. Bedene faces an extremely difficult Australian Open tie against Novak Djokovic . Djokovic's preparations have been disrupted as he has been battling against a virus . 'I haven't been checking up on it too much here because I need to focus,' he said on Sunday. 'I really want to play for Great Britain, that's my life goal actually. I don't know everything about it but it looks good so far and I'm looking forward to the next few years. 'I'm paying taxes in England so that's a plus, I guess. I live with my fiancee. I have a friend as well, Jeff Wayne, who is trying to help Kimalie, which is her artist's name in her music career. 'So we have both been based there for our careers and I think that's a big thing. We are both enjoying it there. I'm planning to live there after my career as well. It's just a nice place to live.' He confirmed that he would try to appeal against a new rule that came into effect this month preventing players who have already represented another country switching their allegiance in the Davis Cup. His problem is that he has been on the Slovenian team three times, the last occasion being three years ago. The potential objections from someone like long standing Davis Cup stalwart James Ward would be understandable on that basis. James Ward may object against Bedene switching from Slovenia to represent Britain at the Davis Cup .","Aljaz Bedene is hoping to represent Great Britain later this year .

"After the Twitter skirmish that turned into a war of words, Mo Farah let his running speak for itself in Birmingham on Saturday as the double Olympic champion smashed the indoor world record over two miles at the Sainsbury's Grand Prix. Having landed every major title, the 31-year-old finally claimed a global mark. 'It's difficult to train for a world record and then to train for a championship,' he said after setting a time of 8:03.40. 'It's always been hard, but at some point, I wanted to see what I could do.' His well-wishers had included Andy Vernon, who earned Farah's fury for a joke gone wrong and aspersions cast over the strength of the field here. The off-track distractions lifted Farah on it and he ground out a solo pursuit when his challengers faded away, finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Kenya's Paul Koech. Mo Farah of Great Britain celebrates after winning the Mens 2 Miles final and breaking the World Record . Farah clocked a time of 8 minutes, 3.40 seconds, beating the seven-year-old record set by Kenenisa Bekele . The record breaking 31-year-old athlete salutes the Birmingham crowd after crossing the finish line . 'It inspired me,' he said. 'Whatever has happened has happened, we've got to move on. But at the same time I'm an athlete, that's what I do best. I just have to keep on running.' A training stint in Kenya has set him up nicely for a summer where retaining his world 5,000 and 10,000 metres titles will be the priority. Others in Birmingham were preparing for the European Indoor Championships in Prague on March 6. Farah takes a quick glance across the field on the home straight but he was well in front of the pack . Katarina Johnson-Thompson illustrated why she will be favourite for pentathlon gold by claiming her second UK record in a week by following up her high jump mark with a new long jump best of 6.93m.

"UK Athletics president Lynn Davies believes the feud between Mo Farah and Andy Vernon is good for the sport. Double Olympic champion Farah and Great Britain team-mate Vernon were involved in an unseemly spat ahead of the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham last weekend. Somalia-born Farah claimed that Vernon had questioned his nationality after winning 10,000 metres gold at the European Championships in Zurich last summer but the silver medallist from Fareham described that as 'complete lies'. The record breaking 31-year-old athlete salutes the Birmingham crowd after crossing the finish line . Farah responded to the row by roaring to the first world record of his career - setting a new world indoor best of eight minutes 03.40 seconds over two miles in Birmingham - and Davies said the bad blood reminded him of the historic track rivalry between Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett and would raise the profile of athletics. 'What happened was out of character for both of them but it's not a bad idea to have gossip and talking points in athletics,' Davies said. 'It happens all the time in football. People talk about personalities and suddenly we've got two top-class athletes who are having a go at each other. 'I remember the Coe-Ovett era well and you couldn't have had two characters with more different personalities. 'They didn't speak to each other and, of course, that creates a lot of public interest because there's a human story. 'Mo and Andy are both great guys but sometimes in athletics you get this keen rivalry.' Vernon said he would welcome a press conference for the two athletes to clear the air with both men expected to be representing Great Britain at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing in August. The double Olympic champion slots in behind the pace maker on his way to setting his first world record . Farah poses behind the clock in Birmingham showing his world indoor record of eight minutes, 40 seconds . And Davies supported that novel idea, saying; 'We're overshadowed by so many other sports now that we need to put our heads above the horizon and say 'Athletics is alive and kicking and we've got personalities here.' 'You had that with Coe and Ovett and then the possibility of the two of them racing against each other. 'It adds spice and rivalry and we need personalities who are larger than life, not just great athletes but people who can project themselves and connect and engage with the public.' Davies was speaking at the launch of the 2016 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Cardiff and Farah was the name on most people's lips at the event. The conversation quickly escalated as the two middle-distance runners aired their views on Twitter . Farah celebrates beating Andy Vernon (left) in the Men's 10,000m at the European Championships . Vernon and Farah hold up the Union Jack flag together after finishing one-two at the European Championships . (From left) Vernon, Farah and Turkey's Ali Kaya made up the podium in Zurich last August . The Championships will be held on March 26, 2016 and race organisers are hoping Farah will compete in Wales, even though it comes less than five months before the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro when the 31-year-old will be defending his 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres titles. 'Mo's presence would be a massive boost and the icing on the cake because he is such a charismatic figure,' said Davies, the 1964 Olympic long jump champion. 'It's hard to say how it fits in with his Olympic preparations but I think the half marathon might appeal to him next year rather than the full marathon which he attempted last year in London. 'It would give him enough time to recover for Rio and when I get the chance to chat to him in Beijing this summer I will ask him to come along [to Cardiff].' Davies also believes race organisers should entice Farah to compete by offering him appearance money as well as a lucrative incentive to break the world record, which is currently held by Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese in a time of 58 minutes and 23 seconds. 'Mo is such an iconic figure I would imagine there might be an attractive proposition in terms of appearance and prize money,' Davies said. 'The course is very flat and potentially world-class times can be recorded on it, which will attract the best runners in the world to claim bonus money for records. 'We have been granted a special opportunity to put Cardiff and Wales on the sporting map and for a Welshman like myself it will be a very special occasion.'","Lynn Davies sees no problem with Mo Farah and Andy Vernon's spat .

"A family were left stunned when they discovered the skeleton on a 60,000-year-old mammoth in their firm's gravel pit. The almost complete set of pristine fossils were uncovered in May when Marty McEwen and his grandson Ethan Beasley were digging at the family business in Texas. After Mr McEwen hit a 6ft-long (1.8m) tusk with an excavator, the pair alerted nearby palaeontologists who carefully removed layers of mud which are millennia old. A family were left stunned when they discovered the skeleton on a 60,000-year-old mammoth in their firm's gravel pit. Perot Museum of Natural History Fossil Preparator Ron Tykoski, excavates a preserved mammoth skeleton found by gravel pit owner Wayne McEwen, in Ellis County, Texas . Experts believe the creature's relatively small size - it would only have been around 9ft (2.7m) tall - shows it is a female mammoth. Tom Vance, a palaeontologist from nearby Navarro College, Texas, believes the animal died after she fell on her left side. Remarkably it appears as if the clearly visible skull, ribs and lower jaw have been relatively untouched bar a few missing leg bones. Mr Vance said: 'I am extremely excited about this outstanding find - it's very unique for North Central Texas. The skeleton has been donated the nearby Perot Museum in Texas where it will be examined thoroughly . It is estimated that the skeleton could be between 20,000 and 60,000 years old. It will be transported to a permanent home at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas, Texas . The creature's relatively small size - it would only have been around 9ft (2.7m) tall - shows it was a female . 'We were very excited to discover the mammoth in our sand pit and realise it was 90 per cent complete,' Mr McEwen said. To protect the precious fossil, the McEwens have chosen not to disclose the excavation site . 'What is so meaningful is to know that this animal walked through our backyard thousands of years ago.' 'We were very excited to discover the mammoth in our sand pit and realise it was 90 per cent complete,' Mr McEwen added. 'One of the greatest joys in this whole thing was to meet and see the excitement on the faces of the many volunteers. 'It needed to stay in North Texas so it can be enjoyed for a long time to come.' It appears as if the skull, ribs and lower jaw have been relatively untouched bar a few missing leg bones . Ron Tykoski, the museum's palaeontologist, said: 'The McEwens have made a huge contribution to science. 'This fossil is now part of the public trust, meaning scientists can describe it, study it, publish papers on it' The skeleton has been donated by the McEwen's to the nearby Perot Museum, Texas where it will be examined thoroughly after being catalogued. To protect the precious fossil during this transition process, the museum and McEwen family have chosen not to disclose the excavation site. Ron Tykoski, the museum's palaeontologist, said: 'The McEwens have made a huge contribution to science. 'This fossil is now part of the public trust, meaning scientists can describe it, study it, publish papers on it and display it from this time on. 'Without their gift, this magnificent creature might have gone onto the auction block, never to be seen again. 'It would have been a huge loss for science.' Resurrecting a prehistoric creature might seem like a sci-fi dream, but scientists say they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen. Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia. The announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia. There was palpable excitement among the team which included scientists from Russia, the UK, the USA, Denmark, South Korea and Moldova,’ The Siberian Times reported. The researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to provide the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal. Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago. Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’ But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it.","Mammoth found by Marty McEwen and grandson Ethan Beasley in Texas .

"A woman who called an Asian passenger a 'gook'  and mocked her language and facial features has been arrested after her racist outburst was filmed on a Sydney train. Sue Wilkins, 55, was being questioned over the racial tirade at a Central Coast police station on Thursday night. The video - filmed by another passenger who was also a target of Wilkins' abuse - shows her hurling offensive remarks at the Asian woman, mocking her accent and pulling her eyes back. Scroll down for video . The video footage, filmed on a Sydney train, showed a woman hurling racist abuse at an Asian woman by mocking her accent and pulling her eyes back . The racist woman then turned her attention to the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook' Ms Wilkins apologised to the victim after the video went public and acknowledged there were no excuse for such offensive behaviour. 'It's awful and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, regardless of any race,' she said in an exclusive interview with Ninemsn. 'It's not nice what I did to that lady.' Wilkins, who had recently returned from Holland to live with family in the Central Coast in Sydney's north, said she was having a 'rotten day'. 'I've been chasing work for quite some time now. It's awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,' she said. 'It wasn't nice to say that to her because it's not nice when people say that to me ... call me white trash and fatso. I know how it hurts and I shouldn't be saying it to other people.' Wilkins said she has been the victim of a $100,000 scam by a mystery Dutchman, whom she met on dating website RSVP. After she caused a scene inside the carriage, police first spoke to Ms Wilkins on Wednesday when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney's west. They decided to let her 'go about her journey', NSW Police Transport Command Assistant Commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters. Mr Mitchell didn't know why she was allowed to walk free but stressed she would be charged for her 'abhorrent and unacceptable behaviour'. A charge of offensive behaviour carries a $500 fine but any penalty could be greater because the incident was racially motivated. Sydney Trains chief executive Howard Collins - the former boss of London Underground - added that he had not seen anything like it in 37 years as a transport executive. The incident occured at about 4pm on Wednesday on a northbound train heading from Sydney's Central station to the NSW central coast. The train was traveling from Newcastle and Central Coast Line as some commuters warned the woman that she would be charged with assault when they arrived at Strathfield station, Sydney's inner west . In the footage, Wilkins also targets the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook'. 'He's too lazy to jerk off, he can only get a gook,' the rant continued. 'Gook' is a derogatory term for people of Asian descent which started in the Vietnam War. The man filming the scene described the woman as 'f*cking scum' but she seemed unfazed and called him a 'bogan'. 'Oh look at it (alluding to the Asian woman), isn't it sad that he can't get a regular girlfriend, he's got to get an Asian? And she probably thinks he's rich,' Ms Wilkins said. 'What's wrong with Hong Kong? Why did you come to this country? This is our country.' However the man had no association with the Asian passenger next to him, saying in the footage that he is married to another woman. '(The Asian woman) is not even the cameraman's wife, she was just a random passenger sitting next to him,' a witness said. 'My mate who took the vid saw her getting questioned by the cops, but didn't stick around cause (sic) he wanted to get home to his real wife.' Kareem Abdulm, who uploaded the original video on YouTube, said the woman first became aggressive toward some children who refused to vacate their seats when she had demanded. 'This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids,' he wrote. 'The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her.' The man filmed the woman complaining to police on the phone about the children who would not offer her their seats. Ms Wilkins says she argued with the children's mother, who told her they did not have to comply to her request. 'I thought it was just a disgrace,' Ms Wilkins said. 'What sort of an example is that setting for your children? It's just appalling.' This isn't the first incident of its kind in Australia, where two young women kicked and spat on a vision-impaired elderly man on a Gold Coast bus, Brisbane's south, in September. A Melbourne man was also jailed for 21 days in March after racially abusing a French tourist on a bus in 2012. Another racist attack on public transport involved an ABC newsreader Jeremy Fernandez, where he was subject to a 15-minute rant on a Sydney bus in April last year, was told go back to his country and called a 'black c***'. Fernandez declined to comment on this week's abuse when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. Vic Alhadeff, Chairman of NSW Community Relations Commission, described the recent abuse as a 'despicable act'. '(It) violates everything that we stand for as a proudly multicultural state which embraces diversity and celebrates difference, he said. 'Such outbursts of racism demean us as a society, and we encourage all who witness such offensive behaviour in future to condemn it immediately and unreservedly.' NSW Minister for Transport Gladys Berejiklian said she is 'disgusted by any kind of racism or threatening behaviour towards customers using public transport'. A Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink spokeswoman said they condemn any form of abuse on their services. 'The safety of our customer is our priority and we will continue to work with the Police Transport Command to respond to these incidents,' she said. Witnesses should contact police on Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Did you witness this scene or know this woman?

"Mo Farah is facing serious questions about pictures that have emerged of him alongside convicted doper Hamza Driouch. The double Olympic champion features in a series of snaps posted on social media which appear to show him running alongside the banned former world junior 1500m champion in Ethiopia last month, and sharing a minibus back from training there. Qatari Driouch is serving a two-year ban that began on New Year’s Eve for irregularities in his biological passport and IAAF rules state banned athletes are prohibited from ‘participating in any capacity … in a training camp, exhibition or practice’. This picture, posted by Hamza Driouch, that appears to show the athletes travelling in a minibus . Mo Farah and Hamza Driouch are pictured training together on the latter's Facebook page . Farah celebrates breaking the world record for the Mens 2 Miles final at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix . Farah’s agent Ricky Simms told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Mo was in Ethiopia by himself. He hired some local athletes to pace for him during his workouts and he wasn’t part of any other training group. It’s not unusual for people to jump in. He has not got any association with any other athletes that may be out there.’ But Sportsmail has obtained pictures posted by Driouch on his Facebook page which appear to show him in a minibus with Farah and other athletes, and two of him training with Farah. Driouch's Instagram account was switched to private on Saturday morning. Farah’s own Twitter account also has a picture posted on January 20 which appears to show them running together, and the IAAF are certain to want to find answers about why one of the world’s most high-profile athletes was training alongside a runner who is banned. Farah flew from Ethiopia to the UK to compete in Birmingham, where he broke the two-mile world record last weekend. He claimed he is feeling better than ever at this stage of the season and credits switching his training base from Kenya to higher altitude in Ethiopia. ‘I am definitely in the best shape of my life,’ he said.

"Scientists have for the first time captured a direct image of DNA, the structure that encodes the genetic instructions of all living organisms. Enzo di Fabrizio and colleagues from the University of Genoa, Italy, developed a technique to capture the famous double helix of DNA using a scanning electron microscope. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules encode the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses. The stuff of life: DNA's double helix is clearly visible in this scanning electron microscope image taken by an Italian research team using a new method to capture the hitherto elusive molecule . Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Previously the DNA helix could only be detected using a technique known as X-ray crystallography, which involves scattering X rays off atoms in crystallised arrays of DNA. Capturing the reflected rays on photo film forms the now iconic fuzzy X inside a fuzzy O pattern that James Watson and Francis Crick used to discover the double-helix structure. However, because of the indirect nature of the image, Watson and Crick were only able to infer the existence of the double helix using complex mathematics to interpret the image. Very, very small: A team from the University of Genoa, Italy, captured DNA threads out of a dilute solution and dried them and stretch them out across water-repellent nanoscopic silicon pillars . Now Professor Di Fabrizio and his team from Genoa's Nanostructures Department have used a scanning electron microscope to creat the first direct image of the DNA double helix. The researchers developed a process to capture DNA threads out of a dilute solution and dry them and stretch them out across water-repellent nanoscopic silicon pillars, New Scientist reported. By drilling tiny holes through the base of their bed of nano-nails and shining electrons through them, they were able to create high resolution images of a strand of DNA. A stylised image of the double helix strands of DNA: The structure of DNA was first inferred in the Fifties using a technique called X-ray crystallography . The remarkable image clearly shows the DNA double helix, as predicted by Watson and Crick nearly 60 years ago. With refinement, the Genoa team hope that their new technique will allow researchers to watch single molecules of DNA as they interact with other biomolecules. But since the electron energies are high enough to snap DNA molecules, at the moment the method only works with 'cords' of DNA made of six molecules wrapped around a seventh acting as a core. Professor Di Fabrizio now hope to use more sensitive detectors that can detect lower-energy electrons. This should allow them to see individual double helices and even unwound single strands of DNA. 'With improved sample preparation and better imaging resolution, we could directly observe DNA at the level of single bases,' New Scientist quoted him as saying. The research was published in the journal Nanoletters.","Researchers have in the past used a technique called X-ray crystallography to infer the structure of the molecule .

"British diplomats in the US have been forced to apologise after revealing they were hosting a party to celebrate the anniversary of the burning of the White House. The British Embassy in Washington held a ‘White House barbeque’ yesterday to mark the two hundredth anniversary of Britain capturing the US capital and setting fire to the President’s iconic address. The Embassy even sent a message on Twitter from its official account with a photograph of a White House cake, flanked by British and American flags and surrounded by sparkler fireworks. British diplomats tweeted this picture  to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the burning of the White House . A caption accompanying the photograph, revealed by the Telegraph newspaper today, read: ‘Commemorating the 200th anniversary of burning the White House. Only sparklers this time!’ Three hours later, after receiving dozens of angry replies from Americans on Twitter, the Embassy issued an apology. A message explained: ‘We meant to mark an event in history & celebrate our strong friendship today.’ The original tweet referred to the events of August 24 1814 when British troops occupied Washington for 26 hours - setting fire to several buildings, including the Capitol and the White House. British troops were forced to withdraw from the US capital and return to their ships when a heavy thunderstorm and tornado struck. It was the only time in history that the US capital has been invaded and caused substantial damage to the White House. The British occupation forced the then US President James Madison to flee with his with Dolley. British troops ransacked Washington in 1814 - the only time a foreign power has occupied the American capital . A view of the White House in  Washington DC after the British attack on August 24, 1814. The painting is by , William Strickland . The Embassy tweet sparked fury in the US with Americans lashing out at the ‘extremely poor taste’ massage. Yossi Gestetner ‏wrote: ‘HELLO David Cameron. The tweet by [the British Embassy] is of poor taste. Disappointed in the Conservatives.’ The British Embassy had earlier revealed it was holding a ‘White House BBQ’ to mark the 200th anniversary of the ‘rather unfortunate event in UK/US relations’. The War of 1812 between the US and Britain is also known in America as the country’s second war for independence. President James Madison signed a declaration of war against Great Britain - the first time the United States had declared war against another nation – because of continuous British meddling in north American. The US administration was angry over Britain forcing American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy, as well as trade restrictions on the US as a side-effect of Britain's war with France. Britain was also supporting Native Americans fighting the US government's westward expansion. After grinding to a stalemate in 1814 Britain and America signed a peace treaty in Ghent, Belgiun. This settled the border between the United States and Canada, while allowing Washington to expand west into Native American territory. The war therefore seen by some as a victory for both sides - with only the Native Americans as the losers.","Diplomats in the US held a ‘White House BBQ'  to mark anniversary .

"Encased within a plastic isolation chamber, Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo lands on home soil after being struck down with Ebola while helping victims in Sierra Leone. The priest, a medical director of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, was infected with the deadly disease as he tended to victims in the Western city of Lunsar. And today, dramatic images of the missionary being unloaded from a Spanish military transport plane at Torrejon de Ardoz Air Base in Madrid were released, laying bare how fearful even the most experienced of medical professionals are of the disease. In scenes that would not feel out of place in a science-fiction movie set in space, Mr Viejo was wheeled by doctors dressed from head to toe in protective bio-hazard suits to a Madrid hospital where they will battle to save his life. Scroll down for video . Isolated: Meanwhile, dramatic pictures emerged of infected Spanish nurse, Manuel Garcia Viejo, being flown home from Sierra Leone in a plastic isolation chamber . The Spanish military plane  repatriated Mr Garcia in the early hours of this morning where he will receive treatment . Committed: Mr Viejo is a member of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios who worked in the Western city of Lunsar . Life-threatening: He is the second Spanish priest to be diagnosed with Ebola after Miguel Pajares, also a member of San Juan de Dios, who died last month days after being brought back to Spain from Liberia . Surrounded by doctors dressed from head to toe in protective hazard suits, Mr Veijo is stretchered off the flight in Madrid. These dramatic images lay bare quite how fearful  even the most experienced of medical professionals are of the disease . He is the second Spanish priest to be diagnosed with Ebola after Miguel Pajares, also a member of San Juan de Dios, died last month days after being brought back to Spain from Liberia. Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's controversial Ebola lockdown has uncovered some 150 new cases of the deadly virus in addition to around 70 bodies previously unaccounted for, according to the authorities, who said they may repeat the campaign. Most of the west African country's six million people were confined to their homes for 72 hours from Friday, as 30,000 volunteers went from door to door to educate residents on preventing the spread of the deadly epidemic. The crack down came as it emerged many families in the country are conducting secret 'night burials' of victims - clandestine funeral services held under cover of darkness to conceal the fact that there had been an Ebola patient in the household. Precautions: A suspected victim of Ebola shields his face as Liberian nurses spray him with disinfectant at the entrance of Medecins Sans Frontiers Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia . The country's controversial Ebola lockdown has uncovered some 150 new cases of the deadly virus in addition to around 70 bodies previously unaccounted for . Not only is that making it increasingly difficult for authorities to record an accurate death toll for the the worst outbreak of the disease on record, but it is also seriously damaging Sierra Leone's ability to prevent its spread. The World Health Organisation says the virus has already killed more than 562 people in the country. 'We have an overflow of bodies which we still need to bury but this has been an everyday occurrence since the Ebola outbreak ... Now at least we have about 150 new cases,' Steven Gaojia, head of the country's emergency operation centre, said late last night. The country's chief medical officer earlier said up to 70 bodies had been uncovered, but these were in and around the capital, and results for the whole country are likely to push up the figures significantly. Health Minister Abubakarr Fofanah told AFP volunteers had managed to reach around 80 percent of homes, deeming the action a success. 'We have learnt a lot from the campaign. Although this campaign has ended, there is a possibility we would have a similar one some other time,' he said. 'I cannot as of now give you statistics about the total corpses collected during the three-day period as we are now awaiting returns from other parts of the country and this will be made known as soon as the full report is compiled.' It comes as it was revealed an official team burying Ebola victims was attacked in Sierra Leone's capital on Saturday. The attack on the burial team on Saturday occurred in the village of Matainkay, some three miles from  Freetown. Panic: Liberia's government says it is desperate to cut down on 'night burials' - funeral services held within families trying to conceal the fact that there had been an Ebola patient in the household . Liberian nurses carry a suspected Ebola patient into the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Ebola treatment center in Monrovia, Liberia. Local MP Claude Kamanda said that armed policemen accompanying the burial team quickly arrived, causing the attackers to flee. But the attack represents the huge challenge faced by governments in the region who are desperately trying to stamp out the disease in the face of widespread fears, misinformation and stigma among residents of the affected countries. A day earlier, it emerged eight bodies, including those of three journalists, were found after an attack on a team trying to educate locals on the risks of the Ebola virus in a remote part of neighbouring Guinea. 'The eight bodies were found in the village latrine. Three of them had their throats slit,' government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara said. Guinea's Prime Minister Mohamed Said Fofana, speaking earlier, said six people were arrested following the incident, which took place on Tuesday in Wome, a village close to the town of Nzerekore, in Guinea's southeast, where Ebola was first identified in March. Ebola has infected at least 5,357 people in West Africa this year, mainly in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, killing 2,630 of those, according to the World Health Organization.","Manuel Garcia Viejo was flown home aboard a Spanish military plane .

"The working-class labourer who could have been a lover of the poet Oscar Wilde while they were held at Reading Prison has been revealed. Henry Bushnell, a petty thief, was a fellow inmate at the jail where Wilde had been imprisoned for homosexual acts in 1895. Wilde is thought to have indicated his attraction to Bushnell who he described as a 'little dark-eyed chap' in a letter to a friend during his two-year prison sentence.

And they believe the man he was referring to was Bushnell, a dark, handsome man, who only stood at five foot two inches tall. Academics from the university uncovered the pictures of Bushnell, while trawling the archives of Berkshire Record Office. The mugshots of Bushnell are are thought to be the only photos in existence of any of the working-class men Wilde took an interest in. Poet and playwright, Wilde, left, was sentenced to two years in Reading Prison, right, for homosexual acts . The researchers say that Bushnell was described as a prolific thief, who was sent to prison 21 times between 1892 and 1911. And so taken was Wilde with Bushnell, it is thought that the writer sent him money and wrote to him after they were both released. Professor Peter Stoneley, who lead the research told Mailonline: 'It is clear to see Wilde was interested in him and liked him and was part of a group of men he referred to as his pals. 'I think the interest could have been a romantic one and there are certainly grounds for that. 'But whether they were lovers it is difficult to say as Victorian prisons practiced solitary confinement and prisoners weren't even allowed to talk to each other.' Now pictures of Bushnell, along with those of other inmates, which forms part of a exhibition at Berkshire Record Office called 'Oscar Wilde and Reading Gaol', which open next week. The research also uncovered a vast range of mugshots of prisoners taken during Wilde's time in jail. However, no mugshot was ever taken of the writer . The never-before-seen pictures of Bushnell were uncovered by a team from Reading University. Lead researcher Peter Stoneley, pictured, and his team found them while looking through archives at Berkshire Record Office . Wilde began his famous two years in HMP Reading for 'gross indecency' with the son of a lord. His imprisonment scandalised society in 1895 where he was also made to do hard-labour. The jail time lead to one of Wilde's greatest works written about his time behind bars - 'The Ballard of Reading Gaol'. Professor Stoneley added: 'The well-known legend of Reading Gaol has, until now, focused almost exclusively on the tragedy of Oscar Wilde. 'But Wilde himself urged us to look beyond this story to ‘the others’, the men, women and children who were in prison alongside him. The modern day Reading Prison, which was eventually closed down for good earlier this year in January . 'It was seeing and understanding their suffering that helped him to come to terms with his own, and it made him an extraordinarily powerful advocate for prison reform. Yet until now, no genuine effort has been made to understand the circumstances of these men. 'It reminds us of the most attractive aspects of Wilde’s own character – his generosity of spirit, and his openness to the most despised members of his society.' Wilde, a prolific poet and playwright renowned for his wit, was married and had two children at the time of his conviction.","New research has uncovered new pictures of fellow inmates of the poet .

"Barack Obama and White House challenger Mitt Romney are on track to raise more than $2 billion by Election Day – making it by far the most costly presidential race in history. By November 6, both candidates will have each passed the $1 billion barrier in donations. Mr Obama is already there, according to financial disclosures filed yesterday. The president and his Democrat Party have tallied up about $1.06 billion while Mr Romney and the Republicans have collected $954 million since the turn of the year. Big business: President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney have brought in about $1.7billion so far this election, according to fundraising reports . By comparison, Mr Obama raised a total . of $750 for his successful 2008 campaign and his opponent, John McCain, . raised just (pounds) $130 million, which included a government grant . for more than two-thirds of the total. The sources of the money underline the difference between the two rivals and the kind of support they are attracting. Wall Street has invested more heavily . in Mr Romney than any White House candidate in memory, according to the . New York Times, which obtained the disclosures last night. Employees of . financial firms have given more than $18 million to the ex-financier’s . campaign. In Delray Beach, Florida: Obama, the Democratic Party and related fundraising committees raised a combined $1.06billion so far . In Port Saint Lucie, Florida: Romney's fundraising apparatus reaped $954 million so far . They have also donated hundreds of . millions more to so-called ‘super PACS’ – groups working independently . of the official campaigns that often provide cash for adverts backing . their chosen candidates.

Golden handshakes: With the 2012 election so tight, both Obama and Romney have spent considerable time at high-dollar fundraising events courting wealthy donors . Touch down: This year marked the first time that both . major party candidates opted out from the public financing system . established to set limits on how much a presidential candidate can raise . Delray Beach, Florida: In 2008, Obama became the first presidential contender to refuse all public financing while his Republican rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, accepted the government funds . The Obama campaign has received donations from 4.2 million people, about a million more than in 2008. By contrast, Mr Romney has profited . from support from big business donors. Just 22 per cent of his cash came . from people donating less than $200 while 45 per cent was for the . $2,500 maximum. Of the super PACS, Mr Romney was by . far the biggest winner.

Tough talk: (In Richmond, Virginia) Obama's spokesman said the President's campaign was making efforts to expand its donor base as it headed into the remaining days before the election . Star help: Both candidates have enlisted the help of celebrities. Romney's got Meatloaf (performing alongside Romney in Defiance, Ohio), for example, while Obama has Katy Perry, right (in Las Vegas on behalf of the president) Portsmouth, Ohio: Obama's campaign team admitted that Romney and his supportive super PACs were outspending the president on the airwaves . Michael Toner, a Republican campaign finance lawyer and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said the close race between Obama and Romney and the sharply polarized electorate have also played a role in accelerating the dash for dollars. 'I don't know any campaign manager who thinks they have too much money. In this political 50-50 environment you can't ever have enough,' Toner said. 'Every last million could make the difference in who is elected.' But the emergence of super PACs and other outside groups, emboldened partly by the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court in 2010, has done more than anything else to reshape the contours of presidential campaign fundraising. The wheels on the bus: Romney arrives in Worthington, Ohio. A handful of federal court cases have broadly eased campaign finance regulations, allowing donors to give unlimited sums . Homecoming: Wrapping up a 40-hour battleground state blitz yesterday, Mr Obama headed to his hometown of Chicago and cast his ballot 12 days before Election Day (pictured with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel) Into the sunset: The bus of Republican Mitt Romney drives towards Defiance High School in Defiance, Ohio. Groups aligned with Mr Romney have spent $302 million on campaign advertising, compared with about $120 million for groups supporting Mr Obama . A handful of federal court cases have broadly eased campaign finance regulations, allowing donors to give unlimited sums. That kind of money has largely been funneled to super PACs, which can raise and spend money on behalf of candidates as long as they don't coordinate expenditures or strategy with the campaign. 'The distinctive factor in this election is the outside money being spent and the corrupting money financing it,' said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime campaign finance reform advocate. 'It's a symbol of the disastrous campaign finance system we have and the undue influence relatively few well-financed individuals and interest groups now have over government decisions. Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is the top super PAC donor this year. Adelson, a billionaire, has contributed more than $40 million to Republican super PACs, including those backing Romney and former candidate and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.","The eye-popping figure puts the election on track to be the costliest in modern U.S. history .

"Mark Zuckerberg and new wife Priscilla Chan were spotted brushing up on some Italian architecture as they toured the Sistine Chapel during their honeymoon in Rome. Snapped by a fellow culture-vulture, the Facebook CEO wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back. The photo of Mr and Mrs Zuckerberg taking in Michelangelo's frescoes was just one many sightings across the Italian capital of the notoriously private social network founder. Roman holiday: Mark Zuckerberg and new wife Priscilla Chan look engrossed as a tour guide speaks about the Sistine Chapel on their honeymoon . Polish tourist Darek Rusajczyk posted the image to Twitter after spotting the social network billionaire and his wife, who is training to become a doctor. The couple were dressed casually, with Zuckerberg in his typical jeans and t-shirt (but missing a hoodie) while Priscilla wore bright red skinny jeans and wraparound cardigan. They were snapped listening intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings. The couple were also seen at the Colosseum and the Spanish Steps. Zuckerberg took his new wife for dinner at Pierluigi restaurant which has been an institution in the Eternal City since 1938. However the billionaire, 28, had come under fire for spending just 32 Euro on a lunch with 27-year-old Priscilla. The pair were spotted eating a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Roma's Jewish Ghetto where they were snapped by fellow diners. That's amore: Zuckerberg places a hand on his new wife's back as they take in the art at the Vatican . Tourist trail: The couple were casually dressed in jeans and t-shirts as they listened to a priest talk about Michelangelo's art . They tucked into a bargain meal of Roman-style artichokes, ravioli in an artichoke sauce and fried pumpkin flowers but they had no alcohol choosing instead water and tea. Within minutes of leaving the restaurant, the owner Umberto Pavoncello had confirmed the couple had paid a visit - while word also quickly spread via Twitter. The couple's 32 Euro bill - equivalent to $40 - was also posted on the internet by Italian news websites and Mr Pavoncello said: 'They seemed like two lovebirds. They shared a plate of artichoke ravioli in the centre of the table. It was a very romantic scene.' Impressed: Mr and Mrs Zuckerberg hang on every word of their tour guide at the start of their Italian honeymoon . Honeymooners: Zuckerberg looks delighted with his new wife as they take in the tourist sights . With Facebook's value plummeting just days and billions being wiped off its share value after it was launched, perhaps Zuckerberg was looking after his holiday cash during his break in the Italian capital. Receipt: He may have billions in the bank, but the Facebook CEO shared a bargain meal with his wife . Later the couple were spotted in Pierluigi's restaurant where staff revealed they dined out on a supper of prawns Catalan style, oysters and fish carpaccio, followed by lobster pasta and flame grilled fish washed down with a bottle of Chardonnay Gaia e Rei. Unlike Nonna Betta, staff at Pierluigi were rather more reluctant to reveal the cost of their dinner but it was thought to be in excess of £120 - service not included - with a waiter saying: 'It was just the two of them. 'They were happy and content. They had an intimate and romantic dinner.' Besides the Vatican were also spotted at the ancient Colosseum, as well as taking in the sights, sounds and colours of the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps taking photographs every few minutes. The couple are thought to have arrived in Rome by private jet and stayed at the luxury five star Portrait suites hotel close to the Spanish Steps which is owned by the family of fashion designer Salvatore Ferragamo with prices starting at 800 Euro a night. Zuckerberg and his new bride had a sumptuous suite overlooking the Trinita dei Monti, the church at the top of the Spanish Steps and enjoyed breakfast in their room every morning before being taken around the city in a chauffeur-driven limousine. On its website the hotel writes: 'Delight in the ‘Dolce Vita’ at the breathtaking Portrait Suites in Rome in the heart of Via Condotti, a stone throw away from the Spanish Steps.' Why the long faces? Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan look awkward as they eat during their honeymoon on Monday . Venue: Zuckerberg, 28, and Priscilla Chan, 27, were spotted having lunch a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Roma's Jewish Ghetto . True love: Priscilla Chan, the new Mrs Mark Zuckerberg, was walked down the aisle two Saturday's ago by the couple's dog Beast, a Hungarian sheepdog. The couple also wrote their own vows .","Newlyweds also spotted at the Colosseum and Spanish Steps .

"Arabic sign: A post in Zell am See in Salzburg where leaflets are being handed out to Arab tourists . Salzburg has been accused of ‘tourism apartheid’ after distributing a leaflet to Arab visitors advising them to stop them trying to haggle over prices, cooking in their rooms, and dumping litter. The eight-page etiquette guide, called ‘Where Cultures Meet’, also explains how children need to wear seatbelts in a car, meals should not be eaten on the floor, and advises guests to adopt the Austrian mentality and not wear burkas. The pamphlet, in association with tourism officials, the police and the Austrian Arabic chamber of trade, is handed out to visitors in the resort of Zell am See, regarded as one of the most picturesque and expensive of Austria's tourist destinations. Located in the Kitzbuhel Alps, the town is the number one of the country's lakeside destinations on the edge of the 223ft deep Lake Zell. The move comes in response to complaints from locals and companies about the way the Arab guests behave, but the region does not want to give up the tourism revenue, which in the past 10 years has increased by several hundred per cent. However, many business owners disagree with the leaflets. Hotel owner Wilfried Holleis said he said he had no problem with Arab guests and that the whole discussion was a sign of the intolerance in the area. He added: ‘I see it as a kind of tourism apartheid. From the leaflet: The etiquette guide encourages Arab women not to wear burkas . Popular destination: Last year there were 275,000 overnight stays by Arab guests in the Zell am See-Kaprun region . ‘I think there are much more serious problems here, for example the number of people who don't spend any time here but buy property which is effectively just a holiday house and therefore make little or no contribution to the local economy.’ According to the latest statistics, last year there were 275,000 overnight stays by Arab guests in the Zell am See-Kaprun region – about 25 per cent of total visitors. They also spend £195 per person per day – double the level of other tourists. Tourism spokesman Renate Ecker said: ‘They often stay for several weeks, also at times when it's not so busy and in contrast to guests from other regions they are always delighted when it rains. Etiquette guide: The pamphlet includes advice on how to dispose of rubbish in the area . 'No haggling': The tourism guide includes details of how to pay for goods in Salzburg . ‘Some hotels depend so much on the Arab guests that they have almost no other visitors and even have cooks specially employed to cater to Arab taste.’ She added . that the sceptical attitude of locals was a real cause for concern, . adding: ‘If locals find a stumbling point to accept Arab guests, then . that means trouble for tourism.’ Local mayor Peter Padourek said tourists wearing the burka was the biggest reason for friction in the area. He . said: ‘Here the Arabs have the problem that their strong presence in . the region is very clearly visible because of the burka. Pretty town: View over the town of Zell Am See and Lake Zell in Austria . The Where Cultures Meet guide also tells Arab tourists not to cook in hotel rooms . ‘That causes irritation among locals and among visitors from other countries. ‘The guests are coming from other countries carry away with them a different image of our region.’ He also said that he was noticing increasingly that signs were being put up in Arabic and that didn't make him happy. He said: ‘I don't like it when we sell ourselves in this way. We don't need to cosy up to anyone with gestures like this. We should limit ourselves to German and English.’ It is not the first time friction has been seen between Austria and guests from Arabic regions. In 2012 the Austrian Times reported that the regions tourism officials had cancelled all advertising for the Middle East.","Eight-page etiquette guide produced in association with tourism board .

"Kerry Kennedy may agree to a plea deal over driving while drugged charges stemming from a 2012 accident so she can continue her extensive human rights work. Kennedy, 54, is afraid a conviction would bring with it restrictions that would curtail her international travels – she has visited several dozen countries on humanitarian missions. The plea deal was previously discussed between her legal team and prosecutors before being shelved, but her attorneys have brought it back to the table with her trial slated to start Monday, according to the New York Daily News. Other priorities: Kerry Kennedy addressed the media at the European Parliament building in Brussels last week during a jury selection for Monday's trial . Lawyers originally tabled the deal while preparing a defense explaining former Senator Robert F Kennedy’s daughter took Ambien by mistake – she meant to take thyroid medication, sources told the paper. ‘Our defense in this case is that Kerry Kennedy did not knowingly and intentionally ingest those sleeping pills,’ her lawyer explained Friday in court. ‘The pills are very similar,’ he added. ‘She took what she thought was her thyroid medication.’ The former wife of current New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Kennedy was travelling between the Western Sahara and Brussels, Belgium during last week’s jury selection process, sources said. Kennedy faces a misdemeanor charge of driving while impaired by drugs after colliding July 13, 2012 with a tractor trailer on a suburban New York highway, authorities said. In the spotlight: Kerry Kennedy speaking to the media outside the North Castle Justice Court after pleading not guilty to drug-impaired driving charge after her July 17, 2012 arraignment . She fled the scene of the accident and subsequently tested positive for Ambien several hours later, police said at the time. There were no injuries in the crash, which Kennedy told cops she did not remember, and the only damage was a flat tire to her 2008 Lexus SUV. Her legal team told the Daily News she is ready to take the stand in her own defense if need be. A Westchester County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson told the paper that authorities are ready for trial. ‘We will be presenting our case on Monday morning in court.’ If convicted, Kennedy could also lose her driver's license for up to six months.","Kerry Kennedy faces a misdemeanor driving while under the influence of drugs charge .

"Doomsday fanatics claim that a 12th century prophecy states  the successor to Benedict XVI will be the last pope before the end of the world. After the Mayan 2012 prophecies failed to materialise, apocalypse aficionados have turned their attention to the purported writings of St Malachy, an Irish saint and Archbishop of Armagh, who lived between 1094 and 1148. St Malachy is said to have travelled to Rome in 1139, where he experienced a vision of future popes, writing down a series of 112 cryptic phrases that described each one in turn. Prophecies: St. Malachy, an Irish saint who lived between 1094 and 1148 . is said to have travelled to Rome in 1139, where he . experienced a vision of future popes . The saint's final prediction 'Petrus Romanus' is now being linked to leading contender Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson. According to Malachy's visions, 'Petrus Romanus' will be the 112th and final pope after whom it is stated that the 'the seven-hilled city will be destroyed and the dreadful Judge will judge the people'. Although not part of official Catholic teaching, the Prophecy of the Popes is well known by Vatican officials and Catholic scholars. Naysayers have found ways to successfully link each of the phrases to a corresponding pope throughout the centuries. Pope John Paul II, for instance is associated with phrase No. 110, 'From the labour of the sun,' because he was both born and entombed on the day of a solar eclipse. And current pope Benedict XVI, is . linked to phrase No 111, 'glory of the olive' due to the fact that some . members of the monastic order founded by St. Benedict are known as . Olivetans. The ominous phrase No 112, reads: 'In the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church . there will reign Petrus Romanus (Peter the Roman), who will feed his . flock amid many tribulations; after which the seven-hilled city will be . destroyed and the dreadful Judge will judge the people.' Current Pope Benedict XVI, is linked to phrase No. 111, 'glory of the olive' due to the fact that some members of the . monastic order founded by St. Benedict are known as Olivetans, while the final prediction 'Petrus Romanus' is being linked to leading contender for his successor Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson . And with Cardinal Turkson being a member of the Roman Curia or Court of Rome, it is enough to have doomsday prophets heading back to their bunkers. However many experts believe the so-called 'Prophecy of Popes' is a fake and was made up in an attempt to increase a 16th-century cardinal's chances of becoming pope. One of the biggest holes is the fact they only came to light in 1595, in a book by Benedictine monk Arnold de Wyon. The original text was said to have lain unnoticed in Rome's archives until Wyon published it. Sister Madeleine Grace, a historical theologian at the University of St. Thomas who specializes in medieval texts, told NBC News: 'There are just a number of red flags,' 'The material that implies they're talking about future popes is rather scanty indeed, and there are factual errors. ... The likelihood is that they're some kind of forgery.' While it is an accepted fact that our planet will one day be consumed by the Sun, modern science has calculated that that will not happened for several billion years. But that hasn't stopped mankind repeatedly predicting that the world is about to end. In fact, doomsday prophecies have been made ever since we started using calendars, with flood, famine, incoming asteroids and nuclear wars among the favoured causes of annihilation. Biblical scholars point out that in the Book of Matthew, Jesus himself implies that the world will end within the lifetime of his contemporaries, while a host of scholars made similar predictions in the first millennium. The craze appears to have reached a peak in Europe in the Middle Ages. In 1500, Protestant reformer Martin Luther proclaimed that 'the kingdom of abominations shall be overthrown' within 300 years. Others to get in on the act included . Christopher Columbus (1656), mathematician John Napier (1688) and . astrologer Sir Isaac Newton (1948). The town of Bugarach in the French Pyrenees, with . the mountain in the background from which, according to the Mayan prophecy . rumour, a spaceship would emerge to carry people to . safety . More recently, the fad for making Doomsday predictions has become popular amongst Christian groups in the U.S. According to website Armageddononline, prophecy teacher Doug Clark announced in 1976 that President Jimmy Carter would be 'the president who will meet Mr. 666 - soon', . And about 50 members of a group called the Assembly of Yahweh gathered at Coney Island, New York, in white robes, awaiting their 'rapture' from a world about to be destroyed on May 25, 1981. 'A small crowd of onlookers watched and waited for something to happen. The members chanted prayers to the beat of bongo drums until sunset. The end did not come,' the website notes. The year 2000 was also expected to usher in an apocalypse of sorts, with aeroplanes falling from the sky and computer systems crashing. The planet survived. In the days leading up to September 9, 2009, fans of Armageddon insisted that the world would end - 9/9/9 being the emergency services phone number in the UK and also the number of the Devil - albeit upside down. Surprisingly there wasn't the same hyperbole on June 6, 2006. But if the world does manage to get through today unscathed, believers won't have to wait too long before another popular Doomsday prediction date looms. The Maya civilisation of South America was for several centuries one of the most advanced in the world. Along with their architectural achievements, the Mayans left us with calendars that, some argue, predicted the end of the world on December 21, 2012. According to internet rumours circulating at the time, a mountain near the French town of Bugarach would burst open just in time for a spaceship to emerge to carry people to . safety.","Ominous prediction is part of the writings of Irish saint St Malachy .

Rochat said she been surprised at the reaction to the stunning photographs. She wrote: 'Little did I know that [the photos] would inspire people the way they have. 'I had the photos taken to show . people that despite making myself as vulnerable as I could by wearing . only a bikini and freediving with the sharks, they still did not harm . me. 'They are powerful images and they have worked well to support my efforts in changing people's perceptions of sharks.' Tiger sharks are second on the list of recorded attacks on humans, behind the great white shark. However most attacks are not fatal. The species is classed as a near threatened species and it . is under pressure of over fishing and illegal finning. They are also . hunted for their distinctive striped skin.

"An urgent expedition will leave tomorrow to probe a giant crater that has appeared in gas-rich northern Siberia. Extraordinary aerial images show a mysterious hole which experts say may be up to 262 feet wide, in the Yamal Peninsula of northern Russia. 'A scientific team has been sent to investigate the hole and is due to arrive at the scene on Wednesday,' The Siberian Times has reported. Scroll down for video . What on earth is it? This enormous hole has appeared in a remote corner of Russia - and scientists are searching for answers . Opening up: The enormous crater could be caused by global warming, with gas exploding below the surface . The . cause of the hole's sudden appearance in Yamal - which translates as . 'the end of the world' - in the far north of Siberia is not yet known. There has been web speculation about the crater indicating 'the arrival of a UFO craft'. But . one Russian expert says the cause is more likely to be global warming . releasing gases under the surface, which then explode like a champagne . cork. Experts say that the darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates 'severe burning' which scorched its edges. Another . theory is that the hole was formed by a meteorite striking this lonely . spot in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, some 20 miles from the . Bovanenkovo gas field. 'There is agreement that soil around . the hole was thrown out of the crater, large enough for several Mi-8 . helicopters to fly into it,' The Siberian Times reported - before adding . 'not that they have.' The . expedition organised by the Yamal authorities includes experts from . Russia's Centre for the Study of the Arctic, and also the Cryosphere . Institute of the Academy of Sciences. Very remote: The crater has appeared in Yamal - a part of Siberia whose name translates as 'the end of the world' Search for answers: Expedition teams are on their way to the site, hoping to work out the cause of the crater . The mysterious hole is in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, some 20 miles from the Bovanenkovo gas field . They plan to take samples of soil, air and water from the scene. They will be accompanied by a specialist from Russia's Emergencies Ministry. A spokesman for the ministry's Yamal branch has ruled out a meteorite, but says it is too early to say what caused the hole. 'We can definitely say that it is not a meteorite,' he says. Dim and distant: Yamal is a corner of Russia far removed from the cities of St Petersburg and Moscow . A place far far away: Yamal is is Russia's main production area for gas supplied to Europe . Barren: Gas pipelines run through Yamal - but otherwise, in many places, there is little sign of life . Mysterious: One more outlandish theory suggests that the crater has been caused by the landing of a UFO . Anna Kurchatova from the Sub-Arctic Scientific Research Centre, thinks the crater was formed by a mixture of water, salt and gas igniting an underground explosion, a result of global warming. Gas accumulated in ice could have mixed with sand beneath the surface, and then mixed with salt. Some 10,000 years ago this area was a sea. Who knows? Scientists are hoping to announce their findings as to the cause of the hole in the next few days . Global warming may have caused an 'alarming' melt in the under-soil ice, released gas and causing an effect like the popping of a Champagne bottle cork, Ms Kurchatova suggests. Yamal, a large peninsula jutting into Arctic waters, is Russia's main production area for gas supplied to Europe.","Enormous crater appears suddenly in part of Russia whose name translates as 'the end of the world'

"The Ministry of Defence is being urged to stop shooting and blowing up pigs for training in battlefield injuries by a group of leading vets. In an open letter to the government, the experts argue that the use of live pigs in military training exercises is ‘morally wrong, educationally redundant and legally unsound’. And they question the similarities between pig and human wounds, likening it to testing ‘a drug for parrots on horses’. Training: The Ministry of Defence has defended its involvement in the 'cruel' practice of blowing up pigs . Animal rights groups have condemned the exercises and insisted modern alternatives could be found. But last month Defence Minister Philip Dunne insisted the animals were treated ‘humanely’ and nothing was as realistic as using the ‘live pig models’. Official figures show 115 pigs have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts. In one test a group of farm animals were put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire. The letter, seen by MailOnline, argues that civil society is ‘willing to accept some forms of animal suffering, where the end justifies the means’ but if the public knew there were viable alternatives to the use of live pigs it would ‘no longer be tolerated’. Campaigner Andre Menache said pigs and humans were too different for the tests to be useful to surgeons . They cite the decision by the MoD to stop using live goats in submarine tests after pressure from MPs and campaigners. The letter adds: ‘As veterinary surgeons we are acutely aware of the concept of species differences. We would not test a drug for parrots on horses, so where is the logic in training human doctors on pigs? ‘We live in an age of evidence based medicine. The fact that pigs are “similar” to humans, because both are mammals and both bleed when blown up does not make the pig a predictive model of human outcome.’ They argue humans and pigs are separated by up to 97million years of evolution, and there are major differences in the way they bleed. Some 95 percent of American and Canadian test sites use lifelike human patient simulators instead of pigs, the letter adds. ‘Pigs are a poor substitute for real life experience. British civilian and military surgeons have for years gained valuable real life experience by travelling outside the UK and providing medical help where it is most needed, in exchange for their training.’ The letter has been organised by Andre Menache, a Belgian vet and director of France-based Antidote Europe. According to latest figures, some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012. ministers insist the exercise are the only way to replicate the injuries soldiers sustain on the frontline, in order to give military medics training in how to treat horrific wounds. Official figures show that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries . Responding to a parliamentary question, Mr Dunne said: ‘As a key element in their training for operational deployment, members of the UK Defence Medical Services attend military Exercise Surgical Training courses in Denmark. ‘These exercises are essential to ensure our medical personnel are capable of carrying out potentially life-saving surgery on casualties with serious bullet and blast wounds. ‘Injuries of such severity are not routinely encountered during their clinical practice in NHS hospitals, but they are regularly required to treat them when on operational deployment. Participating in Danish training minimises the number of animals involved. ‘The pigs are treated humanely with full use of anaesthetics. There are a number of sophisticated simulation models on the market that provide effective training in certain surgical techniques, and the Ministry of Defence already uses these where clinically appropriate. ‘However, none of those currently available provide a viable alternative to the serious bullet and blast wound training that our surgeons receive from live pig models.’ Defence minister Philip Dunne has rejected calls for the tests to end, insisting the pigs are treated humanely . Dear Philip Dunne, . We, the undersigned veterinary surgeons, are contacting you as Defence Minister to ask you to end the use of pigs in military training exercises and to replace them with readily available alternatives. We respectfully ask that you take into consideration the weight of the following moral, scientific, pedagogical and legal arguments against continuing this practice. The moral argument . Civil society is willing to accept some forms of animal suffering, where the “end justifies the means” and on the understanding that the higher the cost to the animal in terms of suffering, the greater the expected benefit to human well being. However, if the public is made aware that viable alternatives exist to the use of live pigs in military training exercises then this practice will no longer be tolerated, as happened in a similar case involving the Ministry of Defence in 2008. After years of conducting experiments on goats to determine the effects of extreme pressure and the ‘bends’ on submarine crews, the MoD bowed to pressure from MPs and animal protection campaigners and announced that these experiments would stop. The scientific argument . As veterinary surgeons we are acutely aware of the concept of species differences. We would not test a drug for parrots on horses, so where is the logic in training human doctors on pigs? We live in an age of evidence based medicine. The fact that pigs are 'similar' to humans, because both are mammals and both bleed when blown up does not make the pig a predictive model of human outcome. Pigs and humans differ in significant ways, for example: . The pedagogical argument The use of live animals to teach and train military as well as civilian surgeons, as illustrated by courses in Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) has long been surpassed by the use of non harmful, alternative techniques. The legal argument . Articles 4, 13 and 47 of Directive 2010/63/EC on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes endorse the principle of 'Replacement, reduction and refinement'. Specifically, Article 4 states: 'Member States shall ensure that, wherever possible, a scientifically satisfactory method or testing strategy, not entailing the use of live animals, shall be used instead of a procedure.' The availability of non harmful alternatives to the use of pigs is now internationally recognised by bodies such as the American College of Surgeons and considered as routine practice in many countries including the US, Canada, as well as the militaries of 23 of the UK’s 27 Nato allies. The use of live pigs in military training exercises is therefore, in our view, morally wrong, educationally redundant and legally unsound. It is high time the Ministry of Defence ended the practice and instead focused on funding readily available, non-animal alternatives. Yours sincerely, .

"Three famous women have agreed to be photographed without make-up for a good cause. Binky Felstead, Kristina Rihanoff and Apprentice runner up Luisa Zissman have kickstarted a Breast Cancer Care campaign by tweeting pictures of themselves au naturel. The charity are urging women to dare to bare by going make-up free in return for sponsorship. Participants can get involved for a day, a week, or even the whole month of October - which also happens to be Breast Cancer Awareness month. Made In Chelsea star Binky Felstead tweeted: Do you dare go to work without make-up? Binky tweeted: 'Do you dare go to . work without make-up? I'm going to #DareToBare for BreastCancerCare in . Oct,' while Luisa posted: 'Can you #DareToBare in October? #nomakeup . #nofilter.' Kristina followed suit, tweeting: 'Please RT and help the campaign for Breast Cancer Care- #DareToBare.' All proceeds from the campaign will go towards helping breast cancer sufferers in the UK. The charity hope the event will become as big as Movember - when men are encouraged to grow a moustache in November to raise money for good causes. All women have to do is to go to work, a social activity or even on a night out without any make-up on. Kristina tweeted: Please RT and help the campaign for Breast Cancer Care- #DareToBare .

"Forget air guitar - the World Air Sex Championships which have gone down a storm in the U.S. are on their way to the UK. The salacious sport, which makes even Miley Cyrus twerking look tame, sees contestants romp their way through the show simulating sex in front of a live audience. To impress the judges, eager men or women have to act out a full sexual experience with an invisible partner that is part-romance and part-comedy to a soundtrack of their choosing. Scroll down for video . Raunchy routine: Judges giggle as a competitor at the World Air Sex Championships shows off her moves .

"Court: Dr Colin Whitehurst, 54, (right) pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering when he appeared at Trafford Magistrates' Court . A respected scientist who tried to poison rats prowling in the two-acre grounds of his home ended up condemning  his neighbour’s cat to an agonising death. Dr Colin Whitehurst, 54, left a mixture of bacon, tuna and slug pellets on a roofing slate placed by a tree. But instead of ridding the garden of vermin, his concoction proved irresistible to Tallulah, a silver tabby, who was found foaming at the mouth with her back arched in agony. Neighbours claimed the inventor, who patented medical lighting equipment for hospitals, had once told them he did not like having wildlife in his  garden. Tallulah’s devastated owner David Furness, 41, hit out after the wealthy scientist was ordered to pay costs but escaped any other sentence. Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 the maximum sentence for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is a £20,000 fine or six months’ imprisonment, or both. Mr Furness said: ‘The sentence is very lenient – you get more for not having a tax disc. ‘We were devastated about Tallulah. She was only 18 months old and what happened to her was terrible. She was a lovely cat with a lovely nature. ‘The chap would openly say to me he didn’t want any wildlife living in the area – but what I can’t understand was why he then bought a property with all that land. If you move to the country this is what you are going to get.’ Mr Furness, a dog breeder and kennel owner, said the baited roofing slate had been left propped against a tree on the boundary he shares with Whitehurst in the village of Little Bollington, Cheshire. He added: ‘He is quite in his rights to kill rats in a contained way but where he put the poison was near the public right of way. A child could have picked it up and plenty of families walk through there. It just seems a shabby, dirty and cruel trick – knowing we have all the animals.’ The deadly concoction accidentally killed his next-door neighbour's silver tabby cat Tallulah after she ate the mixture, which was left on a grey roofing slate propped up against a tree . Tallulah's owner David Furness said he was 'devastated' about the death of his 18-month-old tabby cat . Whitehurst mixed rat poison and crushed slug pellets with bacon and tuna in a bid to lure and kill the rodents . Trafford magistrates were told the . incident occurred last November at Whitehurst’s £650,000 detached house. Anna McDonald, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: ‘It was rapidly acting . poison and causes fits, often within 30 minutes of ingestion. The cat . would have suffered an unpleasant death and the suffering was . unnecessary. ‘Placement showed a disregard to wildlife. Mixing it with food made it attractive to all wildlife in the area.’ The court heard how the incident occurred in November last year at Whitehurst's £650,000 detached house in Cheshire (pictured) next to the Kottage Kennels which is run by Mr Furness . The cat had suffered from effects of slug pellets, bait and poison which crippled her nervous system . Whitehurst . admitted causing unnecessary suffering and was handed a 12-month . conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,493 costs. Paul Fitton, . defending, said: ‘He is extremely remorseful. Historically there have . been problems with rats on the land. ‘The next property, which keeps dogs, has kennels made from stables and rats have been on the border of this land. ‘There was no intention to harm any animal, he was naive to bait the poison with leftovers. He is not an animal hater.’ Chairman . Margaret Sturt told Whitehurst: ‘A cat has died under distressing . circumstances but we also understand there was no intention to cause . harm to any animals apart from killing rats.’ It emerged the poison had been placed on a roofing slate that had been propped against a tree in order to create a 'bait station' Prosecutor for the RSPCA, Miss Anna McDonald said: 'The cat died as a consequence of poisoning. It was rapidly acting poison and causes fits often within 30 minutes of ingestion'","Dr Colin Whitehurst put rat poison and slug pellets in garden to deter rats .

"The probably thought that the faded fresco needed a lick of paint. Unfortunately, it would appear a company was a little too zealous in sprucing up this ancient art work, and have left it completely unrecognisable. Now two officials in China have been sacked after centuries-old Buddhist frescos were ruined in the 'unauthorised restoration' work. This picture shows one of the ancient frescos that are currently covered by cartoon-like paintings in Yunjie Temple in Chaoyang . A company has 'restored' the ancient Buddhist frescos in Yunjie Temple by painting them over with cartoon-like figures . The faded and peeling paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, which is nearly 400 miles north of Beijing. Years after it was created the intricate fresco, which dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), was left with only hints of its former glory, with large pieces scratched away and only scraps of colour left. But they have now been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures in garish colours. The crude characters are dressed in pinks, greens, yellows and blues and bear no resemblance to the former painting that was in the Chaoyang temple. Figures swaddled in robes can be seen riding ponies, mythical beasts and elephants.

"By . Piyush Srivastava . Updated: . 16:41 EST, 22 January 2012 . The BJP is collapsing under the weight of its own heavyweights in UP. Minutes after the appointment of Pankaj Singh - son of party's former president Rajnath Singh - as general secretary of the UP unit on Sunday, three senior state-level functionaries tendered their resignation in protest. Daya Shanker Singh, Santosh Singh and Ashwini Tyagi - who have forwarded their resignations to party president Nitin Gadkari are UP BJP secretaries. Like father, like son: Rajnath Singh (left) and his son Pankaj . Pankaj, who is much junior to them, also held the same post before being promoted. Confirming his resignation, Daya Shanker said: 'The BJP is turning into a concentration camp where its committed workers are victimised. When it comes to managing the election campaign, the party remembers us. But when it comes to promotion, our national leadership gives it to someone just because he is the son of a senior leader. My two colleagues and I have sent our resignations to Gadkari in protest against his decision to promote Pankaj.' He alleged that Rajnath had blackmailed the party's central leadership into promoting his son. 'Pankaj is dependent on his father to save himself from the wrath of state BJP leaders who have been struggling for over a decade to get a key post in the organisation. Although he was secretary of UP BJP since 2010, he was never seen in the party's state headquarters,' Daya Shanker said. Santosh Singh and Ashwini Tyagi could not be reached over their phones. A senior national BJP leader described Pankaj as a 'friend of criminals', referring to his meeting with jailed mafia don Dhananjay Singh. 'Pankaj was denied a ticket from both Lucknow (east) and Varanasi. So, it appears that Rajnath blackmailed Gadkari into getting him promoted as general secretary,' he added. BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: 'He [Pankaj] was asking for an election ticket. This may be the reason that an alternative responsibility was assigned to him.'",'The BJP is turning into a concentration camp where its committed workers are victimised'

According to Dr Durante, during ovulation single women will 'feel sexier' and their political views will swing more liberal but married/women in committed relationships will cling to conservative viewpoints during fertile phases. 'While the campaigns eagerly pursue female voters, there’s something that may raise the chances for both presidential candidates that’s totally out of their control: women’s ovulation cycles,' read the article from CNN reporter Elizabeth Landau . 'New research suggests that hormones may influence female voting choices differently, depending on whether a woman is single or in a committed relationship.' 'Please continue reading with caution. Although the study will be published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychological Science, several political scientists who read the study have expressed skepticism about its conclusions,' the author warned about Durante's academic paper, 'The Fluctuating Female Vote: Politics, Religion, and the Ovulatory Cycle.' More liberal: According to the research by a San Antonio based academic, single women tend to sway more liberal during times of fertility . GOP: The study from Kristina Durante concluded that married women/women in committed relationships will cling to conservative beliefs during ovulation . But even with that caveat, the article's explanation of research drew a firestorm of criticism from followers who called the study backward and slammed CNN.com for giving it credibility. 'This study published in the Journal of Giant Steps Backwards for Election Coverage,' one Twitter user quipped. Don't shoot the messenger: Elizabeth Landau, who authored the CNN post, said she was merely reporting on a study . 'Yes world has gone bad. CNN trying to tie women hormone levels to their vote,' another user wrote, with others calling the piece 'awful' and 'sexist.' But Landau, a graduate of Princeton who also has a degree from the Columbia School of Journalism, defended her work. 'For . the record, I was reporting on a study to be published in a . peer-reviewed journal & included skepticism. I did not conduct the . study,' Landau, a CNN reporter based in Atlanta, Georgia, tweeted late . Wednesday. Upon reflection, . the website for the cable network relented and removed Landau's piece . saying it fell below their journalistic standards. 'A . post previously published in this space regarding a study about how . hormones may influence voting choices has been removed,' a message on the site read. 'After further review it was determined that some elements of the story did not meet the editorial standards of CNN.' In . an official statement released later, CNN pointed out that Landau's . piece 'did not channel through the standard internal process and it was . not reviewed by senior editorial staff before appearing on CNN.com.' 'As . recognized by our leadership, audience and critics, the piece did not . meet the journalistic standards of CNN and should not have appeared on . our site. We had an obligation to remove it.' Dr . Durante was the chief author of the academic paper, 'The Fluctuating Female . Vote: Politics, Religion, and the Ovulatory Cycle,' with two contributing authors also listed - Ashley . R. Arsena, a Ph.D. student in marketing at the UTSA, and Vladas . Griskevicius, a professor of marketing and psychology at the University . of Michigan. In defense: The author of the CNN.com posting, Elizabeth Landau, took to Twitter to defend her piece . Dr Durante did not respond to a request for comment about the controversy at CNN.com regarding her research. The hormonal impact on female behavior has long been a research interest for the Texas based academic. She previously released a paper last April that concluded 'women at peak fertility (near ovulation) are . attracted to different kinds of men and show increased desire to attend . social gatherings.' In 'Ovulation, Female Competition, and Product Choice: Hormonal Influences on Consumer Behavior,' she discussed how 'at peak fertility women nonconsciously choose . products that enhance appearance (e.g., choosing sexy rather than more . conservative clothing)...This research provides some of the first evidence of how, why, and when consumer behavior is influenced by hormonal factors.'

"The Islamic State suffered heavily in the Syrian battleground of Kobane today as Iraqi forces fought the jihadists buoyed by U.S backing for top government security appointments. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the appointment of defence and interior ministers after weeks of delay was a 'very positive step forward' in the fightback against ISIS in Iraq, which Washington has made its priority. But US-led warplanes kept up their strikes on the jihadists around Kobane on Syria's northern border with Turkey, helping the town's Kurdish defenders to repulse a new attempt to cut their supply lines. Scroll down for video . ISIS militants take shelter behind a wall in Kobane in their battle to claim the Syrian city; the jihadists are said to have suffered heavily today, as the U.S announced the appointment of defence and interior ministers . Coalition air strikes killed 15, while another 16 died in the ground fighting, including two suicide bombers . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the appointments were a 'very positive step forward' in the fightback against ISIS in Iraq, which he said Washington had made its priority . The Kurdish fighters, who have been under attack from ISIS for more than a month, weathered fierce street fighting and at least two jihadist suicide bombings but the front line remained unchanged today, a Kurdish official said. '(ISIS) brought in reinforcements... and attacked hard,' Idris Nassen said . 'But thanks to air strikes and (the Kurdish fighters') response, they did not make any progress.' The ISIS fighters suffered heavy losses in their effort to seal the battle for the town, which has become a key prize as it is being fought under the gaze of the world's press massed just over the border in Turkey. From Saturday into this morning, a total of 31 jihadists died in the battle, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Coalition air strikes killed 15, while another 16 died in the ground fighting, including two suicide bombers. Syrian army forces gather on a road near the town of Al-Jbaileh on the outskirts of Aleppo; The U.S. military has said it sees 'encouraging' signs in the battle for Kobane, although it warns the city may still fall . The Kurdish fighters, who have been under attack from ISIS for more than a month, weathered fierce street fighting and at least two jihadist suicide bombings but the front line remained unchanged today . The Kurdish lost seven fighters, said the Britain-based Observatory. On Friday, ISIS lost 35 of its fighters while the Kurds lost three. Medics and witnesses reported a steady flow of bodies from the Kobane fighting arriving at an ISIS-controlled hospital further east, the Observatory said. The bodies of at least 70 ISIS fighters had been brought into the mortuary in the town of Tal Abyad over the past four days, they said. The U.S. military has said it sees 'encouraging' signs in the battle for Kobane, although it warns the city may still fall. But commanders have repeatedly said that the main priority remains the battle against ISIS in neighbouring Iraq, where the jihadists swept through much of the Sunni Arab heartland north and west of Baghdad in June. The minority community's grievances against the Shiite led-government were a major factor in the lightning advance and Washington has been piling pressure on Baghdad to form an inclusive government capable of mounting a fightback. Commanders have repeatedly said that the main priority remains the battle against ISIS in neighbouring Iraq - not Syria, where Syrian soldiers are seen above - where the jihadists swept through much of the Sunni Arab heartland north and west of Baghdad in June . Yesterday, the remaining posts in a new government line-up were finally approved by parliament, including a Sunni as defence minister and a Shiite as interior minister. 'These were critical positions to be filled, in order to assist with the organising effort' against IS, the US top diplomat said. 'So we're very pleased.' With Washington voicing approval, Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi's office announced that he is to head to Tehran tomorrow to discuss the fightback with his other key ally. Washington has acknowledged that Tehran has an important role to play in the battle against ISIS, although it has kept the main Shiite power out of the coalition it has forged against the jihadists for fear of alienating Sunnis. Abadi's talks in Iran are part of his bid 'to unite the efforts of the region and the world to help Iraq in its war against the terrorist group,' his office said. Although it has not been part of the U.S-led coalition, Tehran has been a key backer of Abadi's government in its efforts to hold back the jihadist advance. According to a senior Iraqi Kurdish official, it has deployed troops on the Iraqi side of the border in the Khanaqin area northeast of Baghdad. Iranian forces also played a role in the Shiite Turkmen town of Amerli, where security forces and allied militiamen broke a months-long jihadist siege at the end of August, another senior Kurdish official has said. Evidence also indicates that Iran sent Sukhoi Su-25 ground attack jets to Iraq, though it is unclear who subsequently piloted the aircraft.","Air strikes on ISIS killed 15 in Kobane, while ground fighting killed 16 .

"A zoo once dubbed the 'worst in the world' by a visitor is now set to close after complaints that the animals in residence were looking too depressed. The Split Science Museum and Zoo in Croatia's second largest city, Split, will relocate its animals to different zoos across the country. The announcement came after numerous complaints that the animals were living in squalid conditions, such as small and dirty cages, making them visibly depressed. Trapped: Bears are kept in tiny cages, often seen restless and ill-treated, making them depressed and violent . The closure was announced by Split's deputy mayor, Goran Kovacevic, who said: 'We have told the zoo manager to start preparations and draft a programme . to relocate all animals.' The monkeys will be sent to Germany, but the zoos managers are still still looking for a housing solution for the zoo's 14-year-old tiger. The establishment, open since 1924, previously housed 450 animals across 55 species. Violent: Local animal rights groups have pointed out the troubles of the wolves (pictured), saying up to five of them were kept in a cage at once, causing them to constantly attack each other . Depressed: Animals, such as the pigs (pictured) are made to stick to squalid conditions, with tourists saying their cages and enclosures are cramped to the point of abuse . Utilitarian: The zoo is a mixture of old and rusting metal, cracked and poorly maintained concrete and small cages that are often too small to house as many cramped animals as they do . It has been the subject of scathing reviews on the review site Tripadvisor, with statements like 'disgraceful' and 'terrible' a frequent occurrence from visitors choosing to leave comments. One visitor said: 'The zoo in Split is located at the very . top of the Marjan Hill, unfortunately on the top of the hill you will find a . very sad place and tears may easily wet your eyes. 'There is a . small range of animals including bears, wolves, donkeys and monkeys. 'Some of the cages are ridiculously small and animals do not look happy . at all. The most shocking cage was for the biggest animals in the zoo - . bears. 'The tiger's cage was also really small, but no tiger was . present, maybe he was inside what looked like a nightmarish doghouse . with tiny windows. 'All in all, a terrible experience. 'You don't get even close to a feeling of visiting nature, instead it looks like a tiny and filthy prison. 'This zoo is an utter disgrace. I do not get how it is still open.' Trapped: Some of the animals, used to roaming free, like the monkeys (pictured), are kept in incredibly small cages so that visitors can be ensured a better look . Other animals from the zoo's collected 55 species are left to roam around the zoo's grounds . Another visitor said 'this is a terrible place for animals that live in small cages - they look shabby and depressed'. And one reviewer just simply wrote: 'Ces't monstreux.' (It is monstrous) Because of the terrible conditions, the zoo has suffered a bad reputation for animal mistreatment for years. Many campaigns have been started against it, including that of local animal rights activists under the Marjan civic group, who have been trying for years to have the zoo closed. Many animals are simply left to socialise in indiscriminate areas, mixing in bizarre combinations because the number of cages are not sufficient enough . The groups have been trying to get . the zoo closed since 2006, to some success a few years later as the . managers decided to stop accepting or bringing in new animals. However, it wasn't until now that they decided to close it. Marjan's leader, Srdjan Marinic, told Jutarnji List: 'Bears live in a small concrete enclosure. 'Until recently there were five . wolves in a cage and they had so little room that they constantly . attacked one another.' Croatia: The zoo is located on top of a hill in the Croatia's second largest city, Split. It has been open since 1924, and people have been trying to get it closed since 2006 because of the animal's conditions . Reviews: One of the tourists claimed that while the zoo boasted excellent views of the surrounding city, it also said the animals would cause 'sights that would fill eyes full of tears' Once closed, the zoo will be made into . a recreational park, featuring a playground, botanic garden and an . enclosure for domestic animals, according to the deputy mayor. The city in the southern Adriatic attracts hundreds of tourists from all over the year, especially in the summer. Its popularity comes from both its Roman-era heritage and proximity to the popular Croatian islands surrounding it.","Animals in Croatia's Split Zoo are kept in cramped, dirty cages .

"Former vice president Dick Cheney believes that a terrorist attack even worse than the destruction of the twin towers on September 11, 2001 is probable before the end of the decade. Cheney appeared on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show on Tuesday and was asked if he thought the United States would ‘get through this decade without another massive attack on the homeland.’ ‘I doubt it,’ Cheney said. ‘I think there will be another attack and the next time I think it’s likely to be far deadlier than the last one. You can just imagine what would happen if somebody could smuggle a nuclear device, put it in a shipping container, and drive it down the beltway outside Washington D.C.’ Scroll down for video . Former vice president Dick Cheney appeared on Hugh Hewitt's radio show on Tuesday and was asked if he thought the United States would 'get through this decade without another massive attack on the homeland' Hewitt wondered if the government could continue in such a scenario and Cheney recalled a Cold War era plan for constitutional government in the event of a nuclear attack. ‘Basically, it involved having a government in waiting if you will ready to go in the event of  nuclear attack on the United States so that we could always maintain the constitutional-based governmental authority,’ he explained. ‘We operated and actually trained under circumstances of how would we go about providing for a government to survive if we were having nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union falling all over the country.’ Cheney and his daughter Liz last week announced the launch of The Alliance for a Strong America, which they’ve described as a ‘grassroots organization that will advocate for a restoration of American strength and power.’ Video: Dick Cheney predicts a terrorist attack 'far deadlier' than 9/11 . Harsh: Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for Obama's handling of the insurgency in Iraq . The Cheneys have posted a video to . YouTube about their organization, which the video’s description says . will attack 'the dangerous policies of the Obama Administration' and . promises to keep 'policies necessary to protect the nation' in the . spotlight. Concerning the current situation in Iraq, the Cheneys oppose the president's plan for the uprising and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to grow. 'Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense . of so many,' the Cheneys wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last week. 'Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is . ""ending"" the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—as though wishing made it so. 'His rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad . ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final . proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not ""decimated."" They are emboldened and on the march.' Fore! The Cheneys say that while the situation in Iraq escalates, Obama is playing golf and talking about climate change . The Cheneys contend that the uprising in . Iraq is not just a threat to Iraqis, but to Americans, as well, as the . country could become a safe-haven for al Qaeda and other terrorist . groups that could carry out 9/11-style attacks on the U.S. and its . allies. The Cheneys mention trips they've been on to the Middle East, where government officials are confused as to what Obama has been doing in the region following the wars in Irag and Afghanistan, and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the U.S. has in the Arab world. 'In one Arab capital, a senior official pulled out a map of Syria and . Iraq,' the Cheneys write. 'Drawing an arc with his finger from Raqqa province in northern . Syria to Anbar province in western Iraq, he said, ""They will control . this territory. Al Qaeda is building safe havens and training camps . here. Don't the Americans care?"" 'Our president doesn't seem to. Iraq is at risk of falling to a radical . Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change. 'Terrorists . take control of more territory and resources than ever before in . history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent . to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present . danger to the United States of America.' Brutal: ISIS crucified this man and left a note on his body saying 'Cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country . After the Iraq War, the Cheneys say al Qaeda was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved, Obama pulled the U.S. out of the unfinished conflict, according to the Cheneys. Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some . residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help . secure the peace. Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching . American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. The Cheneys cite a Rand study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of Salafi-jihadists between 2010 and 2013. They say that 'in the face of this threat, Mr. Obama is busy ushering America's adversaries into positions of power in the Middle East.' 'First it was the Russians in Syria. Now, in a move that defies . credulity, he toys with the idea of ushering Iran into Iraq,' they write. 'Only a fool . would believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the . world's largest state sponsor of terror.' Violence: The number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since the uprising began is in the thousands . They write that there is 'a dire need for American leadership around the world' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over. 'It is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths: America . remains at war, and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while . our enemies stay in the fight does not ""end"" wars. Weakness and retreat . are provocative. U.S. withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts . our own security at risk,' the Cheneys write. They went on to quote former President - and conservative hero - Ronald Reagan. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan said, ""If history teaches anything, it . teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our . adversaries is folly. It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering . of our freedom."" President Obama is on track to securing his legacy as . the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom.","Former vice president .

"Shares in the global cruise firm that owns the Costa Concordia fell 21 per cent today, wiping nearly £1billion from its market value. Analysts have suggested that the disaster off Giglio, Tuscany, could reduce the company's profits by a tenth this year. The timing of the fatal sinking could not be worse for the business, as January to March is the so-called 'wave season' - accounting for about a third of all bookings. Disaster: At least six people were killed after the Costa Concordia, owned by Carnival Corporation plc, ran aground off the island of Giglio, Tuscany . Investigation: The fatal crash saw £1billion wiped of Carnival Corporation's market share this morning . Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns the Costa Cruises business in which the stricken Concordia operates, is the world's largest cruise ship operator. It owns 11 brands, including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises. It is a dual-listed company, with headquarters in Southampton in the UK and Miami in the U.S. It can trace its origins back to the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which was founded in 1822 by Brodie McGhie Willcox, a London ship broker. Carnival Corp & plc was formed in 2002 when Carnival Corp, the U.S. side of the business, controversially merged with P&O Cruises plc. Run aground: A great tear was opened up in the side of the Costa Concordia on Friday after it hit rocks off the island of Giglio . Global: Carnival Corporation owns 11 brands, including Costa Cruises like those provided by the Costa Allegra (pictured), and is the largest cruise liner operator in the world . In its last update, Carnival Corp & plc recorded profits of £141million in the quarter ending November 30, down from £162million a year earlier. From its humble beginnings as an Italian family firm, Costa Cruises has risen to become Europe's top cruise operator. But it has been plagued by a history of accidents and scandal aboard its 15 ships. One collision caused the deaths of three crew members, while a near-miss prompted an investigation into the company and its safety record. And in 2008, the Costa Concordia itself hit the dockside in Palermo, Sicily, in bad weather - causing damage to the bow, though no one was hurt. It is not known whether the same captain was sailing it. Impact: The Carnival Corporation & plc headquarters in Miami, Florida. The company could lose a tenth of its profits in 2012 after the disaster . More seriously, the Costa Europa crashed in 2008 as its captain tried to dock at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt in high winds, killing three crew and injuring four passengers. At the time, an unnamed maritime official blamed '100 per cent human error', but Costa insisted bad weather was the cause. Later that year, power failure was blamed for the Costa Classica smashing into a cargo vessel in China's Yangtze River, injuring three people. The cruise line has also been plagued by reports of ineffective equipment and scandal. Investigation: Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, is facing charges of multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship . In 2008, the Costa Atlantica developed steering problems. Separately, a crew member was arrested on a charge of possessing and importing child pornography. The following year, the cruise line was fined £23,000 for deceptive advertising and there was a near-mutiny on the Costa Europa over engine problems. There was also a fire on the Costa Romantica in the generator room which led to 1,429 passengers being evacuated. Costa's safety record was called into question after a near-miss in the Channel in 2008. The crew of the Costa Atlantica almost collided with a car transporter and was criticised by the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch in an official report for failing to obey the waterway's strict two-way traffic system. Costa began as a cargo shipping firm but carried passengers from 1947. In 2000 it was bought by Carnival Corporal. The firm owns a combined fleet of more than 100 ships, has a 49 per cent share of the total worldwide cruise market and made £1.3billion profit last year.","Shares in company that owns Costa Concordia fall 21% .

"A court ruling that a jobless graduate was unlawfully forced to do work experience at Poundland could lead to benefit claimants demanding compensation totalling more than £40million, it emerged today. Cait Reilly complained she was subjected to ‘forced labour’ which breached her human rights after being told she risked losing her Jobseeker’s Allowance if she refused to work for nothing at the discount store. The Appeal Court yesterday backed key parts of the geology graduate’s claim and quashed the regulations that underpin the Government’s back-to-work schemes which have helped thousands of unemployed benefit claimants find jobs. University graduate Cait Reilly has today won her Court of Appeal claim that requiring her to work for free at a Poundland discount store was unlawful . Cait Reilly was backed by three judges in London who ruled that the regulations under which most of the Government's back-to-work schemes were created are unlawful and quashed them . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan . Smith called the ruling ‘utter madness’ and said he had ‘no intention’ of paying compensation to any claimant who declined to join a scheme and . had their benefits docked as a result. Ministers also announced an immediate . legal appeal and pushed emergency regulations through Parliament to . prevent the schemes collapsing. Letters were being sent to one million . benefit claimants last night warning them that the ruling did not mean . they could pull out of work placements. Miss Reilly, 24, has landed a part-time . job at Morrisons following her two-week stint in November 2011 stacking . shelves and sweeping floors at Poundland, which she branded ‘a complete . waste of my time’. She was hailed a hero by Len McCluskey, general . secretary of the giant Unite union. And TUC chief Frances O’Grady said . the court judgment ‘blows a big hole through the Government’s workfare . policies’. Work experience scheme - For 16 to 24-year-olds. Scheme offers a work experience placement with a business for two to eight weeks. Job seekers volunteer for the course but they must continue to look for permanent jobs. These placements can become apprenticeships and lead to potential employment later.Sector based work academy places - Open to people of all ages. They are voluntary to join and can last for six weeks, including training and then four weeks' work experience, tailored to local job vacancies. They end in a guaranteed job interview. Jobseekers can still claim benefits but once they get a place attendance becomes mandatory and face losing benefits if they don't attend.Mandatory work activity - Placements are usually for people who have been unemployed for more than 13 weeks.  Each placement can last up to four weeks. People can still receive benefits but can face losing them for 13 weeks if they fail to attend.Work programme - is open to anyone and is the backbone of the government's back-to-work policy.  If you are 18-24, nine months after you start to claim jobless benefits you are required to attend the Work Programme. If you are above 25 years old, 12 months after you start to claim jobseekers' allowance you are required to attend. It is delivered by companies and charities appointed as service providers by the DWP.Post work programme - expected to start this year, it will be for those who have been through the Work Programme and have still not found a job. Participants will be expected to accept ongoing case management or a community action placement - a mandatory six-month work experience placement tailored to your local communities needs. Anyone who fails to attend without a good reason faces losing their benefits. But Mr Duncan Smith said he was . determined to press ahead with schemes designed to get people back to . work – and would continue to strip benefits from those who refused to . take part. The Work and Pensions Secretary said: ‘I fundamentally . disagree with the ruling in this case and will fight it all the way. Our . work experience scheme is a huge success and the young people I speak . to who have volunteered to take part find it hugely rewarding and . helpful. ‘People who are fit for work should no . longer expect to receive benefits in return for doing nothing. We want . people to be ready for work and we are trying to help them. ‘To try and liken this to “slave labour” is frankly insulting to anyone living in oppression around the world . and to the hard-working taxpayer here who pays for benefits. Miss Reilly had to leave her voluntary work at a local museum and work unpaid at the Poundland store in Kings Heath, Birmingham, under a scheme known as the 'sector-based work academy' ‘Yet when the Government recommends that . someone who is out of work and capable of working should undertake a . work placement, we are taken to court for breaching human rights? This . strikes me as utter madness.’ Miss Reilly, from Birmingham, and . 40-year-old unemployed HGV driver Jamie Wilson, from Nottingham, . succeeded in their claims that the Government’s unpaid work schemes were . legally flawed. Their solicitors said the ruling meant . that ‘all those people who have been sanctioned by having their . Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) withdrawn for non-compliance with the . back-to-work schemes affected will be entitled to reclaim their . benefits’. The DWP last night said up to 150,000 people had had their benefits stopped for failing to take part in schemes. In his ruling, Lord Justice Pill said he agreed there was an 'important public interest in getting people back to work' as well as a 'major saving in not having to pay Jobseeker’s Allowance, and possibly other benefits.' The judge also said he appreciated there could be a substantial saving of public money if effective sanctions are available when jobseekers are not cooperating with proposals. He added: 'The Secretary of State’s object in these proceedings is not to end jobseeker’s allowance but to ensure that it is only paid to those actively seeking employment and prepared to cooperate with attempts made by the state to achieve that end. The entitlement to receive the weekly sum should depend on such cooperation.' But the judge said it was a matter of 'statutory construction'. Declaring the regulations unlawful, he said they must be quashed since their central purpose was to . impose 'requirements' on claimants of jobseeker allowance and impose sanctions for . failing to comply. He said: 'Claimants must be made aware of their obligations and of the circumstances in which, and the manner in which, sanctions will be applied.' Payments can be stopped for anything . from two weeks to three years, although the typical sanction for a first . offence is four weeks. Officials refused to say how much compensation . might potentially be involved as ministers were determined not to pay a . penny. But if those involved had their £71-a-week JSA payments stopped . for an average of four weeks the bill would top £40million. Miss Reilly . said she was ‘delighted’ by the judgment, adding that it was unfair for . benefit claimants to be expected to work without additional pay. She said she had been forced to give up . voluntary work at a museum to attend the work experience at Poundland, . which she said had not provided her with any training. ‘I don’t think I . am above working in shops like Poundland,’ she said. ‘I now work part . time in a supermarket. It is just that I expect to get paid for . working.’ Her claim that compulsory work . experience breached her human rights was thrown out by the court. Lord . Justice Pill said he accepted there was an ‘important public interest in . getting people back to work’. But judges accepted her case that the . DWP regulations underpinning seven back-to-work schemes were unlawful. They ruled that the regulations, introduced in 2011, did not comply with . separate laws setting out the power of the DWP to stop people’s . benefits. Claimants were also not given enough detail about what sanctions they would face if they refused to take part. The DWP said precise figures on the . number of people helped back to work by its schemes were not yet . available. But of almost 65,000 people placed on work experience between . January 2011 and May 2012, about half were no longer on benefits 13 . weeks later. The DWP said studies had found that, . after 21 weeks, work experience participants were 28 per cent more . likely to get a job than those who chose to languish on benefits.","Cait Reilly has won her Court of Appeal claim that requiring her to work for free at a Poundland discount store was unlawful .
She and unemployed HGV driver Jamieson Wilson, from Nottingham, both succeeded in their claims, in the legal aid-funded case .
The move could lead to compensation claims of up to £40million .
The ruling will not affect the schemes’ existence but will mean the way in which they are written and enforced will need to change .
Lawyers say today's ruling could mean those whose benefits were stripped for refusing part in back-to-work schemes could now reclaim them .
But DWP say it is 'adamant there are no grounds for repayment'"

"Kashmiris were glued to their mobiles today after the authorities in the restive Indian state revoked a ban on text messages. The four-year-old SMS ban was introduced in response to political unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, an autonomous Indian state, parts of which are disputed by Pakistan. The ban has now been lifted, at least partly because of improvements in the security situation. Some observers say that the state government is also wooing voters ahead of elections later this year. :-) Indian students use their mobile phones to send a texts in Jammu, the winter capital of Kashmir after local government lifted the ban on Short Messaging Services (SMS) on prepaid cell phone subscribers . Chief Minister Omar Abdullah instructed telephone companies to restore the service from today, a government spokesman told BBC News. The ban had affected only users of pre-paid mobile phone packages, but with 70 per cent of Jammu and Kashmir's mobile users on such plans it had wide-ranging effects. A blanket ban on texting was imposed in 2010 when the murders of three Muslim civilians by the Indian army led to massive street protests which descended into riots that shook the Kashmir Valley. There were claims that mass text messages were being used to to spread rumours which were whipping up emotions among protesters during the unrest. Then ban was lifted for mobile users on contracts six months later, but pay-as-you-go customers were still restricted. The decision to revoke the ban comes days after Mr Abdullah - who is half British and was born in Essex - sought policy proposals over social in a bid to win over electorate before assembly elections. 'The government was already considering this,' Tanvir Sadiq, an adviser to Mr Abdullah, told the BBC. 'All aspects were reviewed and it was found that the security situation has improved and there was no need to keep the text messaging blocked.' But it also became clear that the ban had outlived its usefulness now that a range of smartphone apps which offer users alternative ways to communicate. Suresh Kumar, Jammu and Kashmir home secretary, told dna India: 'There was no relevance of ban since there are other ways like WhatsApp services available.' Labourers hold the banner of a mobile network company advertising SMS to pay-as-you-go customers after the ban was lifted today in response to public demand and in advance of regional elections later this year . Kashmiris had also taken to the streets in protests against the ban organised by opposition leader Mehbooba Mufti, and various rights groups had challenged it in court. Jammu and Kashmir is the only state in India which enjoys special autonomy from the central government. It has been in the grip of an anti-Indian insurgency since 1989 and has been the spark for at least three wars with Pakistan, which disputes Indian control of the territory.","Authorities say improvements in security prompted the lifting of the ban .

"3D printing has been used to make household objects and even guns, but now a team of engineers has created a futuristic car using the additive manufacturing technique. Urbee 2 is designed to be highly efficient and lightweight as well as reasonably cheap and simple to reproduce, although it will be a few years until it goes on sale. The teardrop shaped car’s shell and interior is made from 3D printed plastic parts, which is ideal for creating lightweight structures, while its engine and chassis are metal. Urbee 2 has a 3D printed shell and is designed to be highly efficient and lightweight as well as reasonably cheap and simple to reproduce . The teardrop shaped car’s shell and interior is made from 3D printed plastic parts and hybrid engine and chassis is made of metal. The vehicle generates a maximum of 10 brake horsepower. Engineers anticipate most driving will be done under 40mph using the car’s electric motor but the engine can use the ethanol to reach higher speeds on motorways. There is no top speed for the car, which is built for endurance. The company aims to show it can do 290 miles per gallon on a two day trip across the U.S. in two years time. There is no price for the car as yet and the company believes it will take a few years more of research before it goes into production. The engineers, led by Jim Kor who heads up the company behind the vehicle, Kor Ecologic, told Wired that it takes three months to print the three-wheeled car, which holds two people. The car weighs just 1,200 pounds and the prototype model is expected to consume just 10 gallons of ethanol fuel on an epic journey across the U.S from New York to San Francisco. The team designed the car as an eco-friendly, highly-efficient alternative to today’s gas-guzzling models. ‘Today, there are one billion cars in the . world. With population and affluence rising, this is rocketing towards . two-and-a-half billion cars by 2050. If these are similar to today’s . cars, this spells disaster,’ they said. The engineers, led by Jim Kor (pictured) said it takes around three months to print the three-wheeled car, which holds two people. Here he holds a model of the vehicle and is sitting amid the 3D printed parts . ‘We believe that powering cars on renewable energy is vital to our civilisation’s survival.’ The engineers claim their vehicle is the ‘greenest practical car ever made’. They are currently raising money on . Kickstarter so that in 2015 they could demonstrate the vehicle’s fuel . efficiency, by taking just two days to drive from new York to San . Francisco using 10 gallons of biofuel to set a new world record - and . they even plan on squeezing a dog into the car with them. While the company is mulling which hybrid metal engine to use, it is thought the vehicle will have a maximum of 10 brake horsepower. Most of the driving would be between zero to 40mph using the car's electric motor, but the engine can use the ethanol to reach higher speeds on motorways .

Most of the driving would be between zero to 40mph using the car’s electric motor, but the engine can use the ethanol to reach higher speeds on motorways. 3D printing means parts for the car can be easily reproduced and can be modified as the printer can add extra rigidity in certain areas, which might be helpful in creating better bumpers that are still lighter than conventional parts, for example . The team envisions that the electrical energy stored in on-board batteries to the power electric motors could be produced using renewable energy such as solar power and is contemplating offering customers a kit comprising the car and solar panels to put on their garage so they can charge their vehicle sustainably. The engineers built the prototype car at an on-demand 3D printing facility with plenty of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) machines. These printers spray heated polymer to build up thin layers until the desired shape, described in an uploaded file of a design, is achieved. The company spent 15 years creating its first prototype and has only just started its second prototype stage. The car's shape is inspired by a water droplet and it is extremely aerodynamic . This technique means parts for the car can be easily reproduced – even if they do take a while to print – and parts can be modified as the printer can add extra rigidity in certain areas, which might be helpful in creating better bumpers that are still lighter than conventional parts, for example. 'The use of 3D printing to fabricate the body panels, interior trim and possibly structural components holds promise because material is only placed where one needs it,' the company said. The engineers claim their vehicle is the 'greenest practical car ever made'. An illustration of the 3D printed interior of the second prototype is pictured . 'It is an additive process, building the part essentially one ""molecule"" of material at a time, ultimately with no waste. This process can use many materials, and our goal would be to use fully-recycled or biodegradable materials.' The firm spent 15 years creating its first Urbee prototype and has only just started its second prototype stage. ‘After the second prototype, we would need a pilot run of 10 or so units and then an initial production run could be considered. As of today, the project still requires millions of dollars of investment before we are in such a position to sell cars to the public,’ it said. There is currently no price for the vehicle.","The U.S. engineering firm said it took three months to print the three-wheeled car, which is several years away from going into production .

"Prince Andrew will finally step down from his position as a global trade ambassador, he confirmed last night. The move follows a series of scandals, culminating with revelations about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. However, in a face-saving move, the prince will fashion himself the role of a jobbing royal with a particular interest in British business. Mixing with the stars: Prince Andrew meets Hollywood actor Tom Cruise and his wife Katie Holmes . It means he will continue to clock up miles travelling abroad at taxpayers' expense. Andrew has been dogged by controversy since he gave himself the rather grand title of UK Special Representative for International Trade and Investment in October 2001. He has been repeatedly accused of ‘cashing in’ on connections with oil-rich trading partners, of developing questionable friendships with disreputable figures and of lavishing millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on private jets and helicopters. In his annual review, published late last night, the prince put a brave face on his demotion, saying he had decided to ‘evolve’ his role to concentrate on promoting British skills and exports. He wrote: ‘As the evolution of my role continues apace…I have decided that the label I gave myself when I began this role of Special Representative has served its purpose and is no longer necessary to the work that I do today and, more importantly, in the future.’ The Duke has been dogged by accusations . of a lack of judgment about his links with billionaire Jeffrey . Epstein (right), who was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for soliciting . a minor for prostitution . While admitting he would be focusing on the UK, he stressed his work would take him to the Middle East and Asia but said that all overseas engagements would be rubber stamped by the Royal Visits Committee at the palace and the Foreign Office. The final nail in the coffin for Andrew’s envoy role was the revelation of his links with Epstein. In February photographs were published of the pair walking together in New York, after the billionaire financier had been released from jail for grooming underage girls for sex. Andrew has been the UK's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment since 2001. Here he is seen at a presentation in Hong Kong . Palace officials are known to remain jittery about the possibility of further revelations concerning his relationship with Epstein – including rumours that at least one of the women involved in the scandal may be writing a tell-all book. Andrew himself was on a ‘boys-only’ holiday in Canada, canoeing in the isolated North West Territories. He is not due to return to the country until next week. Downing Street sources confirmed they understood the prince was stepping down and made clear they had no interest in him taking on any other formal business-related role. Help or hindrance? Prince Andrew is pictured here at a military air display event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates . While they admit that Andrew has been useful in opening doors, particularly in former Soviet republics and the Middle East,  officials at UKTI were not queuing up to heap praise on him yesterday. ‘He is a very difficult man to deal with – rather pompous and one who simply refuses to listen to reason,’ said one official who asked to remain anonymous. ‘I think many people will be breathing a sigh of relief.’ But the suggestion that Andrew will sever his formal link with UKTI – which was first revealed by the Mail’s Richard Kay – will not curtail his activities. Globetrotter: Prince Andrew clocked up thousands of miles around the globe in a decade as trade envoy . One source suggested the prince wanted to become a more active advocate of London’s role as a global financial centre. Labour MP Chris Bryant yesterday described Andrew’s departure as ‘long overdue’. Mr Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister said that within the department the prince’s trips ‘were legendary – but not for the right reasons’. He said the prince insisted on travelling ‘in style’ with an entourage of at least six, including a valet equipped with an ironing board. Mr Bryant accused the prince of bringing Britain ‘into disrepute’ because of his dealings with a number of unsavoury characters. David Cameron said the prince had made a ‘major contribution’ to UK trade over the last decade.","The Duke says the role has served its purpose .

"Waiting for my shipmates to arrive, I sprawl on the deck of Nomad, a 37ft yacht, and look across the water from Gosport to Portsmouth. With a backing track of halyards clinking against masts in the marina, and the sea reflecting the sun’s evening rays, it is hard to believe this is England. Exhilarating: Sailing boats navigating  the Isle of Wight in blustery but sunny weather during Cowes week . I’m here for a five-day yachting course with Nomad Sailing, a training centre run by RYA-certified instructor Jim Barden and his sister, Lou. The pair abandoned their day jobs in 2008 to teach full-time, and lead shore-based theory classes in London and the South-East, as well as practical courses on the Solent. Families can learn with Nomad en masse ahead of a Mediterranean flotilla holiday. Ahoy! Instructor Lou Barden offers a student the benefit of her experience on one of Nomad's courses . My fellow mariners include a sailing novice from Poland, a boat-owning barrister from Eastbourne and a human resources manager from Essex. What do we have in common? Little, besides our love of the sea. But we don’t waste time on small talk: before long we’re rubbing sun cream into one another’s backs and sharing grisly details of our love lives. Instructor Jim is equipped not just with limitless knowledge, but a buoyant personality. It’s high fives all round when we get something right. Leaving Gosport bright and early on the first day, we practise our manoeuvres and then sail across to the Isle of Wight. There’s great satisfaction in navigating your way using a chart, pencil, plotter and compass. The boat is rigged with a state-of-the-art GPS system, but the RYA insists we learn the manual methods. It’s a challenge - one false tidal calculation can leave you washed up for hours. Sundowner: The sunset at Poole Harbour, where the Nomad moors up for the night . We sleep on Nomad each night, and take turns cooking. In Yarmouth, I conjure up a spag bol. The barrister delivers his verdict - the carrots should have been chopped smaller - before Jim takes us ashore to Salty’s, a packed sailors’ bar where dancing on the tables is compulsory. We journey on to Poole, where we moor up against the sea wall and sleep to the smell of fish and chips, then the pretty market town of Lymington, and over to Cowes, where preparations for the regatta are in full swing. Sail away: Sailing boats compete in Cowes Week (left); boats moored up in Lymington's pretty harbour (right) We even sail breathtakingly close to the toothy Needles. The trip proves a great opportunity for a whistle-stop tour of English seaside towns, and the hard work of our daytime sails is balanced with chilly swims, ice cream and boozy evenings. The highlight is our night sail, using nothing but lights to guide the way. My heart thumps as we slip the lines at dusk and chug from Lymington into an empty sea. ‘In one minute you should see a green buoy to starboard, flashing every four seconds,’ the skipper calls from the chart table, as the crew peer through binoculars. The line on the horizon where the sea meets the sky is indistinguishable in the dark, and it feels as though we’re floating on air. Practical courses with Nomad Sailing (01424 461185, www.nomadsailing.co.uk) run between March and November, from £245 per person. Price includes food and accommodation.","The Solent is a great place to learn to sail - but warm weather always helps .

"Champion lover: Sonko Tijan was arrested by Austrian police who found he had no less than four wives, seven fiancées and five girlfriends . A prolific lover with four wives, seven fiancées and five girlfriends has set Austria's record for bigamy. Sonko Tijan was finally caught in a honey trap at Vienna Airport after two of his wives realised they were married to the same man and complained to police. The seducer had picked up women all across the country, using them for room and board whenever he was nearby and borrowing money from them which he never returned. His downfall came after he met Sonja Maier, who believed she had found love at first sight when she was swept off her feet by Tijan after meeting him in a bar. The 28-year-old from Gambia told her he felt the same, and after a whirlwind romance - and against the advice of her family - they were married a month later. After a year of happy marriage she was pregnant and browsing Facebook when she happened across somebody with the same surname and a strikingly similar-looking husband. Curious, the delved into the woman's profile. Then she realised this woman's husband was not only similar looking, but actually identical. The fact he had the same surname as her own spouse convinced her something was wrong. 'I thought that either he had a twin I never knew about or he was cheating on me,' she said. Ms Maier got in touch with the woman to compare notes. Soon they realised that when he was with one of them, he was never with the other, and together they made a complaint to police after he vanished when they confronted him. That complaint led to the unravelling of a web of intrigue that has so far revealed 16 different women all of whom believed they were in an exclusive relationship with Tijan, including three who were married to him. The youngest of his women was 22, and the oldest 44; there is also another woman he is married to in his home country, where he also has children. Tijan used the women to provide him with a place to stay and food whenever he was in the area, and also borrowed tens of thousands of euros promising to pay it back later. He never did. Some also complained he had taken their jewellery to use as a security on loans he needed. And if a woman became too demanding on his time or for her money back, she suddenly found that he had vanished. Living by his looks: Tijan used the women to provide him with a place to stay and food whenever he was in the area, and also borrowed tens of thousands of euros promising to pay it back later. He never did . Police have now found that he kept a network of women across Austria from the western state of Vorarleberg to the capital Vienna. As well as the 15 active lovers, they believe there were many others who he used, then dumped. Winning smile: Police have also found four children Tijan has fathered with different women in Austria. Two of his current girlfriends were also pregnant . Police have also found four children Tijan has fathered with different women in Austra. Two of his current girlfriends were pregnant. Detective Patrick Maierhofer, who has made an appeal for other women to come forward, said: 'He always used the same tactics. He would look at women in bars and was always charming and attentive. 'He would also fascinate them with fanciful stories about his homeland in Africa and how he had fled horrific wars leaving his family behind - and later he would ask for financial assistance for them.' Tijan has also been accused of benefits fraud, using his women, children and fake names and photos of friends who were also black to claim thousands from the Austrian social services. He once posted online that the Austrians could not tell the difference between black men anyway. Vienna police spokesman Thomas Keiblinger said: 'He went under various names and we have released his picture at some of his names in the hope that we can contact other victims. 'They included the names Sonko Tijan, Bojang Tijan and Crang Junior. 'He claimed the money was for business ventures to help his family in Gambia. We have found that he is actually also married to a woman in Gambia where he also has a family.' Police put out an arrest warrant for him and eventually tracked him down using Facebook after discovering he was on the hunt for fresh victims. Officers arranged for a honey trap with the cooperation of a young woman he had been communicating with online to persuade her to lend him more money. In reality though she was working with police and he was arrested.","Sonko Tijan used his 16 lovers for places to stay, hot food and loans .

"Vogue Italia has worked with Asian models before but never on the cover . Sun, 23, has also featured on the cover of i-D magazine . French Vogue was the first to put a Chinese model on its cover, using Du Juan in a 2011 edition . She has starred in campaigns for Calvin Klein, Valentino and Diesel, as well as featuring on the covers of Chinese Vogue and Elle. But now Chinese supermodel Fei Fei Sun can add pioneer to her lengthy CV. The model has become the first Asian to feature on the cover of Vogue Italia - a groundbreaking development for the fashion glossy. In the UK, Sun has been photographed for the cover of i-D magazine and has featured in fashion editorial in British Vogue. Groundbreaking: The January cover of Vogue Italia features Chinese supermodel, Fei Fei Sun . Glamour: Chinese supermodel Fei Fei Sun poses for the shoot in Vogue Italia . The model also made her international catwalk debut in Britain when she walked for Mulberry and up-and-coming designer Nathan Jenden in September 2009. Since then Fei Fei Sun has walked for a veritable who's who of big names, with appearances on the Vivienne Westwood, Miu Miu, Dries van Noten and 3.1 Phillip Lim catwalks among many others. The model has also landed starring roles in some of the biggest beauty campaigns on the planet, including becoming the face of DKNY's Be Delicious fragrance and Calvin Klein's One. Although Sun and her compatriot, fellow Chinese supermodel Du Juan, have previously featured in Italian Vogue editorial, this is the first time that an Asian model has made the cover of the Italian glossy. French Vogue was the first European magazine to include an Asian model on its cover, when Du Juan appeared on an issue in 2011. Tribute: Shot by Steven Meisel, the shoot is an homage to the legendary Sixties model China Machado . Asia major: Fei Fei Sun has also taken pride of place on the cover of i-D magazine as well as starring roles in DKNY and Calvin Klein campaigns . Catwalk queen: Fei Fei Sun's runway credits include Derek Lam (left) and Anna Sui (right) It's famous for its conservative culture but Arab models are quickly catching up with their Chinese counterparts in terms of demand from big names. Although Fei Fei Sun and Du Juan are currently making waves, expect to hear much more of Morocco's Hind Sahli and Tunisia's Hanaa ben Abdesslem in future. Asked by the BBC to describe the reaction to her burgeoning career back home, Sahli said: . 'Mostly, I have had positive reactions. Most people think it's good to have a Moroccan model. I have had just a few bad reactions from people, but I don't mind - I'm happy what I'm doing.' British and U.S. Vogue have yet to follow suit by featuring an Asian model as a cover girl - but both titles are known for their use of celebrity cover models rather than catwalk stalwarts. Both, however, have featured Asian models in their fashion editorial. Indeed, Anna Wintour's U.S. Vogue caused controversy with an all-Asian shoot two years ago. The Stephen Meisel shoot, which was styled by flame-haired fashion director, Grace Coddington, and appeared in the December 2010 issue, was accused of being 'tokenist', while others questioned the premise that Asian models are 'redefining traditional concepts of beauty'. 'Traditional concepts of beauty where, exactly?' asked Huffington Post blogger, Disgrasian. 'Because there are plenty of places in the world where, traditionally speaking, Asian women have long been considered beautiful. Like in, um, Asia, for example?' French Vogue is no stranger to race-related controversy either, with the French glossy causing an uproar in October 2009 when it published an editorial shoot that included images of white models with blacked up faces. The shoot, which featured Dutch model Lara Stone, passed unnoticed in France but caused a storm in the USA, with critics describing it as 'culturally insensitive' and 'a step back in time'.","Vogue Italia has worked with Asian models before but never on the cover .

"Like man, the way to a dog's heart is through its stomach. No one knows that better than Kris Rotonda and Denise Fernandez, the couple who conceived the Doggy Cooking Network and founded online dating service YouMustLoveDogsDating.com, where pooch-loving singles can connect with potential mates. Their Doggy Cooking Network on YouTube taps into the popularity of cooking shows like The Pioneer Woman and Barefoot Contessa to show pet owners how to dish up fresh, homemade alternatives to commercial kibble. Scroll down for video . Canine cameo: The Doggy Cooking Network on YouTube teaches pet owners how to prepare healthy, homemade treats for dogs . It struck a chord as serving safe, wholesome food has become important to people putting more time, money and energy into pet care. Some animal lovers have emphasized home-cooked canine cuisine following complaints of tainted food sickening and killing pets. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports that dog and cat treats made in China have killed 1,000 dogs and sickened more than 4,800 pets since 2007. The agency has not been able to prove the chicken, duck or sweet potato jerky treats are causing the illnesses, but large retailers PetSmart and Petco plan to pull them from shelves. Dream team: Denise Fernandez and Kris Rotonda conceived and star in the Doggy Cooking Network . Worried pet owners can find easy recipes in Rotonda and Fernandez's cooking shows. In their videos, they use simple ingredients like chicken, rice and eggs to make everything from frozen yogurt bars and sweet bean rice to meatloaf birthday cake, and they incorporate food trends like organic and gluten-free snacks. 'The idea is simple. Food brings families together,' Fernandez said. 'Only people who are really devoted to their dogs are going to cook for them.' She and Rotonda are not professional chefs but display quick ways to please a pet's palate after testing the dishes out on their four dogs. Easy: Recipes require simple ingredients and cooking processes are straightforward . Dog's dinner: The finished dishes are all natural so ideal for pets with food allergies . Viewers mix along with the couple as they joke, banter and show off their finished dishes during the four-minute cooking segments. Shows are being posted once a week on YouTube, but they hope to expand soon. They started their one-of-a-kind show about three months ago. With the holidays coming up, at least one episode a month will spotlight ideas for pet recipes and gifts, Fernandez said. Mary Montufar of Mountain View, California, will build on the show's recipes to make her own creations for her 11-year-old Maltese mix, Phoebe. If the Doggy Cooking Network features chicken with carrots and peas, she will try similar alternatives, like turkey and sweet potatoes. Here's some I made earlier... Co-host Denise Fernandez pictured before a recording in her kitchen . Not so scary: The couple film a Halloween special, showing how to make holiday-themed treats for pets . The fresh food helped combat Phoebe's extensive allergies. Montufar tried all kinds of store-bought food, but none of it stopped the dog's scratching and discomfort. So she decided to give the online cooking shows a try. The ingredients are simple and cheap and the recipes are so easy that she can make a week's worth of food at a time, Montufar said. She can also get it done in the same amount of time it would take her to go shopping, she said. Best of all, the food has cut way down on Phoebe's allergies. 'It's all fresh food, so there's nothing you would be afraid to eat yourself,' Montufar said.","The show taps into a growing trend for homemade pet food .

"A mother-of-five was inspired to slim down EIGHT dress sizes after a terrifying dream in which she was left trapped in a house fire because firemen could not lift her from her burning bed. Teaching assistant Kim Lee, 40, reached 17st 3lb and wore size 26 clothing after years of comfort eating and grazing. Her uncomfortably large 36G breasts made exercise difficult. She said: . 'My breast size had caused problems since my teenage years. I had awful . shoulder, back and neck problems which wouldn’t go away. 'I . used that as an excuse not to lose weight. Being so top-heavy I thought . it wouldn’t make any difference if the rest of me was slim or not, so . the weight piled on.' Scroll down for video . Kim before she slimmed down eight dress sizes after experiencing a terrifying dream in which she was left trapped in a house fire because firemen could not lift her from her burning bed . Left: Kim before she lost weight.; Right: Kim after she shed the pounds and had a breast reduction . But then a horrifying dream, in which she . imagined being left to burn alive because no one was strong enough to . rescue her, motivated her to finally change her lifestyle. The mother-of-five from Croydon started a diet and exercise plan that saw her shrink down to the 10st 7lb, size 10 she is today. She said, 'I woke up with a start - the dream felt absolutely real. It shook me to my core. 'It was such a disturbing and embarrassing experience that I’ve hardly told anyone about it. But it was enough to get me started on losing weight for good.' Kim, who is mother to Leanne, aged 19, Amy, 15, Billy, 13, Lily, 10 and Danny, nine, with her partner of 24 years, Jamie McClatchie, 43, put on weight because of long-standing back problems caused by her top-heavy figure.

Kim (second from right) with her family (from left) Leanne, 19, Billy, 13, Danny, 9, partner Jamie, 43, Lily, 10 and Amy, 15 . 'Having children didn’t help either,' the mother-of-five admitted. 'At each pregnancy I convinced myself I was eating for two, and as the kids grew up I found myself habitually eating their leftovers and grazing at their snack food during the day.' In July 2010, when Kim was at her heaviest weight, she went to bed not anticipating the shock that awaited her. She said: 'I dreamt I was in our flat, when the whole place burst into flames. A fireman appeared at the window, and tried to lift me out of the room. 'He couldn’t get a grip on me because of my size. Then he climbed back out of the window, and left me there to die. Kim before she lost weight and dreamt she was left trapped in a house fire . 'It was terrible. I woke up with a start but was too shaken to talk to Jamie about it.' Kim decided to hit the gym and cut out sugary and fatty snacks, losing more than two stone, before she decided to give the Kickstart Fat Loss programme a try. The programme focused on eliminating sugar and starchy carbohydrates coupled with daily 10-minute workouts. Kim pictured recently, having lost weight and undergone breast reduction surgery . She said: 'As I started to lose weight, I decided to address my back problems. I went to my doctor in the summer of 2013 and asked about the possibility of breast reduction surgery. 'He was very supportive, but a consultant at the hospital told me I needed to lost another two-and-a-half stone before I would qualify for the operation on the NHS. 'I was sure I wouldn’t be able to get there but I asked my slimming consultant for support and through dieting and exercise I managed it by February this year.' Miss Lee underwent breast reduction surgery in July 2014 and has managed to maintain her slim figure by continuing on her diet programme. At her heaviest weight, Miss Lee typically ate three slices of toast with peanut butter for breakfast, followed by fried egg sandwiches for lunch, and a Chinese takeaway for her evening meal. She would snack on crisps and chocolate, with cups of coffee and cans of coke throughout the day. Today, she enjoys a boiled egg with asparagus for breakfast, with chicken salad for lunch and white fish with steamed vegetables for evening meal. She also tends not to snack. She said: 'Now that I’m slimmer and don’t suffer with back problems anymore, I feel like a completely new person. 'I used to struggle to climb the stairs and even walking was difficult - I could only waddle. Now, I’m much healthier and I can keep up with the kids much easier. 'I work as a teaching assistant in a primary reception class, so I need as much as energy as I can get, and I certainly have that now.'","Mother-of-five, Kim Lee, 40 of Croydon reached 17st 3lb and wore size 26 .

Generation Y is defined as people aged between 18 and 32. It finds that they’re moving into management at a rapid pace. Reputation: Gen Y are widely perceived as self-entitled and don¿t score particularly highly when it comes to being a team player . Tech-savvy: Compared to their Generation X counterparts, Generation Y workers are adaptable, expect flexible conditions and and familiar with using technology to do their jobs . New newly released research from EY, the global firm that includes Ernst & Young LLP suggests 87 percent of Gen Y managers have taken on a new management role in the last five years, compared with 38 percent of older Gen X managers and 19 percent of aging baby boomer managers. Gen Y workers now accounts for around a third of the American workforce. The survey found the work group are seen as being ‘entitled and concerned primarily about individual promotion.’ Workers who feel they are owed things . from their organization and that their excellence is a given, are less . likely to lead teams effectively and advocate for subordinates NBC News . reports. A 2010 study by . Paul Harvey, an assistant professor of management at the University of .

In some of the survey’s other results, it was found that Generation Y placed a high value on being flexible in the workplace. A roughly equal number of respondents from both Gen X and Gen Y said they would walk away from a job that didn't offer adequate flexibility.

"The tourist: Dennis DeJesus, 45, a logistics specialist from Florida, has been arrested on a federal charge of traveling to engage in illicit sexual activity . A Florida man has been arrested on suspicion that he made several trips to South America to have sex with underage girls and make child pornography involving masks and costumes. Dennis DeJesus, an unmarried 45-year-old logistics specialist from North Lauderdale, was arrested last Saturday on a federal charge of child sex tourism as part of an international sting operation, which also netted 11 Colombian suspects. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, federal agents rescued 55 children, some as young as 11 years old, who allegedly were forced to work as prostitutes, Sun-Sentinel reported. Some of the victims said they had been plied with cocaine and ecstasy before sexual encounters. According to police, Dennis DeJesus traveled to the Colombian cities of Bogota and Medellin several times over the past year for the purpose of having sex with underage prostitutes. The portly, bespectacled Floridian caught the attention of federal officials last month when they received a tip about his alleged involvement in 'sex tourism.' An undercover agent identified in court records as 'Todd' befriended DeJesus on Facebook, and before long the two were making plans for a joint sex-capade in Colombia. Communicating via instant messenger, DeJesus and his new 'friend’ talked about the prospect of having sex with 'fresh' girls - a code phrase they had agreed upon to signify a prostitute under the age of 18. Illicit hobby: The portly, bespectacled Floridian caught the attention of federal officials last month when they received a tip about his alleged involvement in 'sex tourism' Sex-capades: DeJesus is accused of making repeated trips to Bogota and Medellin in Colombia for the purpose of having sex with girls and making porn videos . Court records state that in September, DeJesus reached out to the undercover agent telling him that he knew a 'fresh' sex worker who charged $300 'for the whole night.' The 45-year-old North Lauderdale resident also confided in his Facebook friend that he had picked up props for their upcoming trip: costumes, masks, silk gloves and lingerie for the girls to wear in his homemade porn videos. DeJesus also allegedly revealed that he cataloged all his teen lovers in his phone, complete with each girl’s name and picture. When federal agents searched DeJesus' home in the 7800 block of Southwest Fourth Place, they allegedly discovered two X-rated videos and one photograph depicting an underage girl performing oral sex on a man. Officials also came upon a stash of lingerie, costumes and masks. DeJesus, a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, told federal investigators that he has been making bi-annual trips to Colombia since 2007 to visit friends, but he denied hiring underage prostitutes. The 45-year-old did admit, however, that he has talked to young girls online and was tempted to have sex with them. Cyber-ambush: DeJesus shared his 'sex tourism' plans involving 'fresh' girls under the age of 18 with an undercover agent nicknamed 'Todd' on Facebook . Addressing the presence of costumes intended for young girls in his house, DeJesus said he was planning to take them to Colombia as Halloween presents for his friends’ children. So far, the suspect has been charged with a single count of traveling to engage in illicit sexual activity with another person, but prosecutors say they expect to file additional charges against DeJesus. About 35,000 underage boys and girls are involved in child prostitution in Colombia, according to the Colombian Family Welfare Institute.","Dennis DeJesus, 45, a logistics specialist from Florida, charged with traveling to Colombia to engage in illicit sexual activity .

"A female employee at an Oklahoma zoo who almost lost her arm after being attacked by a tiger on Saturday morning was 'at fault' according to the park's owner. The attack occurred at the GW Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood at around 10am. The owner of the park, Joe Schreibvogel, told the Mail Online that the employee 'violated safety protocol' by placing her arm inside the tiger cage. He said there was 'no other way of avoiding this other than handcuffing my employees' hands behind their backs'. 'All I can do is train them and work with them as an employer. I can’t babysit them,' he said. Scroll down for video... Attack: An employee at the G.W. Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, was injured when she was attacked by a tiger at the park Saturday morning . Closed for a time: The zoo was expecting lots of visitors this weekend because of the cooler temperatures . It is believed the accident happened after the female worker placed her hand inside a male adult tiger cage. She was wearing a large goose down jacket which became bunched up inside the cage wire. It meant the tiger was able to grab her hand and pull her left arm through a 4-inch square hole. The Garvin County Sheriff's Office said the woman was mauled by an adult . tiger and was air-lifted to OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City. The employee, who has not been identified, is said to be in stable condition. 'Her fault': The park's owner, Joe Schreibvogel, said the employee violated safety protocol by placing her arm inside the tiger cage. She almost lost her arm in the incident on Saturday . Joe 'Exotic' Schreibvogel, said there was 'no other way of avoiding' incidents like today's other than 'handcuffing' his employees' hands behind their backs . 'I can't babysit them', says Schreibvogel about his employees . The eccentric owner, who sometimes wears sparkly clothing as he poses with his wild beasts, told the Mail Online that the animal would not be put down because 'it was not the tiger's fault'. According to Schreibvogel, the employee had 'three comments' before she was air-lifted to OU Medical Center. 'She . said it was her fault, that she wanted to come back to work and asked . us not to release her name until she had spoken to her family,' he said. The park was closed after the incident but reopened only a few hours later. An update on the park's Facebook page said the woman was out of surgery and that her arm had been saved. ‘She . has a long road of repairs ahead of her but this is a miracle and . thanks for the prayers everyone,’ said the post on Saturday evening. The park's owner said the animal would not be put down because 'it was not the tiger's fault' Schreibvogel said he did not know why the employee put her hand into the cage with the tiger . This is not the first time the GW Exotic Animal Park has been at the centre of controversy, and the 54-acre park, which is located outside Oklahoma City, has had previous run-ins with regulators. GW . Exotic is licensed by the federal government because it's open to the . public - charging admission to come very close to what Schreibvogel . calls the largest 'refuge' for 'unwanted' animals in the world. The . park is home to nearly 170 big cats: lions, tigers, leopards, and about . 800 other animals, including camels, monkeys and exotic birds. He . also runs a controversial breeding programme, selling tiger cubs - only . to zoos, he says - for up to $5,000 each and, at the same time, . cross-breeding exotics like ‘ligers’, a cross between a lion and tiger, . and even what he calls a tuliger, a mix of a liger and a tiger, . according to CBS News. However, Schreibvogel admits he does not have a background in zoology or veterinary medicine. ‘I grew up a farm kid, and that's pretty much my background,’ he told CBS. Over . the years, GW Exotic has come under scrutiny by the U.S. Department of . Agriculture (USDA) for concerns ranging from 'public contact with . dangerous animals' to a 'lack of physical barriers'. The park is home to nearly 170 big cats: lions, tigers, leopards, and about 800 other animals, including camels, monkeys and exotic birds . Records show that, in 2006, it had its license suspended for two weeks and paid $25,000 for 'facilities violations'. It is currently under investigation by the USDA for the death of 23 tiger cubs between 2009-2010, according to CBS News. The Humane Society of the United States sent an activist undercover into GW Exotics in 2011, posing as an employee. The . video, which the Humane Society calls ‘alarming’, shows Schreibvogel . smacking a cub to make it walk and other tigers being hit and dragged . across gravel. In another incident on tape, a boy was suddenly attacked while interacting with a young tiger, and began screaming. They . say at least five tigers died at the facility during the investigation – . two of them had been sick for months and ‘may have been shot by GW . employees’, according to their website. The . society also says a number of visitors at the park have suffered bites . from tigers, including one child whose bite became infected. 'Dangerous': Critics of the park, such as the Humane Society of the United States, says several people have been bitten by tigers at the park. But Schreibvogel says it is not true . However, Schreibvogel says that they have 'never had an accident here at this facility'. 'I . most confident that our visitors here at the park are safe. We have . spent milions on building our cages to where our park is safe. No one . is allowed to go into a cage with an animal,' he told the Mail Online on Saturday evening. According to Schreibvogel, today's incident should 'not reflect on exotic animals or on any zoo being safe or not'. 'We don’t know why she stuck her arm into the tiger.' Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society, says GW Exotic is ‘a ticking time bomb’. According . to CBS News, Schreibvogel responded to the comment saying, ‘It is a . ticking time bomb - if somebody thinks they're going to walk in here and . take my animals away, it's going to be a small Waco.’ He . said: ‘I have poured my entire life into what I do, to care for . animals. Nobody is going to walk in here and freely shut me down and . take my rights away from me as long as I am not breaking the law.’ The owner says he has 'poured his life' into the park 'to care for animals' A . Waco-type tragedy in Zanesville, Ohio, in October 2011, saw the owner of an . animal park, Terry Thompson, release 56 dangerous animals into the wild . before committing suicide. Forty-eight . of his animals were eventually killed by authorities concerned over . public safety, pushing Ohio lawmakers to author a bill restricting . private ownership of exotic pets. The . Humane Society is currently urging the US Department of Agriculture to . adopt regulations banning public contact with dangerous wild animals no . matter the age of the animals. Current . regulations generally allow public contact with tiger cubs between the . ages of 8 and 12 weeks, and encourage the reckless over breeding of . tiger cubs and surplus of captive adult tigers. Baby cubs: Current regulations allow public contact only with tiger cubs up to the age of 12 weeks . The . HSUS is also urging Congress to pass H.R. 4122, the Big Cats and Public . Safety Protection Act to prohibit the private ownership and breeding of . tigers and other dangerous big cats. However, Schreibvogel says a ban would not stop accidents happening. 'You . can ban public contact with animals till the cows come home, but that . doesn’t mean it stops employees from breaking protocol,' he told the . Mail Online. According to Schreibvogel, the accident was 'not the zoo’s fault'. 'An . employee made a mistake and we’re paying for it. She was an excellent . employee, and she is more than welcome to have her job back.' He said it was 'next to impossible' to hire more staff members because it was 'hard work' being employed at the park. 'You come to work here to clean cages and scoop poop. This is not about cuddling with full grown tigers, and a lot of people think that it is.' 'We have a high turn over because this is very hard work,' he told the Mail Online. Schreibvogel . said he is planning to release a six-song country-western music album, . titled Joe Exotic – The Tiger King, with music videos, on November 15 to . ‘help fund tigers in the wild’. Schreibvogel says the accident was 'not the zoo's fault' and banning contact with wild animals was not the solution . The HSUS is also urging Congress to pass H.R. 4122, the Big Cats and Public Safety Protection Act to prohibit the private ownership and breeding of tigers and other dangerous big cats .

"Senseless: Delbert Belton an 88-year-old veteran of World War II was beaten to death outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane, and police have arrested two teens in connection with the murder . The 88-year-old World War II veteran who was randomly beaten to death Wednesday likely died because he tried to fend off his attackers. Two teenage boys are charged in the bloody beating of Delbert Belton outside a Spokane, Washington ice skating rink and investigators are now suggesting the soldier—who took a bullet in the Battle of Okinawa—tried to stop the apparent robbery. Police say that enraged the teens and turned their petty theft into full-blown murder as they continued to beat him into submission with ‘big, heavy flashlights.’ ‘Our information is that the individual fought back and that may have made this, you know, a worse situation,’ said Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub in a Monday press conference. Straub was quick to maintain Belton’s innocence in the matter. ‘I'm not being critical of Mr. Belton,’ he clarified. ‘We certainly encourage individuals to fight back, and he should have. But it shouldn't have happened to begin with.’ The second fugitive teenager wanted in connection with the brutal murder was arrested morning after a four-day man-hunt. Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, was the second teen to be arrested for the murder of Belton. The teen was arrested on a 1st degree robbery and 1st degree murder warrant and was brought into custody by Spokane police to join fellow suspect, 16-year-old Demetrius Glenn, who was arrested on Thursday. Glenn's bail was set at an eyebrow-raising $2 million. District Judge Richard Leland, presiding over a packed courtroom, said the brutality of the attack and vulnerability of the victim make the high bail proper. Several other people found with Adams-Kinard have been arrested for rendering criminal assistance to the teen during his time in hiding. Scroll down for video . Demetrius Glenn, left, confers with attorney Christian Phelps. He is charged with first degree murder and first degree robbery . Glenn, pictured being led away by an officer, has pleaded not guilty . Most wanted: Police say Adams-Kinard was arrested after a four day man-hunt . He was found in a basement apartment at 500 West Montgomery in Spokane and arrested without incident at early Monday morning according to KHQ.Com. Prior to his arrest, the family of Kenan had urged him to come forward and turn himself over to the police. 'He's . out there and if anybody knows where he's at or something, they really . need to contact the family because we are trying to bring him in,' said . Kenan's Dad, who wished to remain anonymous. 'We don't want this . prolonged, we really need to get this over with and get through with . this and find out what's really the situation, of really, what happened . in this tragedy.' As soon as she heard about Adams-Kinard's arrest, Belton's daughter-in-law made her feelings on the issue known in no uncertain terms. 'You can’t go around beating people to death and think it’s OK and not pay any consequences,' Barbara Belton told the LA Times. 'They need to pay the consequences of their action, which was horrendous.' Rather than a random murder, Kenan's uncle had previously suggested the incident was more complicated than a random attack. 'They . are building it like these kids just went and beat up an old man, which . it didn't occur like that, but it is all going to come out,' Kenan's . Uncle said to KHQ.Com.

His great-nephew Allen Hills told KHQ that the veteran took him in and put him back on his feet when he hit rock bottom. 'It seems trivial, but he really did save my life. He made it possible for me to get a job and find work,' he said. 'He wasn't just my great-uncle. He was a great person, and he didn't deserve to die like that.'

Tribute: Lill Duncan takes a photo of a memorial for Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran who was beaten to death, in Spokane . Friends were left equally outraged that the serviceman would die in such a callous way. 'He put his life on the line for our country to come home and 60 years later? Get beat to death?' his closest friend Ted Denison told the Review. 'That’s not right.' Denison who knew Belton for 23 years regularly played pool with the former soldier who went on to be an aluminum worker. He worked at Kaiser Aluminum’s Trentwood rolling mill until his retirement in 1982 but remained a skilled member of the Steelworkers Union. His wife died several years ago. 'He went up there and played pool, met with some of the guys he used to work with at Kaiser Aluminum,' he told CNN. 'It's really depressing. Seems that all there is is bad news.' Police said that Belton had just arrived with a lady-friend to play pool at the lodge when he was set upon. Tribute: Friends raised a drink to Delbert Benton in the bar he was murdered outside today . 'Those . people to me are cowards,' said Denison to KXLY.com. 'They are cowards when they . beat old people that are defenseless.... They need to be caught. Period. Because that's senseless. Beating an old man, what kind of person does . that? But a wimp to me.' 'He was always there for me when I needed him,' he added. 'We'd joke . back and forth. We were always having fun, some sort of fun.' Their outrage was mirrored online. On Twitter a campaign titled Justice for Delbert Belton was spreading this morning. Actor James Woods was one high profile supporter. 'Don't let him die without anyone caring,' read one of his many posts on the killing.
