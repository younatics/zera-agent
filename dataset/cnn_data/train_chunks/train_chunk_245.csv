"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Two explosions rocked an anti-government protest in the Thai capital of Bangkok on Friday, wounding more than two dozen people, security and health officials said. The blasts went off as protesters were marching in the streets, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Pattanathabut, the national security chief. The cause wasn't immediately clear. Twenty-eight people were wounded and taken to hospitals, according to the Erawan Emergency Center, a medical unit monitoring the political unrest in Thailand. Demonstrators demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra began their latest round of rallies -- dubbed the ""Bangkok shutdown"" -- in the capital Monday. But their numbers have shrunk over the course of the week. Roughly 12,000 protesters were on the streets Friday, Paradon said. That's a fraction of the 170,000 people the government estimated had assembled Monday evening. Demonstrators say their numbers are far higher than official estimates. Outbreaks of violence have flared around the protests this week. On Tuesday night, authorities reported the nonfatal shooting of two protesters, bus burnings, an assault on police officers and an explosive device being thrown at an opposition leader's house. Akanat Prompan, a spokesman for the main protest group, said the blasts Friday were the first attack on marches in daylight on a public street. He said the first explosion took place about 30 meters from Suthep Thaugsuban, the leader of the protest group, and generated a lot of smoke. But the situation wasn't too chaotic, he said. Marchers continued on to the Lumpini Park area, one of their main rallying points. Political crisis . The protests this week caused some disruption in central Bangkok, but large areas of the sprawling capital city remain unaffected. The government has deployed about 20,000 security personnel throughout the city. Rights groups, the United Nations and the United States have called on Thai authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during the mass demonstrations. Since demonstrations against Yingluck's government began in November, eight people have died and more than 450 have been wounded, according to authorities. The country is still scarred by the severe 2010 civil unrest that left about 90 people dead. In a bid to resolve the current crisis, Yingluck dissolved the nation's parliament last month and called for new elections to be held on February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters. They have called on the Prime Minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" which would see through electoral and political changes. The opposition Democrat Party has said it will boycott the elections. Ambitious goal . Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin, a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class, particularly in Bangkok. Thaksin's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast Thailand. His supporters, known as ""red shirts,"" support the holding of elections on February 2.","The blasts hit protesters as they marched through the city .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal agent will be allowed to write a book with an insider's account of Operation Fast and Furious, reversing an earlier government attempt to block publication for ""morale"" reasons. However, John Dodson, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, won't be allowed to make money on the book. A U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the matter says the Justice Department, ATF and the Federal Bureau of Investigation will review Dodson's manuscript and, after making redactions to protect sensitive law enforcement information, will clear it for publication. However, federal employee guidelines prohibit Dodson and other active agents from making a profit from their work in law enforcement, the official said. Dodson was among several agents who claimed whistle-blower status to provide information to Congress about the controversial Fast and Furious operation. The operation run by ATF agents in Phoenix allowed suspected smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms in 2009-10. Their plan was to use the gun sales to try to prosecute major arms traffickers. However, agents had no way to track the weapons, and hundreds wound up in the hands of drug cartels. Two Fast and Furious guns were recovered at the scene of a border agent's slaying in 2010 near the Mexican border, although it isn't clear whether they were used to kill him. Dodson has enlisted the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, which last week warned the ATF that denying permission to publish his manuscript violated his First Amendment rights. The ACLU urged the ATF to change its regulations that allow supervisors to block publication for any reason. Dodson's supervisors in the ATF's Phoenix office earlier rejected his request to seek a publisher for his book in part because they said it would have ""a negative impact on morale,"" and ""a detremental effect (sic) on (ATF) relationships"" with other agencies, the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration. In an October 8 interview with Chris Cuomo, host of CNN's ""New Day,"" Dodson rejected the claims about morale or about the ATF's relationship with other agencies. ""I think what happened, what we were doing, what the agency was doing, the Phoenix field division, the operation itself, I think that is what is harmful for morale,"" Dodson said. ""I think that is what is a detriment -- to not only our relationship with other federal agencies, but our relationship with the American people and their trust in us."" The Fast and Furious operation gave rise to more than a year of political controversy for the Justice Department, and eventually prompted House Republicans to sanction Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress in a legal dispute over the White House's refusal to turn over documents. Holder has said tactics used in ""Fast and Furious"" never should have been allowed. Dodson said he suffered retaliation after providing testimony to Congress. Justice Department documents released in the congressional investigation showed that Dodson sought permission from supervisors to use some of the same tactics he later criticized in Fast and Furious. Dodson told congressional investigators he did so assuming that his request would be rejected and that then he could point out the problems in Fast and Furious. Instead, his request was approved. After Dodson last week complained about his book being blocked, ATF officials acknowledged that his supervisors had noted morale as one reason. However, the agency said the rejection was ""not about 1st Amendment rights. This is about a current employee trying to profit financially from knowledge he has gained while currently employed as a special agent."" The ATF cited federal ethics rules that state: ""An employee, including a special Government employee, shall not receive compensation from any source other than the Government for teaching, speaking or writing that relates to the employee's official duties.""","John Dodson, an ATF agent, wants to write an insider's account of the U.S. operation .

"Washington (CNN) -- Law enforcement and medical personnel rushed to Washington's National Mall on Friday afternoon to assist a man who reportedly set himself on fire. The man was taken to a hospital and is in critical condition, said Maj. Patrick Smith with U.S. Park Police. Officers rushed to scene after receiving a 911 call and found the man engulfed in flames, according to Smith. Office Hugh Carew, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department, said police will investigate whether the injured man intentionally set himself on fire. Adam Stifel saw part of the incident while he was jogging. ""I saw a man sitting in flames,"" Stifel told CNN. ""He had already doused himself in gasoline, I believe."" Stifel said five or six people used their shirts to pat out the fire. He said he saw a red gasoline canister near the man. The incident occurred near the National Air and Space Museum. The man was airlifted out to receive medical care. No information was available on the man's identity or whether he was part of a protest group. The location where the man was found on fire is about six blocks from the U.S. Capitol, where a high speed car chase on Thursday ended with a woman being shot and killed by law enforcement officers.

"(CNN) -- Ted Ligety's winning streak in the giant slalom is over. Ligety made it four victories in a row last week in Beaver Creek, Colorado to become the first man since legendary Italian Alberto Tomba more than 20 years ago to achieve that feat but his race was quickly over in Val d'Isere, France on Saturday. Starting first in the first run -- usually not an enviable bib number -- the American went wide on a turn and couldn't make the next gate on the icy Face de Bellevarde. The last time he finished off the podium in the giant slalom was in 2012 and he failed to make the 30-man second run for the first time since 2009. ""Just a little bit (of) bad luck on my part today,"" Ligety told reporters. ""This course is always super, super bumpy and miserable to ski so I wasn't surprised by that at all. ""It's not ideal. It's the kind of hill where anything can really happen, because it's such a tough and rough and bumpy hill."" Former overall champion Bode Miller -- second behind teammate Ligety in Beaver Creek -- and current overall leader Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway also couldn't complete the first run. Austrian Marcel Hirscher took advantage of Ligety's mishap to win, rallying from a 0.41-second deficit after the first run to cruise past Thomas Fanara of France and Stefan Luitz of Germany. Frenchman Alexis Pinturault, the leader entering the second run, slipped to fourth. Gut seventh in St. Moritz . In the women's Super-G in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein -- who registered two second-place finishes in Lake Louise, Canada last week -- beat surprise package Kling Kajsa of Sweden by 0.31 seconds. The win was a birthday gift for Weirather's mom, Hanni Wenzel, a gold medalist in the slalom at the world championships in St. Moritz in 1974. ""It's an awesome story to win here today in front of my mother on such a special day,"" Weirather was quoted as saying by the website of alpine skiing's governing body. ""The goal was to give her a nice present."" Kajsa finished on the podium from a starting position of 44th but overall leader Lara Gut of Switzerland only managed a seventh. Weirather is now fewer than 40 points behind Gut in the overall standings. Two months ahead of the Sochi Olympics, Lindsey Vonn elected to sit out this weekend's races.

"(CNN) -- A liner carrying nearly 2,000 passengers ran into trouble Saturday in Finland's Aland archipelago in the northern Baltic Sea. Viking Line said its liner, M/S Amorella, had ""touched slightly aground"" at about lunchtime local time. None of the 1,945 passengers was injured and the situation on board the ship is calm, a statement on Viking Line's website said. The company plans to try to move the ship to the port of Langnas on Saturday evening. The ship is not letting in water, but a small leak has been observed on a ballast tank that normally holds water, it said. All the passengers remain on board and are safe, it said.

"Decatur, Indiana (CNN) -- It's a grim topic: What would you want if you were on life support after a life-altering accident? Would you want to live in a wheelchair, or would you want to die? An Indiana deer hunter and father-to-be who was left paralyzed after falling from a tree chose the latter, state authorities said Wednesday. Timothy E. Bowers, 32, of Decatur was hunting Saturday afternoon when he fell about 16 feet to the ground from a tree stand, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources said. Bowers suffered a spine injury and paralysis, authorities said. On Sunday, he chose ""to remove himself from life support systems,"" the department said in a statement. He died that evening. Bowers was a newlywed; he married Abbey Logan on August 3. The Haggard-Sefton & Hirschy Funeral Home of Decatur said memorials could go to the couple's Baby Bowers Education Fund. His widow is expecting a baby, family friend Bill Whitright told CNN. ""The last thing he wanted was to be in a wheelchair,"" the Indianapolis Star quoted Abbey Bowers as saying Wednesday. ""... He would never be able to give hugs, to hold his baby. We made sure he knew that, so he could make a decision. Even if he decided the other thing, the quality of life would've been very poor. His life expectancy would be very low."" ""He had such a strong faith that it didn't surprise me (that he made the decision),"" Whitright said. ""He was ready to go to heaven, he was ready for God."" ""Tim was like a brother to everyone. He was just a great man. I learned a lot from a 32-year-old kid,"" Whitright said. Medical ethicist Arthur L. Caplan of New York University said Bowers' death is a reminder that young people need to deal with difficult end-of-life decisions just like older adults. ""I know it's hard,"" he said. ""Talk to your friends; talk to your family. Say, 'This is what I would want.' "" It's best to have the conversations now, he said. Some people who are asked in the hospital if they want life support removed might change their minds after a few days. In this case, Caplan said, Bowers' hospital decision matched his prior discussions about living in a wheelchair. All-terrain wheelchair helps disabled get back on track . Tributes have flooded the funeral home's website. ""To the entire family so sorry for your loss,"" wrote Dean Dubach. ""Tim was a good person. I just talked to him in the grain line. He said he was so happy with life, beautiful wife, baby on the way, business was good, crops were good. God bless the family."" Bowers owned and ran 5 Points Transmission shop in Decatur, the funeral home said. ""He would do anything for you. He had his transmission business, and if you had a wreck and couldn't afford to pay him, he would fix it anyway,"" Whitright said. Bowers' decision to end his life prompted many comments on social media. ""Tim was a great guy"" who always took time to help customers in need, Aaron Cowans wrote on Facebook. ""I'm guilty of not wearing my safety belt,"" he wrote, adding that he hopes everyone will get something good out of the loss. State conservation officers urge hunters to always wear a safety harness when climbing up or down tree stands and to use a haul line to move equipment up and down. The state offers a checklist for deer hunters, which includes practicing tree stand climbing and using a safety harness. This year, Indiana has seen seven tree-stand falls, with Bowers' fall being the only one classified as a fatality, said conservation officer Lt. William Browne. In 2012, the state recorded 28 such falls, including one fatality. In 2011, 22 falls occurred, Browne said. Paralyzed UK man dies after losing assisted-suicide case .

"(CNN) -- Swiss scientists say levels of polonium-210 measured in the personal effects and body tissues of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ""moderately"" support a proposition that he died of polonium poisoning. The findings released by the University Center of Legal Medicine of Lausanne -- first reported Wednesday by Al Jazeera -- do not address how Arafat, who died in 2004 at age 75, might have been poisoned or who might have done it. The report comes a year after Arafat's widow, suspecting he was poisoned, had the body exhumed for tests after the radioactive isotope polonium-210 was found on some of his personal belongings in 2012. The Swiss center said it identified ""significant quantities"" of polonium in biological stains on those belongings. Some polonium also was found in samples of remains taken during last year's exhumation, it said. What polonium does to the body . The scientists' findings may renew controversial allegations over how Arafat -- the most prominent face of Palestinian opposition to Israel for five decades -- died. The Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank, has said Israel would have been behind any poisoning of Arafat, who was regarded by many Palestinians as a father figure. ""I believe that all fingers are pointed at the Israeli occupation ... who have experience in such cases of poisoning,"" said Wasel Abu Yousef, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Yousef called for a ""criminal international committee"" to be formed to investigate the report. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday that any such accusation would be ""utter nonsense."" ""This is nothing to do with us, and for the moment they refrained (from) making accusations,"" Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said. ""They know why -- there's no strictly no connection to Israel."" The Swiss center pointed out some caveats: . -- The testing was based on ""very small specimens."" The center noted that blood, urine and other specimens were destroyed after Arafat's hospitalization. -- Eight years passed between the death and the exhumation. Because polonium-210 has a half-life of just 138 days, its detection after eight years is ""very difficult and subject to uncertainties."" -- The ""chain of custody"" of Arafat's personal effects -- from the time he died and when the center began to study them in 2012 -- is unclear, it said. Paddy Regan, a professor of radionuclide metrology in the physics department at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England, agreed that the years that have elapsed since Arafat's death make it more difficult to estimate how much isotope was there originally. ""It's like a blindfolded man holding the tail of an elephant and using that to estimate the weight of the elephant,"" Regan told CNN in a telephone interview. ""You can do it, but there is a huge amount of extrapolation involved."" And the mere presence of the isotope -- in amounts significantly higher than what occurs naturally -- does not necessarily mean that that is what killed Arafat, he added, citing the scientists' measurement of a urine stain on Arafat's underwear. ""If you were being cynical about such a thing, if you wanted to put a false trail out there, you could put a tiny amount of polonium 210 on that urine stain,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that the urine stain came from inside him."" French prosecutors launch murder inquiry in Arafat's death . But the report expressed doubt that that could have occurred. It said that Arafat's widow had ""certified that the measured personal effects have been stored in a secured room."" And biological samples -- including from bone -- also contained a higher concentration of the isotope, said Regan, who complimented the work of the Swiss experts. ""These are good forensic scientists,"" he said. ""These results imply that, at the time of his death, Mr. Arafat had an amount of polonium-210 present in his system that would be significantly detrimental to his health."" How much would it take? ""It's a terrifyingly small amount,"" Regan said. ""The size of a grain of salt, something like that."" Arafat, who first led the Palestine Liberation Organization and then the Palestinian Authority, died in a Paris military hospital in November 2004 after suffering a stroke after weeks of illness. Palestinian officials said in the days before his death that Arafat had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but the Palestinian Authority's then-foreign minister, Nabil Sha'ath, said he ""totally"" ruled them out. French authorities -- responding to a request from Arafat's widow -- opened a murder inquiry into his death in 2012 after high levels of polonium-210 were detected on Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and his keffiyeh, the trademark black-and-white headscarf he often wore. France opened the investigation partly because Arafat died there. Forensic experts from Switzerland and Russia took their own samples for independent analysis. Radiation poisoning from polonium-210 looks like the end stage of cancer, according to medical experts. The radioactive substance can enter body by eating or drinking contaminated things, breathing contaminated air, or inhaling or ingesting bodily fluids from someone contaminated with it. A wound can also become contaminated. Russian spy dies after polonium poisoning .

"(CNN) -- An Iraq war veteran accused of fatally stabbing four homeless men in Southern California is dead, authorities said Friday. Itzcoatl Ocampo, 24, was pronounced dead the previous afternoon at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department. He had been sent there Wednesday from Orange County Jail, where he had fallen ill while awaiting trial. Deputies noticed Ocampo ""shaking and vomiting"" in his solitary cell ""and immediately summoned medical attention,"" the department said. Ocampo was charged in January 2012 with four counts of first-degree murder. The first homeless man, killed a month earlier, was stabbed more than 40 times with a 7-inch, heavy-gauge Ka-Bar Bull Dozier knife, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said. ""In each of these cases, the violence, the number of stabbing wounds of each victim, increased,"" the prosecutor added. The next month, Ocampo was arraigned on new charges that he killed the mother and brother of an old friend. Authorities say 53-year-old Raquel Estrada was stabbed more than 30 times and her 34-year-old son Juan Herrera more than 60 times on October 25, 2011, their bodies left in pools of blood inside their Yorba Linda home. The accused killer was being held without bail, with his next court appearance scheduled for January 17, 2014. His death is under investigation ""as is protocol for all Orange County Jail in-custody deaths,"" the sheriff's department said. An autopsy is tentatively set for early next week, with toxicology tests possibly coming back in several weeks. Ocampo served in the Marines from July 2006 until July 2010, including a six-month stint in Iraq in 2008, according to military service records. He completed his service, with the rank of corporal, with the 1st Marine Logistics Group at Camp Pendleton, which is about 80 miles south of Los Angeles and 50 miles north of San Diego.

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych offered amnesty to the protesters detained after mass anti-government rallies in Kiev, the President's office said Friday. Yanukovych said authorities should ""release the arrested people and even those who have already been convicted. We should put an end to this conflict."" Ukrainian protesters, angry about the government's decision last month to spurn a free-trade agreement with the European Union in favor of closer economic ties with Moscow, have stood their ground in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, paralyzing the center of the capital. On Thursday, the European Union's top diplomat said the Ukrainian President intends to sign a deal on closer EU ties after weeks of the mass protests. The Ukrainian President made a comment to the same effect: ""We are not refusing and have not refused European integration,"" Yanukovych said. ""We went and will go on the path of reform, which will bring us closer toward European criteria."" The President criticized both protesters and police for their actions in the clashes. ""I will say frankly: I am indignant at radical actions of provocateurs and law enforcement officials that were not always adequate,"" he said. ""Different people stand for different positions, but they all are our compatriots and we must listen to them and take their point of view into account,"" he said. ""There is a common desire to make our life better."" Yanukovych spoke Friday at a round-table talk with three Ukrainian opposition leaders. Opposition leader and boxing world champion Vitaly Klitschko said Friday that his Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party will take part in the round-table talks and that he believes that the only way out of the political crisis is a complete reboot of power, namely early presidential and parliamentary elections. Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. Protesters have said an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. They accuse Yanukovych of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union.

"London (CNN) -- Two former personal assistants to celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi splashed out on luxury goods on company credit cards, a court heard Thursday. The former assistants, Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, are accused of fraud. They deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds from the couple. The first witness, Rahul Gajjar, an accountant for Saatchi, told the court in west London that Francesca had 64,336.97 pounds ($104,500) in expenses on her company credit card in June 2012. Among the expenses were purchases from designer labels Prada, Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton and Chloe as well as hotel bills and plane tickets. The court heard that Francesca's average monthly expenditures were 48,000 pounds and Elisabetta's were 28,000 pounds, whereas other personal assistants for Saatchi, a well-known art collector, spent 8,000 pounds or less a month. Gajjar said he noticed the sisters' credit card balances had changed at the beginning of 2012. Their average monthly expenditures were previously between 10,000 pounds and 20,000 pounds a month, he said. He was more concerned about Francesca's balance because it was higher, he said -- reaching about 40,000 pounds ""on a regular basis."" The prosecutor asked why he did not raise the matter with Saatchi and Lawson immediately, but Gajjar said he put it ""on the back burner"" because other matters were more pressing. ""We were dealing with more corporate matters -- more serious corporate matters -- and Mr. Saatchi and Miss Lawson normally didn't have time for what we thought were trivial matters,"" Gajjar said. The sisters were expected to make purchases for the family on the company credit card, he said, as part of their job helping the couple with personal and work-related matters. He said they had a close relationship with Lawson and Saatchi and regularly accompanied the family on holiday. After an investigation revealed the sisters' alleged personal spending, Gajjar said he met with them in July 2012 to discuss the situation. The sisters, who didn't have any housing expenses, initially said they were ""happy to start paying back"" what they had spent on themselves, he said. However, they then rejected the offer and complained of their treatment, he said. Saatchi's testimony had been expected to follow that of Gajjar, who has been finance director of the Saatchi Gallery Group, part of the multimillionaire art dealer's Conarco Partnership, since June 2002. However, it became clear there would not be time for Saatchi to take the stand before proceedings finished for the day. Saatchi is expected to testify Friday. Drugs use allegations . Isleworth Crown Court heard at a pretrial hearing for the sisters this week that Lawson and Saatchi had a ""culture of secrecy"" around their marriage. In the hearing, the defense read an e-mail from Saatchi to Lawson about the allegedly embezzled money, saying the assistants would ""get off"" because, he wrote, Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Representatives for Lawson declined to comment on the allegations, citing the ongoing court proceedings. The defense also read a statement from Saatchi saying he learned of Lawson's alleged drug use in June, around the time the couple were photographed in a restaurant having an argument. In the photos -- which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers at the time -- Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon afterward. The defense alleged that the e-mails showed both Saatchi and Lawson had attempted a ""manipulation of the court"" and that the case should be thrown out. The judge ruled the trial would proceed. The prosecution told the court Wednesday that the two sisters spent some 685,000 pounds ($1.1 million) on company credit cards over the course of four years, according to UK media reports. The pretrial hearing had heard allegations the two sisters had spent a lesser amount, about 300,000 pounds, on luxuries. On Wednesday, Lawson tweeted out a recipe, saying it was in thanks for her supporters. ""Holiday Hotcake: the perfect recipe to show thanks for all your support & to those who hashtag #teamNigella,"" she wrote. Lawson, whose culinary skills have long entranced UK audiences, has also appeared as a judge on ABC show ""The Taste"" in the United States. A second season of the show is due to air in January.

"(CNN) -- Four years ago, Beth Cirami walked into Malissa Booth's tattoo shop, mournful and anxious. Her brother had just died of leukemia, and she wanted something to remember him by. She'd gone to other tattoo shops in the St. Louis area and when she tried to explain her story -- why she was getting her first tattoo at age 37, what it meant to her -- it felt like no one listened. They told her to flip through a book and pick a drawing she liked; it just didn't feel right. ""This was a very personal piece for me. I needed that work of art,"" Cirami said. She had heard about Booth's shop, Madame Voodoo's House of Ink in Warrenton, Missouri, and decided to stop by. She told Booth that her brother died at age 45, and she wanted to honor him in some way. Cirami left Booth's shop with a pinstripe tattoo adorned with the initials of her children and a picture of a heart glass her brother gave her before he passed away. It was exactly what she wanted. ""She had that sensitivity to that reason why most people get tattoos. It is a very secret and spiritual experience,"" Cirami said. It's the kind of experience on which Booth built her business -- a family-friendly tattoo shop she opened five years ago, hoping it would feel welcoming to everybody. ""I wanted to take the smut and drama out of the image of a tattoo shop,"" said Booth, 42. ""I have children, and I didn't want to be embarrassed to bring my kids into my shop."" But Booth's entrance into the tattooing world didn't start off easy. Long before Booth started dabbling with needles and inks, she managed a call center with more than 180 employees. The single mother of three teens rose quickly at her company, but when the travel industry hit a slump, jobs were cut left and right. After sleepless nights and stressful days of hoping she would stay employed, she found herself being escorted out of her building with her belongings packed in a cardboard box, while her boss told her she'd be ""fine."" Suddenly, the years of stress, the long on-call hours felt like a waste. ""I was angry, angrier than I had ever been,"" she recalls. ""I put everything I had into that job."" After sending out dozens of job applications and not hearing back, she decided to pay her ex-husband, a tattooist, a visit. She wanted to give tattooing a shot, maybe just as a part-time job until she found her next management gig. He was hesitant to help her. ""The life of a tattoo artist is one of feast or famine,"" she said. ""He knew I had three kids to raise and that it wouldn't be stable income, but I insisted. So, he spent months making me draw."" At age 37, she quickly learned she was a rarity in the business; few middle-aged women were signing up to become tattoo artists. As an apprentice working among other artists -- all men -- she sometimes heard she was too ""soft"" to be in the industry, or too old to start learning. While apprenticing at a shop in Warrenton, she met Michael Pease, a 30-year veteran of tattooing. Pease taught Booth how to draw lines and quick sketches, techniques tattoo artists use to ink their customers quickly, ""before they change their minds,"" he jokes. Pease was impressed by Booth's persistence, despite the negativity she heard from her male counterparts. ""There are a lot of guys who don't like (female tattoo artists),"" he said. ""Art is a big egotistical thing, especially in the tattoo world."" After Booth apprenticed with him for a year, Pease encouraged her to take another step by purchasing a tattoo shop that was going on sale in Warrenton. ""If you meet her, you would understand why she would run a shop in this industry,"" Pease said. ""With her background in management, she was perfect to run the books the legal way. A lot of shops half-ass the things they do."" And she had her own ideas about how a shop should look and feel. Booth remembered apprenticing at a tattoo shop in 2008, looking up at pictures of half-naked women strung on the walls. It wasn't the kind of place anyone could just walk into, she thought. As wearing tattoos was becoming mainstreamâ€” more than 14% of people in the United States have tattoos -- Booth felt confident she could cater her business toward previously under-served clientele. ""I felt a need to create something more accommodating for women and anyone else that didn't want to feel like they were entering a shady establishment,"" she said. In her shop, there are no photos of nude girls. Instead, there are colorful paintings of wildflowers, abstract shapes, and warped skulls, it's reminiscent of Creole artwork hanging in the French Quarter of New Orleans, a place where Booth says she draws artistic inspiration. Although experts usually advise against tapping into your 401(k), Booth cashed hers out, using $12,000 to buy the tattoo shop and new equipment. So far, she says, the bet has paid off. Booth says she has seen steady success since launching her shop in 2008. She hasn't replenished her 401(k), but it's among next year's goals. ""My clientele ranges from 80-year-old women to leaders of churches and doctors and lawyers,"" she said. ""I wanted to create a shop where anyone would feel safe and like family."" It's that kind feel of that drew customers like Beth Cirami, who now refers others to the shop. ""It's a very cherished thing,"" Cirami said. ""Malissa really takes the time to produce something that is as special as the reason why you are getting it."" Booth says she's on track to grow the business, and happier now than when she worked her corporate job. ""It was very hard going from being in careers where you are at the top of your game, winning awards of excellence, being the expert at things, to being a nobody that knew nothing,"" she said. ""(Tattooing) is not a job. It's an adventure. I have no idea what each day brings and I like helping people, giving them beautiful works of art that they can be proud of.""","Mother of three Malissa Booth saw a need to open a family-friendly tattoo shop in her area.
As tattoos become more mainstream, she wanted to create a welcoming space for people.

"(CNN) -- The University of North Carolina has launched its own investigation into claims highlighted by CNN that too many of its student-athletes read poorly. Chancellor Carol Folt posted an open letter to campus, saying: ""I take these claims very seriously, but we have been unable to reconcile these claims with either our own facts or with those data currently being cited as the source for the claims. Moreover, the data presented in the media do not match up with those data gathered by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions."" The university also released some of its own data, which it claims shows that the allegations of academic problems highlighted in a CNN investigation by whistle-blower Mary Willingham are not true. Folt's letter said: ""Only two of the 321 student-athletes admitted in 2012 and 2013 fell below the SAT and ACT levels that were cited in a recent CNN report as the threshold for reading levels for first-year students. And those two students are in good academic standing."" But a larger analysis of SAT and ACT entrance exam scores released to CNN show the situation is not so bright. UNC data shows that, since 2004, the university admitted 34 players to play in the revenue-generating sports of football and basketball who scored below a 400 on the SAT verbal test, or below a 16 on the ACT reading and English tests. That's 10% of those athletes admitted under ""special talents"" to play football or basketball. Willingham reported 8% of student-athletes playing in revenue sports were reading below a third-grade level as part of a research project that was university approved. However, Willingham's research included other factors, and used a smaller sample size. On Thursday, CNN talked to a psychologist who administered the academic achievement test that Willingham used in her research, and that psychologist backed up Willingham's findings. The psychologist, who asked not to be identified, said a spreadsheet with the results of the tests was given to UNC academic support center staff each year the testing was done. ""You have to do really badly on that test to get a low score,"" the psychologist also said, noting that some student-athletes scored even lower on later evaluations. ""I have the utmost confidence in Mary's integrity and she's trying to do the right thing, and always has,"" the psychologist said. The SAT and ACT thresholds were used by CNN, after consulting several experts, to represent a reading level too low to understand college textbooks. That was the standard applied to several universities as part of CNN's national look at the reading levels of college athletes. UNC officials talked with Willingham, a learning specialist, on Monday in what they said was a ""cordial"" meeting; Willingham described it as being ""condescending."" But the university continues to dispute her findings. And her university approval to do the research was pulled Thursday by UNC, Willingham said, partly because she was aware of the identity of some of the athletes in her findings. While UNC says it will do its own review of what Willingham found, it also disputes the claim that it admitted students who could not do work at UNC. ""There have been 34 students evaluated in detail at length and we believe were capable of succeeding here,"" said Steve Farmer, UNC's director of undergraduate admissions, referring to the 10% who scored below the threshold. ""When we evaluate someone, we don't just rely on one score."" Farmer also pointed out that in 2013, no student-athletes were admitted with scores below the threshold, and in 2012, only two student-athletes in the revenue sports were admitted with scores that low. CNN first requested comment from the university on Willingham's research back in September. The university originally said it was not aware of the research, then later said the university would not comment. Only after the story was published has the university responded to CNN's requests for information. Two years ago, UNC's own internal investigation uncovered an academic scandal in which several athletes were enrolled in classes where little or no work was required. The North Carolina attorney general recently indicted a former professor who allegedly accepted money for teaching those ""no-show"" classes. Willingham, who has spoken publicly about that scandal and has received threats since talking to CNN, insists she worked with several student-athletes who would not have been able to read this article on the day they were admitted to college. ""We were going back to letters and sounds,"" Willingham told CNN, recounting stories of athletes, one who could not read multisyllabic words.","UNC will investigate claims regarding student-athletes .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters battling a California wildfire overnight progressed in making containment lines. The firefighters took advantage of the lower temperatures at night to make ""backfires"" that helped secure the containment lines, fire management spokesman Marc Peebles said. The work, however, did not change the percentage of the fire that was contained. It remained at 30% on Saturday. The Colby wildfire, as it is called, continued to burn Saturday on about 1,863 acres of foothills of Los Angeles County near Glendora. An illegal campfire apparently ignited the wildfire, and fire officials cited drought conditions as contributing to the blaze. One area resident, Korey Rowe, who moved to Los Angeles just six days, photographed the blaze and firefighting helicopters for a CNN iReport. He woke to the choppers flying over his home and then drove to see the blaze Friday. ""It was my first wildfire,"" said Rowe, 30. ""There was ash raining down all over us. I could feel the heat, it was awesome. The cops had shut the roads down."" Also Friday, California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the state, saying it is facing ""perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago."" The Colby fire began before dawn Thursday and allegedly originated with three men camping in the foothills near Glendora, authorities said. The campers were tossing paper into a campfire, and a gust of wind spread embers, authorities said. The three men, all in their early 20s, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting a fire, said police Chief Tim Staab of Glendora. One man is from Glendora and another is from Irwindale, he said. The third man's hometown was not known. Bail was set Thursday at $20,000 for each. The three men arrested were identified as Jonathan Carl Jerrell, 23; Clifford Eugene Henry Jr., 22; and Steven Robert Aguirre, 21, police said. They and their attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.

"(CNN) -- A 41-year-old Mississippi man pleaded guilty Friday in federal court months after being accused of developing ricin and sending the dangerous substance in letters to President Barack Obama and others, the U.S. Department of Justice announced. According to a plea agreement, James Everett Dutschke is expected to be sentenced to 25 years in prison. The Tupelo resident will be sentenced in by U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock in about 60 days. CNN first learned of Dutschke's plea via Twitter. Dutschke was arrested on April 27, 2013, and charged with possession and use of a biological agent as a weapon. The agreement wraps up a bizarre case that began when federal investigators first arrested another man -- an Elvis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis -- for allegedly sending letters containing ricin to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County. Ricin is a deadly toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. The letters to Wicker and Obama were stopped at a government mail-screening facility after initial tests indicated the presence of the deadly poison ricin. The one sent to Holland did not cause any illness. Mississippi man charged in ricin case . Even so, the case -- which came on the heels of the Boston Marathon bombings -- spurred anxieties around the country about such biological attacks. In a way, it recalls the days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when U.S. senators and journalists were sent anthrax-laced letters. Authorities cleared Curtis after his attorney, Christi McCoy, told authorities that she believed her client was framed, possibly by Dutschke. In fact, FBI agents were searching Dutschke's home and the studio where he practiced martial arts as Curtis walked out of jail. At the time, Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he was cooperating with the FBI and had nothing to do with the letters. ""I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters,"" he said at the time. Friday's plea shows that was not true. The Justice Department said, in its press release Friday, that Dutschke concocted and carried out the elaborate ploy -- including buying castor beans or seeds to make ricin via eBay -- then making the toxin and enclosing it in the three letters. Each of the letters had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. They read, in part: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" They were signed ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" a source told CNN. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","James Everett Dutschke pleaded guilty in ricin case .

"(CNN) -- It didn't surprise Reggie Landsberry that his brother was reportedly trying to stop a student with a handgun from shooting when he was killed. Math teacher Mike Landsberry was killed in the shooting at Sparks Middle School by a student who brought a semiautomatic weapon. The student also wounded two 12-year-old students. A witness told the Reno Gazette-Journal that Landsberry intervened at one point. Reggie Landsberry said that his brother, like their father a former Marine, probably was trying to talk the gunman out of shooting. ""That was the kind of person that Michael was,"" Reggie Landsberry said. ""He was the kind of person that if somebody needed help he would be there."" Reggie Landsberry said it was something they learned from their father, who served in the military for 22 years. His brother loved teaching and coaching at Sparks Middle School, he said. ""He was just a good all-around individual,"" Reggie Landsberry said. Mike Landsberry went to Afghanistan on several tours as a member of the Nevada Air National Guard, his brother said. Sparks Mayor Geno Martini said it was a ""devastating"" loss. ""It's very unfortunate that (the life of) someone like that, who protected our country over there and came back alive ... had to be taken at his work, at a school,"" Martini said. Landsberry joined the Marine Corps in 1986, attained the rank of corporal and served as a field wireman, Marine spokeswoman Maj. Shawn Haney said. On his school website, the teacher posted pictures of himself hiking in the wilderness and standing with a weapon beside an armored vehicle. ""One of my goals is to earn your respect while you earn mine,"" he wrote in a message to students. ""I believe that with mutual respect that the classroom environment will run smoothly."" A Facebook memorial page posted in Landsberry's honor had more than 2,000 likes by Monday evening. Friends, former students and others described him there as a great teacher and a hero. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy, Amanda Watts and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","His brother says the former Marine was someone who helped those in need .

"(CNN) -- West Virginia authorities announced Friday that thousands more water customers have been given the green light to resume using tap water after a spill that contaminated supplies and put water safety in the national spotlight. The end of the ""do not use"" order for residents in the West Virginia communities of Eskdale, Leewood, Ohley and Elkview means more than 220,000 of the approximately 300,000 people originally affected by the incident have been cleared to resume using tap water. That number was further increased Friday afternoon, when all customers in the Kanawha Valley district were given the all-clear. That's up from about 213,000 on Thursday. The chemical, 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, got into water supplies after it leaked out of a storage tank and poured into the Elk River near an intake for a West Virginia American Water Co. treatment plant. Officials detected the 7,000-gallon leak eight days ago, on January 9. More than 7,000 gallons of the chemical, which is used to clean coal, leaked into the river, according to officials. Freedom Industries, the company that owns the property from which the leak originated, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday, said Matt Hayes, clerk for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Water officials say the amount of the chemical in the water has fallen to well under 1 part per million, the level deemed safe for consumption by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A later advisory suggested that pregnant women should continue to avoid drinking the water. But concern lingers among many affected by the spill, some of whom say they will not drink the water out of fear that scientists know too little about the long-term effects of the chemical, which is not routinely tested for in water supplies. ""If a pregnant woman can't drink this ... no, we're not feeling safe here in West Virginia,"" Charleston resident Jacqueline Bevan said Thursday. CNN's Miriam Falco, Dana Garrett, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jean Casarez and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: Freedom Industries files for bankruptcy protection .

"(CNN) -- At least 61 people were killed and scores wounded Wednesday in the latest wave of attacks in the Iraqi capital and across the country. Bombings and shootings, aimed at security forces and civilians alike, made it an especially bloody day as sectarian violence flared up. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since violence broke out in Anbar province in recent days. Much of the violence recorded Wednesday was in and around Baghdad. Twenty-two people were killed and 74 were wounded by seven car bombs and two roadside bombs that exploded in the Iraqi capital, targeting mainly Shiite areas, police said. Two of the bombs detonated near a busy market in the mainly Shiite area of Hussainiya, in northern Baghdad, police said. The deadliest bombing in Baghdad was in the predominantly Shiite al-Shula neighborhood in the northwestern part of the city, where a car bomb detonated at an outdoor market, killing seven people. Violence flared outside of Baghdad, too. In Baquba, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Baghdad, 14 people were killed and 21 wounded in a bombing at the funeral of a school official, according to police. In Diyala province, gunmen attacked and kidnapped seven truck drivers in Alham village. Two hours later, the bodies of the drivers were found. At least three people were killed in violence in Mosul, in addition to seven soldiers killed in a bombing south of Mosul. In Anbar province to the west, al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraq's security forces are battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. The violence recalls the bloody fighting at the height of the Iraq war that nearly tore the country apart. Allawi: Iraqi violence could 'burn up' entire region .

"(CNN) -- There were headlines when one of Tesla's Model S electric cars caught fire in late October after the battery case was pierced by a piece of road debris. There were bigger headlines, and much speculation, when within six weeks, a second and then a third Model S fire occurred in the wake of accidents. The fires are regrettable and must be investigated. No one is suggesting otherwise. We all need to know whether there's a flaw in the Model S that must be corrected. But to use these incidents to question the viability of Tesla as a company is wrong. This is a company that has achieved the remarkable in launching a new automobile, a new propulsion technology and a new automobile manufacturing enterprise in just a few short years and against very long odds. Tesla's brilliant but often blustery chairman, Elon Musk, quickly came to the defense of his company's groundbreaking vehicle, going so far as to claim that Tesla asked the government to investigate the cause of the fires -- a claim that National Highway Traffic Safety Agency Administrator David Strickland disputes. NHTSA is investigating, Strickland said, but the agency made that decision on its own, with no request from the automaker. News about the fires has been overtaken by the announcement of NHTSA's investigation, the squabble between Musk and Strickland and the tumble in the price of Tesla's stock as investors began distancing themselves from a company that until those three fires had been a Wall Street darling. The whole thing is a shame. This has become much more than a query into a very few vehicle fires. Electric cars have been politicized and many are taking the Tesla fires as a sign that electric vehicles are too new, too different and too dangerous to be allowed on our roads. Additionally, some in the investment community and a few politicians critical of Tesla and other electric vehicle developers for using government loans have made the fires a referendum on Tesla itself. (Tesla, which received loans from the Department of Energy's new technology program, repaid its loans nine years early.) Tesla has won the backing of two big players, Toyota and Daimler, which have ownership stakes in the company. Whether it remains independent or eventually is absorbed by another carmaker, it is unlikely to end up on the scrap heap. It may transpire that Tesla needs to redesign its cars -- or at least the location or shielding of the batteries -- in order to help prevent further fires. But to turn that into an indictment of electric vehicles in general would be wrong as well. The two Tesla fires in the United States occurred when their battery cases were pierced by metal objects struck when the vehicles were moving at high speeds. The third fire, in Mexico, occurred when a speeding driver lost control and hit a stone wall. Yet while a Tesla's battery is directly beneath the car's passenger cabin, the flames were channeled to the front, where an engine would be if Teslas had gas engines. This is part of the Model S safety design. The passenger cabins didn't burn. The cars' safety systems warned the drivers to pull over and get out because something was amiss. The same type of accident involving a conventional gasoline-fueled vehicle might not have resulted in a fire. But think of the damage a hefty metal trailer hitch or length of scrap iron could do after piercing a conventional vehicle's relatively thin floor and entering the passenger cabin. It's not a pretty picture. The location of the Tesla's battery pack may well have saved one or both drivers from terrible injury in the road debris incidents, even though the cars burned. Meantime, a typical conventional car with 15 gallons of gas on board carries the explosive power of 210 sticks of dynamite. But most of us drive around all day long blissfully ignoring that deadly potential. Gasoline is the devil we know, and familiarity lets us overlook its flaws. Electric cars, though, are new and different and challenge the status quo. That makes them a target for suspicion and for criticism. We are not comfortable with things we don't know. We won't know until NHTSA completes its investigation whether the design of the Model S is inadequate. We should wait until then before contemplating obituaries -- for Tesla or for the electric vehicle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John O'Dell.","Tesla's Model S electric cars have caught fire three times in recent months .

"(CNN) -- On a single she previewed as part of a Pepsi ad earlier this year, Beyonce sang, ""I'm a grown woman / I can do whatever I want."" The singer proved that on Friday when she released a surprise album with no fanfare. Fans promptly lost it and the Internet was on the verge of exploding. Even fellow celebs seemed to have been left breathless. Singer Katy Perry tweeted, ""Don't talk to me today unless it's about @Beyonce THANX."" Added actress Abigail Breslin, ""The new Beyonce album is so perfect wow."" The 14-track self-titled album was released exclusively on iTunes at midnight and had to be purchased in its totality. Singles will not be available for purchase until December 20. In addition to the songs, there are also 17 music videos. Speaking to fans via a video on her official Facebook page, Beyonce called the project a ""visual album"" and said ""I see music."" ""It's more than just what I hear,"" she said. ""When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or an emotion, a memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies. And they're all connected to the music."" Her fifth studio album has been eagerly awaited since the success of ""4,"" which was released in 2011. Over the past year she has hinted that something new was in the works and previewed singles including ""Grown Woman,"" ""Bow Down/I Been On"" and ""Standing on the Sun,"" which served as the soundtrack for her H&M fashion campaign. The new album - which quickly shot to No. 1 on iTunes Friday - features collaborations with rapper Drake, singer Frank Ocean and author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and, of course, her husband, rapper Jay Z. Daughter Blue Ivy also makes a cameo. The bold and innovative move was hailed by critics and fans. USA Today 's Korina Lopez wrote ""It's a fully baked album, no filler remixes and re-released greatest hits. By sidestepping promotional blitz and gimmicks, this album could be her most personal yet."" According to Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times, Beyonce, her producers and writers began work on the project last summer while they were all together in the Hamptons. The end result, Kennedy said, ""is a striking collection of work that shows her torching the veil of her carefully crafted image."" ""Songs on the album jump and dive between genres and are woven together with everything from spoken word and trap raps to the coos of her daughter Blue Ivy and vintage Destiny's Child footage,"" Kennedy wrote. ""It's a lot to consume, but a revelatory look at the singer who has tirelessly calculated what she chooses to share (and it's not always much)."" Miles Marshall Lewis, the Arts & Culture editor for Ebony.com, writes that Beyonce has overshadowed some other big-name singers who have recently released new projects. ""Where pop stars are concerned, Beyoncé easily bests the latest from both Lady Gaga and Britney Spears, rivaling Justin Timberlake with a fraction of the media blitz (so far),"" Lewis said. ""Now that's a superpower."" For her part, Beyonce said in her video to fans that she was inspired by the legendary Michael Jackson. ""I remember watching 'Thriller' on TV with my family. It was an event, we all sat around the TV and now looking back, I am so happy I was born around that time,"" she said. ""I miss that immersive experience.""","Beyonce released a self-titled album as a surprise .

"(CNN) -- Michelle Knight squeezes her eyes shut and cries as she listens to the 911 call that led police to rescue her from the house where Ariel Castro held her hostage for more than a decade. In the recording, fellow captive Amanda Berry begs police to come quickly, before Castro gets home. ""Help me, I'm Amanda Berry,"" she says. ""I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."" That frantic call six months ago finally brought authorities to the Cleveland home where Berry, Knight and Gina DeJesus had been Castro's prisoners. The moment when police rescued them, Knight recalled in an interview broadcast Wednesday on the syndicated ""Dr. Phil"" talk show, was a ""roller coaster of mixed emotion."" ""I wanted to kiss the ground that I was walking on and thank God for letting me get out of that hellhole,"" Knight told host Dr. Phil McGraw. But Knight wiped away tears as she listened to the 911 call Berry made after escaping on May 6. It makes her sad, she told McGraw, because of what Berry left out when she called for help from a neighbor's house. ""She didn't mention us,"" Knight said. 'Finally being heard' Castro lured Knight into his vehicle from a Family Dollar store in Cleveland in 2002, promising to give her a ride. She endured more than a decade of torture, rape, starvation and beatings, held captive inside his home. In August, Castro was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping. He committed suicide in his prison cell in September. Knight, Berry and DeJesus have since been trying to readjust to life as free women. Knight, whose disappearance generated the least public notice of the three, has been the most outspoken. ""After 11 years, I am finally being heard, and it's liberating,"" she said in a powerful statement at Castro's sentencing, describing the abuse she endured. Knight was Castro's first victim, and her interview with ""Dr. Phil,"" which aired Tuesday and Wednesday, marks the most detailed remarks any of the women have made publicly so far about their experience. It provides a detailed glimpse into some of the horrors she suffered, her relationships with the other women, and the day when she got her first taste of freedom after 11 years in captivity. 'We thought somebody was breaking in' It started when she heard a pounding sound coming from downstairs, Knight told McGraw. Castro had gone out for the day, Knight recalled. He told them he was going to visit his mother, then buy them some food. Police were outside, trying to get in after Berry's 911 call. But at the time, Knight says, she thought robbers were coming in and she asked DeJesus to turn down the radio. ""So we're hiding, because we're scared. We're terrified. We didn't know that the cops were down there,"" Knight said. ""We thought somebody was breaking in, because it was a bad neighborhood. So we're sitting there hiding behind a dresser."" Knight says she heard an officer shout, ""Police!"" But she still didn't feel safe -- until she saw a badge. ""I just ran,"" she recalled. ""I jumped on her (the officer) and I never let go."" Knight returns to Cleveland house where she was held for 11 years . 'I had to help him drill holes in a wall' Since their release, accounts have depicted Knight as someone who cared for the other victims during their captivity while also enduring great suffering herself. Castro, Knight told McGraw, would tell her of his plans to abduct other women. ""I begged him not to bring any more there to suffer the hell I went through,"" Knight said. But it wasn't long before Knight learned that she wasn't the only captive. In 2003, Castro abducted Berry and brought her to the house. The next year, he kidnapped DeJesus. Knight said Castro made her get ready for DeJesus' arrival. ""He was telling me that I needed to help him prepare another room,"" Knight told McGraw, ""and I didn't want to prepare that room. ... I had to help him drill holes in a wall, to put the chains through, to hook us together."" The two quickly developed a close bond, Knight said. When Castro tried to abuse DeJesus, Knight said she often stepped in. ""He went to hit her and I would stop him and take the hit,"" she said. ""I would jump in front of her. ... I know how it feels to be hurt, and I didn't want her to go through that."" Delivering Berry's baby . Asked by McGraw how she feels about Berry, Knight said, ""We're OK. Not the best of friends, but OK."" She described the day when Castro forced her to help deliver Berry's baby in a swimming pool. ""He told me if the baby didn't come out alive, that he would blame me,"" Knight said. ""And at that moment when the baby didn't come out breathing, I knew if I didn't get her to breathe, that he would kill me right then and there."" Knight said she laid the baby on its back, started doing compressions on her chest and breathed into her mouth. ""Five minutes later,"" Knight said, ""she started screaming."" Knight said she became pregnant herself at least five times while in Castro's home. Each time, she said, Castro beat her brutally until she miscarried. ""Every time got worse than the other,"" she told McGraw. ""By the third time that I got pregnant, it was kicking, jumping on my stomach, like if I was a bed."" Castro, Knight said, ""didn't want a girl like me to have a kid."" ""I was a girl that couldn't be broken, a girl that couldn't be underestimated,"" Knight said.

"(CNN) -- It looks like that ""deep rift"" among the Jonas Brothers has led to a breakup. The boy band, which recently canceled a planned 19-show national tour following a disagreement over musical direction, is no longer a group. ""It's over for now,"" Kevin Jonas, 25, told People magazine, which first reported the news. His brother Joe, 24, called it a ""unanimous decision."" Jonas Brothers cancel tour amid 'deep rift' The three decided to go their separate ways after Nick Jonas, 21, spoke up during an October 3 meeting, according to the magazine. ""I was feeling kind of trapped,"" Nick said. ""I needed to share my heart with my brothers."" The Jonas Brothers skyrocketed to fame through the Disney Channel's ""Camp Rock"" movie series. They signed with Disney's Hollywood Records label in 2007, and their albums -- including solo projects -- have sold 20 million copies worldwide. But in recent years, each brother has broken out with his own projects: Kevin and his wife, Danielle, have a reality show on E! and are expecting their first child. Joe has gone in a more adult direction with his music career, and both he and his brother Nick have released solo albums and expanded into acting. No purity ring for this Jonas in new video . Rumblings that the band was in a pretty bad spot have grown louder over the past few weeks after a spokesman confirmed there was ""a deep rift"" within the pop group. On October 17, their official Twitter account was deactivated, and Joe Jonas asked fans via his personal account on October 22 to ""please hold while we get our s*** together."" The three worked together on new music earlier this year, releasing singles ""Pom Poms"" and ""First Time,"" but one industry insider told People it could be ""the beginning of the end.""

"(CNN) -- When actor Barkhad Abdi calls his ""Captain Phillips"" role life-changing, he means it literally. Just a few months ago, he was known only as one of Tom Hanks' co-stars in the film based on the Somali hijacking of the Maersk Alabama in 2009, but today, he's known far and wide as something else. On Thursday, the newcomer was announced as a contender for the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role, a category that includes stars like Jared Leto (""Dallas Buyers Club""), Jonah Hill (""Wolf of Wall Street"") and Bradley Cooper (""American Hustle""). ""Captain Phillips,"" by the way, is Abdi's first role. The 28-year-old, who was born in Mogadishu and moved to Minnesota as a teen, stumbled upon the opportunity while watching TV. ""I was at my friend's house in Minneapolis, just hanging out, and the local channel said that there was a casting call for a Tom Hanks film, (needing) Somali actors,"" he's told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""I always loved acting. It was something that I wanted to do. I would just shoot basic videos, but I wasn't in front of the camera."" Undeterred, Abdi went to the casting call at a Minneapolis community center and wound up landing the role of Somali leader Muse. ""He had this instinct for expression; he is a very interesting man,"" ""Captain Phillips"" director Paul Greengrass told The Hollywood Reporter. ""His ability as an actor is rooted in personal experience and a sense of drama."" That ability has won over critics left and right and has earned Abdi nominations from the Hollywood Foreign Press and the Screen Actors Guild. The Oscar nom ""has been a life-changing experience for me,"" Abdi said in a statement. ""I would like to congratulate all of the nominees this morning, especially the team from 'Captain Phillips' who were recognized. My performance is a testament to the vision of our incredible director Paul Greengrass, and our other Captain -- the generous, amazing, and inspiring Tom Hanks."" As for what he plans to do next, Abdi told Entertainment Weekly that he's just trying to let his newest accolade sink in. ""It's been a really wild ride,"" he said. ""Every time, it gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and now it's an Oscar nomination. It's just a little too big to comprehend. But that's life. I'm just looking forward to the next adventure.""","Barkhad Abdi's life has been changed by his ""Captain Phillips"" role .

"(CNN) -- When a police officer demanded that she cover her hair, Amira Osman Hamed simply refused. ""I'm Muslim, and I'm not going to cover my head,"" she declared. For that, the 35-year-old Sudanese engineer was arrested last August and charged with ""indecent dress."" Now Hamed faces a possible sentence of 40 lashes if a court convicts her when she faces the judge on Monday. Still, she refuses to wear a headscarf. Hamed's determination to challenge arbitrary rules restricting women's freedom is part of a wave of energy pushing against those limits, notably (but not exclusively) in Muslim countries. In Muslim-majority states in Africa, South Asia, the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, women are relentlessly demanding more equal treatment. To some, the matter of whether or not to cover one's hair may seem like a trivial issue. But the right to decide what one wears is a basic freedom. And strict rules by the government or by religious authorities dictating women's attire are almost always the tip of the iceberg -- the most visible portion of a structure that constricts women's freedom, taking away their right to make other important choices about their own lives. Hamed herself has already pushed back. In 2002, the human rights activist was arrested and convicted under the same law. She paid a fine for the crime of wearing pants in public. In 2009, the ban against trousers snagged the journalist Lubna Ahmed al-Hussein and 12 other women in a Khartoum restaurant, all wearing slacks. Several pleaded guilty, paid a fine, and were flogged for their crime. Al-Hussein refused. She was so outraged that she sent out invitations to her trial and to her possible flogging. In the end, the Sudanese Journalists Union paid the fine, but al-Hussein did not waver. Sudanese women, she pointed out, are getting swept up under the infamous article 152 of Sudan's 1991 Criminal Code. In the country ruled by an Islamist party with its own interpretation of Sharia, Islamic law, the rules are strict but conveniently vague. The statute calls for punishment of up to 40 lashes for anyone committing an ""indecent act"" or wearing an ""obscene outfit."" Not surprisingly, the law is used mostly against women. Government figures for 2008 said 43,000 women were arrested for clothing-related offenses in the capital alone. And the cases keep coming. A few weeks ago, police were recorded lashing a woman in the street for getting into a car with a man. The images are chilling. The extraordinary displays of courage from women challenging restrictions on their lives include the case of Malala Yousafzai -- the Pakistani girl who nearly died after Taliban gunmen shot her in the face -- and other young girls, like Yemen's Nujood Ali, divorced at the age of 10 and now a campaigner against child marriage, and thousands of others. Nobody, however, has gained the fame of Malala, whose call for girls to receive an education crossed the line for those who think women should remain subservient, with society under the full control of men. Her courage frightens the Taliban. Some in Pakistan claim that Malala, now a celebrity, is a product of the West. But these outbreaks of courage, these rumblings for change, are coming from within the Muslim world. Muslim women do not need the West to tell them that inequality and second-class status for women are unacceptable. The rules enforcing inequality are often couched as religious mandate, but they are mostly the product of deeply traditional societies. The societies, however, are changing. Women are part of those societies, and many accept the restrictions -- but not everyone is happy with the status quo. Consider Saudi Arabia. In most parts of the kingdom, many women, depending on the regions where they live, are required to cover themselves from head to toe, wearing the niqab, a veil that covers even the face, essentially erasing a woman's identity while she is in public. Most Saudi women are accustomed to wearing it. For now, those demanding change are focusing on other areas. Saudi women chafe under many rules. One of the best known is an unwritten ban on their right to drive. Last weekend, a group of women in Saudi Arabia defied the stunningly anachronistic rule that puts Saudi misogyny in a category of its own. Saudi women have fought for years to gain the right to drive. In 2011, when they thought they might have something like a Saudi Women's Spring, echoing the popular revolutions in the region, activists organized the Women2Drive day. Many were arrested after they took to the road. Despite the arrests, they tried it again last weekend. Some men raised an outcry. Others cheered. Two Saudi men, wearing their traditional red kaffiyehs, created an Internet sensation with the parody song ""No Woman, No Drive,"" mocking the driving ban with a takeoff on the Bob Marley hit ""No Woman, No Cry."" The video has had millions of hits, with lyrics that introduce viewers to the absurd logic of the ban, such as one Saudi cleric's contention that driving could damage women's ovaries and threaten their fertility. The inability to drive creates a host of practical problems for Saudi women -- problems that make them even more beholden to the whims of men. But other rules are even more offensive, such as the one that prohibits a Saudi woman from leaving the house, working, studying, traveling, even receiving medical treatment without the permission of a male ""guardian,"" usually her husband, father, or brother -- or even a son. Not all Muslim countries impose terrible restrictions on women, and not all countries with profound inequality between the sexes are Muslim. But the worst countries in which to be a woman, according to the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report, are almost all Muslim-majority states in Africa, the Gulf, and South Asia. Luckily, those are also countries where women are fighting back, pushing to close the gap, armed with the conviction that the restrictions they face are not mandated by their religion, but by social norms that are subject to change. And that change, a call for human rights for all -- including for women -- is not an invention of the West. It is what a woman like Amira Osman Hamed demands when she says she is a Muslim, and she simply will not be told what to wear. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Sudanese woman faces flogging for refusing to wear a headscarf .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Texas is one of those great Western states that is simply beyond belief for many of us: It is too big, too bold, too sprawling, too brawling for many folks east of the Mississippi River to fully grasp. And yet, its very ""otherness"" makes it the perfect place to begin our grand journey to find out how our fellow citizens are ""Building Up America."" For each of the next seven months, we are going to roam the American countryside in the CNN Express bus asking people, communities and businesses how they're finding ways to succeed despite the hard times we are all facing. We will share what we find here and on CNN programs like ""American Morning,"" ""The Situation Room,"" and ""AC360°."" One thing I know already from a lifetime of traveling over and over again to all 50 states: America is filled with independent, hard-working, innovative souls who find ways to succeed even when success seems unreachable. There may be no state with a deeper streak of that independence than this one, which was once a nation. In the Lone Star State, we found people with big smiles, determination, enormous pride in their home and their country. I suspect I'll find very much the same elsewhere on our journey, despite the economic slump that has hit everyone so hard. Laura Culin is one person we found. She's the owner, chief executive, forklift driver and all-around hand at the Austin Lumber Company. Five years ago, her business burned to the ground. No insurance. And with the construction business soon to head into a steep decline, she could easily have been forced into an early retirement, or at least an entirely different trade. But Laura never considered it. She rallied her friends and family, scraped up money and moxie, and the first business day after the fire, with little more than a working phone, she sold a load of plywood. Since then, she's rebuilt, rewritten her business plan and shifted heavily to green and sustainable building materials to capitalize on changes in the marketplace. She's the first to say that ""Building Up America"" means constantly evolving and innovating. That is just one of the success stories we've seen up close during our visit to Texas. Some economic analysts predict that the area between Austin and San Antonio will lead the way for much of the nation as the economy slowly recovers. We'll also spend a lot time just traveling around and listening to ordinary citizens: blue-collar laborers and white-collar business folk; farmers and field hands; musicians, housewives, students and more. The simple truth is, the real secret to any hope we have for a recovery lies out there, not inside the Beltway in D.C. It rests with all sort of normal people who, despite the downturn, have never stopped ""Building Up America"" and have a lot of lessons to share with all the rest of us. Saddle up. And if you see me on the trail, flag me down to say hello.","CNN Express bus tells stories of people who evolve and innovate amid hard times .

"(CNN) -- At least 83 people died in aerial bombing conducted by government forces in Aleppo, Syria, said the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group. At least 27 children and eight women were among the dead, the group said; it reported that 50 more people had sustained injuries in Sunday's attacks. The United Nations Children's Fund said in a statement that it was ""horrified"" by reports that improvised bombs dropped from helicopters killed between 14 and 28 children. ""It is absolutely unacceptable for children to be targeted in this manner, whether through the use of indiscriminate weapons resulting in mass casualties or by any other means,"" the statement said. Helicopters dropped barrel bombs on 12 neighborhoods in the city, where people have strongly backed rebels opposing the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The opposition organization says it is not the first time the Syrian regime has dropped barrels filled with explosives on Aleppo neighborhoods. The LCC said 135 people died overall in the conflict on Sunday. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have also been injured. It began when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement, and slowly spiraled into civil war. More than 2.3 million people have fled Syria and another 4.25 million Syrians have become refugees within their country since the civil war began, according to an Amnesty International report released on Friday.

"(CNN) -- A former NFL player and his mother have been indicted in a scheme to steal more than $690,000 by fraudulently obtaining five home equity loans in six days, according to the New Jersey Attorney General's Office. Irving Fryar, 51, and his mother, Allene McGhee, 72, were charged with second-degree conspiracy and theft by deception in New Jersey Superior Court Wednesday. The indictment alleges that Fryar schemed with McGhee to obtain five home equity loans totaling more than $690,000 between December 16 and 21, 2009, using McGhee's Willingboro home as collateral for all of the loans. The pair allegedly deceived five banks by acquiring the loans within six days and purposefully failing to disclose the existence of any other loans. The indictment further charges that McGhee's loan applications falsely claimed that she earned thousands of dollars a month as an event coordinator for her son's church, New Jerusalem House of God in Burlington County. Fryar himself allegedly received or spent more than $200,000 of the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds, the attorney general's office said. Fryar and McGhee made only a few payments on four of the loans, and those banks eventually wrote the loans off as losses, authorities said. ""This is not a case in which Mr. Fryar and his mother simply omitted or misstated information on loan applications,"" said acting Attorney General John Hoffman. ""This indictment alleges that they engaged in an elaborate criminal scheme that was designed to defraud these banks of hundreds of thousands of dollars."" Neither Fryar nor McGhee responded to CNN's requests for comment. It is unclear whether either has hired an attorney. A court date has not yet been set, according to the attorney general's office. Between 1984 and 2000, Fryar played for four NFL teams: the New England Patriots, the Miami Dolphins, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins. He is the head football coach at Robbinsville High School in Robbinsville, New Jersey.

"Washington (CNN) -- For four years, we've witnessed a non-stop political brawl over Obamacare. Now rhetoric has again reached a fever pitch since the botched October 1 launch of the new insurance exchanges at the heart of President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms. While Obama and Democrats scramble to reassure supporters and a skeptical nation that the dysfunctional Obamacare website can be fixed and the reforms will work, Republican opponents seize every opportunity to attack the 2010 Affordable Care Act they consider to be big government run amok. Not surprisingly, such partisan back-and-forth has generated persistent myths about Obamacare that foment confusion, if not outright ignorance, about the reforms. In other cases, both sides try to quickly exploit newer issues. Here is an attempt to debunk some of them: . 1. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan . Let's start with the obvious -- Obama's oft-repeated pledge in selling the reforms that they wouldn't require people to change health coverage or doctors. While the administration depends on a technicality to explain what Obama meant -- he was referring only to individually owned policies already in place back in March 2010 when the Affordable Care Act became law -- it was misleading when he started saying it back in 2008 and definitely is false today. Yes, anyone with an individual policy dating back more than three years can keep it, as long as it hasn't been changed by the insurance company. However, that is unlikely in the volatile individual market that comprises about 5% of Americans, a relatively small group compared to the 80% who get coverage through their jobs or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, at least 1 million individual policy holders have received letters from their insurers in recent months informing them that their plans are being discontinued at the end of the year or changed to cost more. The reason cited is added benefits required by Obamacare. ""The fact that the president sold it on a basis that was not true has undermined the foundation of his second term,"" former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who lost to Obama in last year's presidential election, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Obama and his aides argue the President kept his word by including a ""grandfather"" provision that allowed people to keep their plans from before the health care law was passed, as long as the policies hadn't been changed by the insurance companies. At the same time, they contend most policies no longer eligible for the ""grandfather"" provision -- and therefore being canceled by insurers -- offered substandard coverage, leaving people at risk of bankruptcy for hospitalization or other major medical needs. ""If you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really like that plan, what we said was you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the law was passed,"" Obama told supporters on Monday night. ""But if the insurance company changes it, then what we're saying is they've got to change it to a higher standard,"" he said, adding that ""if we had allowed these old plans to be downgraded or sold to new enrollees once the law had already passed, then we would have broken an even more important promise -- making sure that Americans gain access to health care that doesn't leave them one illness away from financial ruin."" His explanation differed from the repeated promises on the campaign trail that if people liked their coverage, they could keep it, period. Obama aides note that for most Americans who get their health care through their jobs or government programs, that remains true. ""What the President was referring to was the broader promise of the Affordable Care Act, that if you're on Medicare or Medicaid, if you, like probably most people in this room, have insurance through your employer, if you're a vet and you get coverage through the (Veterans administration), you don't have to do anything,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday. Obama further alters 'you can keep your plan' pledge . 2. Everyone's health insurance costs will rise because of Obamacare . Republicans regularly declare that the end result of Obamacare will be higher health insurance costs for all. If that happened, it would continue what was going on before Obamacare, when skyrocketing health care costs put effective insurance coverage out of reach for millions of Americans. Obamacare requires virtually everyone to have health insurance, which would create large markets of previously uninsured or underinsured people to stimulate competition and presumably hold down prices. That means some will pay more than before, such as healthier young people now required by the Affordable Care Act to have coverage, and some will pay less. Under the reforms, some people who make too much to be eligible for Medicaid coverage but not enough to afford high-quality plans can get government subsidies in the form of tax credits to ease the burden. Ezekiel Emanuel, an Obamacare architect from the University of Pennsylvania, told Fox News Sunday that the reforms were based on the concept of shared responsibility. ""We all share in the costs so that everyone can get it,"" he said, adding that if people don't have coverage and need health care, ""they transfer those costs to the rest of us. That's the whole point of part of Obamacare, to eliminate this cost shifting."" Obamacare website getting better, official tells Senate panel . 3. Write me . In recent weeks, as the extent of problems with the Obamacare website became known, the President and his aides sought to reassure the public by noting other options to enroll, including paper applications they could file by mail to avoid the dysfunctional online option. However, notes from so-called War Room meetings of administration officials released by the Republican-led House Oversight Committee showed all applications still must be processed through the HealthCare.gov website, regardless of whether they were submitted online or mailed in. ""The same portal is used to determine eligibility no matter how the application is submitted,"" said notes from an October 11 meeting, according to the committee. "" ... The paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provide another option; at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue."" Website performance has improved, but problems continue as open enrollment for Obamacare enters the second of a planned six months. A notice at the top of HealthCare.gov on Monday explained it will be out of order between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET every day as contractors work on it. Obamacare website goes dark for nightly fix-it work . 4. The website is broken, so Obamacare is a failure . ""The website is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Monday. ""There is the sticker shock for increased costs. There's increased out-of-pocket cost in terms of deductibles and co-pays, and many Americans are not going to be able to keep their doctor, even if they'd like to keep their doctor."" No one disputes that the website woes are a major problem that threatens to derail the vital enrollment of millions of uninsured or underinsured people if not fixed soon. However, the law was passed more than three years ago, and Obama aides point out it has already made a difference. In his speech Monday night, Obama listed various reforms that already have taken effect. ""The insurance market now has the strongest consumer protections that this country has ever known,"" he said of the reforms. ""No more discriminating against kids with pre-existing conditions. No more dropping your policy when you get sick. No more lifetime limits on the care that you can receive. All of that and more is part of a new Patient's Bill of Rights that's smack dab in the middle of the Affordable Care Act, and it's helping people right now."" Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who helped design both Obamacare and the Massachusetts health insurance program on which it was modeled, counseled patience in assessing whether reforms should be labeled a success or failure. ""According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will be about a three-year ramp-up period until Obamacare is fully effective at its full level of functioning,"" Gruber told CNN last week. ""That's what we saw in Massachusetts as well. So we need to just calm down and stop worrying about days and weeks and focus instead on months and years."" However, Gruber warned that the HealthCare.gov website must be fully operational by the end of November to ensure that people being forced to change policies have time to enroll by January 1, when their current coverage ends. The Obama administration says the website will work smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of users by November 30. Obamacare: It's about government's role, future elections .

"(CNN) -- The highly anticipated update to the classic 1980s series ""Sweet Valley High"" is here. As we reported in July, ""Sweet Valley Confidential"" (St. Martin's Press) takes place 10 years after high school. The series protagonists -- twin sisters Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield -- are 27 now and on their own, no longer safely ensconced in the split-level, Spanish-style home of their parents. Their perfect figures, cascading blond hair and aquamarine eyes remain. And in case you need any reminders that the book takes place in modern times, there are references to Facebook, Google, Beyoncé and Justin Timberlake. Jessica still lives in the idyllic Sweet Valley and has done something unforgivable to Elizabeth, who has since high-tailed it to New York, utterly brokenhearted. She is also bent on getting revenge, not a typical Elizabeth character trait. CNN spoke to Sweet Valley creator Francine Pascal about the new book and the lasting legacy of the ""Sweet Valley"" franchise, which sold more than 150 million copies worldwide and was the first young adult series to hit The New York Times best-seller list. ""This is the first time in history that a kids' book has made the leap into adulthood,"" the author said. ""And it's a very difficult thing because the people who used to read the books are people of importance, they're grown adults, and they have a certain ownership of 'Sweet Valley' because it was their adolescence. With the new book I hoped not to outrage them and I don't think I have. But I think I have surprised them in a lot of ways and I hope I have touched them."" Pascal, 73, said the inspiration for the first ""Sweet Valley"" book was the 1980s nighttime soap ""Dallas."" She figured that telling the story in series form would suit the soap opera format well because she wouldn't be tied in to providing closure -- she could feel free to leave readers hanging ""with a hook ending and that would give it the feel of continuity."" Pascal said she selected the high school setting because she ""needed a location that was complete in itself."" ""High school is, after all, a microcosm of the real world,"" Pascal said. ""It's the first time kids have some independence and have a world of their own where they're all together and they make the rules and live their life."" ""High school is so serious,"" she continued. ""There's friendship, pain, joy, betrayal, all those incredible things and the very essence of idealism."" Pascal hinted that is exactly why the town of Sweet Valley and its inhabitants are so unbelievably perfect. It is just that -- an idealization. Pascal said she intentionally made her main characters female because it was important ""to do something where the girls drove the action. Up until then it was sort of a 'Sleeping Beauty' kind of thing where you had to wait for the boy to kiss you before you woke up, and this story I wanted to be in the hands of girls."" The author said she made the girls twins because she had always been fascinated by twins and she wanted ""the opportunity to do a Jekyll and Hyde kind of thing where it's really the good and the bad of one person. So I conceived these impossibly (laughs) perfect people with very distinct personalities."" Surprisingly, Pascal concocted the picture-perfect Southern California town of Sweet Valley having never set foot in the state! ""I thought about what was the best thing about your teenage years and it seemed to me it was summer,"" she said. ""So I wanted a place where it was always summer and that's how I came to California."" ""But I didn't actually come to California,"" Pascal said, ""because at the time I had never been to California. Everything I knew about California came from MGM movies. A couple years later I went out there and it turned out it was just the way I thought it was."" When the first ""Sweet Valley High"" book, ""Double Love,"" was published in 1983, Pascal said she had no idea it would be so successful. ""I remember two weeks after it came out the shock of seeing it on the Publisher's Weekly best-seller list,"" said Pascal. ""I was stunned. This was in 1983 -- before the internet -- and I couldn't understand how everyone knew about it so fast. And it wasn't just the hundreds of thousands of readers who bought my four previous books. We were going into the millions."" Pascal is particularly proud that ""Sweet Valley"" turned a lot of young women on to reading. ""I used to get thousands of letters and about a quarter of them started the same way, 'I used to hate to read. ...'And that's the wonderful thing about this series; it really did bring a lot of young women into the reading world."" Ironically, librarians initially thumbed their noses at the notion of ""Sweet Valley."" ""At first they didn't even want to have the books in the library,"" Pascal said. ""Until they saw girls who had never even set foot in the library before ask for them and then they relented."" Pascal, who divides her time between homes in New York and France, said if she were starting the series today, she wouldn't change much, ""because I do feel the more things change the more they stay the same, particularly in adolescence. That's a unique time when many things are happening."" ""These books were translated into 25 different languages,"" Pascal said. ""Which makes you think: 'What does a girl in Indonesia have in common with these blond, blue-eyed girls in California?' Well, with the physical changes girls go through at that age comes a lot of feelings that are the same no matter where you are. So, the fact that there are cell phones and other technological advances now, those are all rather superficial. It's not how people are communicating, it is THE communication."" She pointed out that ""Sweet Valley's"" legacy lies in ""the hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of girls who became readers because of 'Sweet Valley.' Otherwise they may have spent their lives captive of TV."" ""Sweet Valley's"" next incarnation will be a ""Sweet Valley High"" feature film written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody. Pascal said she believes Cody will do right by the series because, ""She grew up with 'Sweet Valley' and she loved it."" Pascal said she thinks the movie should take place in the 1980s, ""Because I think all of the technological stuff is wrong for this. This is, well, a period piece."" Pascal said she is not quite sure what her involvement in the film will be. ""I'd have to go back to the contract,"" she said. ""It's something like story consultant. When material is adapted the original writers are not that involved. They don't hate them or, like in (Robert Altman's) 'The Player,' wish them dead or kill them. But it's gone from New York (laughs).""","The ""Sweet Valley"" series is back and updated .

"Windhoek, Namibia (CNN) -- A Mozambique Airlines flight crashed in northeastern Namibia, killing all on board, a government official told CNN on Saturday. The accident occurred Friday in Bwabwata game park, said Tobias Günzel, acting director of Namibia's Civil Aviation Department. The location is a remote region near the Angolan border, . Günzel said the plane started losing altitude at 38,000 feet and went down swiftly. ""We could see it on our radar, and we could see it was descending very quickly, at a rate of about 100 feet per second,"" Günzel said. ""We lost it from our screens at 3,000 feet above sea level."" The airline has not confirmed the crash, but the company released a statement earlier confirming 28 passengers and six crew members were on Flight TM 470 and that it was ""missing."" The flight was en route from Maputo, Mozambique, to Angola. Namibia's aviation authorities have dispatched a police helicopter to the area, Günzel said. ""We now have to wait and see if the black box can be recovered,"" Günzel said.","The flight was en route to Angola from Mozambique .

"(CNN) -- There is a saying in sport which goes along the lines ""take each match as it comes"" so as not to get distracted by what might happen in the future and that is exactly the approach Rafael Nadal is taking to the Qatar Open. He may be world number one and with the Australian Open just around the corner, but the Spaniard wants this particular title in his trophy cabinet for the first time and showed his typical steel to see off the dangerous Ernests Gulbis Thursday in the quarterfinals. Nadal was fully extended by the talented Latvian, who had chances in the opener and led 3-0 in the second set, before he turned up the heat in typical style. Fists pumping with every winner, he ran off five straight games before sealing the match 7-5 6-4 to reach the last four. Asked about using the matches as ""preparation"" for the opening grand slam of the season, Nadal told the court side announcer that he was only focusing on success in Qatar for now. ""This is a tournament I really like to play in but have never had the chance to win,"" he said. ""I'm just thinking about Doha at the moment and not looking ahead to the Australian Open."" Nadal lost in the 2010 final to Nikolay Davydenko and has found it hard to produce his best form in the season-opener, but with three wins under his belt this time around at the Khalifa Tennis Complex, he does indeed look well set for a crack at a 14th grand slam title later this month. He will now play qualifier Peter Gojowczyk, who earlier beat dreadlocked Dustin Brown 7-5 in the third set tie-breaker in an all-German encounter. The other semifinal will pit Florian Mayer, who beat third seed Andy Murray in the second round, against Gael Monfils of France. Germany's Mayer survived a lengthy three-setter against Victor Hanescu, eventually beating the Romanian 6-4 6-7 6-4. Monfils, who followed Nadal on court, breezed past German Daniel Brands 6-2 6-1 in just 48 minutes in impressive style. In other ATP Tour action, Australian veteran Lleyton Hewitt upset sixth seed Feliciano Lopez of Spani 7-5 6-3 to reach the last eight of the Brisbane International. The former Wimbledon champion battled back from 5-3 in the opener to claim victory in one hour and 39 minutes. He will face Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, who caused an upset as he ousted third seed Gilles Simon 7-5 6-3 in 88 minutes, for a place in the semifinals. Nadal's great rival Roger Federer is top seed at the Australian Open warm-up event.","Rafael Nadal into semifinals of Qatar Open in Doha .

"(CNN) -- Derby games can sometimes be dull, with space at a premium and scoring chances few. That wasn't the case Saturday when Liverpool and Everton played to a thrilling 3-3 lunchtime draw in the English Premier League. Daniel Sturridge's goal in the 89th minute salvaged a point for Liverpool, which had taken the lead away from home in the fifth minute. It was the highest scoring Merseyside league derby since Liverpool thrashed Everton 6-0 in 1935. ""All in all a wonderful game and when you come to your rivals it is important not to lose,"" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told BT Sport. Liverpool's dropped points, though, allowed Arsenal to extend its advantage atop the Premier League to four points. The Gunners later defeated Southampton 2-0. Prior to Sturridge's conversion from a Steven Gerrard free kick, Romelu Lukaku's two second-half goals reversed a 2-1 Liverpool lead. Lukaku netted his sixth and seventh league goals since joining Everton on loan from Chelsea. ""That is the best experience I've ever had in club football,"" the Belgian international told BT Sport. ""It's a pity we didn't win but hopefully we will next time."" Lukaku's compatriot, Kevin Mirallas, canceled out Philippe Coutinho's effort to make it 1-1 after eight minutes before Luis Suarez's free kick put Liverpool back on top. Despite losing influential left-back Leighton Baines to injury and after Liverpool's Joe Allen missed a sitter, Everton pushed forward in the second half and got its reward through Lukaku strikes in the 72nd and 82nd minutes. Substitute Sturridge, however, had the last word. ""It's really disappointing we didn't get three points,"" Everton manager Roberto Martinez, whose side still rose to fifth, told BT Sport. ""I'm disappointed to concede from three set plays. ""To concede late on from a dead ball situation doesn't reward my team for how they played in the second half."" Southampton could have gone top of the standings but a mistake by goalkeeper Artur Boruc -- one of the Saints' best players this season -- gifted Olivier Giroud the opening goal in the 22nd minute in London. Giroud, part of France's squad that this week advanced to the World Cup courtesy of the playoffs, completed his brace from the penalty spot in the 86th minute after defender Jose Fonte tugged at the shirt of Per Mertesacker. Chelsea pulled level with Liverpool on 24 points, dispatching West Ham 3-0 in the late kickoff thanks to a pair of strikes from former Hammer Frank Lampard. Elsewhere, Newcastle beat Norwich 2-1 for a third consecutive victory -- French striker Loic Remy has scored in all three games -- and Stoke City blanked 10-man Sunderland 2-0. Sunderland defender Wes Brown saw red to the disbelief of Black Cats boss Gus Poyet in the 36th minute. Crystal Palace, which named Tony Pulis as manager earlier Saturday, moved off the bottom and ahead of Sunderland by edging Hull City 1-0 even after having Yannick Bolasie dismissed in the 78th minute. Fulham remained in the relegation zone, downed 2-1 at home by Swansea in Rene Meulensteen's first game as head coach assisting Cottagers manager Martin Jol. On Sunday Manchester City, perfect at home but struggling on the road, hosts Tottenham and Manchester United visits Cardiff. The Red Devils are coming off a morale boosting 1-0 win over Arsenal two weeks ago.","Everton and Liverpool play to the highest scoring Merseyside derby in about 80 years .

"(CNN) -- Do you know why so many children think they're entitled to a comfy life filled with toys, smiles and puppy dogs? I blame Santa Claus. Not ""white"" Santa Claus or ""nonwhite"" Santa Claus. Just Santa Claus. Christmas came early for perennial critics of Fox News when host Megyn Kelly got sucked into the country's racial vortex by insisting that Santa Claus -- and, also, for that matter, Jesus -- is white. It all began with a column by Slate culture blogger Aisha Harris, who is African-American. In the piece, provocatively titled ""Santa Claus should not be a white man anymore,"" Harris noted that she grew up with ""two different Santa Clauses"" -- one in popular culture that was white, and one she knew in her household, who was black. She advocated that, from this point on, Santa should be depicted as, eh, a penguin. Kelly was having none of it. ""Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change. Jesus was a white man, too. It's like we have, he's a historical figure that's a verifiable fact, as is Santa, I just want kids to know that. How do you revise it in the middle of the legacy in the story and change Santa from white to black?"" After being criticized and ridiculed from here to the North Pole, Kelly accused her detractors of ""race-baiting"" and claimed that her comment was lighthearted. She did apologize, however, for her comment about Jesus, saying she had learned the question was ""far from settled."" I can relate to part of what Harris said. As a parent, I'm also living with two different Santa Clauses. But it has nothing to do with skin color. My two Santas are ""Good Santa"" and ""Bad Santa."" I'm not worried about what color Santa Claus is. Teacher to student: You can't be Santa -- you're black . What I'm worried about is the challenge of raising well-behaved kids in a society that sometimes make this difficult. As a parent of young children -- 8, 6 and 4 -- I want to care for them but not coddle them. I don't worry about being too hard on my kids or demanding too much; I'm more concerned that, like many parents, I'll wind up being too soft, too accommodating and too eager to excuse their misbehavior. I want them to be kind, thoughtful, generous and grateful for all they have. And do you know who sometimes works against me on that last front? Ol' St. Nick himself. You see, the opposite of grateful isn't ungrateful. It's entitled. After all, it's hard to feel thankful for something that you believe you're owed. And if you want to know where the American culture of entitlement begins, try eavesdropping when your kids talk to Santa Claus. You'll either get Good Santa or Bad Santa. In my first encounter this year, I got a Good Santa. I know the difference because, over the years, I've had plenty of Bad Santas. That guy -- who lingers at malls and department stores -- must work on commission. He encourages kids to rattle off a list of all the toys they want. Kids come away thinking that Christmas is all about gifts -- and unearned gifts at that. Bad Santa doesn't ask anything in return for his largess. A child gets toys just by being a child. On the other hand, Good Santa is old school. He requires that kids put some skin in the game. That's what happened when I took my 6-year-old son, along with his 6-year-old and 5-year-old cousins, to see Santa just a few days ago. We weren't at the mall or department store but at a Christmas get-together at our neighborhood club house. When the boys approached Santa and began to rattle off what they want for Christmas, he put up his hand and stopped them. First, he asked if they had been good this year. Then Santa got on his soapbox. He told them to listen to their parents (and their uncle) and not fight with their siblings. And if they did that, he said, maybe they'd get the toy they want. But they'd only get one, so they had better choose wisely. The kids nodded obediently. They each asked for one gift and promised to hold up their end of the bargain. The jury is still out. I was pleasantly surprised. This Santa really was a saint. He was the kind of Santa I remembered growing up, and I hadn't seen him in years. Throughout life, our kids will get plenty of encouragement to think of themselves as entitled. We should make the holidays about teaching them that, whatever they want, they have to earn by being good -- good to others, making good choices and practicing good behavior. Some people say it takes a village to raise a child. But do you know what would really come in handy? A few good Santas. Meanwhile, back in the cultural war, it's a silly waste of time for Americans to argue over whether Santa is white or black. What matters is his philosophy on gift-giving. Besides, this whole argument is positively 20th century! In 2010, Latinos made up 16% of the U.S. population, and they are expected to account for as much as 30% by 2050. Everyone knows that, at least in the United States and Latin America, Santa is Latino. So, this year, skip the cookies, and leave out some tamales. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Cultural debate flares over question of whether Santa is white .

"(CNN) -- Paul Tanner, one of the last surviving members of the Glenn Miller Orchestra, died February 5 at an assisted-living facility in Carlsbad, California, his stepson said. Tanner was 95 and died of pneumonia, said Dick Darnall in a telephone interview. Tanner was born in Skunk Hollow, Kentucky, in 1917, but soon left to tour the country with his five brothers and their father, all of them musicians, during the early 1930s. ""Everybody was trying to survive during the Great Depression,"" Darnall said. After one gig, Miller, who scouted his own talent, came up from the audience and ""asked Paul to become part of his band."" The trombonist went on to play with Miller, who also played trombone, from 1938 until 1942. But when the band leader joined the military and started a military band at military wages, the civilian band broke up. For the next few years, Tanner stayed in Hollywood, where he did studio work, Darnall said. At age 39, he enrolled at UCLA, which offered him a teaching job and advanced degrees upon his graduation four years later; he went on to teach music there for 23 years, Darnall said. Tanner was also working with the ABC Orchestra, where for 16 years he played with the likes of Leonard Bernstein, Andre Previn and Arturo Toscanini, Darnall said. His interests included early forms of electronic music, and he developed the Electro-Theremin in the 1950s, said Darnall. The device, which is mechanically linked to an audio oscillator, produced the eery, almost human sounds showcased by the Beach Boys on ""Good Vibrations"" and on the TV series ""My Favorite Martian."" The Electro-Theremin also was used in movies, including 1964's ""Strait-Jacket,"" with Joan Crawford. ""She was accused of chopping off everybody's heads,"" Tanner said in an interview in 1997 that is posted on his website. ""So, she was a psycho, they thought. There was one spot in the picture where she was to go up the wall, and they put her in a little small room, and then she got more and more and more excited and then she gradually got limp and passed out. And all through that, I'm the only thing playing. ""So, I told the guy who was going to conduct me, I said, 'Just raise your hand up when you want more intensity, and lower it when you want less intensity, that's all you got to do,' which was mainly a case of widening the vibrato. There was no music for that, I was just to make an effect, that's all."" Though Tanner did not invent the device, ""He enhanced on it and made it easier to play,"" his widow, Jeanette, said in a telephone interview. ""He made it more like piano keys."" But the device proved to be so simple that he put it into an elaborate container to make it look nicer. ""Otherwise, it would look like an oatmeal box,"" he said. During his teaching years, Tanner wrote a number of textbooks, and his classes proved popular, his widow said. ""He used to crowd the auditorium area where he had his classes, and it got so full that the fire department closed the doors and wouldn't let any more in,"" she said. Though he stopped teaching more than 30 years ago and moved to Carlsbad, ""I still get letters from people that were his students,"" she said. ""They said that he changed their life."" Tanner wound up giving his Electro-Theremin to a hospital, where it was used to measure hearing, she said. In addition to his wife and stepson, Tanner is survived by another stepson, Doug Darnall. Tanner's first wife, Alma, died in 1981 or 1982 after four decades of marriage, according to his family.

"(CNN) -- At least five thieves armed with hammers stormed a jewelry store in Memphis, Tennessee, sending mall shoppers and employees scurrying as they stole dozens of Rolex watches, police said. The culprits targeted Reeds Jewelers in Wolfchase Galleria around 7:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET) Saturday, Memphis police spokeswoman Sgt. Alyssa Macon-Moore said. Employees ran to the back of the store as the thieves stuffed about 65 Rolex watches into pillowcases, Macon-Moore said. Each watch is worth about $11,000. The case is being investigated as a theft, not a robbery, because the thieves did not interact directly with any employees. Previously, police said the assailants were armed with sledgehammers and guns, based on witness accounts. But officers reviewed surveillance video and saw only hammers. Others in the mall also reported the sound of gunfire, but police determined it was the sound of display cases being broken, Macon-Moore said. Police received numerous calls from people hiding in the mall, which was temporarily locked down. The thieves fled and remain at large. No one was injured in the incident.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man who sped down Venice Beach's crowded boardwalk Saturday evening looked like he wanted ""to create mayhem and massacre a lot of people,"" a witness said. One woman was killed, and a Los Angeles County coroner's office spokeswoman identified her as Alice Gruppioni, 32, of Italy. Her husband told police they were on their honeymoon, a law enforcement source told CNN. Nathan Campbell, 38, was charged with murder after he turned himself in to police hours after the incident, Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Rosario Herrera said Sunday. Campbell is being held on $1 million bond, she said. ""There no indication that he knew anybody that he hit,"" LAPD Cmdr. Andy Smith said. ""It looks like this guy wanted to run over a bunch of people. One guy bent on doing evil."" Of the dozen people injured, one victim was critically hurt and two others suffered serious injuries, officials said. The driver eventually stopped the car and ran away. ""It was horrible. I mean it was like something out of a movie, something you would never expect to see,"" witness Katherine Blackburn told CNN affiliate KABC. It was two hours before sunset on a beautiful Saturday evening -- one of the busiest times of the week at the Venice Beach Boardwalk. ""This guy had an intent to create mayhem and massacre a lot of people,"" Dave Blackburn told CNN affiliate KCAL. The Blackburn family was dining on the sidewalk patio of the Candle Cafe & Grill when they saw a man get into a parked car and drive it around a corner onto the crowded boardwalk. ""The boardwalk was packed with people, and he sped up and purposefully -- it looked like purposefully -- was just swerving back and forth to run over as many people as he could,"" said Laura Blackburn. Los Angeles police robbery-homicide detectives are leading the investigation. ""There were people flying, laying on the ground, tents flying everywhere. If he wanted to kill people, he came on a perfect time, 5 p.m. on a Saturday in the summer in Venice Beach,"" Katherine Blackburn said. Numerous victims were hauled away on stretchers, their legs covered with blood, KCAL reported. The crash took place on the Venice Beach Boardwalk, a popular tourist attraction on the west side of Los Angeles lined with hundreds of street vendors and performers. This isn't the first time someone drove into a crowd of pedestrians in Southern California. In 2003, an elderly man accidentally plowed his car through a busy farmer's market in nearby Santa Monica, killing 10 people and injuring 69.

"(CNN)  -- When talking about so-called family values, pastors, popes, and politicians routinely quote the Bible as if it were an unassailable divine authority --  after all, they assume, God wrote the Bible, and therefore it is absolutely and literally true. But that is a misconception. As the Bible itself makes clear, its authors were human beings, many of whom are named: David, Isaiah, Luke, and Paul. These human writers wrote over the course of more than a thousand years, and their writings reflect their own views and the values they shared with their contemporaries. So it's not surprising that inconsistencies are frequent in the Bible, both trivial and profound. Although Jews and Christians, individually and collectively, have for the last 2,000 years accepted the Bible as authoritative in principle, in practice many of its values have been rejected. On issues such as slavery, no one today would maintain that slavery is acceptable, even though, according to the Bible, it was a divinely sanctioned institution. In the debates about slavery in the 19th century those opposed to its abolition cited the Bible in support of their position, but despite such biblical warrant, their views were renounced. According to biblical law, a father could sell his daughter as a slave, and the last of the Ten Commandments lists as off-limits a neighbor's possessions -- his house, wife, slaves, and livestock. But the majority of modern Jews and Christians no longer accept the biblical view of women as men's property and hence subordinate to them, as they have also abandoned the biblical practice of polygamy. In current debates about family values, most of which have to do with sex, opponents of abortion and advocates of a woman's right to choose both cite the Bible in support of their conflicting views, even though the Bible in fact says nothing specifically about the issue. And with regard to same-sex marriage, although the few biblical writers who mention same-sex relationships, especially between men, were unequivocally opposed to them, many contemporary believers would argue that, as with slavery and the status of women, it is time to recognize that the values of the biblical writers are no longer necessarily our own. Opponents of same-sex marriage cite Leviticus, which says that when a man sleeps with a man as with a woman it is an abomination. They're right: It does say that. But it later calls for the death penalty for such activity, which only the most rabid opponents would insist on. The Bible also calls eating pork and a woman wearing a man's clothes abominations, yet many would no longer enforce such prohibitions. Individual biblical texts should not be appealed to selectively: Such cherry-picking is all too easy because of the nature of the Bible as a multi-authored book. Rather, as with another formative text, the Constitution, one needs first to understand it historically -- what did its words mean when they were written -- and then attempt to determine what its underlying values are, not just what it says in a specific passage. Only in this sense can the Bible be considered to have timeless relevance that transcends the historical particularities of its authors. What are those underlying values? I would argue that they are rooted in love of neighbor, which Jewish and Christian commentators over the ages have identified as the essential and enduring message of the Bible. Here are three of them. The great Rabbi Hillel, who when asked what the basic principle of the Torah was, replied: ""What is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor: That is the whole Torah; the rest is commentary."" His words are echoed both by his near-contemporary, another rabbi, Jesus of Nazareth, who put it this way: ""Whatever you wish people to do to you, so you should do to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets,"" and by an early leader in the movement that Jesus started, the rabbinically trained Paul, who pronounced that ""Love is the fulfilling of the law."" So, I suggest, the essence of the Bible --  its ultimate authority -- is not in its individual pronouncements, but in its underlying message: equal, even loving, treatment of all persons, regardless of their age, gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Michael Coogan.","Michael Coogan: Bible seen as unassailable divine authority, but it was written by men, not God .

"Durban, South Africa (CNN) -- Your phone rings. Someone's trying to sell you financial services. The person you're speaking to is likely to be sitting in a massive room with hundreds of other people. And if you're in an English-speaking country, the chances are they will have an Indian accent. India may be the world leader in call centers but in South Africa the government is hoping to grow its own industry, so the person calling you in the future could be a South African. Amazon and Aegis are among the internationally renowned companies using South African call centers. British company Coracall has also opened a call center in South Africa. The company's CEO, Philip Lightfoot, says he looked at other international call center destinations, including India and the Philippines, but was lured to Durban. ""The main reason for coming to South Africa was the pool of talent, with regards to the employees we could bring in,"" he says. But it was the South African accent that's proved particularly compelling for his business interests. ""For the UK in particular there has been a stigma around the Indian accent,"" he says. ""South Africa, as a destination, because it has such a neutral accent, especially Durbanites have such a neutral accent, means the UK population is receptive to speaking to individual from South Africa, and in particular, Durban."" Read related: African CEOs look to bright future . Coracall currently employs 300 people, but it has plans to expand over the next three years. Its staff, many of whom happen to be from Durban's large Indian community, are calling the UK asking about customer satisfaction for a major car company. The South African government wants to attract more companies like Coracall to its shores, as well as grow its own domestic industry. It has introduced a number of financial incentives in the hope of achieving this. Companies are now eligible for grants for investment and training, as well as tax breaks for job creation. ""It has had a massive impact,"" says Suleman Shaikh. He runs a call center in Johannesburg that deals specifically with the South African consumer market. He adds: ""It has made the industry much more competitive in terms of attracting offshore investment into the country. ""We can now compete with other offshore locations, such as India and the Philippines, much more favorably. It has lowered the barriers of entry into the market and it really has given the industry that competitive edge we have been looking for."" Read related: Mxit - South Africa's Facebook beater . According to South Africa's national association for companies operating in the ""Business Process Service and Outsourcing"" market, this competitive edge is beginning to deliver results. The industry grew over 85% from 2007 to 2010. Around 10,000 people are currently employed in this sector but that is expected to rise to 40,000 by 2015. ""The industry has grown exponentially over the last 10 years,"" says Shaikh. ""I have seen the industry grow from a few thousand agents to tens of thousands agents. I have seen it grow from just pure domestic operators to at least six new entrants from the UK entering South Africa over the last 24 months."" For the South African government there are incentives too; this is a labor-intensive industry and one that is proving lucrative. Between 2009-10 the industry made nearly $250 million in exports. South Africa's success in this area is attracting interest from other African countries, according to Brendon van Staaden, the CEO of Inter-Active Technologies. His call centers provide services for Samsung and the cable television provider Multi Choice, but he also provides technology for businesses opening their own call centers in other parts of Africa. ""It is incredible the amount of commitment that African countries are making to this industry,"" van Staaden says. ""If you look at the prospects we are faced with over the next four to five years it is a very exciting space to play in. ""We have come of age in South Africa.

"Rome (CNN) -- The captain of the Costa Concordia did not ""fall"" into a lifeboat after the ship hit rocks, as he contends, a crew member testified. Instead, Francesco Schettino ""jumped into the lifeboat,"" Stefano Iannelli said. Schettino is on trial in Grosseto on charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship after 32 people died in the shipwreck off the Tuscan island of Giglio on January 13, 2012. Iannelli, who was on the bridge when the ship hit the outcropping, testified that Schettino's reaction was, ""What have I done?!"" As part of his defense for the abandoning ship charge, Schettino has maintained that by the time he left the crippled vessel, the inclination made it impossible to stay on the ship. He told the court at a hearing in October that the ship was literally falling on top of him and he fell into the lifeboat. The ship ended up lying on its side. INTERACTIVE: How ill-fated cruise liner was raised from Italian seabed . Iannelli, who followed Schettino off the ship, testified Monday that he did not see passengers when they left the vessel, even though more than 1,000 people were later rescued from the ship. In a taped conversation between the captain and the port authority in Livorno, the port authority ordered Schettino to ""get back on board"" while passengers were still being rescued from the other side of the ship. Schettino, who admits that he was in command when the ship veered off course and hit the rocks, also blames a malfunction of the ship's watertight doors for making the situation worse. His defense lawyers say that created a new emergency after the initial accident. On Tuesday, the court heard testimony from Hugo Di Piazza, a technician who was working in the engine room when Schettino hit the rocks. The court heard a taped call from Di Piazza and the bridge in which he is heard saying that ""something"" had ripped a 70-meter (230-foot) gash in the hull and warning that the engine rooms were flooding. ""A 10-foot jet of water hit my back,"" Di Piazza told the court. He said he then closed the watertight doors but the ""water infiltrated"" the seals. If the watertight doors had functioned, Schettino's defense maintains, the ship would have stayed upright and afloat despite the fact that it had picked up an 80-ton boulder from the seabed. After losing power, the Costa Concordia glided past the port of Giglio and then made a 180-degree turn back toward the port before capsizing. Di Piazza said he narrowly escaped the flooded engine rooms. ""I opened other doors but the water kept rising,"" he told the court before describing how he and another technician escaped to the upper control platform and the engine room flooded. The court also heard an intercepted telephone conversation a week after the accident in which Di Piazza said that Schettino seemed oblivious to the gravity of the situation. ""He didn't understand the situation. We were idiots and he didn't give a damn if we died,"" Di Piazza said. After Tuesday's testimony from crew members, the trial will resume next week with testimony from traumatized passengers who survived the incident. Schettino is expected to testify before the end of the year. Schettino argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people, not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32. In addition to blaming the watertight doors, the captain's attorneys also say the ship would not have crashed had the helmsman turned it in the direction that Schettino told him to 13 seconds before impact. The helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin, and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements.","Stefano Iannelli says Capt. Francesco Schettino said, ""What have I done""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge revoked Chris Brown's probation because of his October arrest in Washington, but the singer's not going to jail because he's already in a court-ordered residential rehab program. Brown, who appeared before a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge Monday, must return for a hearing on February 10 that will decide if he'll serve jail time after his three months in rehab. The singer has an anger-management problem and drug-abuse issues, according to a probation report obtained by CNN. He's been on felony probation since pleading guilty to beating up singer Rihanna on the eve of the Grammys in 2009. Judge James Brandlin ordered Brown to check into a rehab program a month ago after he had been booted from another rehab facility a week earlier for smashing his mother's car window during a family session. A report submitted to the judge by Brown's probation officer included a letter from his current rehab facility saying he ""has made significant progress"" since starting in the program on November 20. Brown kicked out of rehab for 'acting violently,' ordered to new facility . ""The clinical and medical team have witnessed very positive change in Mr. Brown since his psychotropic medications have been changed and he has been taken off medical marijuana,"" the program director said. ""His ability to emotionally regulate himself has improved markedly."" ""I'm pleased that he's doing well,"" Brandlin said Monday, explaining why he did not send him to jail Monday afternoon. Brown was arrested on an assault charge in Washington on October 27. That case is why Brandlin ruled Monday that he was tentatively revoking Brown's probation for the Rihanna assault. He will decide in February if he will order Brown to complete his sentence in prison instead of probation. Brown's girlfriend Karrueche Tran accompanied him to the Los Angeles County courtroom Monday. For the second time, his mother was not with him. Brown's freedom has been in question since he was arrested on a sidewalk near the White House after allegedly punching a man. The probation imposed when he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in the attack on Rihanna -- his girlfriend at the time -- requires that he stay out of legal trouble. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab center on October 28, a day after he was released from a Washington jail. Secret Service report could help Chris Brown's defense . The probation report given to the judge last month revealed that he was kicked out of the program. It quoted a center official saying he was ordered out for ""breaking program rules by acting violently."" The violence involved Brown ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center in which she said she wanted him to stay in treatment. ""Mr. Brown preceded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. Brown's ""prognosis is very guarded"" unless he gets professional help, the letter said. Brown leaves the new rehab center three days a week to work eight-hour shifts of community labor so that he can complete the 1,000 hours of work still remaining in his punishment for attacking Rihanna. The report estimated he will have to work on community labor three days of every week until next August to meet the deadline for completing the labor. He may also travel to Washington for a court hearing on January 8 in the assault case there, the judge said.","Chris Brown returns for a hearing in February to decide if he'll serve jail time after rehab .

"(CNN) -- Authorities arrested the father of three missing Michigan boys Tuesday, charging him with parental kidnapping, officials said. John Skelton was arrested immediately upon his release from a mental health facility where he was being treated after an attempted suicide, Morenci, Michigan, Police Chief Larry Weeks told reporters. Weeks said investigators have not found the children, despite internet rumors that began circulating Tuesday of their whereabouts. Local authorities and federal investigators have been trying to find the children since Friday. But Tuesday morning, Weeks said investigators ""do not anticipate a positive outcome."" Investigators are skeptical of information Skelton has provided them, he said. Skelton said he left the three boys with a woman, whom he identified as Joann Taylor, the morning before he tried to take his own life -- in part to ensure they did not witness his suicide attempt. Skelton said Taylor was supposed to take the boys to their home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, Ohio, Friday afternoon, Weeks said. But the boys -- Tanner Skelton, 5, Alexander William Skelton, 7, and Andrew Skelton, 9 -- never arrived. Earlier, authorities determined that Skelton had no ""established relationship"" with the person he named as Taylor, and they aren't certain that she even exists. Authorities continue to ask for the public's help, hoping that someone saw Skelton's blue 2000 Dodge Caravan, in which he was believed to be carrying the boys from 2:30 p.m. Thursday to 1:30 p.m. Friday somewhere along a 25-mile stretch of road between Morenci and Holiday City, Ohio. Weeks had been more optimistic Monday, saying, ""We remain hopeful. ""That's why we're doing what we're doing, and hope to bring these boys home."" The last time a non-family member saw the boys was at 5 p.m. on Thursday, according to the chief. Police say Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall with strawberry blond hair and blue eyes, and weighs about 40 pounds. Alexander is 3 feet, 9 inches tall, has brown hair and eyes, weighs about 45 pounds and has scars on his hairline and chin. The oldest brother, Andrew, is 4 feet, 1 inch tall, has brown hair and eyes and weighs roughly 57 pounds. Andy Arena, a special agent with the FBI, also has called for help from the public. ""We need calls. We need tips. Anything that's out there, no matter how incredible you may think it is, call. Let us know,"" he said Sunday.","NEW: Authorities charge the father of 3 missing boys with parental kidnapping .

"(CNN) -- Soccer may be the number one sport in most of Africa but basketball is growing fast and the NBA has set its sights on the continent to provide future stars, and tomorrow's fans. In recent weeks, Amadou Gallo, managing director of NBA Africa, has embarked on a continent-wide tour including stop-offs in Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa. The talent hunt is part of the NBA's ""Basketball without Borders"" program, a community outreach project for young people, and is key to expanding the sport's global reach. Gallo Fall said: ""Making the game accessible, increasing participation, growing a fan base, that's the real priority."" Basketball without Borders takes the top youth players, aged 19 and under, from all over the world and invites them to train with NBA stars and coaches. Launched in 2001, the program aims to promote basketball outside the U.S. and also offers young people the chance to develop life skills and education with their mentors. Read more: Africa's new skyscraper cities . ""Part of making the game accessible is also putting it on the televisions,"" Gallo Fall said. ""More players are going to come from the continent so we are going to have (NBA) games here, just like in Europe,"" he added. In August, the NBA signed a multi-year deal with South African broadcaster SuperSport to televise games from the 2013-14 season in 47 Sub-Saharan territories. Incoming NBA Commissioner Adam Silver -- who will succeed incumbent David Stern in February 2014 -- said the NBA is growing ""exponentially"" outside the United States. He added: ""The continent of Africa, China, increasingly India, there are opportunities for basketball throughout the world, so that's going to be my focus."" Although he recognizes that soccer is Africa's most popular sport, Gallo Fall sees no reason for competition. ""Basketball is the number two sport globally and that holds true in Africa,"" he said. ""There's always the debate with football because that's a game that you can play anywhere so we are working to make sure that children who have passion for playing our sport have access to playing it,"" he added. Read more: The 'Beautiful Game' as a way of life . Despite, a lack of infrastructure in Africa, the NBA has a long tradition of African players. Legends including Dikembe Mutombo from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan's Manute Bol have inscribed their names into the NBA history books as being among of game's greats. While more recently Chicago Bulls' Sudan-born Luol Deng, who played as an All-Star in the 2011-12 season, and Cameroonian Luc Mbah A Moute of Milwaukee Bucks have broken into basketball's elite league. Writing in an editorial for CNN last year, Masai Ujiri, general manager of NBA team Denver Nuggets said Africa represents a potentially huge talent pool for U.S. basketball. He said: ""Some tribes in Sudan and Senegal have an average height of 6-foot-6, which also happens to be the size of the average NBA player. People in Nigeria, Mali and Congo tend to be very big and physical. We need to build a strategy to go into these regions and cultivate the talent through infrastructure and instruction."" But Ujiri added that if Africa is going to produce the basketball stars of the future, development needs to start at a young age. ""Most kids in Africa don't start playing basketball until they are 13 or 14 years old. This puts them at a disadvantage because they lack the instincts and must work harder to develop,"" he noted. And creating a younger fan base could also be good business for the NBA. ""We think there is a huge opportunity,"" said Silver. ""I mean, there's roughly a billion people on the continent of Africa, so just a little small sliver of those billion people can result in a very successful business for us."" Oliver Joy contributed to this story.","Africa is ""a huge opportunity"" for the NBA, says incoming commissioner Adam Silver .

"(CNN) -- After three days of horrifying images from Kiev, February 21 brought tentative good news from the Ukrainian capital. President Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leaders Vitali Klitschko, Oleh Tyahnybok and Arseniy Yatsenyuk concluded an agreement on a political settlement. If it holds, it offers Ukrainians a peaceful path out of the crisis that has gripped their country for the past three months. But the agreement is fragile. It will encounter opposition from within Ukraine. Indeed, protestors on the Maidan are already calling for Yanukovych's immediate removal. The Russians may try to undermine it. But the United States and European Union must work to make it succeed; it is the best bet that Ukraine now has. It comes at a moment when the crisis had reached the brink of chaos. There had been three days of violent clashes between demonstrators and police, the threat by Security Services of a nationwide ""anti-terrorist operation,"" and images, splashed across the media, of Berkut riot police firing on demonstrators. At least 75 died and hundreds were injured in the capital. The Polish, German and French foreign ministers arrived on February 20. Their mission was bolstered by reports that the European Union later that day would impose visa and financial sanctions against Ukrainian officials responsible for the use of force (this came a day after Washington announced that it was banning visas for 20 regime officials). The EU foreign ministers met with the opposition leaders, then with Yanukovych. All came together for discussions that ran through the night. They were joined by Vladimir Lukin, the former Russian human rights ombudsman, hastily dispatched to Kiev by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Yanukovych and the opposition leaders reached and initialed a tentative agreement the morning of February 21. After the opposition leaders consulted with a council representing the protesters, the agreement was signed. Among the key points: . -- Adoption of a law to restore the 2004 constitution, which will provide for more of a balance of power between the Rada (Ukraine's parliament) and prime minister on the one hand, and the president on the other. The current constitution favors the president. -- Formation of a national unity government within 10 days. -- Further constitutional reform to be completed by September. -- Early presidential elections, to be held once the constitutional reform is completed, but no later than December. The agreement provides a road map for Ukraine to move forward to normalize the country's political life. The result would be a greater balance in power between the legislative and executive branches of government, and between the prime minister -- who presumably will come from the opposition ranks or will be someone acceptable to the opposition -- and the president. It likely means that Yanukovych will be a one-term president. His poll numbers already were severely sagging last year. The events of the past three months will make it all but impossible for him to win reelection in a free and fair process. The settlement also may mean that Ukraine will move to sign an association agreement with the European Union. It was Yanukovych's decision in November not to sign that triggered the initial protests; they morphed into an expression of broader public discontent with the government corruption and authoritarian trends that have characterized Yanukovych's four years as President. The Rada wasted little time in acting on the settlement. Members cast 386 votes in favor of a proposal to return to the 2004 constitution (a constitutional majority requires only 300). But the deal remains vulnerable. Some in Yanukovych's inner circle will see it as a threat to their personal political and economic interests; they may seek to undo it. Many demonstrators will question why Yanukovych, whom they hold responsible for those killed, should remain in office another day, let alone perhaps until the end of the year. And a particularly ominous note came from Russia. Lukin joined the Polish, German and French foreign ministers in initialing the draft agreement as a witness. However, after reportedly consulting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, he did not attend the signing ceremony and did not sign the final agreement. What that says about Moscow's view of the agreement remains to be seen, but it is hardly a positive sign. Should the agreement put Kiev back on course to deepen its relationship with the European Union, expect the Kremlin to look for ways to undermine it. The European Union, whose engagement on Ukraine has often appeared frustratingly cautious, deserves considerable credit for its role. Having foreign ministers from three major EU member states in Kiev -- backed by a threat of EU sanctions -- undoubtedly helped bring the Ukrainian sides to agreement. The European Union and Washington must now do all they can to bolster the agreement and to work with Ukrainians to pursue its implementation. The alternative -- a return to the violence of earlier this week -- in unthinkable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Pifer.","Ukraine's president and opposition have reached a deal to end violence .
It's fragile, says Steven Pifer, but it is the best deal available to Ukraine right now .

"(CNN) -- A ninth-grade student was in custody Saturday and charged with murder after he allegedly shot a classmate in the back of the head at their northern Alabama middle school, authorities said. The shooting happened during a class change around 1:45 p.m. Friday at Discovery Middle School in Madison, just west of Huntsville, police said. ""I was walking down the hallway and just saw a whole bunch of kids start screaming and running, telling me there was a gunshot, (that) there was a kid that got shot in the ninth grade,"" seventh-grader Paxton Schremsher told CNN affiliate WAAY-TV. Ninth-grade student Todd Brown, 14, died after being taken to a hospital in Huntsville, Madison Police Chief Larry Muncey said. No one else was hurt, CNN affiliate WAFF-TV reported. Police said it was an isolated incident between Brown and the alleged shooter, though they said the motive was still unclear. One student, however, said he may know the reason. ""It was some discussion about gang-related things and the shooter just got fed up with it,"" student Jeremy Tuttle told WAAY. The shooting happened in the hallway just outside the band room, WAAY reported, and immediately sent students running for cover. ""I was in the ninth-grade hallway and I just heard a loud pop, and it sounded like a gun. People started running,"" student Tyler Renn told WAFF. ""People started running toward the classrooms, so I just ran in a classroom and everybody was under the desks and the lights were off,"" ninth-grader Joshua Murphy told the station. The school resource officer held the shooter and the school nurse stayed with the victim until the authorities arrived, said Madison City Superintendent Dee Fowler. The school went into lockdown until 3 p.m., leaving panicked parents outside, unable to pick up their children. One of them was Dixie Duncan, who sat in her car waiting to be allowed in. She read aloud a text message she said she received from her 14-year-old daughter inside the school. ""Mama, don't come to school. Watch the news. There's a possible shooting,"" the message read. City officials planned a meeting at a high school Sunday with church leaders, city and school officials, and counselors. The meeting is open to the public. ""We'll continue as a community to work together to work through this,"" Madison Mayor Paul Finley said. Muncey said the threat to the school is now over.

"(CNN) -- Ray Price, the Nashville star whose trademark ""shuffle"" beat became a country music staple, has died at age 87, his agent said Monday. Price's 1956 single ""Crazy Arms"" spent 20 weeks atop the country charts and introduced a bass-driven, four-four rhythm that became a touchstone of the Nashville sound -- a rhythm later dubbed the ""Ray Price beat."" ""Ray expanded country music to the masses,"" Bobby Roberts, Price's agent, said in a written statement. ""He was a true gentleman that absolutely cared about his fans."" He had started singing while in veterinary school, after coming back to Texas from World War II. His first records drew little notice, but he caught the attention of Hank Williams, who took Price on tour with him in 1951 and brought him to Nashville, where he began to sing with the Grand Ole Opry. Price ""had one of the greatest voices in country music history as well as a great sense of humor,"" Roberts said. His other hits included ""Heartaches by the Number"" in 1959, a heavily orchestrated 1967 version of the traditional ""Danny Boy"" and the Kris Kristofferson-penned ""For the Good Times"" in 1970.

"(CNN) -- Former world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher, who suffered severe head injuries in a weekend skiing accident in France, remained in stable condition Wednesday, his manager said. Sabine Kehm said Schumacher had been carefully supervised overnight. ""His condition remains stable overnight and this morning,"" she said. ""This is the good news -- however I don't want to go into any further prospects because it's much too early, as the doctors said yesterday,"" she said. Doctors treating Schumacher at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble will not give a news conference unless there is a significant change in his condition, she said. ""We are still in a critical situation,"" she said. Schumacher remains in an artificially induced coma. On Monday night, doctors carried out a surgical intervention that relieved some pressure on Schumacher's brain. The surgery, which took about two hours, involved the removal of a large hematoma, the head of anesthesiology, Jean-Francois Payen, said Tuesday. Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history, suffered severe head trauma after falling while skiing Sunday in Meribel, in the French Alps. Kehm recounted more details Tuesday of how the accident happened, gleaned from Schumacher's son and friends who were skiing with him. The party was in an area of deep snow when Schumacher helped a friend who had fallen, she said. As he set off again and went to make a turn, he seems to have hit a rock hidden under the snow. This catapulted him into the air and he fell head down with all his weight onto another rock, she said, resulting in severe injuries to his head. He was not traveling fast at the time, she added. In a statement released Tuesday, Schumacher's family expressed thanks for the outpouring of support from people around the world. ""They are giving us great support. We all know he is a fighter and will not give up,"" the statement said. Schumacher, who turns 45 Friday, won a record seven world titles in his spectacular Formula 1 career.

"Athens (CNN) -- The leader of Greece's extreme right wing Golden Dawn party and four party lawmakers have been arrested on charges of forming a criminal gang, Athens police said Saturday. The arrests of the leader, Nikos Michaloliakos, and lawmakers Elias Kassidiaris, Elias Panagiotaros, Ioannis Lagos and Nikos Mihos are part of a crackdown following a controversial stabbing death. At least 10 more people have been arrested, including Golden Dawn party members, police said. More than 30 warrants were issued as police operations were launched across Greece Saturday. One more Golden Dawn lawmaker is still being sought, police said. Pavlos Fyssas, a popular anti-fascist figure and well-known hip-hop artist with the stage name Killah P, was the victim of the knife attack that was allegedly committed by a Golden Dawn supporter. Clashes broke out in a working-class Athens suburb last week, as Fyssas' death inflamed already growing concerns about the rising influence of Golden Dawn. The ultranationalist, anti-immigration party has been linked by critics to street violence and neo-Nazism. The violence came despite police raids of Golden Dawn offices and the arrest of a 45-year-old party supporter who police say admitted killing Pavlos Fyssas. Kassidiaris last week denied his party's involvement in Fyssas' death, calling it a ""heinous crime."" The singer's death has nevertheless led to renewed calls to ban Golden Dawn . The Greek constitution does not allow for political parties to be banned, however, and the party's arrested lawmakers will retain their parliamentary seats unless they are convicted of a crime. Golden Dawn holds 18 of Parliament's 300 seats. It is the first time since the restoration of democracy in 1974, following a seven-year junta, that a party leader and members of parliament have been arrested. Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos, whose socialist Pasok party is part of the governing coalition, said last week that Golden Dawn ""must be dealt with as a criminal organization."" In 2012, the party rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some Greeks over internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country's deep financial crisis, winning 7% of the vote and gaining seats in parliament for the first time. Recent polls had seen support rise as high as 12%. However, since Fyssas' killing last week, opinion polls suggest that Golden Dawn's popularity has dropped. A poll carried out from September 19 to 21 by Rass, for the Eleftheros Typos newspaper, indicated that support for Golden Dawn had fallen to 5.8%, down from 8.3% on September 15. Back in 2009, before the financial crisis and ensuing austerity measures hit Greeks hard, the party polled only 0.3%.","NEW: 4 party lawmakers as well as the leader of Golden Dawn have been arrested -- police .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Basketball star and Kardashian spouse Lamar Odom settled his drunken driving charge with a no contest plea Monday. Odom, 33, must serve 36 months' probation, attend three months of alcohol counseling and pay a total of $1,814 in fines and fees for the DUI charge, according to Los Angeles City Attorney spokesman Rob Wilcox. The California Department of Motor Vehicles will hold a hearing later to decide how long Odom's driver's license will be suspended. It was automatically suspended when he was arrested. Odom, who is married to reality TV star Khloe Kardashian, changed his not guilty plea, entered before a Los Angeles County judge two months ago to a no contest plea, Wilcox said. He was arrested on a driving under the influence charge in the early morning hours of August 30 by a California Highway Patrol officer who reported seeing Odom, 34, driving his white Mercedes SUV in a ""serpentine manner at 50 mph."" Odom ""showed objective signs of intoxication and he was unable to perform his field sobriety tests,"" a CHP news release said. In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice. ""I've made a couple (of mistakes) and I may make a couple again, but hopefully they won't be as big as this one,"" Odom told reporters then.

"(CNN) -- Wednesday is the second anniversary of the Osama bin Laden raid. The terrorist leader's death made the world safer, but the bombings in Boston on Patriots' Day are a cruel reminder that we will never prevent every act of terror. In the United States, we accept that risks coexist with our culture of freedom. Yet we also must act with greater responsibility in the face of ongoing threats. We can begin by rejecting a culture that drives details of our nation's special operations missions out into the open, thereby weakening our national security. The aftermath of the raid in Abbottabad is a powerful example of this problem. We have tolerated, and at times encouraged, a steady stream of marketing and promotion that glorifies the mission and its participants: ""No Easy Day,"" an unauthorized, tell-all bestseller by a special operator; ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" a blockbuster film based on insider accounts; and ""The Shooter,"" an Esquire magazine profile that sparked a scramble for personal credit amid competing claims over who fatally shot bin Laden, and how and where. We might think such visibility honors our nation's special operations forces -- expertly trained units that conduct clandestine, high-risk missions, often to combat terrorism -- but when these shadow warriors become public figures it produces unintended consequences. First, the extensive attention creates backlash and division that ultimately detract from national readiness. Thousands contributed to the decade-long hunt for bin Laden, and future missions will demand similar support across military services and civilian agencies. Most public portrayals, however, romanticize one moment or individual while neglecting many others. This weakens the entire team's morale and leads to resentment, fair or unfair, that degrades the willingness of all to collaborate fully on the tasks at hand. Collective action is the cornerstone of success. Our country cannot afford such internal discord. Second, excessive public accolades contribute to the overuse and misuse of special operators. These forces have proven their ability to address a range of 21st century security threats, but they do not have unlimited capacity. Yet special operators are increasingly asked to take on more conventional missions better done by the military's general purpose forces or that divert them from maintaining readiness for missions they are uniquely qualified to conduct. Simply because they can do just about anything does not mean they should be called upon to do everything. We should respect the limits and specializations of these forces. Third, most portrayals depict an exceptionally narrow and violent view of special operations that weakens our collective understanding of military power. Films and books brandish dramatic raids, such as rescuing hostages or killing terrorists. They overlook conflict-prevention activities our forces undertake every day, such as training the militaries of other nations to better provide for their own defense. Since such missions are difficult to showcase to impressive effect, they are not so marketable in the media. But when public depictions are skewed toward lethal actions and fail to account for nuanced forms of power and deterrence, we undermine public discourse on how best to leverage military force for our national security. Our leaders must counter this misrepresentation and overexposure. Their first step? Act more responsibly. Senior officials are a primary driver behind these profiles, trumpeting operations almost as a matter of routine. Sometimes this is to inform the public, but often it is to claim credit or, even worse, to divulge insider knowledge. This encourages misleading and unauthorized disclosures from others, including from some operators themselves, leading to more sensationalism. Former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates reportedly expressed great frustration with leaked details on the Abbottabad raid, saltily asking his White House colleagues to ""Shut the f... up."" We should hold those indiscreet individuals accountable. We can't legislate common sense, but we can reject leaks and unseemly competition for credit. We call upon the Department of Defense to take the lead and issue a new weighty policy directive that states clear and specific guidelines for the appropriate release of operational information. The directive must codify who can divulge what, when and under which conditions, and call for a universal commitment to accurate reports that also maintain operational security. Officials vigorously protect information before a mission; they must remain equally disciplined in their communications afterwards. Our nation's battles are far from over. Officials then must hold themselves and each other to these standards. If not, they undermine their credibility and erode the trust that is essential in civil-military relations. Those who risk their lives serving the nation must be confident that the people sending them into harm's way will not make personal or political gain a bigger priority than the protection of the mission's integrity.

"(CNN) -- ""Operation Angry Birds"": No, it is not a mission to beat your highest score in a phone game app. Instead, it is the largest cockfighting bust in New York state history, resulting in more than 3,000 seized birds, 70 people taken into custody and nine felony arrests by Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman's Organized Crime Task Force. The record-setting raid spanned two boroughs and upstate Ulster County. A cockfight in Queens, a pet shop in Brooklyn, and a farm in upstate Plattekill were raided Saturday night into Sunday by the task force, with the help of New York State Police, the Homeland Security Department and the Ulster County sheriff's office, according to a news release from Schneiderman's office. The Queens raid disrupted a 70-person event, which included bettors and spectators of the bimonthly fights, according to the news release. Simultaneously in Brooklyn, law enforcement officials busted the owner of a pet shop called Pet NV after 50 fighting birds were rescued from the basement, according to the statement. The birds were found in poor condition inside metal cages. Cockfighting contraband -- including artificial spurs, candle wax, medical adhesive tape and syringes used to inject performance-enhancing drugs into the roosters -- was also found in the basement. The owner of the pet shop, Jeremias Nieves, 74, was arrested and charged with prohibition of animal fighting. The Ulster County sheriff's office and other local law enforcement helped OCTF investigators raid the 90-acre farm in Plattekill. The ASPCA recovered up to 3,000 birds that had been bred, trained and given performance-enhancement drugs from the farm, which has been operating as a live poultry farm for years, according to the release. For years, the roosters, which were bred and trained at the farm, were then taken to the cockfighting event raided in Queens and the pet shop in Brooklyn, according to the release. The cockfighting spectators paid an admission fee to watch all-night fights. Alcohol was sold without a permit and drugs were used openly, according to attorney general's office. ""Cockfighting is a cruel, abusive and barbaric practice that tortures animals, endangers the health and safety of the public and is known to facilitate other crimes,"" Schneiderman said in the release. Cockfighting is a crime in all 50 states. In New York, cockfighting and possession of a fighting bird at a fighting location are felonies that carry a maximum sentence of four years in jail and a fine of $25,000, according to the statement. ""My office will keep working to hold these individuals accountable, and put an end to illegal cockfighting,"" said Schneiderman.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Inside a brightly painted Mogadishu clinic, Salim (not her real name) sits alongside her seven-year-old son, waiting for a check up. Opposite them, a health professional listens to their nightmarish ordeal. Salim recounts how she was raped and then watched, helpless, as her young son was molested. Too afraid to seek assistance, she did what she thought would help. She washed her son's wounds with hot water and salt for four excruciating days, until they were brought here, the Sister Somalia center. ""There are so many stories; when you hear one, another one is even worse and that makes you think of it all the time,"" says Fartuun Adan, co-founder of Sister Somalia, the first rape crisis center in the East African country. ""I even dream about what I heard during the day."" A champion for women's rights in Somalia, Adan is used to hearing such horror stories. Two years ago, she started Sister Somalia, a group dedicated to supporting survivors of sexual violence with medical services, counseling, education and entrepreneurial advice. ""Our purpose when they are there (is for them) to feel safe,"" says Adan. ""If you want to cry, if you want to laugh -- support them, (make them) feel at home and that's why we created the center."" 'Rape was everywhere' But in order to provide rape victims with a refuge, Adan had to risk her own safety. Her mission began in 2007, at the height of a Somali conflict that had been raging for more than 15 years. Until then, Adan was living with her three daughters in Ottawa, having fled to Canada in 1999 three years after the brutal murder of her husband, Somali human rights activist Elman Ali Ahmed. Read this: Peace concert rocks Mogadishu . But six years ago, Adan took the courageous decision to leave her children behind and return to her motherland to help the Somali women and youth suffering because of the war. Adan initially focused her efforts on reviving the work of her late husband, a prominent peace activist committed to rescuing young boys from becoming child soldiers. But in 2011, many parts of Somalia suffered from famine, forcing thousands of people to make the grueling trek to Mogadishu where humanitarian organizations were giving out food. Makeshift camps sprouted all over the capital, providing shelter for the internally displaced. But for many women and children living there, cut off from the protection of their clans, the camps were places of rape and violence. To deal with the growing crisis, Adan started Sister Somalia, the first organization in the country to come out publicly and talk about the astonishing number of sexual abuse victims. ""Rape was everywhere, Somalia was in denial,"" she says. ""There was a lot of denial and that made it harder."" 'Safe place' Community elders wanted Adan to hide the rapes and Islamist militants and militia men constantly threatened her. But the activist defied the dangers to provide rape victims with a place of healing. At the Sister Somalia center, women and children receive a holistic approach to care and treatment. Initially, the victims are given short-term anti-retroviral treatment to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection. They also receive drugs to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. Read this: Chef brings a taste of peace to Mogadishu . The women and children are sheltered in safe houses, becoming part of a communal setting that provides victims with emotional support as they go through counseling and treatment. ""This is a very safe place,"" says Adan, who now runs the group with one of her daughters. ""We can talk, we can eat, take tea together, having a little fun so they forget most of the times and they share their story."" World recognition . For her work championing human rights and women's rights in Somalia, often in dangerous conditions, Adan was bestowed in March with the U.S. Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award, an annual prize that pays tribute to emerging women leaders across the world. ""I was happy because of the recognition we got, not only me but all the other women who are doing the job we are doing in Somalia,"" says Adan, who started Sister Somalia alongside Lisa Shannon, founder of ""Run for Congo"" and Katy Grant, co-founder of Prism Partnership. ""It's an encouragement for us,"" adds Adan, who now runs the group with one of her daughters and a few dedicated helpers. An eight-person volunteer support staff based in North America also gives administrative assistance. ""I was always thinking how can I help women but I never thought it would be recognized internationally,"" she adds. Hope . Rape in Somalia carries huge social stigma, so although an increasing number of women seek help at Adan's crisis center, many more suffer in silence. ""A lot of people know what is going on but they are denying,"" says Adan. ""Even the family, they deny if their girl gets raped because they don't want her to be stigmatized and shamed and that makes it hard."" Read this: Holidays in Somalia, anyone? But for the first time in a long time, there is a new sense of optimism in Somalia. After more than two decades of war, there is a newly elected president and parliament. Adan says political leaders now acknowledge rape is a huge issue in the country, and this gives her hope for the future. ""I would like to see peace, justice, development like another country,"" says Adan. ""Just to walk around without worrying and women can go to market and see whatever they want; have education, health, the basic human rights -- that is what I want to see.""","Many Somali women raped in camps that were set up to shelter them .

"(CNN) -- The widely anticipated ""Mass Effect 3"" will be the culmination of a story spanning a galaxy and eight years of development and drawing millions of fans around the world. In the third and final installment of the series, set for release Tuesday, protagonist Commander Shepard returns for a battle to retake Earth from an advanced race of synthetics, known as Reapers, who want to cleanse the Milky Way of all intelligent organic life. Developers from BioWare had always planned the series as a trilogy, so everything from the first two games has been leading up to this climax. ""On one hand, we knew where things were going so we could build these huge story arcs in the first one, and even in the second one, that would get resolved in the third game,"" said Casey Hudson, executive producer of the ""Mass Effect"" series. ""At the same time, we were able to be pretty flexible in developing it mechanically so that as we started to really like certain story arcs and characters, we could build those in more and let players get more enjoyment out of playing."" But the question now becomes -- how to satisfy a fan base already engaged with the story's lore while remaining accessible to players who may just be meeting Shepard in the ""Mass Effect"" universe? Fans of the science fiction/fantasy genre are familiar with how trilogies end. Whether it is Darth Vader tossing the emperor off a balcony or Gollum falling into the lava and destroying the One Ring, you can be sure of two things: Really big things are going to happen, and there will be a dramatic twist at the end. Hudson said the way the ""Mass Effect"" series is built allows experienced players to continue with the stories they've already worked on but also provides entry points for new players to get quickly acclimated to the tale and begin their own adventure. As with ""Mass Effect 2,"" players who have saved characters will be able to import them into ""Mass Effect 3,"" changing some dialogue (the game will have a hefty 40,000 lines) and missions to reflect actions taken in previous games. New players are quickly brought up to speed through some introductory missions and different dialogue from experienced characters. But Hudson said new players shouldn't feel like they are missing out on anything. ""The fact that it is a third story means that's where you get to decide the fate of entire civilizations because we know this is the third of three,"" he said. ""If you are coming in as a new player, those plot lines are established, but you also get to make the biggest decisions in them. For existing players, it's mind-blowing that they've gotten to know people and characters from a given species that they can choose to wipe out in 'Mass Effect 3.' "" He added, ""That was the real fun of developing 'Mass Effect 3.' This is the beginning of all the biggest things you get to do in the 'Mass Effect' series, and then everything comes to an end that you define as a player."" Defining the parameters of the story and possibilities for the ending pushed the limits of Hudson's team, he said. Since it's the final episode, everything needs to get resolved and all lingering questions answered. Hudson said that despite players being in the driver's seat, they want to see that developers have created interesting and satisfying conclusions of the story arcs in which they've become invested. Which species will live and which will die? Which major character doesn't make it to the end, and who will be left for the final battle? Players, new and veteran, will both have those choices to make and be saddled with the emotional baggage that goes along with it. ""The team was really pushing to put little bits of fun even in the final days. (The game) ended up being bigger than what we thought it would be,"" Hudson said. ""Whether you are a really passionate fan about the fiction or you're fairly casual about it or you're new to it, it should be a great story for everybody. We tried to build it as a story regardless of how familiar you are with the 'Mass Effect' universe. ""This is really the biggest part of this series. That's what the whole story's about."" ""Mass Effect 3"" will be available Tuesday in North America, Thursday in Australia, March 9 in Europe and March 15 in Japan. It is playable on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 360 and Windows PC. It currently does not have a rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board.","In ""Mass Effect 3,"" Commander John Shepard is in a battle to retake Earth from the Reapers .

"(CNN) -- A man who crashed his plane in the Florida Panhandle in an apparent attempt to fake his death was sentenced Wednesday to more than four years in federal prison, officials said. Marcus Schrenker was accused of defrauding investors through companies he owned in Indiana. Marcus Schrenker, 38, of McCordsville, Indiana, pleaded guilty in June to charges of destruction of an aircraft and causing the Coast Guard to respond when no help is needed. He was sentenced to 51 months in prison Wednesday, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in the northern district of Florida. Schrenker also must pay the Coast Guard more than $34,000 in restitution and must pay Harley-Davidson Credit Corp., the plane's lien-holder, more than $871,000, the U.S. attorney's office said. However, the payment to Harley-Davidson will be offset by any amount the company receives from insurance, prosecutors said in a statement. Authorities believe that Schrenker hatched the plot for the January crash after investigators with the Indiana secretary of state's office searched his home and business on December 31. He has been charged in Indiana with one felony count each of an unlawful act by a compensated adviser and unlawful transaction by an investment adviser. Authorities have said they think he defrauded investors through three companies he owns in a suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. On January 11, Schrenker took off alone from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA46 plane, saying he was headed for Destin, Florida. While over Alabama, he contacted air traffic controllers, saying that the windshield had imploded and that he was injured and bleeding profusely. ""The defendant stated to air traffic controllers that he was not going to make it,"" according to documents filed in court providing a factual basis for Schrenker's guilty plea. Schrenker agreed to the facts, the documents said, and they were read aloud during his change of plea hearing in June. After Schrenker made that statement, his aircraft leveled off, and he remained at 3,500 feet while he made course corrections taking him closer to Harpersville, Alabama, where he had stored a motorcycle in a storage facility, the documents said. Over the nearby town of Childersburg, Alabama, Schrenker jumped from the aircraft. The Coast Guard Investigative Service later recovered cut lines from tree branches and a parachute with a serial number that was traced to Schrenker, court documents said. The Coast Guard dispatched rescue helicopters from New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, in case the plane crashed on land and sent two cutters in case it crashed into the Gulf of Mexico, prosecutors have said. Meanwhile, two F-15 fighter jets were scrambled and located the plane in the air near Birmingham, Alabama. The pilots reported that the plane's window was intact, its door was open, no pilot was on board, and the plane appeared to be on autopilot, according to affidavits filed in the case. The jets followed the plane until it crashed near the Blackwater River in East Milton, Florida, according to court documents. Authorities said it missed a group of homes by 50 to 75 yards. Although the plane was severely damaged, investigators found that its windshield and windscreens were not damaged and that there was no blood inside the plane, the documents said.  See plane's flight path » . In a search of the plane, authorities found handwritten notes on the inside back cover of a campground book, saying among other things, ""windshield is spider cracking,"" ""doors open,"" ""bleeding very bad"" and ""graying out,"" the documents said. Meanwhile, Schrenker fled Harpersville on his motorcycle and traveled to a campground in Florida, where he was arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service on the outstanding charges from Indiana, according to court documents. When found, authorities said at the time, Schrenker was bleeding from cuts on his wrists after an apparent suicide attempt. He was briefly hospitalized before being taken into custody. Examining Schrenker's computer, authorities found Internet searches on how to jump from airplanes and how to open a parachute, among other subjects, the court documents said. When questioned by federal officials, Schrenker claimed that his windshield struck him in the face and his door malfunctioned, the court documents said. Authorities then ""presented various pieces of evidence showing his claims to be untrue,"" and Schrenker admitted that he called in a false distress message and had intended the plane to crash into the Gulf of Mexico, the documents said. Indiana officials agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to extradite him, prosecutors have said.","Indiana's Marcus Schrenker pleads guilty to federal charges .

"JACKSON HEIGHTS, New York (CNN) -- Every day, unemployed men gather under the elevated 7 train in Jackson Heights, Queens. Many of them are homeless. All of them are hungry. Jorge Munoz estimates he has served more than 70,000 free meals since 2004. At around 9:30 each night, relief comes in the form of Jorge Munoz's white pickup truck, filled with hot food, coffee and hot chocolate. The men eagerly accept containers of chicken and rice from Munoz, devouring the food on the spot. Quiet gratitude radiates from the crowd. For many, this is their only hot meal of the day; for some, it's the first food they've eaten since last night. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""I thank God for touching that man's heart,"" says Eduardo, one of the regulars. Watching Munoz, 44, distribute meals and offer extra cups of coffee, it's clear he's passionate about bringing food to hungry people. For more than four years, Munoz and his family have been feeding those in need seven nights a week, 365 days a year. To date, he estimates he's served more than 70,000 meals.  Watch Munoz describe how his work is a family affair » . Word of his mobile soup kitchen has spread, and people of all backgrounds and status now join the largely-Hispanic crowd surrounding his truck -- Egyptians, Chinese, Ethiopians, South Asians, white and black Americans and a British man who lost his job. ""I'll help anyone who needs to eat. Just line up,"" Munoz says. And at a time when food banks are struggling to keep up with skyrocketing demand, he's never been needed more. But for Munoz, a school bus driver by day, this work is a labor of love. ""When I see these guys on the street,"" he says, ""it's like seeing me, 20-something years ago when I came to this country."" Munoz was born in Colombia and his father died in an accident when he was young. When his mother found it difficult to support Munoz and his sister, she made her way to New York, finding work in Brooklyn as a nanny. At her urging, Munoz followed in her footsteps, coming to the United States in the 1980s.  Watch Munoz be honored at Madison Square Garden » . ""She said this was a better future for us,"" he says. Munoz obtained legal residency in 1987 and later became a citizen, along with his mother and sister. He never stood on a street corner to find work, but as an immigrant, he identifies with many of the men he feeds. Munoz began his unorthodox meal program -- now his nonprofit, An Angel in Queens -- in the summer of 2004. Friends told him about large amounts of food being thrown away at their jobs. At first, he collected leftovers from local businesses and handed out brown bag lunches to underprivileged men three nights a week. Within a few months, Munoz and his mother were preparing 20 home-cooked meals daily. Numbers gradually increased over the years to 35 per night, then 60. In recent months, that number has jumped to as many as 140 meals a night. Sustaining this endeavor consumes most of his life. To his mother's dismay, his family's Woodhaven home is bursting with goods related to this work. An oversize freezer takes up most of the dining room, and the porch is lined with canned food and paper products. Daily operations now run like a well-oiled machine. Munoz gets up around 5:00 a.m. to drive his bus route, and he calls home on his breaks to see how the cooking is going. When he gets home around 5:30 p.m. -- often stopping to pick up food donations -- he helps pack up meals before heading out to ""his corner"" in Jackson Heights. ""He comes here without fail,"" says one of the men. ""It could be cold, it could be really hot, but he's here.""  Watch Munoz in action in Queens, New York » . On Saturdays he takes the men breakfast, and on Sundays -- his ""day off"" -- he brings them ham-and-cheese sandwiches. It's a relentless schedule, but either Munoz or his sister does it every night of the year. ""If I don't go, I'm going to feel bad,"" he says. ""I know they're going to be waiting for me."" With the economic downturn, donations have slowed as the crowds awaiting Munoz's arrival have grown. But he is determined to do all he can to meet their needs. Munoz estimates that food and gas cost approximately $400 to 450 a week; he and his family are funding the operation through their savings and his weekly $700 paycheck. Asked why he spends so much time to help people he doesn't know, he answers, ""I have a stable job, my mom, my family, a house... everything I want, I have. And these guys [don't]. So I just think, 'OK, I have the food.' At least for today they're going to have a meal to eat."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Sergio Perez is to leave Formula One team McLaren at the end of the 2013 season after just one year with the British marque. The 23-year-old, known in his home nation of Mexico as ""Checo"", is one of the country's biggest sporting stars, but has struggled after his high-profile move to one of the sport's biggest outfits prior to the start of this campaign. Perez, McLaren stablemate of 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson Button, has yet to record a podium finish this season and is 12th in the standings on 35 points -- 312 behind leader Sebastien Vettel, of Red Bull. Speculation has been rife in recent weeks that Perez was set to leave the team, with McLaren young driver Kevin Magnussen tipped to replace him. Now Perez has confirmed via a statement on his official Twitter page that he is to leave McLaren but insists he will give his all in the final two races of the season. ""First of all, I would like to thank McLaren for giving me the opportunity to be with them this season,"" he Perez. ""It has been an honor for me to have been in one of the most competitive teams in the sport and I do not regret even a bit having joined them. ""I have always given the best of me for the team and still despite this I could not achieve what I aimed for in this historic team."" Perez has just two races left, starting with the United States Grand Prix in Austin this weekend in which he is likely to be supported by a huge Mexican contingent, the circuit in Texas lying just 200 miles from the border. ""I am committed to delivering very good results in these last two races, especially in Austin,"" he said. ""I am so much looking forward to see all my people gathered together, feel their energy and show them the best of me. ""I would like to say to every single one of my fans around the world and in my country that I am eternally grateful to them. They have never let me down, especially in difficult moments like these. ""I truly appreciate their support, they have never forgotten me. I have met a lot of new people at McLaren and I have made many good friends as well. I am eternally grateful to them. It has been a learning experience to me."" McLaren has struggled to keep pace with Red Bull, Sebastian Vettel securing his fourth straight drivers' championship crown at the Indian Grand Prix last month. They last won the drivers' title in 2008 when Lewis Hamilton triumphed, though the Briton now drives for Mercedes, and last took the constructors' crown in 1998. McLaren's official Twitter account linked to a story in which team principal Martin Whitmarsh was quoted as saying: ""First of all, we would like to thank Checo for his kind and gracious statement, and for being a fine team member during the 2013 Formula 1 season. ""There are still two grands prix yet to run this year, and our collective focus is on scoring as many points as we can in those two remaining races. ""Checo has made many friends during his time at McLaren -- and, together, as a team, we intend to do our utmost to help him finish his year with us with two good results, especially here in Austin, where he has so many fans. ""We wish him well for the future, and are sure that he will have many successes ahead of him. ""As regards our driver line-up for next year, no 2014 deal has yet been signed with any driver except Jenson, and we therefore have nothing further to announce at this time. As and when that situation progresses, we will make a further announcement accordingly.""","Mexican driver Sergio Perez is to leave F1 team McLaren at the end of 2013 season .

"(CNN) -- Was the killing of Osama bin Laden legal under international law? The administration says yes, absolutely.  Experts are unsure. Attorney General Eric Holder told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that the U.S. raid on bin Laden's compound was lawful ""as an act of national self-defense."" Bin Laden ""was the head of al Qaeda, an organization that had conducted the attacks of September the 11th,"" Holder said.  ""It's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field."" The raid ""was conducted in a manner fully consistent with the laws of war,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters.  Carney declined to offer specifics, but said ""there is simply no question that this operation was lawful. ... (Bin Laden) had continued to plot attacks against the United States."" Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama had all issued orders to kill or capture the al Qaeda leader. ""The authority (during the raid) was to kill bin Laden,"" CIA Director Leon Panetta said Tuesday during an interview with PBS.  ""Obviously, under the rules of engagement, if he had in fact thrown up his hands, surrendered, and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him.  But they had full authority to kill him."" A number of experts have told CNN the question of actual legality may come down to bin Laden's response at the moment U.S. Navy SEALs burst into his room. ""If a person has his hands in the air, you're not supposed to kill him,"" said Steven Groves, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Navi Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, told reporters she wants a ""full disclosure"" of the key facts. U.S. officials have revised their account of the assault on the compound in Pakistan.  Bin Laden was not armed during the 40-minute raid, they now say, but he put up resistance to U.S. forces. The al Qaeda leader was moving at the time he was initially shot, according to a U.S. official who has seen military reports of the incident.  The official declined to describe the movements more specifically. Asked if bin Laden tried to grab a weapon or physically attack a commando, the official would say only that ""he didn't hold up his hands and surrender."" Officials earlier claimed that bin Laden was an active participant in the firefight that erupted, implying that he was armed and gave the SEALs little choice but to shoot him. Groves, citing the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, told CNN that, based on the most recent White House account, ""there is nothing to indicate anything illegal happened."" Bin Laden, considered a combatant by virtue of his position as head of al Qaeda, needed to immediately make clear a desire to surrender, if that was his decision, in order to avoid being shot.  That apparently didn't happen, Groves said. ""The United States offered bin Laden the possibility to surrender, but he refused,"" Martin Scheinin, the United Nations' special rapporteur for human rights, said Tuesday.  ""Bin Laden would have avoided destruction if he had raised a white flag."" Geoffrey Robertson, a human rights lawyer who has defended WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange among others, made clear that international law requires any killing to be done in self-defense. If members of the SEAL team ""reasonably (believed there was) a risk to themselves, then the killing was justified,"" Robertson asserted.  But given the changing White House account of the raid, ""there needs to be an inquiry,"" he said. Cherif Bassiouni, head of DePaul University's International Human Rights Law Institute and a former U.N. war crimes investigator, said that the ""killing of any individual sought by law enforcement in the course of a lawful arrest is always a question of facts.  Did the person resist?  Did the person have a deadly weapon?  Were the arresting officers in fear of their lives?  These are all pertinent questions."" Bassiouni stressed that any ""extrajudicial execution of an unarmed person is in violation of international law."" ""It is necessary for the Navy to conduct an internal investigation into the appropriateness of the use of armed force,"" Bassiouni told CNN.  ""However, it is also important not to make the Navy SEALs be the scapegoats for (any) secret orders which the public is unaware of to simply kill bin Laden no matter what."" Was the incursion of U.S. forces into Pakistani territory without the clear permission of Islamabad legal? In response to that question, the U.S. intelligence official echoed Holder's and Carney's remarks, asserting that ""since 9/11, the U.S. has had the authority to kill Osama Bin Laden."" ""The operation was the subject of a rigorous legal review and was planned in strict accord with American law,"" the official said.

Bin Laden was an indicted international criminal who had evaded all attempts to apprehend him, Robertson said.  As a consequence, he asserted, the operation was legal. Groves argued the use of the SEALs in Pakistan does ""present complications,"" though he noted that there has been a ""kind of a wink and a nod game (the U.S. government has) been playing with the Pakistanis for years"" in terms of predator drone strikes and other attacks against Islamic extremists on Pakistani soil. Bassiouni argued that ""the mission to capture was legal, even though there are some questions under international law about one state sending its forces into another state to kidnap a person wanted for trial."" The issue first arose in the early 1960s, Bassiouni noted, when notorious Nazi Adolf Eichmann was kidnapped by Israeli agents in Argentina and subsequently brought to Israel for trial. Half a century later, that issue remains a matter of sharp dispute.

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- The judge in the libel case of Amanda Knox's parents resigned Monday because he was involved in the trial of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito in the killing of a British student. Paolo Micheli said he would recuse himself, intimating paperwork in the very brief court hearing. The case was adjourned until January 24, 2012. Police officers are suing Knox's parents, Edda Mellas and Curt Knox, accusing them of defamation for their description of how Amanda was treated after her arrest in the murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox won a legal victory last week when key DNA evidence from her murder trial was called into question. In a 146-page report, forensic science professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti concluded that while Knox's DNA was present on the knife handle, tests for Kercher's DNA were unreliable. ""There is no conclusive scientific evidence regarding the nature of the blood,"" the report states. ""It cannot be excluded that the result obtained from sampling the find B (knife blade) could be the result of contamination"" occurring at any stage of the testing process. Mellas on Monday hailed the DNA findings as ""great news,"" saying Amanda Knox was ""thrilled."" The forensic report gave Knox ""a little bit more hope that this is all going to turn out the way it should. I mean, as an innocent person it's really hard for her,"" her mother said. Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga said the conclusions of the report ""are clear to everyone -- there is a probability of contamination"" of the evidence. Mellas and Knox were indicted in February on charges of libeling police in Perugia, the family's Italian attorney said. In a 2009 interview in the Sunday Times of London, the couple said their daughter ""had not been given an interpreter, had not received food and water, and had been physically and verbally abused"" by police after her arrest for the murder of the exchange student, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. ""I think our case may go years, depending on what happens in Perugia. If we're found guilty we will appeal, even if it means going to the Supreme Court,"" Mellas told CNN in February when she was indicted. Knox, 23, was sentenced in December 2009 to 26 years in prison for Kercher's death at the villa the two shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Kercher, 21, was found dead in November 2007, semi-naked with her throat slashed. Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of the murder. Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. He testified against Knox and Sollecito in Knox's appeal last month.

"(CNN) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung urged authorities Wednesday to ""urgently implement"" relief efforts after Typhoon Ketsana slammed into the country hours earlier. A man walks by a lake alongside the national north-south highway near Danang, Vietnam, on Tuesday. The prime minister said in a written statement that he sent his ""profound condolences to the families of killed and wounded,"" and to those who suffered damage to their homes and property. The government did not say how many people had been killed or were reported missing. Numerous news agencies reported the deaths of more than a dozen people. CNN could not independently verify the reports. The prime minister said resources in several provinces would be focused on searching for missing people; treating the wounded; moving those in flooded areas; and providing people with food and water. After it struck central Vietnam, Ketsana weakened to a tropical storm, forecasters said. ""The system is expected to completely dissipate over land within the next 12 hours as it continues to track to the west,"" the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said in its final statement issued on the storm at 11 a.m. Tuesday ET.

"Rason, North Korea (CNN) -- As the sole Western journalist covering a unique bicycle race in North Korea last month, I was provided with a personal guide, a car with a driver and the promise that I was free to take any photographs I wanted. As a journalist, it seemed like an incredible opportunity to document a small snapshot of what North Korea was really like. However, the promise turned out not to be completely true. At the border, before going back to China, a group of security guards confiscated my camera and erased all images they thought were inappropriate, or did not portray the country in a favorable light. The North Korea I wasn't meant to see . But with the help of a computer expert in Hong Kong, I managed to get all the pictures back. Officially, I only had two restrictions to obey during my trip: No photos of the military or military facilities and all shots of portraits of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong-Il had to show their entire figures. And I was under no circumstances allowed to walk off alone. My guide, Ko Chang Ho, was surprisingly friendly and talkative. Contrary to the propaganda machine I was expecting, the 42-year-old father of two talked at length about his days as an English student in Pyongyang and his interest in international literature. His favorite author was William Shakespeare; the last book he read was Sir Walter Scott's classic novel, ""Ivanhoe."" We also talked about why the outside world has such a negative view of North Korea; something he was very sad about. He loved his country and I chose my words carefully. Many times I asked Ho if it was okay to take photos of police, guards, power stations, refineries, train tracks and other objects I suspected would be considered sensitive by the secretive regime. ""Go right ahead,"" he would say with a smile. Driving though the countryside, I asked the driver to stop by the small villages. ""No problem,"" said my guide. ""Just be polite to the peasants. They are not used to Westerners with big cameras."" Westerners race into North Korea -- by bike . By the finishing line of the cycle race in the city of Rason, I was running around trying to get good shots of the riders coming in as well as of spectators and the city itself. My guide had a hard time keeping up with me, but he never once told me to lower my camera or slow down. It was all very informal. After the race, I had a chat with the vice mayor of the Rason Special Economic Zone, Hwang Chol Nam -- who to my surprise spoke fluent Swedish after studying in Europe. And in the evening I sat down with a couple of young women from the local tourist office and had a conversation -- in Mandarin through an interpreter -- about relationships and everyday life in North Korea. They explained that although some North Korean marriages still were staged because of family ties to politics, almost all are today based on love. They said most of their friends and local teenagers are studying Mandarin to do business and network with the growing number of Chinese visiting the region. The following day, I had my first clash with the authorities. After breakfast I decided to go for a walk alone. While the guides and the other officials were busy, I walked out the hotel to the parking lot by myself. I didn't manage to get more than 10 meters before a uniformed guard saw me and led me back to the hotel lobby and told my guide that I had wandered off. The real setback happened just minutes before I was to cross the Tumen River and go back to China. At the border, a group of guards called me over and demanded to check my camera. Despite my objections, one of the guards erased picture after picture. I tried to look over his shoulder to see what he was deleting, but he kept turning his back to me so I couldn't see. Every time he hit the delete button, I felt the frustration build. My guide said they were erasing ""inappropriate"" pictures, with no further explanation. In total, 90 images were erased from the memory card. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . I was annoyed but not surprised. Back in Hong Kong I got in contact with a small IT company that specializes in data recovery. After leaving me waiting impatiently for 24 hours, they finally got back to me. All the photos had been saved. ""When they deleted the file on the card, they did not delete the whole file instantly, it just released the space of this file for future use -- the content is still there,"" Benjamin Wong, owner of Vector Data Recovery explained to me. Looking at the censored photos, I was surprised about the selection. Some were of angry looking security guards with scruffy barracks in the background, others of government officials going through our passports. I could just about understand that. But others were in my eyes harmless, even scenic. There was an old couple walking alongside the cornfields, a family out in the countryside waving from their house, and a mother cycling with her sleeping baby on a seat on the back of her bike. One photo showed a volleyball pitch next to the customs building by the border crossing. Why these images are not in line with North Korean image guidelines is for me a mystery. But so are a lot of things about the world's most isolated country. The North Korea we rarely see .","Journalist Johan Nylander covered an international bike race from China into North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Monday sees the eagerly awaited publication of ""Steve Jobs,"" the authorized biography of the late tech pioneer written by Walter Isaacson. Remarkably -- through leaks of the book's details in the press and reflections from his friends -- I've learned more about Jobs since his passing than I knew during his life. What I've learned is that Jobs was guided by a very specific worldview -- a set of values that shaped everything he did. And I've begun to think how we can all live more like Steve: The Tao of Steve, perhaps. How to be rich . Steve, despite his financial success, was frugal. According to Isaacson, a former chairman of CNN, Steve said of money, ""I did not want to live that nutso lavish lifestyle that so many people do when they get rich."" As a result, Steve's home wasn't particularly huge and he famously embraced minimalism. ""I saw a lot of other people at Apple, especially after we went public, how it changed them."", Steve said in a recorded interview. ""And a lot of people thought that they had to start being rich. I mean, a few people went out and bought Rolls Royces, and they bought homes, and their wives got plastic surgery. I saw these people who were really nice simple people turn into these bizarro people. And I made a promise to myself to myself, I said I'm not gonna let this money ruin my life."" Steve wasn't completely opposed to having expensive things, however: He drove a Mercedes-Benz SL55 AMG. How to dress . Steve's frugality showed in his simple wardrobe, too: a pair of jeans and a black turtleneck. Jobs embraced this look for its simplicity -- allowing him, perhaps, to focus on more important things. ""He also came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style,"" Isaacson said of Steve's look. Jobs had enough of the turtlenecks to wear them for his entire life. His frugality played into Jobs' clothing choices as well. Former Compaq chairman Ben Rosen recalled in his blog this week a meeting he had with Jobs on a bitterly cold day in Manhattan. Rosen noticed Jobs did not have a coat, and the two went to a clothing store to purchase one. Jobs found a coat he liked, but balked at the price. ""That much for an overcoat? Too much. Besides, I'll never use it in California,"" he said. The pair left the store, with Jobs tolerating the freezing cold rather than spending money on a coat he wouldn't wear again. How to handle authority . Living like Steve involves having a healthy disregard for authority. Jobs' penchant for breaking the rules was best summarized in Apple's 1997 ""Think Different"" ad campaign: ""Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo."" Jobs questioned authority his entire life, even choosing to drive without license plates. Isaacson asked Jobs why he didn't have plates, to which Jobs initially replied it was for privacy reasons. When informed that having no license plates would actually attract attention, Jobs replied that he didn't have license plates because he didn't have license plates. How to die . Jobs' philosophy on death was that it may ultimately be a good thing: ""Nature's change agent,"" he called it. In a 2005 Stanford commencement speech, Jobs said of death: ""Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked."" And yet Jobs may have altered his views as he faced his own mortality. According to Isaacson, Jobs said he was ""50-50"" on whether he believed in God. ""Ever since I've had cancer I've been thinking about it more -- and I find myself believing a bit more. I kind of, maybe it's because I want to believe in an afterlife, that when you die, it doesn't just all disappear. The wisdom you've accumulated. Somehow it lives on. But sometimes I think it's just like an on-off switch -- click and you're gone,"" Jobs said. ""And that's why I don't like putting on-off switches on Apple devices."" To live -- and to die -- like Steve Jobs, then, is to live simply, to challenge the norm, to never let success change you. Most of all, it's to live in the knowledge that you're going to die. As Jobs said of mortality: ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.""","Steve Jobs lived by a set of values that shaped everything he did, Pete Cashmore writes .
Jobs, despite his financial success, was frugal .
Jobs questioned authority his entire life, even choosing to drive without license plates .
He saw death as having positive aspects, referring to it as ""nature's change agent"""
"(CNN) -- On a cold December evening, the green and white of Celtic were demolishing the red and gold of Motherwell and extending their lead at the top of Scotland's Premier League. At the same time, a few hundred of their fans were demolishing seats, throwing green smoke bombs onto the pitch and extending their reputation for notoriety. For Celtic's management, it was the final straw. They banned 128 Celtic supporters from attending future home matches and coach Neil Lennon bemoaned the ""powder keg"" atmosphere generated by a group of fanatical followers called the Green Brigade. There are passionate soccer supporters the world over, the sort who name sons after their clubs' stars or travel hundreds of miles on a wet Tuesday evening. But Celtic's Green Brigade brings a sectarian flavor to its support for Glasgow's Catholic club. In fact, it's more than a flavor -- though its members have described themselves as ""anti-sectarian."" This week Celtic went before the disciplinary committee of European football's governing body UEFA for the seventh time in as many years. The latest infraction: the Green Brigade had unfolded huge pictures of a Scottish nationalist hero, William Wallace, and more controversially of Irish Republican Army hunger-striker Bobby Sands before a recent game against AC Milan. Above the portraits, the slogan: ""The Terrorist or the Dreamer."" UEFA punishes such behavior, ""particularly messages that are of a political, ideological, religious, offensive or provocative nature."" It holds clubs responsible for the actions of its fans -- whether signs, chanting or throwing pyrotechnics. Celtic was fined 50,000 euros and responded by asking all its fans to ""unite with the Club"" with no more such banners. Celtic is one half of the most famous -- and at times infamous -- rivalry in British football. Its old enemy Glasgow Rangers has Protestant affiliations and for many years had a policy of not buying Catholic players. Submerged in debt, Rangers fell on hard times. Now the club -- resurrected as a new company but still featuring its predecessor's team manager and several of its players -- is in the lower reaches of the Scottish League. But in the past the two Glasgow clubs' epic battles for supremacy have been accompanied by provocative anthems, sectarian songs, violence and even deaths among supporters. There was a time when a club's directors would see such behavior as part of the fans' identity with a cause or heritage. Football in Europe grew up in the slums of industrialized cities, generations before the term ""politically correct"" was born. Glasgow Celtic was founded to provide charity to Irish Catholics who had fled famine for work in Scotland. And religious identity was a mooring in an alien land. Similarly in Liverpool, where one in four inhabitants in the late 19th century was of Irish origin, Everton FC was run by Liberals supporting Home Rule for Ireland while Liverpool FC was dominated by Protestant and Unionist figures. Today club football is big business with sponsors paying millions to have their names on stadiums and shirts, and top players earning six figures a week. Consultancy Deloitte calculates that the 20 richest clubs (all in Europe) generated more than $6 billion in revenues in 2011/12. A club like Celtic which competes in the European Champions League wants to attract international stars regardless of how or whether they were baptized. Getting into constant trouble with the European football authorities doesn't help. The fines are minimal; it's the damage to reputation that puts off sponsors. After the Bobby Sands incident, Celtic's chief executive,Peter Lawwell reminded fans that Celtic was ""a top football club in fantastic shape, aiming to play its part as a major football club on the European stage."" But fans don't always want to co-operate with the new corporate branding that clubs like to project. For sure, those attached to sectarian labels are a very small minority. The rest of society has moved on and religious observance has shrunk. But traditions and rivalries are ingrained for literally millions of fans in the UK and around the world. Supporters of English Premier League side Hull City have launched a vocal campaign against plans by the owner to change the club's name to Hull Tigers to broaden its appeal in Asia. The name of the protest group -- ""City Till We Die"" -- is a mark of the emotions generated. Similarly Cardiff City fans last year protested the decision of Malaysian owner Vincent Tan to change the team's colors from blue to ""lucky red."" Many fans just don't trust the corporate ownership of their clubs. In July, the new director of Fan Relationship Management at Manchester City made the mistake of saying his mission was to ""better engage them, serve them and monetize them."" Beyond Britain, regional, political and class differences -- or the memory of them -- still feed the rivalries and passions of football fans. In Milan, both AC and Internazionale have their own versions of the ""Green Brigade"" -- known as Ultras. AC supporters tend to be more working class; Inter's from more affluent parts of the city. Several Italian clubs -- Inter among them -- have been in trouble because of a neo-Nazi fringe of supporters. The Rome club Lazio, which was the favorite of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, has a notorious group of right-wing ""Irreducibili"" Ultras among its fans. In the past, they have even taunted Jewish supporters of rivals AS Roma with posters recalling the Holocaust. History also infuses Spain's greatest rivalry, between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barca is the champion of the Catalans, traditionally a more left-wing club than Real, representative of the capital's elite. These passions still have a feverish hold. But a new era of multi-million dollar sponsorship and television deals, stadia with executive boxes behind smoked glass, and the spiraling price of match tickets, has changed the game. Consultants Price Waterhouse said in a recent report: ""All sporting bodies are walking a tightrope, as they attempt to balance increased commercial demands on their sports with the often conflicting need to maintain the integrity and unpredictability that make sporting competitions so exciting and appealing to their supporters."" One example: Barcelona's first-ever deal with a sponsor in 2011, a five-year contract with the Qatar Foundation (later Qatar Airways) worth more than $200 million. Fans began a petition against the commercialization of their beloved team, and one of its most famous former players, Johann Cruyff, described the deal as ""vulgar."" But the sponsorship remained. Fans (and some players) also grumble at the need for their teams to go on tiring pre-season tours of North America or the Far East to open up new markets for their club's ""brand"". The big football clubs with monstrous wage bills could not survive without sponsorship and television deals, whose value is growing faster than revenue from tickets. But the fans are still the fabric of any club. In the era of social media they are able to organize and protest, and more are doing just that.","A group of Glasgow Celtic fans lands the club with a fine after displaying banners at games .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- A day after police arrested five people in what authorities described as an anti-Semitic demonstration that turned violent, Jews expressed concern Monday over the attack. Supporters of those who attacked a celebration of Israel's founding outside an Argentine court . The attack occurred outside the Israeli embassy as members of Argentina's Jewish community, celebrating the 61st anniversary of the state of Israel's founding, were confronted by a gang of youths. ""They came equipped for that,"" said Daniel Gazit, Israel's ambassador to Argentina, who witnessed the incident in which three Jews and a policeman were injured -- none seriously. ""They came with their clubs, with their arms, one had a knife, one had a pistol -- they came ready for this,"" Gazit said. ""It was not a political demonstration ... this was violence for the sake of violence."" Witnesses said the attackers were between the ages of 15 and 20. The five who were detained were to make their first court appearance on Tuesday. Some people complained about the lack of security measures in place at the time of the pro-Israel demonstration and denounced the secretary general of AMIA, a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, for having allowed a type of ""liberated zone"" from which the group attacked. ""There were a lot of police in that place,"" said Anibal Fernandez, the minister of justice. ""Some uniformed, others not, and that allowed them to rapidly arrest five of them."" Fernandez described the act as anti-Semitic, but denied Argentina was experiencing a surge in such sentiment. He blamed a small group for the incident. But for some people in Argentina's Jewish community, this and other recent acts, like the appearance of swastikas painted in a cemetery, have raised concerns. The Israeli government, through the chancellery, demanded that the incident be investigated and that those responsible be severely punished to avoid a recurrence of such acts.","Attack occurs outside the Israeli embassy; four hurt, none seriously .

"(CNN) -- We're barely 60 miles southeast of the home of China's latest sports phenomenon, but as kickoff approaches the atmosphere in Hong Kong is, in contrast to European Champions League nights, muted at best. The city's fans, it seems, don't always have the stomach for 3.30 a.m. kickoffs. A mere border may separate Hong Kong from Guangdong and its flagship sports franchise, Guangzhou Evergrande FC, but the city sleeps, unaware, or uncaring, that the team from the neighboring province is playing the game of their lives. This team, which was languishing in China's second division when property magnate Xu Jiayin bought it in 2010, has just played current European champions Bayern Munich at the Stade d'Agadir in Morocco. There is no feeling of ownership here of the team that has surprised everyone, and captured a historic trophy in the process, as Hong Kong fans struggle to even find the FIFA Club World Cup on their dials. The fiscal situation of this Southern Chinese team is not dissimilar to that at, say, Chelsea or Manchester City, both title hopefuls in England's overwhelmingly popular Premier League, or Ligue 1's Paris Saint Germain, who have similarly benefited enormously from the largesse of well-to-do owners. All three have designs on Europe's biggest prize, the Champions League. Chinese domestic football can't hope to match the popularity of English or Spanish football here in Hong Kong, but even so there's been little sense of occasion tonight. If anyone was capturing hearts and minds it would have been the Bayern players, with an assured victory over the newly wealthy Chinese, with three rapid-fire goals around the half-time whistle sealing victory in a game in which Guangzhou failed to score. The result was never really in doubt -- the question was rather the severity of the mauling, but just to be on the same pitch in a competitive match, albeit as underdogs, is enough for many Mainland fans. After all, Bayern are the team of wunder-coach Pep Guardiola, formerly of storied serial winners FC Barcelona, along with players such as midfield maestro Philip Lahm and Ballon d'Or hopeful Franck Ribery. While it might have been hard to tell in Hong Kong, it has been arguably the biggest night of Guangzhou Evergrande's short existence, eclipsing even the AFC Champion's League victory over FC Seoul on away goals in October, a victory orchestrated by Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi. China's last success on the Asian stage came over two decades earlier -- before some of the players on the pitch were even born -- when Liaoning triumphed in the now-defunct Asian Club Championship. Xu, who runs property developer Evergrande Real Estate Group and is reportedly China's 13th richest man, energized Chinese football when his team lifted the AFC Champions League trophy in October. And while it is nigh-on impossible to break the hegemony of the European leagues' popularity in Asia, beating the best of Korea, Japan and Iran -- who supplied the other representatives of the semi-finals -- proved that China could compete with the best, regionally at least, and brought them to the world's attention last night. The Chinese team beat African champions Al Ahly in Saturday's quarter final to set up the semifinal clash with Bayern, whose form under Guardiola has been frighteningly good. While aspirations of beating this stellar team may be beyond the Chinese arrivistes at present, their last match showed promise. With success comes profile, and with profile, fans. ""I'm not a fan yet, just interested,"" Louis Tong says by email the day before the match. This Hong Kong-based Manchester United fan said he was planning on getting up -- or staying up -- to watch the match. ""It makes me proud to see a Chinese team playing at this level, and if they win I'll think about starting to go up to watch their games in Guangzhou."" Prizing the loyalty of already-declared fans like Tong away from their European teams might be a hard sell for an outfit that routinely plies its trade week-in, week-out in the parochial confines of the Chinese Super League, but the team's run of form has started to win them new admirers, like 19-year-old Yue Xu, who comes from Guangzhou but studying in Rennes, in France. ""I am not a real fan,'"" she says, also by email. ""However. maybe later I'll be more interested [in the team]... [the club's] success attracts me to become a fan of it. ""Xu Jiayin is starting a long-term project -- he is setting up football schools and recruiting the best coaches."" Ahead of the game, she remains coy about predicting the result, but with an admirable optimism says, ""I believe that my team, our Chinese team will make a miracle."" But not everyone in China is convinced. Gong Lei, President of China Fanclub des FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen in Beijing, tells CNN that he's happy that Bayern played a Chinese team. ""On one hand it's my favorite team, and on the other it's a team from my country,"" he says via a translator. ""It's not that much of a test of my loyalty. I pay much more attention to Bayern's games and even though Guangzhou is a Chinese team I don't follow them so closely. ""I hope that at some point in the future a Chinese team will be able to rival a European team but for the present there's still quite a gap in the skill level. But this is a good start, and for Chinese teams to play European teams more often is a good learning opportunity.""","Hong Kong slumbers through the Asian Champions' crunch match against Bayern Munich .

"(CNN) -- Vulgar comments, some laced with racial epithets. A physical attack. Threats to him and his family.

""Jonathan endured harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing,"" the attorney, David Cornwell, said in a prepared statement. ""... These facts are not in dispute."" The comments, through the intermediary, break a silence from the offensive lineman who walked out after an incident in the team's cafeteria and hasn't been back since, according to Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin. Days later, Miami suspended Richie Incognito, 30, for conduct detrimental to the team. Rumors and news stories flew quickly in the days to come, including a well-publicized voice mail in which Incognito reportedly calls Martin a racial epithet and threatens his life. Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future . Some also questioned the toughness of Martin, a Stanford University graduate who was in his second NFL season, especially as it came out that he might be seeking help for emotional issues. But Cornwell stressed: ""Jonathan Martin's toughness is not an issue."" ""Jonathan started every game with the Miami Dolphins since he was drafted in 2012,"" he said of the second-round draft pick. ""At Stanford, he was the anchor for Jim Harbaugh's 'smash mouth' brand of football and he protected (then-Stanford, now Indianapolis Colts quarterback) Andrew Luck's blind side. ""The issue is Jonathan's treatment by his teammates."" Cornwell then outlined some of that treatment, including Martin's reaction to it. Martin tried ""to befriend ... teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment"" -- something that Cornwell called ""a textbook reaction of victims of bullying."" It didn't work, the lawyer said. Instead, there was more taunting, ""a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate and daily vulgar comments,"" and a threat of a group sexual assault against Martin's sister. ""Eventually, Jonathan made a difficult choice,"" Cornwell said of Martin leaving the Dolphins. ""... Jonathan looks forward to getting back to playing football. In the meantime, he will cooperate fully with the NFL investigation."" Dolphins quarterback: Richie Incognito saw Jonathan Martin as 'little brother' Martin on leave; Incognito suspended . That investigation is one part of the still evolving saga centered on Martin and Incognito, plus more generally on the Dolphins team and the culture in NFL locker rooms. Commissioner Roger Goodell has tapped veteran lawyer Ted Wells -- who participated in a 2012 investigation of alleged sexual abuse at Syracuse and one that led to the change this year in who heads the NBA players union -- to lead the NFL's investigation. Cornwell, Martin's lawyer, also has a lengthy background in sports and law. That includes five years working for the NFL, being part of a top sports agency and serving as a top official for the Upper Deck trading card and memorabilia company. Besides continuing to work in the Gordon & Rees law firm's Sports, Media and Entertainment division out of Atlanta, Cornwell is also the executive director of the NFL Coaches Association, which represents ""the interests of nearly 500 assistant coaches,"" according to his official profile. Cornwell didn't immediately return a CNN request for comment Friday on a potential conflict of interest, especially given a report from the Sun-Sentinel, a South Florida newspaper, that Miami coaches asked Incognito to toughen up Martin after the latter missed a voluntary workout. His client, Martin, is still on the Dolphins roster. Incognito is the lone player suspended as a result of this ordeal, though Cornwell's statement alleges multiple players mistreated Martin. CNN reached out multiple times to Incognito but hasn't received comment. But he did talk to CNN affiliate WSVN outside a doctor's office in Weston, Florida, on Tuesday, saying, ""You know, I'm just trying to weather the storm right now. And this will pass."" Incognito has a history of run-ins. They include a much-reported suspension from the University of Nebraska football team and his release by the NFL's St. Louis Rams in December 2009 after an in-game argument with then-head coach Steve Spagnuolo. More recently, in 2012, a volunteer at a golf tournament accused Incognito of inappropriately touching her with a golf club, according to a newly disclosed police report. No charges were filed, according to CNN affiliate WPLG-TV, which first obtained the police report. Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future . Teammates: Martin, Incognito seemed close . Cornwell's comments about Martin seeking out friendships with some of his alleged tormenters didn't come from nowhere. Rather, it is an apparent explanation for why a man would appear friendly with the same people who were allegedly abusing him. Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill said Wednesday that Incognito considered Martin a ""little brother"" -- one who ""messed with him but ... was the first one to have his back in any situation."" And the closeness appeared to be mutual. ""I think if you had asked Jon Martin a week before who his best friend on the team was, he would have said Richie Incognito,"" Tannehill said. On the field, Incognito would be ""the first guy to stand up for Jonathan,"" the quarterback said. And ""outside of football, who was together? Richie and Jonathan."" Describing Martin as a quiet guy who made a few jokes but was mostly business, Tannehill said ""there were no warning signs"" that something like this -- which he called ""mind-blowing"" -- was happening. Tyson Clabo, another member of Miami's offensive line, similarly said he saw Incognito and Martin as buddies, not bully and victim. ""They hung out together,"" Clabo said. ""They did a lot of stuff together. So if (Martin) had a problem with the way that (Incognito) was treating him, he had a funny way of showing it."" Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has publicly insisted that the team takes ""this situation seriously"" and that he is ""committed to creating a professional (work) environment."" And Philbin, the club's coach, says he's ready to implement change if the NFL investigation finds his staff at fault. ""If this review reveals anything that needs to be corrected,"" he said, ""we will take all necessary measures to fix it, to ensure that this doesn't happen again.""

"(CNN) -- An 85-year-old American man detained and later let go by North Korean authorities described his time in custody as comfortable. Merrill Newman, who returned to the United States this weekend, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in California that he was kept in a hotel room, not a jail cell, and fed traditional Korean food during his detention. If anything, he was ""bored,"" the newspaper reported he said. Newman had traveled in October as a tourist to North Korea on a 10-day organized tour. Authorities nabbed him just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang. American 'deported' by North Korea fought there 60 years ago . For weeks, the North Korean government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman. An explanation finally came last month, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's ""apology."" The word was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions. In the note dated November 9, Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol Unit, part of the ""intelligence bureau"" fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect ""information"" and wage deadly attacks. ""After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman said, according to that report. When asked about the apology, Newman gave a smirk, according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel. ""Obviously, that's not my English,"" he said. Newman's release coincided with a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to South Korea, where he laid a wreath in honor of those who died in the war that pitted North against South. A senior administration official said that Newman's release was the result of direct contact between Washington and Pyongyang. The official said the North Koreans had told the Obama administration in a telephone call that they were releasing Newman; no explanation was offered. In Palo Alto, California, Newman's neighbors tied yellow ribbons around objects to welcome him back. CNN's Greg Botelho and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Merrill Newman, 85, returned to the United States this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela once said his wife, Graca Machel, makes him ""bloom like a flower."" Despite her reluctance to marry him at first, they've been inseparable since they tied the knot on his 80th birthday. Here are 10 things to know about the woman who was at the international icon's side to the very end. She's been first lady of two nations: Before she got married to the South African anti-apartheid icon, Machel was the first lady of Mozambique. Her husband, President Samora Machel, died in a mysterious plane crash in 1986. She was much younger: When they got married in 1998, she was 52. But she says their advanced age made their relationship better. ""We were grown up; we were settled; we knew the value of a companion, of a partner,"" she says. She separated the man from the icon: At the beginning of their relationship, Machel says, there was a conflict between the man she married and the world's perception of him. ""The aura around him was a bit confusing. But then I learned to live with it, in terms of separating the two,"" she told CNN's Robyn Curnow in a rare interview in 2008. South Africa wasn't always in love with her: Protective of their beloved Madiba, the nation did not warm up to a foreign first lady at first. She remained in the background at the beginning, and then slowly won them over with her loyalty and laid-back demeanor. She has something in common with the Kennedys: In Mozambique, she was nicknamed Jackie Kennedy. Not just for her class and grace, but because of the tragedy that befell her husband while in office. It wasn't love at first sight: After they met, she was reluctant to marry him or discuss their relationship in public. But Mandela wooed her the old-fashioned way, occasionally giving his bodyguards headaches as president when he'd make unannounced stops to buy her chocolates. She's kindred spirits with Mandela: Machel has something in common with her freedom fighter husband. While living in Mozambique, she was outspoken against the Portuguese colonial government. She's qualified in her own right: She served as minister of education and culture in Mozambique for more than 10 years. She is especially passionate about youth education, and has served as an expert on children's issues for the United Nations. She's Mandela's third wife: Mandela was first married to Evelyn Mase, but their marriage ended in divorce. In his biography ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" Mandela has said Mase made him choose between family and politics. He later married Winnie Mandela, a firebrand who became his voice when he was in prison. After their contentious divorce in 1996, Mandela married Machel two years later. Their wedding was private: Despite Mandela's larger-than-life status, they got married on his birthday 15 years ago. Their wedding was a low-key event attended by close family and friends. Nelson Mandela: Surprising facts you probably didn't know .","Graca Machel was reluctant to marry Nelson Mandela .

"(CNN) -- Whenever Felicia Hudson gets overwhelmed juggling a full-time job and caring for her ailing father, she finds solace in a piece of paper hanging in her office. ""Circumstances do not cause anger, nervousness, worry or depression ... it is how we handle situations that allow these adverse moods,"" it says. ""We actually choose our own attitudes. I choose to be calm, well-adjusted and happy!"" She can't remember where she found the motto, but focusing on it is one of several coping mechanisms Hudson has developed since she took her father out of a nursing home in July 2008 and moved him into her two-bedroom apartment in San Diego. By then, 72-year-old Alvin Hudson had suffered three strokes and been diagnosed with diabetes, kidney failure and renal disease, requiring a long list of medication and dialysis three times a week. It was only a matter of days before Hudson became overwhelmed, she says. ""It was like, 'oh my, what did I get myself into?'"" the 51-year-old Georgia native recalls. ""Sometimes, I would just go into the bathroom and cry."" She laughs about it now, but in the beginning, ""it was horrible,"" she says. She'd go to her job at a manufacturing plant at 8 a.m., leaving at lunch three times a week to bring her father to a dialysis center. She'd return to work and stay late to make up the time, and then go back to the center to pick him up. Those were just the normal days. If he had an extra appointment with the dentist, podiatrist or general practitioner, she took the day off to shuttle him around and sit in waiting rooms. ""I put my life on hold,"" she said. ""I was trying to do it all."" It's a scenario familiar to many across the United States as adult children become caregivers for aging and chronically ill loved ones. With the first of the baby boomers turning 65 in 2011, the number of Americans entering retirement age is expected to nearly double by 2030, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging. As the country braces for the prospect of providing health care to roughly 72 million adults, the impact on caregivers is coming into focus. A study released last week found that Americans caring for aging and chronically ill relatives reported higher levels of stress, poorer health and a greater tendency to engage in unhealthy behaviors to alleviate stress than the population at large. Moreover, 55% of caregivers reported feeling overwhelmed by the task at hand, according to the American Psychological Association's ""Stress in America"" survey, which was conducted online among 1,226 adults in the United States in August and September. While emphasizing results among caregivers, the survey also found that 22% of Americans reported ""extreme stress"" and 39% said their stress had increased over the past year. Those results were higher among caregivers, who were also more likely than the general population to report doing a poor job at managing and preventing stress, according to the survey's findings. ""People who care for loved ones tend to take on a lot, but don't take care of themselves,"" said Beverly Hills psychologist Fran Walfish, who helps look after her 90-year-old father. ""It's easy to neglect yourself when you try to be all things to everyone else, but something has to give and it catches up with you."" The report emphasizes the public health implications of high stress levels, with caregivers reporting greater rates of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and depression. ""It takes an incredible amount of self-awareness but you have to be willing to say I need help, I'm not omnipotent,"" Walfish said. ""It's impossible to be all things to everyone, so what we have to do is have honest straight talk with ourselves about how much we can handle and when we seek help from others."" The same lesson applies to those who are stressed, without the added burden of being a caregiver, she said. Significant sources of stress among respondents included money (75%), work (70%), the economy (67%) and relationships (58%), according to survey results. Regardless of the cause, stress often results from taking on too much and not knowing when to stop or ask for help. ""People feel a lot of pressure, especially in this economy, to not complain or set limits for themselves. Before you know it, you can have a bodily reaction that can be very negative, from extreme depression to heart attack or stroke,"" said Andrew Spanswick, chairman and CEO of KLEAN, a residential addiction treatment center in West Hollywood, California. ""Americans are chronically sleep-deprived and overworked, so most people could really benefit from taking time for themselves and figuring out a way to relax,"" he said. For low-income households, a reprieve can be hard to come by. Even as work piled up around her, Hudson didn't complain, fearing for her job security. She'd lie awake at night worrying about finances. With the rest of her family across the country in Atlanta, she felt alone. She lost contact with friends, put on weight and began to neglect basic household chores amid the hustle of work and caring for her father. Help finally arrived for Hudson and her father when they discovered an all-inclusive elder care center that accepted Medicaid. St. Paul's PACE, which stands for Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, functions like a day care for the elderly, providing medical services, social outlets and meals under one roof, along with transportation to and from the Bankers Hill campus. ""What we usually encounter is a very overwhelmed adult child who is trying to work and can't keep things together. Oftentimes, their house is a mess, they're financially burdened and they no longer have outside ties to the community because all their time is spent caring for the mom and dad,"" said Amanda Gois, marketing director of St. Paul's PACE. ""The adult child is almost at the point of resenting the parent they love and the parent is often depressed and withdrawn and has lost a desire to thrive or connect with the community because he or she doesn't want to be more of a burden,"" she said. Now, Hudson no longer has to bring her father to appointments. The program picks him up from home three times a week and brings him to the center, where he receives his medication and has lunch with other clients. The program also brings him to the dialysis center and back before returning him home. One night a week, someone from PACE comes to the home and cleans his room, changes his sheets and provides extras like a foot rub. ""The goal is she can now enjoy her dad versus having to care for her dad,"" said Gois. For Hudson, it's working. She joined a gym with a goal of taking off her caregiver weight. She has the ability to focus on her job and work overtime if she wants. At home, she still occasionally takes refuge in the bathroom if she has a disagreement with her dad. But it's a world of a difference from when they first became roommates, almost four years ago. ""It's a godsend,"" she said. ""I'm finally getting my life back.""","""Stress in America"" report emphasizes toll of caring for chronically ill relatives .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese-funded railway project in Kenya could transform transport in east Africa, and strengthen cross-border political and economic ties. Kenya is known as the region's logistics, trade and transport hub. Yet, its railway dates back to the colonial era and the 300-mile (483 kilometer) journey from Mombasa to Nairobi currently takes 12 hours for passengers -- freight trains take up to 36. The railway is old and large parts of the tracks remain unused, while roads are crowded and traffic is slow. In November 2013, Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta laid the foundation stone for the construction of a new standard gauge railway line in Mombasa that will connect the coastal city with the Kenyan capital Nairobi. ""The project will define my legacy as president of Kenya,"" Kenyatta told local media. ""What we are doing here today will most definitely transform ... not only Kenya but the whole eastern African region,"" Kenyatta said. 'Lunatic Express' The current rail network in Kenya consists of dilapidated British colonial-era lines. The notorious ""Lunatic Express"" was completed in 1901 and links Kampala in Uganda with the Indian Ocean town of Mombasa. The new line is hoped to cut travel time from Mombasa to Nairobi to four hours for passengers, eight hours for freight trains. Read more: Tech cities and mega dams: Africa's giant infrastructure projects . ""The Chinese-financed railway will be as big a game changer as the Lunatic Express was during its time more than a century ago,"" said Aly-Khan Satchu, who is a Sub Saharan Africa geopolitical and financial analyst and CEO of the Kenyan financial portal Rich. ""Kenya is a transit state and if you want to embed that advantage you need to have a first-class infrastructure."" The state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) will build the railway. The Chinese government has funded the first section of the project with $5.2 billion to build the Mombasa to Nairobi section. Work is expected to be completed by 2017. ""The railway development will have the following immediate economic benefits: reduce the cost of transportation in the region making it an attractive investment destination and accelerate industrialization through easier and cheaper transport and the establishment of new industries to service the new railway,"" said Mr. Zhang, a business manager who oversees the Africa projects at China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), parent company of CRBC. But the Mombasa-Nairobi section is only the first part of a much larger project. The standard gauge railway is planned to run between Mombasa and Malaba (in west Kenya) and eventually link to other major east African cities, namely Kampala (Uganda), Kigali (Rwanda) and Juba (South Sudan). With this, the Kenyan government is hoping to strengthen ties between those countries. Read more: World's biggest hydro power project to light up Africa? The railway is also expected to reduce congestion at Mombasa Port and direct the traffic flow away from the crowded streets and onto the railway. It is said to be the largest infrastructure project in the country since Kenya's independence from Great Britain in 1963. The railway is one of the flagship projects in Kenya's ""Vision 2030"" development program, which aims to transform the economic, political and social state of the country by 2030. Will the project benefit local people and businesses? The CCCC argues that the project will contribute to an annual GDP growth of at least 1.5% during construction and subsequent operation and that it will create at least 60 new jobs per kilometer of track during the construction period. ""We believe there is a great potential for us to invest in east Africa and (we're) looking forward to further cooperation,"" Zhang said. The CCCC claims the construction could create at least 10,000 jobs locally as ""large quantities of local inputs such as steel, cement, aggregates, electricity generation and electricity transmission pylons and cables, roofing materials, glass are required from local industries."" However, the unveiling of the project has not been without controversy -- some Kenyan MPs have criticized the tendering process and claimed the project would be a burden on Kenyan taxpayers. China's growing influence in Africa . China has numerous ongoing projects in Africa, especially in the infrastructure, oil, natural resources, manufacturing and banking sectors. For example, China has agreed to finance a large new port in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, that could involve more than $10 billion and the CCCC is also building parts of a new mega port in Lamu, Kenya. A Chinese shoe company is developing a special economic zone in Ethiopia and a Chinese construction company is building a railway line that connects Kaduna in northern Nigeria with the capital Abuja, for the Nigerian government. Read more: Economist Dambisa Moyo: China can transform Africa . David Shinn is an adjunct professor of international affairs at the George Washington University, and a former U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, and has written extensively about China-Africa relations. He argued that China is filling a gap by financing multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects, because Western governments have been largely absent in this area. ""Since the beginning of this century, China has filled a void left by the West but has done so with the idea it will be reimbursed and Chinese companies will turn a profit,"" he said. However, the growing influence China holds on the continent has made some apprehensive. ""Some African countries are concerned that China may develop a monopoly on these big infrastructure projects and want to ensure that Western countries, India, Turkey and Brazil stay or get engaged,"" he added. Of the Mombasa and Nairobi rail line, he said: ""The project probably makes good sense assuming that the cost is in line with predicted benefits. It will certainly improve economic integration and will probably have a positive impact on political integration.""","China funding $5 billion railway project in Kenya, between Mombasa, Nairobi .

"(CNN) -- Last year's inaugural live stream of the Super Bowl got its fair share of criticism, but it did set a precedent for how technology can affect our enjoyment of the year's most-hyped sporting event. This year, Sunday's big game is once again being streamed live online for those who can't camp out in front of their big-screen TVs. Between streaming options, mobile apps and social media chatter, there are plenty of options to take part in what's become a national pastime: eating unhealthy food, joking about the commercials and tuning in to what everyone hopes will be a great game. Whether you'll be watching the San Francisco 49ers take on the Baltimore Ravens at the Superdome in New Orleans, hosting a viewing party or watching solo, here are five ways tech can help you kick off a better Super Bowl. 1. If you're watching online . Super Bowl XLVII itself begins at 6:30 p.m. ET and will be streamed on CBSSports.com and NFL.com to laptops, tablets and smartphones. On CBS's stream, fans can choose from four camera angles to get a better perspective on the action, follow along with a curated Twitter feed, and check out the commercials as they air on TV via an interactive gallery. Real-time statistics and game highlights will also be available. Beyonce's lip-syncing at President Obama's inauguration last week has raised the stakes on her Super Bowl halftime performance. But so has the fact that it'll be the first one to be live-streamed online. (No pressure, Bey.) For the record, she says she'll be singing live this time. 2. If you need to make a beer/soda/chicken wing run . The best-case scenario is that you're well-stocked with snackage and drinks well before the pre-show starts at 6 p.m. and don't have to move an inch until the final whistle. But in case you must tear yourself away from your TV or laptop, there are some mobile apps that'll suffice in a pinch. ESPN ScoreCenter will keep you up-to-date on each play and is available for Apple, Android and Windows devices. If you want to keep it team-specific, both teams in Sunday's game have free mobile apps equipped for the iPhone, Android and BlackBerry. The 49ers Gameday Live app offers team news, real-time statistics and an integrated Twitter feed, while the Ravens roll out stats and news via their official app and mobile site, which hosts live scores. If you're a Verizon Wireless subscriber with an iPhone, there's also NFL Mobile, which offers live video of the Super Bowl. 3. If you're on Twitter . As anyone knows if they've watched a live national TV event with their phone or tablet recently, the best commentary can happen on Twitter and Facebook. The official hashtag to follow is #CBSSuperBowl, although others are sure to pop up during the game. Social-media monitoring company Sysomos has put together this handy infographic of game-related handles to start following. The list includes some obvious choices, like the Twitter feeds for both teams (that would be @Ravens and @49ers), but also those who follow football closely, like Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch, Bleacher Report's Ty Schalter and Matt Loede of NFL Gridiron Gab. For the official word on the game, the New Orleans Super Bowl Committee has its own Twitter account. HLN's website recommends 49ers tight end Vernon Davis and quarterback Colin Kaepernick, along with Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith and kicker Justin Tucker, as top picks for Super Bowl players who are active on Twitter and photo-sharing app Instagram. Considering her upcoming Super Bowl commercial is already one of the game's most buzzed-about ad spots, we're going to throw in model Kate Upton as well. 4. If you're in New Orleans . If you're attending the game, you've clearly got your viewing problems solved. But there are still a few apps that can make your New Orleans stay more enjoyable. HLNtv.com: Entrepreneur helps you experience N'awlins the right way .

"(CNN) -- Preliminary results in Honduras' presidential election show ruling party candidate Juan Hernandez with the lead. With more than 40% of the votes counted, he had 34%, while his closest competitor, Xiomara Castro, the wife of ousted President Manuel Zelaya, had 28%, according to the country's elections authority. Both candidates, however, declared victory Sunday night -- setting the stage for a potential showdown in a country wracked by security concerns and economic hardship. Castro announced her win on live television, while Hernandez did so on Twitter. ""Thank you my God and thanks to the Honduran people for this victory!"" he wrote. Eight candidates competed in the election. Term limits prevented President Porfirio Lobo, who was elected several months after the 2009 coup that removed Zelaya from power, from seeking a second term. He and Hernandez are from the same party. According to Honduras' elections authority, 700 international and 14,000 national observers supervised this year's election, which also included votes for national and local lawmakers. Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, according to the United Nations. The economy is also a top issue in the Central American country, where about 60% of the population lives below the poverty line. Inmates running the asylum? In Honduran prisons, that's no joke .

"(CNN) -- When Shorter University in northwest Georgia recently informed its 200 employees that they had to sign a ""personal lifestyle pledge"" requiring them to reject homosexuality or lose their jobs, school administrators underscored a staggering injustice: In 29 U.S. states, people can still be fired for being gay. While same-sex marriage and other equality debates soak up political and media attention, the Employment Non-discrimination Act, a 37-year-old bill, languishes in the U.S. Congress. Without that federal law, a majority of our states condone job, housing and other discrimination based on sexual orientation. An even larger number -- 35 -- have no protections for transgender people. Even corporate America is ahead of our legislators on this issue: 87% of Fortune 500 companies have policies barring discrimination based on sexual orientation. (About 46% also protect gender identity.) What do the innovators and drivers of our economy know that our politicians do not? Despite a bomb threat that canceled classes, hundreds of Shorter students, faculty, alumni and neighbors protested against the pledge on November 11. These individuals demonstrated tremendous courage in standing up to the university and its leaders' opportunistic interpretation of religious tradition. I know something about the personal strength that kind of protest requires. In the late 1990s, when I stood as President Bill Clinton's nominee as U.S. ambassador to the small European nation of Luxembourg, Christian extremists circulated false allegations of pedophilia and other lies in hopes of sinking the nomination. They never once questioned my professional qualifications; the only issue was my sexuality. One of the main reasons discrimination persists is that many people in America -- whether we speak of Don Dowless, Shorter's president, or presidential hopefuls Herman Cain or Michele Bachmann -- advance and reinforce the myth that being gay is a choice. For them, it is as if we silly LGBT people would be perfectly happy and healthy if we would just make a different set of decisions about our lives. As a young boy growing up in Austin, Minnesota, teachers forced pens into my right hand in the futile hope of correcting my left-handedness. If they had known I was gay, they might have tried to fix that, too. They would have failed. I spent the first 35 years of my life trying very hard not to be gay, to the extent that I married my college sweetheart and created a beautiful family of five children with her. Hard as I tried to make that life work, I could not escape my attraction to men. Choice had nothing to do with it. Scientists from San Francisco to Stockholm are finding evidence of what gay people know in their hearts: that sexual orientation is innate. Recent research in Sweden has identified differences in brain structure that may determine whether a person is gay or straight. Until the time that people accept that all of us are born into our sexual orientation and identity, LGBT citizens will still endure discrimination and selective application of the Constitution's protections. Through a social media campaign that includes online petitions, the anti-bigotry protesters are keeping pressure on Shorter to drop its policy. But the question must be asked: Why is it legal for a university to discriminate? The protesters must next take their demands to Georgia's legislature. Discrimination based on sexual orientation has no place in America today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Hormel.","Shorter University told employees to sign an anti-gay pledge or lose their jobs .
James Hormel: In 29 states, you can still be discriminated against, fired for being gay .
Hormel: Congress needs to pass 37-year-old Employment Non-Discrimination Act .
It's not a choice, he writes; people are born into sexual orientation and identity ."
"(CNN) -- ""I want to be frozen on the hope that they'll find whatever I died of and bring me back,"" Larry King told a shocked group of dinner guests gathered at his Beverly Hills home for a party hosted by him and his wife, Shawn. ""CNN Presents: A Larry King Special: Dinner with the Kings"" airs at 8 p.m. ET Sunday. No topic was off-limits when Conan O'Brien, Tyra Banks, Shaquille O'Neal, Seth MacFarlane, Jack Dorsey, Quincy Jones and Russell Brand discussed friendship, insecurities, success, worries, life, death and nearly everything in between. MacFarlane asked the CNN host whether he was ""maybe a little obsessed with your own mortality, like I am?"" ""Oh, I fear death,"" King told the ""Family Guy"" creator. ""My biggest fear is death, because I don't think I'm going anywhere. And since I don't think that, and I don't have a belief ... I'm married to someone who has the belief, so she knows she's going somewhere."" Although mortality was a topic of discussion, the dinner party was far from macabre. Not only did British funnyman Brand rummage through Shawn's underwear drawer (on camera, no less), the multicourse meal was prepared by Wolfgang Puck. ""This is big news,"" O'Brien said. ""You would like to be frozen? This is news to me."" ""It's the only hedging of a bet,"" answered King. The comedian and host of TBS's (sister station to CNN) ""Conan,"" still in shock, told the group, ""I just want to make sure that we stick with the headline here, which is that you wish to be frozen."" MacFarlane wondered aloud whether King wished to live forever. ""Yeah, you bet your ass,"" King said. ""Here's the thing,"" O'Brien continued.. ""You just revealed that you want to be frozen ..."" ""Why you hung on that?"" asked King. ""Listen, two things just happened,"" O'Brien joked. ""You revealed you want your head chopped off and frozen, and Russell Brand went into your wife's room and stole your underwear. And now you're moving on with your prepared questions."" When the subject turned to friendship, King told the group that he had an ""unusual situation"" because he remains friends with three individuals he's known since the age of 10. ""Well, these are people you fought in the Civil War with, Larry,"" joked O'Brien. ""That's a bond. When you're fighting the Confederacy, that's an incredible bond, Larry."" O'Neal told party guests that his mother is his best friend. ""We started out together in Newark, New Jersey,"" explained the basketball great. ""And throughout all the tough times, she was there. She was really my real role model. My mother's always been there for me. She's my best friend. Before I do something or say something crazy, I always think about how it could affect her."" MacFarlane had similar sentiments. ""Both my parents were unbelievably supportive,"" he said. ""They were ex-hippies and so, thank God, never wanted me to become a lawyer or anything like that. My mom used to call every Monday morning after 'Family Guy' would air, and either rave about the show or say, 'Eh, I didn't think this was as funny as some of the other ones.' And I would always look forward to that call."" MacFarlane lost his mother last year after a battle with cancer. O'Brien opened up about the insecurities within him that plague him to this day. He talked about a group of inner-city kids who came to visit the ""Conan"" set. ""One of the girls -- she must have been 16, 17 years old -- said to me, 'How do you get over your insecurity? When does that go away?' And I said, 'You never get over it.' And she was shocked."" Jones also chimed in on insecurities and success. ""The prime rule back in the '40s was, you have to be humble with your creativity and gracious with your success. We didn't think about money or fame ever."" King asked Twitter inventor Dorsey what makes him angry. ""Inaction,"" answered Dorsey. ""People seeing something just inhumane going wrong and just not doing anything about it."" King asked Banks what people's biggest misunderstanding is about her. ""When I created my show,"" said the fashion and beauty guru, ""I also created a persona on 'Top Model,' and it's a character. ... That is a character. I don't do that."" MacFarlane told the group, ""I think people, because of 'Family Guy', think that I'm a heartless frat guy, playboy type. Could not be further from the truth, I'm actually very shy. I fall asleep each night with a book in my hands. My favorite movie is 'The Sound of Music.' "" As dinner wrapped up, King asked his guests what they were most grateful for. He turned to Dorsey first, and Brand reminded him to do so ""in 140 characters or less."" Dorsey said he is most grateful for ""being able to wake up every day and do what I love."" King spoke to CNN.com about ""Dinner with the Kings."" ""The problem was editing it,"" he said. ""We did about two hours, but had to edit it down to a one-hour show."" King said that he would love to do a few dinner party specials a year. ""I hope people enjoy it,"" King said. ""I hope that enough people like it that we do it on a regular basis. I've done a lot of things in my life and this was one of the big kicks. I think it's a great idea and I think that it works."" King also opened up about some misconceptions about himself. ""People sometimes think I'm sort of all-knowing,"" he explained. ""When you reach a certain age and people see you on television, they look at you and think, 'Wow! Everything must be great!' Well, everything isn't always great. You can be hailed on the streetcorner, but you still have to go home and take out the garbage. You have one kid who doesn't want to go to school, another has an earache. ... ""Here's an example: My wife is late getting somewhere. One kid is yelling, another kid is out on his bike, and he hasn't come home, and I'm out in front of the house looking for him, and a tour bus goes by. So I gotta stop and smile and wave at a tour bus. It's like leading two lives, and it's crazy.""","Larry King: ""My biggest fear is death, because I don't think I'm going anywhere""
Conan O'Brien on Larry's friends: ""These are people you fought in the Civil War with""
Tyra Banks on ""Top Model"": ""That is a character. I don't do that""
Seth MacFarlane: He's not ""heartless frat guy,"" and his favorite film is ""Sound of Music"""
"(CNN) -- Mercedes Smith walked out of Bedford Hills Correctional Facility after 20 years, hoping to become a productive member of society. Shortly after she was released in June 2010, Smith found a part-time job. She was thrilled -- until she found out that working for $13 an hour meant her newly acquired Medicaid insurance would be terminated. Medicaid, a federally run health program, is designed to provide coverage for low-income and disabled individuals. But in New York, where Smith lives, single adults without dependents who earn more than $8,994 a year don't qualify. In other states, the qualifying income level is even lower. Adults without children in nearly half of states don't qualify at all. It's a population known as the working poor: They earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not nearly enough to pay for private health insurance. Smith chose to keep her job and prayed she wouldn't fall ill. She worries constantly about her atopic dermatitis, a skin condition that can be controlled only with a prescription medication cream she can't afford. ""I have to pick and choose when I go to the doctor,"" Smith said. ""When I get really, really sick, I have to go to the emergency room."" Experts hope Obamacare will change that. They estimate that 30% to 50% of released U.S. prison inmates will be newly eligible for insurance under the Medicaid expansion that covers people who earn up to 133% of the federal poverty level: about $15,800 a year for a single person. Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia have chosen to expand their Medicaid programs. And all states must now cover behavioral health treatments at the same rate as they cover physical ailments. So any inmate who qualifies for Medicaid or Medicare, and those who can afford health insurance, will be able to get help for substance abuse and mental health problems. That care could be the ""stay out of jail free"" card former inmates need, experts say. Whether the infrastructure is in place to support those dreams is another question. A chronic problem . Roughly 10 million people cycle through U.S. jails every year, according to Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, a nonprofit dedicated to improving connectivity between health care in and out of the justice system. Most are there for short periods before they are determined to be innocent, post bail or are sentenced to probation. Only 4% are sent to prison to serve longer sentences. ""In other words, 96% ... return directly to the community from jail, along with their often untreated health conditions,"" nonprofit President Steven Rosenberg explained. Those who end up in prison often have serious health issues. Nearly 40% percent of inmates have one or more chronic health problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or asthma, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (PDF) estimated in 2002. Inmates are also three times more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental illness and four times more likely to have a substance abuse problem, said Amy Solomon, senior adviser to the assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 64.2% of jail inmates have a diagnosable mental health problem, compared with about 26% of American adults. Most private health insurance companies do not cover the incarcerated. Inmates who were covered under Medicaid upon entering prison have their insurance suspended or terminated, depending on state law, because of Medicaid's ""inmate exception"" rule. But the real problem is not caring for this population inside, Solomon said; it's caring for them when they get out. Until the Affordable Care Act takes effect January 1, inmates are some of the only people in the United States who are guaranteed access to health care. To deprive them of medical care would violate the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Court has ruled on two occasions. ""A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the more recent Brown v. Plata opinion (PDF) on May 23, 2011. But when they leave prison, and most do, there are no such protections in place. Men and women who may have gotten their addictions under control or found the right medication combination to ease mental health symptoms behind bars are released into the community without a backup plan. Rosenberg tells of newly released prisoners who purposefully commit small crimes with the intent of returning to jail to get the surgeries they need for free. ""Access to health care can make a huge positive difference for this population,"" Solomon said. ""If we deliver the right treatment to the right people at the right time, then we can improve public health, increase public safety and save taxpayer dollars."" Separate worlds . Advocates working to get former inmates the health care they need in the community have a favorite catchphrase: continuity of care. The goal is to have an appointment set up with a provider before the inmate is even released, said Tom Sullivan, Maryland's director of inmate health services. The former warden remembers how his calls to community doctors used to go: ""Can you see this patient? He's been incarcerated for 10 years. He's mentally ill. He's violent. And he has no insurance, so he isn't going to be able to pay for anything."" ""It didn't work out too well,"" Sullivan said with a hint of sarcasm. ""At least today, I've taken one thing off the table. ... You'll be able to be reimbursed."" There aren't a lot of data on whether access to health care will lower rates of recidivism or the rates at which offenders return to jail. But experts know that treatment of mental illness and substance abuse can help prevent criminal relapse (PDF). A study done in the early 1990s called the California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment (PDF) found that substance abuse treatment, in and out of prison, reduced the level of criminal activity among participants by about two-thirds. Since then, many studies have showed that addiction programs, whether participation is coerced or voluntary, reduce recidivism rates. Washington state's Dangerously Mentally Ill Offender program identifies prisoners who pose a threat to public safety and provides them with mental health treatment for up to five years after their release. The state program has reduced felony recidivism by 42% among these former inmates, according to a 2009 report (PDF), and has saved taxpayers $1.64 for every dollar spent on treatment. ""The guy who robs banks for a living and sells drugs for a living, that's what he does,"" Sullivan said. ""And when he gets back out, he's going to do it again. But when (the mentally ill) get out, they don't rush back in."" Judges would avoid sending these low-risk offenders to jail at all if more treatment options were available, said Pam Rodriguez, president and CEO of Illinois' Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities. But state funding for community behavioral programs has long been lacking. Rodriguez believes it's only a matter of time until other states recognize the benefits of expanding their Medicaid programs. Experts have also expressed concern that the physician shortage in the United States will only get worse in coming years due to the influx of newly insured patients. And although the ""Health Homes"" provision of Obamacare provides funding for facilities willing to coordinate primary, emergency and behavioral health care for individuals on Medicaid with chronic conditions, this kind of seamless communication between treatment providers simply does not currently exist in most cities. ""We are building the plane as we fly it,"" Rodriguez said simply. ""And if anybody tells you differently, they are misdirecting you."" Reaching out . The bottom line is that the Affordable Care Act holds a lot of potential, said Dr. Emily Wang, co-founder of the Transitions Clinic Network, which encompasses 11 community health centers caring for recently released prisoners. But she cautions that it may not be the cure-all some are promising for America's inmates. ""Just because everyone is insured doesn't mean you have access to primary care. ... Just because you have insurance doesn't mean you want to go to a clinic or doctor,"" Wang said. ""It doesn't mean you won't feel discriminated in a health care setting. It doesn't mean you'll feel safe."" Former inmates are looking for four specific things when it comes to health care outside prison walls, she said: access to providers within two weeks of release; doctors who know they have been incarcerated so they don't feel they have to hide their past; community health workers who can help them navigate the system; and a health care facility that has strong partnerships with other organizations in the community that can help them find housing, employment and legal services. All are essential to encouraging this population to seek consistent care and stay out of jail, Wang said. Mercedes Smith is working to address some of these issues as a policy specialist at Women on the Rise, an advocacy group in New York run by formerly incarcerated women. ""I realized upon being released from prison that we usually cling to people who have been in the same situation as us,"" she said. ""I was lucky to have a great support system ... so I made myself out to be that support system for sisters and brothers coming home."" Smith plans to apply for Medicaid again under New York's expansion. Until it goes into effect, Smith said, she will continue to use ""home remedies"" to treat her skin condition and will avoid going to the doctor unless it's absolutely necessary. ""My biggest fear is that when I do get insurance, I'm going to have something wrong with me,"" she said. ""It's going to be too late.""","Experts estimate 30% to 50% of released inmates will be newly eligible for Medicaid .
Even states that will not expand Medicaid will provide coverage for mental health treatment .

"(CNN) -- In what's become an annual rite, thousands of diehard fans of Apple's iconic smartphone endured long overnight lines outside Apple retail stores around the world to be among the first Friday to buy the new iPhone 5. Kelson Horton, 39, had been in line at Lenox Square mall in Atlanta since 5 p.m. Thursday. The truck driver from Jonesboro, Georgia, said he's done so for every iteration of the smartphone that Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced to the world in 2007. ""I've been doing it since Day One,"" Horton said. ""It's the experience more than anything. It just happens to be the hottest phone on the market."" Near the front of a line of about 200 people Friday morning, Horton said he got about an hour's worth of sleep while meeting new friends from what he called ""the iPhone family."" At 8 a.m. local time across the U.S., thousands who spent hours waiting in line were greeted with cheers as Apple stores and other retailers began selling the new phone. More than 800 people were already in line outside the flagship glass-cube Apple store on Fifth Avenue in New York City by the time the store opened Friday morning. Dozens of people there had been in line since Monday. Initial demand for the phone, at least in the U.S., appears to be stronger than for previous models. One analyst estimated that based on counts at Apple Stores in New York, Boston and Minneapolis, the lines Friday were, on average, 83% longer than those for the iPhone 4S last October. Those iPhone shoppers (or ""fanboys"" and ""fangirls"" as they're called by less-supportive tech enthusiasts) in the U.S. weren't the first, though. Throngs of shoppers lined up outside Apple stores in Sydney, Australia; Tokyo; London; Paris; and Munich, Germany, among other cities where the phone went on sale. Hundreds of cold and tired but excited customers were lined up outside the Apple store on London's Regent Street Friday morning. Many had been waiting outside the store all night without food or anything to sit on, but the general consensus seemed to be that the hassle had been worth it. ""I've been waiting since midnight, so 12 hours now,"" said Fahir Wardak, a 21-year-old student. ""I haven't really eaten but it wasn't that cold and I've got some tea now so it's alright."" And why was his 12-hour wait necessary? ""I've already got the iPhone 4S and a MacBook Pro so it's like having a collection really,"" he added. ""You just want to keep going along with it."" ""I'm actually from Canada and just missed my flight home to be here,"" said another London customer, Mohammed Farooqi, a 19-year-old student. ""I'm not sure how much it's going to cost me to get a new flight but seeing as the previous iPhone was so great I definitely think it's going to be worth it."" Others were less excited about the overnight wait for the sixth version of Apple's iconic smartphone. ""I've been here for around 11 hours but the queue kept moving so I couldn't go to sleep,"" said student Luna Zhang, 20. ""I had to take time off work to come here and really wish now that I'd just ordered it online."" Despite morning rainfall in Tokyo, hundreds of eager customers lined up outside an Apple store in the city's Ginza shopping district. Store employees handed out umbrellas to waiting customers, some of whom came sporting face paint to celebrate the occasion. ""It's almost like a festival, people just camping in the center of Ginza, just drinking and playing and talking to each other,"" said Taiyo Nakashima, a 34-year-old Web designer. ""It's not really just buying the phone; it's just enjoying the party, really."" In Sydney, customers camped out in tents and folding chairs. Cheers erupted when the store's doors opened. Todd Foot told CNN affiliate Network Ten that he waited for more than 70 hours to get Australia's first iPhone and review it online. Announced September 12, the iPhone 5 features a bigger screen, lighter and slimmer frame, faster processor and, for the first time, 4G LTE wireless connections. If a handful of tech writers were unimpressed with the specs, that didn't translate into lack of consumer interest. Apple took 2 million pre-orders for the phone in the first 24 hours they were available last week, and some analysts said they think it could sell more than 10 million by Monday. That first-day total was double the number of iPhone 4S pre-orders the company took last year, and an initial Friday shipping date was quickly pushed back. People who pre-order the phone now, or did so in the past few days, could be waiting more than three weeks for their phones to ship. The phone will roll out to 22 more countries on September 28. Gallery: The world's hottest smartphones . The most popular single smartphone since the existence of such a device, the iPhone has sold more than 244 million units around the world since its unveiling five years ago. According to research firm IDC, the iPhone and its iOS operating system make up 16.9% of the worldwide smartphone market, coming in behind the cluster of phones running the Android operating system, which account for 68.1% of the world's smartphones. The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner and 20% lighter than the current version, the iPhone 4S. It has a 4-inch screen, measured diagonally, compared with a 3.5-inch screen on previous versions of the phone. It is the same width as the iPhone 4S but taller, and the iPhone 5 is made entirely of glass and aluminum. The new phone has had a few problems, as tech innovations sometimes tend to do. Users: Apple iOS 6 maps are a mess . Most notably, an update to Apple's mobile operating system has replaced Google Maps with an Apple-designed map service that many users say is less accurate or even omits locations altogether. Not surprisingly, those waiting in line Friday weren't deterred. ""I think a lot of people are wanting the world from a product they've just released,"" said Justin Henderson, 32, a composer from Atlanta who had been in line since 3 a.m. ""You've got to be patient with Apple, and they'll get it right. CNN's John Sutter in Atlanta, Yoko Wakatsuki and Alex Zolbert in Tokyo, Diego Lage in Hong Kong and Laura Mackenzie in London contributed to this report.","""It's almost like a festival,"" one customer in Tokyo says .

"(CNN) -- A Kalispell, Montana, newlywed accused of pushing her husband from a cliff wants her trial postponed after prosecutors told her attorney they have evidence her husband was blindfolded before falling to his death, court documents say. Saying the prosecution has provided no evidence regarding the use of a blindfold -- which could be used to make the government's case for premeditation and thus first-degree murder -- Jordan Linn Graham's attorney, Michael Donahoe, asserts that he is unprepared to defend his client if the trial is held in December as planned. Donahoe further said he learned of the ""blindfold theory"" and the DNA testing of ""a piece of cloth found on a shoal in the river"" only during an October 25 conference call, more than three weeks after it was sent to an FBI lab and 10 weeks after it was collected from the alleged crime scene. That timing is important, the attorney says, because if the ""alleged blindfold"" was not sent to a lab until at least October 2, the day before the indictment was filed, it ""would suggest the blindfold theory was not put to the grand jury at all."" ""If, as is stated in the complaint affidavit, Jordan and Cody (Johnson) were arguing intensely on the ledge, it hardly seems plausible that the argument would cease abruptly so Jordan could apply a blindfold,"" says Donahoe's brief supporting a motion to dismiss the case. ""Frankly at this point the defense has no idea of how the government intends to try this case before the petite jury and likewise has grave doubt about what was put before the grand jury."" Donahoe further slams the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office for its handling of Graham's interrogation and subsequent report based on that interrogation. The case is being handled federally because the alleged crime happened in a national park. The report, which alleges an FBI interrogator inappropriately touched Graham's knee during the interview, states that almost an hour and a half of Graham's interrogation was not recorded, despite the necessary equipment being on hand. Failing to preserve such evidence, which includes Graham's first admission that she had previously lied, is a violation of Graham's rights, the defense brief says. Other parts of the interview were misconstrued or provided without necessary context, according to the papers filed by Donahoe, which labels the government's version of Graham's statement ""incomplete, coerced and subject to suppression."" ""The whole recorded part of the interrogation was an epic effort by (the interrogator) to isolate key words that would at a minimum support a voluntary manslaughter theory; with enough room for the argument that Jordan could have walked away, which might even support a theory of depraved heart for first- or second-degree murder,"" the court brief states. It continues, ""At best this synopsis is a decontextualized, exaggerated interpretation that was intended to distort and contradict what Jordan actually reported."" Graham has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder and making false statements. On July 7, just more than a week after they got married, Graham and her husband were arguing at Montana's Glacier National Park, according to court affidavits. Graham said in a court filing that during the argument, Johnson grabbed her by the arm and she removed it, pushing Johnson simultaneously and accidentally sending him off the cliff, according to court documents. The complaint against her says, ""Graham stated she could have just walked away, but due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff."" Donahoe's brief takes issue with how the incident was cast in the complaint and accuses the interrogator of twisting her words to fit certain charges. In September, Donahoe said Johnson pinned his wife down during their argument and that when Johnson grabbed Graham's arm, she jerked it away and shoved him ""all in one motion, the grabbing and pushing."" Graham did not report the incident. She initially told police Johnson had left in a dark vehicle the night of July 7 with unknown friends. On July 11, according to an affidavit, Graham led a party to a popular spot in the park called ""The Loop,"" where Johnson's body was located and she called authorities. ""Ranger S.P. commented to Graham he thought it was unusual that she had found the body. Graham replied, 'It was a place he wanted to see before he died,' and 'He would come up here with friends to drive fast when his friends were visiting from out of state,' "" the affidavit states. Five days later, Graham came clean during the FBI interrogation, telling the interrogator that she lied but that Johnson's death was an accident, according to the defense brief. ""I was afraid that they weren't going to give me a chance to explain things and they were just gonna kind of put me in handcuffs and take me away right there and say that I had committed a crime or that I had planned this to kill somebody,"" she said, according to the brief. The affidavit states that Graham texted a friend the night her husband died, saying she was going to talk to Johnson about having ""second thoughts."" Graham texted, ""Oh well, I am about to talk to him."" Her friend responded, ""I'll pray for you guys."" Graham then replied, ""Dead serious, if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened,"" according to a court document filed in the case.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Myanmar has alarmed Washington and the United Nations after it admitted carrying out airstrikes against rebel fighters in the northern state of Kachin. The conflict between the Myanmar military, which repressively ruled the southeast Asian nation for decades, and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has escalated in the past two years, displacing large numbers of civilians, according to human rights groups. Watch: Economic potential in Myanmar . Recent steps toward greater democracy and civil liberties in Myanmar under the government of President Thein Sein, a former military official, have prompted the United States and other countries to lift most of the sanctions that had been squeezing the country's economy. Terrorized, starving and homeless: Myanmar's Rohingya still forgotten . In November, President Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- in a symbolic endorsement of the fledgling reforms. But the U.S. government expressed concern Wednesday after authorities in Myanmar said they had used air attacks in clashes with KIA fighters this week. Read more: Obama lauds Aung San Suu Kyi, gives a nod to Myanmar . ""We're obviously deeply troubled by the increased violence,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a news conference. ""We are continuing to urge the government of Burma and the Kachin Independence Organization to cease this conflict, to get to a real dialogue to address grievances as the government of Burma has been able to do in virtually all of the other conflict areas."" The Kachin Independence Organization is the political wing of the KIA. The Myanmar military has been using ""air cover"" in Kachin since December 27 in order to transport supplies to a base near Laiza, the capital of the state and headquarters of the KIA, said Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the president's office. The military carried out ""air attacks"" on Sunday and Monday, he said, adding that the president had instructed the troops not to invade Laiza. Attempts to reach a KIA spokesman for comment were unsuccessful Thursday. Read more: From Burma to Myanmar: Land of rising expectations . Ryan Roco, an American freelance photojournalist currently in Kachin, told CNN from Laiza that he had witnessed repeated heavy shelling and airstrikes by the Myanmar military. He has seen air attacks daily since December 28 around Laiza, he said. ""They have targeted multiple positions but as of now, all have been primarily KIA military positions, some of which can be seen in plain sight from Laiza, bringing many residents to the streets and rooftops to watch in horror,"" Roco recounted via e-mail. ""The shelling however is far less precise and far more widespread as hundreds of mortar rounds from 105mm and 120mm mortars are being fired from significant distance."" Shelling in Lajayang, near Laiza, on 27 December left one man dead and three people seriously injured, said Roco. He met the victims, who he said were civilians hit as they worked on a watermelon farm, in the hospital where they had been taken for treatment. The heavy artillery shelling ""poses extreme risk for civilians in the area already made vulnerable by war,"" he said. The photojournalist questioned the Myanmar government's account of its actions, saying what he had witnessed appeared to be ""a clear offensive effort to take strategic KIA defensive positions surrounding Laiza."" Roco traveled with the Free Burma Rangers, a non-governmental organization, which released images earlier this week that showed attacks by the Myanmar military in Kachin, but said he was not affiliated with the humanitarian group. Read more: Myanmar facing unfolding crisis . In the past year, the Myanmar government has made progress in peace talks with other minority groups, securing a cease-fire with Karen rebels. However, clashes this year between Buddhists and Muslims in the western state of Rakhine have set off a humanitarian crisis there and underscored the difficult task of managing the country's complex ethnic mix amid new political freedoms.

"(CNN) -- Governor of New Jersey? Who'd want THAT job? It's a state where politics have long been considered a bloodsport, where corrupt politicians are as common as slices of pizza, where fights can quickly get personal, and where the top politician lives a life constantly on the edge. It's a state whose politics have been awash in scandals for decades, particularly within its towns and communities. In the past 20 years, the state's biggest cultural exports have been a show about organized crime and ""Jersey Shore"" -- a show, as most New Jersey residents will be quick to tell you starred mostly New Yorkers. But, in spite of this, New Jerseyans take great pride in their state and have taken great pride in their governor. Before taking the state's highest office, Chris Christie toppled corrupt New Jersey mayors like they were dominoes, sending them to jail one after another. It was one of the most impressive demonstrations of good government in the state's history. Borger: Is Chris Christie presidential? As governor, he was lauded for his leadership and his outspokenness, and he was criticized by some in his own party for his praise of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy. But what never wavered was Christie's commitment to taking on the big issues. So for many New Jerseyans, it's disappointing to see Christie now focused on answering for the actions of staff. What they did was wrong, but if you stop and look more closely, those attacking him most harshly clearly have their own agendas. Take Democratic Sen. Loretta Weinberg. She'd love to make Christie's downfall her legacy. Prior to this current drama, Weinberg is best known for being a victim of the Bernie Madoff scam, and then for drawing on a pension system to supplement her legislative salary. She and Christie have been battling for years, and she's seeing an opportunity for payback. Meanwhile, Democratic Assemblyman Jon Wisniewski, another Christie foe, is dying for a better position in leadership, even though he's deputy speaker, a powerful chairman and the new head of an investigative committee. He's certainly got an eye on the front office himself. And Congressman Frank Pallone? He's only spent decades trying to run for statewide office. He'd love to take down Christie and ignore the fact that tourism ads are regular practice in New Jersey or any other state with an abundant coastline. The congressman certainly never complained about tourism ads during the 25 years he's represented a district that benefited from those very tourist dollars. Ad firm head: We were asked about using Christie in ad campaign . It's not just New Jersey Democrats who are playing politics with the outspoken governor and possible candidate for president in 2016. Democrats on the national level are sending fundraising letters and raising money on the backs of the popular governor. They'll do whatever it takes to clear the field for Hillary Clinton. But the most disappointing attacks are coming from the right wing of the Republican Party. After two crushing presidential elections and a paralyzed Congress, our party is badly in need of leadership. With a strong, outspoken candidate, Republicans could be right back on top. Demonstrated leadership is what will be needed in the big domestic fights that are right over the horizon, as well as those brewing overseas. Just don't let the candidate be from New Jersey. They say that if everyone hates you, you must be doing something right. Can Christie change the subject? Last week Christie held an exhausting two-hour press conference to answer questions about Fort Lee. It could not have been easy to distance himself from his two-time campaign manager -- the man who would have run Christie's presidential campaign should he choose to run. Try to remember the last time you saw a politician separate himself from someone that powerful in the organization. I'm hard pressed to find one. This week in his speech, Christie again addressed the issue. But what he did next took great leadership. He proposed longer school days. He proposed changes to the state tax code. He took on the pension system. Christie still isn't afraid to do big things. The guy is gearing up for the next big fight. The fight for New Jersey. For now, anyway. The long shadow of politics, both Democrat and Republican will keep hovering -- as will the national media -- waiting for his next move, eyeing his fundraising trips, watching for early signs of 2016 interest. None of which is going to deter the governor from doing what is necessary. There's something to be said for a politician who makes tough decisions. What also should be said is, governor, thanks for taking the job. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Camooso Miller.","Lisa Camooso Miller says Democrats are playing politics with New Jersey bridge scandal .

"(CNN) -- In designing modern and sustainable buildings in the United Arab Emirates, architects are taking cues from an ancient Arabic design tradition. A high-tech shading system running up the facade of the Al Bahar Towers in Abu Dhabi was inspired by ""mashrabiya,"" latticed screens commonly seen in Islamic architecture that diffuse sunlight and keep buildings cool without blocking light. ""Not allowing the sun to land directly on the skin of the building, causing overheating and glare, was a very simple concept,"" said Abdulmajid Karanouh, the buildings' architect. ""And that's why using the mashrabiya, inspired from the past and inspired by nature, was a no brainer."" Wrapping around most of the 25-story buildings' sides, the screens are arranged as an array of repeating geometric patterns and are computer-controlled to respond to the sun's movement, unfolding like an umbrella when the sun hits them. The screens fold closed and the automated mechanism shuts off each day after the sun goes down. The north sides of the buildings never receive direct sunlight and are left unshaded by the screens. In Abu Dhabi, solar rays can heat the outside surface of windows up to 90 degrees Celsius, (200 degrees Fahrenheit). By shielding the glass from the sun, the screens keep the buildings cool, reduce glare and let in diffused natural light. Using this method, the buildings require less artificial lighting and 50% less air conditioning. With the desert sun beating down on the cities in the Gulf, solar energy is an important environmental factor in its cities. But desert dust and sand make photovoltaic panels less practical than one would expect in this part of the world. Karanouh says even a thin layer of dust can reduce the efficiency of solar panels by nearly half, and proper maintenance means regular cleaning using water jets pumping fresh water, a scarcity in an arid country like the United Arab Emirates. ""You might find that you are spending so much energy to desalinate the water and get it to where it needs to be and then clean the panels, you'll find out that that energy may equate or even exceed the energy that you get out of the photovoltaic panels,"" he said. In Qatar, the Doha Tower, a striking cylindrical building, was designed along the same lines; it is covered entirely in a latticed screen that uses a multi-layered pattern constructed of aluminum and glass. Both structures were named as best buildings of 2012 by the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitats, which recognizes sustainable architecture. The United Arab Emirates is not normally thought of as a leader in combating climate change -- it has one of the highest levels of carbon dioxide emissions per capita in the world, according to the World Bank -- but Abu Dhabi has in recent years drawn attention for its innovative renewable energy building projects. Most notable is Masdar City, its much-hyped, planned city that is still being constructed, It was originally slated as being a carbon neutral area but now aims for environmental sustainability. The area has green features like a 10 megawatt solar power plant and a 45-meter-tall wind tower that helps regulate air temperatures in the public square by controlling air movement.","In the United Arab Emirates, architects are taking cues from an ancient Arabic design tradition.

"(CNN) -- North Korea has entered a ""state of war"" with neighboring South Korea, according to a report Saturday from the state-run Korean Central News Agency that included a threat to ""dissolve"" the U.S. mainland. ""Any issues regarding North and South will be treated in accordance to the state of war,"" North Korea's government said in a special statement carried by KCNA. ""... The condition, which was neither war nor peace, has ended."" North Korea and South Korea technically remain at war since their conflict between 1950 and 1953 ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty. On March 11, the North Korean army declared the armistice agreement invalid. This report represented Pyongyang's latest salvo aimed at South Korea and its ally the United States. Tensions in the area have been ratcheting up for months, with North Korea remaining defiant and, in some opinions, belligerent in the face of international efforts to halt its nuclear program. Saturday's report included a direct threat to the United States, while also asserting Pyongyang ""will not limit (itself) to limited warfare but to all-out war and nuclear war."" ""We will first target and dissolve mainland United States, Hawaii and Guam, and United States military based in South Korea. And the (South Korean presidential office) will be burned to the ground,"" the KCNA report said. In a statement later Saturday, South Korea did not treat their neighbor's latest threat as anything new. Seoul noted scores of its personnel had entered the Kaesong Industrial complex -- a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border -- on Saturday morning with hundreds more set to join them later in the day, seemingly suggesting they were going about business as usual. ""The announcement made by North Korea is not a new threat, but part of follow-up measures after North Korea's supreme command's statement that it will enter the highest military alert"" on Tuesday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement. Map appears to show U.S. targets . A day earlier, same official North Korean news agency reported its leader Kim Jong Un had approved a plan to prepare standby rockets to hit U.S. targets. In a meeting with military leaders early Friday, Kim ""said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists in view of the prevailing situation,"" KCNA reported. The rockets are aimed at U.S. targets, including military bases in the Pacific and in South Korea, it said. ""If they make a reckless provocation with huge strategic forces, (we) should mercilessly strike the U.S. mainland, their stronghold, their military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in South Korea,"" the report said. Analysis: Just what is Kim Jong Un up to? North Korean state media carried a photo of Kim meeting with military officials Friday. In the photo, the young leader is seated, leafing through documents with four uniformed officers standing around him. On the wall behind them, a map titled ""Plan for the strategic forces to target mainland U.S."" appears to show straight lines stretching across the Pacific to points on the continental United States. South Korea and the United States are ""monitoring any movements of North Korea's short, middle and middle- to long-range missiles,"" South Korean Defense Ministry Spokesman Kim Min-seok said Friday. U.S. official: We're 'committed ... to peace,' unlike N. Korea . U.S. officials have said they're concerned about the torrent of threats coming out of Pyongyang in recent weeks. ""I think their very provocative actions and belligerent tone, it has ratcheted up the danger, and we have to understand that reality,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday. Some observers have suggested that Washington is adding to tensions in the region by drawing attention to its displays of military strength on North Korea's doorstep, such as the flights by the B-2 stealth bombers. Hagel argued against that assertion. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . ""We, the United States and South Korea, have not been involved in provocating anything,"" he said. ""We, over the years, have been engaged with South Korea on joint exercises. The B-2 flight was part of that."" Washington and its allies ""are committed to a pathway to peace,"" Hagel said. ""And the North Koreans seem to be headed in a different direction here."" Opinion: Why North Korea regime is scary . Amid the uneasy situation, China, a key North Korean ally that expressed frustration about Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, also called for calm. ""We hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said Friday, describing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as ""a joint responsibility."" Behind North Korea's heated words about missile strikes, one analyst said, there might not be much mettle. North Korea's threat: Five things to know . ""The fact is that despite the bombast, and unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among North Korea's strategic forces, there is little to no chance that it could successfully land a missile on Guam, Hawaii or anywhere else outside the Korean Peninsula that U.S. forces may be stationed,"" James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly, wrote in an opinion column published Thursday on CNN.com. Tensions have been rising for months . Tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive government. U.S. officials concerned about North Korea's 'ratcheting up of rhetoric' Pyongyang has expressed fury about the sanctions and the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, due to continue until the end of April. The deteriorating relations have killed hopes of reviving multilateral talks over North Korea's nuclear program for the foreseeable future. Indeed, Pyongyang has declared that the subject is no longer up for discussion. The recent saber-rattling from Pyongyang has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea. Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile, but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. Having already declared the armistice invalid, North Korea more recently said it was cutting a key military hotline with South Korea. North Korea has gone through cycles of ""provocative behavior"" for decades, Pentagon spokesman George Little said Thursday. ""And we have to deal with them. We have to be sober, calm, cool, collected about these periods. That's what we're doing right now,"" he said. ""And we are assuring our South Korean allies day to day that we stand with them in the face of these provocations."" Korean nightmare: Experts ponder potential conflict .

"(EW.com) -- Even rote fantasy blockbusters can — and usually do — feature the showdown of good and evil. To conjure true darkness, however, is a trickier feat. Early on in ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,"" Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), having proved his mettle as a budding thief and honorary comrade to Thorin's band of dwarves, finds himself at the top of a tree in the forest of Mirkwood, where he spies an idyllic vista of autumn leaves. Then he drops into a huge, sticky web, and a pack of giant spiders attempt to eat him alive. These monster arachnids have a fearful presence, like something out of a nightmare devised by Ray Harryhausen. A year ago, Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" got the job done, but it was too bright and busy and noisy, with creatures that kept popping up as if out of a jack-in-the-box. ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is a more grandly somber movie, and also a much better one, with forces of boldly intense and unified malevolence. J.R.R. Tolkien published The Hobbit in 1937, on the eve of World War II, and his book is suffused with a sense of evil looming up in the world. This time Jackson nails that tone: the feeling that Bilbo, who's been recruited to steal back a wondrous gem called the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug, is up against a cosmic storm of black forces. The dragon has ravaged the land, the angry, hulking orcs are on a power trip, and the elves — led by the imperious Thranduil (Lee Pace) — are isolationists who trap the dwarves in a dungeon, setting up a great escape via wine barrels on white rapids. The dwarves, thirsting to return to their homeland (they could almost be pre-WWII Zionists), are portrayed with a crusty urgency that takes them up dizzying stone peaks and pits them against one another. Does ""The Desolation of Smaug"" meander? Of course it does — it's a hobbit movie! Yet Jackson's direction is spiky and majestic, and the risky move of inventing his own Tolkien character — the elf guard Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) — as a love interest for Legolas (Orlando Bloom) pays off. These two bring some badly needed heat to the woodlands. Speaking of heat, the dragon is, quite simply, a marvel: gargantuan yet balletic, hoarding his mountain of gold with a razor-toothed smile, breathing not just flame but an inferno, and voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch with the most delicious, insidious knowledge. Bilbo, as played by Freeman, suggests a sly-dog Dana Carvey without irony, and he is certainly overmatched, but that doesn't mean he's outplayed. Desolation is now his business. Grade: A- .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. drone strike on a vehicle just outside the capital of Sanaa killed six suspected al-Qaeda militants Wednesday night, three Yemeni Defense Ministry officials told CNN. The strike took place in Al-Masna'a village of Khawlan district, 35 kilometers southeast of the capital. Three of the killed were senior members of al Qaeda, two of whom were Saudi nationals, the officials said. Security teams were deployed to the scene, one of the officials said. ""Yemen needs stability and these militants must be killed if Yemen has a chance to stabilize, "" said a Defense Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. He said that more strikes will continue and that al Qaeda is living its weakest days in Yemen. ""The militants know that no place in Yemen is safe for them anymore, even in areas close to the capital Sana'a,"" he added. The United States views Yemen as being on the front line of the war on al Qaeda. Yemen is adjacent to Saudi Arabia, and chaos in Yemen could disrupt oil supplies and upset world energy markets. Eyewitnesses told CNN that three missiles were used in the attack after the first missed its target. Flames from the attack burned for more than an hour. Khawlan is one of the most lawless areas in the country and al Qaeda uses it as a traveling route to numerous parts of the country, local tribal leaders said. ""There is no government presence in many parts of Khawlan. No security forces, checkpoints, military presence or police stations,"" said Ahmed Obad al-Shuraif, a top tribal chief in Khawlan. The attack was the 8th reported by a U.S. drone over in the last four days in Yemen, the Defense Ministry officials said. When Yemen's 2011 uprising led to the al Qaeda invasion of Abyan -- the southern province of Yemen -- Washington was quick to call on newly elected President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi to set his house in order and address militarily the threat posed by al-Qaeda in the country. But drone strikes missed targets on a couple of occasions, resulting in civilian casualties and strong criticism from the Yemeni government. The latest string of criticism came from Human Rights Minister Hooria Mashour, who said that due to civilian deaths she was in favor of changing the anti-terrorism strategy. ""All we are calling for is justice and reliance on international regulations with regard to human rights and to be true to our commitment to our citizens in that they all deserve a fair trial,"" Mashour said.","Drone strike hits vehicle .

"(CNN) -- The sign language interpreter ridiculed for his incoherent translation of the Mandela memorial service has faced a multitude of criminal charges in the past, including murder, attempted murder and kidnapping, South African news network eNCA reported on Friday. The network said it received documents from a senior police source that show Thamsanqa Jantjie was found guilty of theft in 1995. The network said it was unclear if he spent time in jail. The document also revealed that Jantjie was charged with rape, housebreaking, malicious damage to property and murder between 1994 and 2006, but the record shows that Jantjie was found not guilty of the rape and murder charges. The charges of housebreaking, damage to property and a 1996 theft were withdrawn. Reached by eNCA Friday, Jantjie did not deny he faced the charges, but asked how the reporters came into possession of private details and said he wasn't prepared to comment. The network said he then ended the conversation. Jantjie stood a few feet away from world dignitaries, including President Barack Obama, on Tuesday as he produced a series of hand signals that experts said meant nothing. Jantjie told CNN's David McKenzie on Thursday that he suffers from schizophrenia and is under treatment. CNN's efforts to reach Jantjie were unsuccessful Friday. South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority told CNN on Friday it does not have any information on whether Jantjie was facing any of the charges outlined by eNCA. At a news conference on Thursday, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, South African deputy minister of women, children and people with disabilities, said the government was looking into the vetting of Jantjie's security clearance at the memorial. CNN attempted to retrieve court documents from the court in Johannesburg on Friday, but was told that documents for that period are kept off site. Jantjie said on Thursday that he is a fully qualified interpreter and has been trusted with other big events. But Bruno Druchen, the national director of the Deaf Federation of South Africa, has dubbed him a ""fake interpreter."" ""The deaf community is in outrage,"" Druchen said. ""He is not known by the deaf community in South Africa nor by the South African Sign Language interpreters working in the field."" Jantjie showed no facial expressions, which are key in South African sign language, and his hand signals were meaningless, Druchen said.

"(CNN) -- Just 101 miles separate Samoa and American Samoa. But one will be the first country in the world to welcome the New Year; the other will have to wait a full day. Samoans can thank the very crooked international date line for their license to party early. The line is an imaginary one dreamed up to help with global time-keeping. It splits the globe into two -- so when it's Tuesday morning on the west side of the line, it's still Monday morning on the east side of it. Until last year, Samoa and American Samoa celebrated the new year on the same day. But then Samoa hopped west of the line so it could trade more easily with countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Because the date line is not fixed by any international law or agreement, it can zig and zag to accommodate such government and business interests. American Samoa, however, stayed on the other side of the border -- leaving it 25 hours behind Samoa. Samoa isn't the only place the international date line bends (quite literally) its rules for. Take the tiny Pacific Island nation of Kiribati. Before the mid-1990s, the international date line split Kiribati into two parts, leaving the western portion a whole day ahead of the eastern part and causing headaches when doing business. Now, the date line takes a massive detour of more than 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), around Kiribati's eastern-most islands, so that the whole nation is on the same calendar day. Near the top of the globe, the date line veers east to get all of Siberia on board with the rest of Russia. It then swings far west to lasso in the Aleutian Islands, so they can to be on the same day as the rest of Alaska. This means some Russians will see 2013 a full day before some Americans. Perhaps they can tell their neighbors on the other side of the squiggly line what the future holds. CNN's Ric Ward contributed to this report.","Samoa is 101 miles (164 kilometers) west of American Samoa .

"Kabul (CNN) -- At least 21 people -- including four U.N. personnel, an International Monetary Fund representative and a British contractor -- were killed Friday in a suicide bombing and shootout at a restaurant in Kabul, authorities said. The suicide attacker's bomb exploded at the restaurant's gate Friday evening. Two armed men then entered the restaurant and started shooting, Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammed Ayoub Salangi said. Afghan security forces killed the gunmen during a shootout, according to Salangi. The Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday's attack in an e-mail. It said it was payback for an airstrike in Parwan province that caused civilian casualties this week. Four of those killed worked for the United Nations, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. They were among a number of casualties from various ""international organizations,"" in addition to Afghans. Thirteen foreign nationals were among the dead, said Hashmat Stanikzai, Kabul police chief spokesman. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, posted a statement online saying her agency's representative in Afghanistan, Wabel Abdallah, is among the dead. The 60-year-old Lebanese national was named to that position in June 2008. ""This is tragic news, and we at the fund are all devastated,"" Lagarde said. Paul Ross, the IMF's mission chief for Afghanistan, remembered Abdallah as a ""wonderful, kind man"" who was always there for his family, his colleagues and the people of whatever nation he was trying to serve. ""He was modest, he was funny, he was warm,"" Ross said of Abdallah, who is survived by a wife and daughter. ""He was a delight."" Another victim was a British citizen, that country's foreign ministry said. Relatives of the victim -- who was a contractor, not a diplomat -- have been notified. The ministry said she is not being named. Afghanistan continues to be the site of sporadic violence, much of it blamed on militants tied to the Taliban, which ruled the country before the U.S.-led invasion after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The international community has been extensively engaged in Afghanistan for more than a decade both with military troops and nongovernmental organizations. Friday night's attack happened near where many of these NGOs have offices. Friday night's attack was a ""huge shock"" to those working there, said Ross, but it won't deter them from continuing their mission. ""I think that many of the people, like Wabel, are dedicated to trying to help countries develop and prosper,"" Ross said. ""That's really part of their life mission statement. And that's what makes them go to places that are difficult to visit."" CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Jessica King contributed to this report.","NEW: Taliban say it was payback for an airstrike in Parwan province .

"(CNN) -- Victor Chu is chairman and CEO of Chinese investment firm, First Eastern Investment Group. He is also the chairman of FE Securities and First Eastern Investment Bank, the first Chinese bank to be licensed by the Dubai International Financial Centre. Previously, he served as director and council member of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and member of the Hong Kong Government's Central Policy Unit. Victor Chu: China has a lot to contribute in terms of the reinvention of the Gulf . He is also a Foundation Board member of the World Economic Forum and he co-chairs the WEF's International Business Council. Victor Chu met CNN's John Defterios in Beijing to talk about the deepening economic relationship between China and the Middle East and the motivations behind it.  Watch the video. » . Defterios began by asking Chu why China is so interested in the Middle East. Victor Chu: There are strategic and commercial reasons. Strategically, China needs to be friendly to make sure that it is a long-time sustainable partner in terms of energy resources. But China also has a lot to contribute in terms of the reinvention of the Gulf. The Gulf, as you know, is probably the richest area in the world. But in terms of infrastructure development, many parts of the Gulf are still in the second world. If the Gulf wants to get up to speed in the quickest time possible it will need Chinese engineers, construction companies and equipment companies. And with China's 30 years' experience in developing its own infrastructure and the standard of Chinese engineering, there's a lot going for Chinese companies. John Defterios: So what are the hot areas of investment for Chinese money going into the Middle East? VC: Right now it is in terms of infrastructure. We already have Chinese companies winning contracts in Saudi Arabia on railway constructions, on plant constructions, and down the road it will be services. Because the Gulf is expanding so quickly they need service too. And in the past there were a lot of people from the Indian sub-continent helping them but now there are a lot more Chinese. JD: So China is exporting labor as well? VC: Professional as well as labor. When I first went to the U.A.E. 15 years ago there were only a few thousand Chinese residents. Today the number is 200,000. JD: What's your projected growth for investment going into the Middle East? VC: The figure I hear today is that there could be as much as 20 billion of direct investment from the Middle East going to China on an annual basis. So if half is recycled the other way we're talking about a very big number indeed. JD: Is this a one-way street, Chinese money going into the Middle East or is it coming back as well? VC: There's enormous interest from the Gulf to look into China and that's partly because of the trend of the fund flow from the West to the East. In the past the petrol dollar tended to go to Europe and America for safe havens. Today there's still a lot of that. A huge part of it is going back to the Gulf for infrastructure development and also for investment into the East. And historically the Far East stopped in Singapore. It's only really in the last ten years that the Middle Eastern capital has found China. E-mail to a friend .","Victor Chu is CEO of Chinese investment firm, First Eastern Investment Group .

"(CNN) -- The arrest and strip-search of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, accused of visa fraud, has sparked questions about the complex, murky system of diplomatic immunity. ""There's a lot of subjectivity on this stuff,"" says CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. Khobragade's lawyer, Daniel Arshack, says his client is entitled to diplomatic immunity and can't be prosecuted under U.S. law, CNN's Indian sister network IBN reported. But the State Department says Khobragade's consular immunity does not cover this kind of crime. Now, Khobragade has been moved to India's Permanent Mission to the United Nations -- where, Indian officials say, she may get full diplomatic immunity. The rules involved are laid out by the State Department in a guidance document for law enforcement and judicial authorities. ""Most of these privileges and immunities are not absolute, and law enforcement officers retain their fundamental responsibility to protect and police the orderly conduct of persons in the United States,"" the document states. Members of consular posts, such as Khobragade at the time of her arrest, do not have the same level of immunity as those who work at diplomatic missions. Consular officers have some immunity involving official acts, but their ""personal inviolability"" is ""quite limited,"" the document says. They may be arrested and detained for alleged felonies, and may be prosecuted for misdemeanors. Their families have no immunity of any kind. Determining what distinguishes an official act from a personal one is often not cut-and-dry. ""No law enforcement officer, State Department officer, diplomatic mission, or consulate is authorized to determine whether a given set of circumstances constitutes an official act.,"" the document states. ""This is an issue which may only be resolved by the court with subject matter jurisdiction over the alleged crime."" A consular officer who is charged may argue that the allegations involve official acts. If the court agrees, the case must be dismissed. Khobragade is accused of submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for her female housekeeper, paying her less than the amount stated. It's unclear whether she'll argue that the alleged act would be in the performance of her official duties, rather than personal. Some personnel within diplomatic missions wouldn't have to face such questions. Diplomatic agents, who have the highest level of immunity, ""enjoy complete personal inviolability, which means that they may not be handcuffed (except in extraordinary circumstances), arrested, or detained,"" the State Department document says. ""Diplomatic agents also enjoy complete immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the host country's courts and thus cannot be prosecuted no matter how serious the offense unless their immunity is waived by the sending state."" In most cases, these kinds of issues are resolved through negotiations, Toobin says. ""The courts rarely get involved. Because the countries have a lot of connections to each other, there's a lot of interest in both sides in resolving it without recourse at the courts.""","U.S. authorities accuse Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade of visa fraud .

"(WIRED) -- Facebook has rolled out its new Timeline feature to the masses. This ultra-illustrative, chronological listing of posts, photos, shared links, check-ins, and more is a radically different arrangement than the Facebook profile you've been used to. And now that your life can be exposed for everyone to see -- and scrutinize -- you may be interested in curating the new interface. Once you've activated Facebook Timeline (go here to do so), you've got seven days to tweak it to make sure it's just how you like before it goes live for everyone to see. Below are five quick tips on how to personalize, privatize, and generally get the most out of Facebook's newest feature. It doesn't take long to master the new interface, and it's an important exercise for anyone interested in, well, reputation management. 1. Privacy 101: How to hide things . You probably already know that Facebook has controversial positions on privacy. So you may now find that some things included on your Timeline are best kept from curious eyes. This could be anything from an embarrassing status message you posted in simpler social media times, to a rant your ex left on your wall a few months ago. To hide a Timeline element, click the pencil icon at the top of the offending post, then choose ""Hide from Timeline."" Easy. And please note: Any privacy settings you've already set still apply to the Timeline interface. So the photos of you getting wild at last weekend's kegger are still safe from Mom. If you prefer to keep your profile public, but don't want everyone to see what you posted back in high school, for example, you can also tweak your Timeline settings more generally. Click the arrow next to your Home button at the top of the screen to access your Privacy Settings. Scroll down to ""Limit the Audience for Past Posts,"" then choose ""Manage Past Post Visibility."" Now click ""Limit Old Posts"" -- all . 2. Tell your life story: How to add past events . Privacy, schmivacy! Perhaps, you want the whole world to know the day you were born, the first time you rode a bike, and that debate club award you got in high school. These events aren't listed on your Timeline, but they can be. To add a status update, photo, place check-in, or life event to your Timeline, simply hover the mouse over the line in the center of the page until it turns into a plus sign, and reveals the option to add one of those four types of posts. Now, Facebook can accurately reflect your entire life -- and not just the events that occurred after you first signed on. 3. Add some individuality: How to customize your Timeline . There are a number of ways you can personalize your Timeline so it highlights the posts, pictures and events you cherish most. First, you can add a cover to your Timeline. Toward the top of your profile, above the buttons where it says ""Update Info,"" you should see ""Add a Cover."" Once you click that, you can select an image from your photos, or opt to upload a new image. Once it loads, you can adjust the positioning of your cover image. If you set a cover photo and then decide it's not as great as you first thought, just hover your mouse over the image, and a ""Change Cover"" option menu will pop up, letting you reposition the image or select a new one. For photo albums you've created, you can change the primary photo that displays (you could do this before, but now the process is different). Simply click the pencil icon in the upper corner of the album post, and select ""Change Primary Photo."" You can also choose to highlight a post -- expanding it from a small, half-page-size post to a wide-screen version â€” by selecting the star icon in the post's upper-right corner. Conversely, you can click the star on a maximized featured post to make it normal again. 4. Appearances matter: How to check out your Timeline from different angles . If you decide to make a number of posts and photos private or hidden from your Timeline, you can still get the full, complete view of your Facebook action history. On your Timeline, click ""Activity Log."" There you'll find posts and information you need to review before it publishes to your profile, as well as a complete look at your interactions on Facebook. This is log completely private to you. You can choose to filter what you see by clicking the ""All"" dropdown menu at the top. You can choose to see only your posts, posts by others, posts from specific Facebook apps (""Hmm, let's look at my past Farmville accomplishments""), photos and more. Like before, you can also check how others view your profile. Next to ""Activity Log"" is a cog icon. Click that, and you can choose ""View As..."" and either enter a friend's name or click the ""public"" link to see how your profile looks to strangers. 5. Information overload: How to organize friends and filter updates . Now that your Timeline is all straightened out, you might as well do some house cleaning on what shows up in your Newsfeed. When you add a friend or follow someone's public updates, Facebook automatically sets the level of posts you see to ""Most Updates."" You can change this by going to that profile, and clicking the ""Subscribed"" button. You can change it to ""Only Important"" updates or ""All updates,"" and you can also filter what types of posts you're interested in seeing: things like life events, status updates, or photos. And if you haven't done so already, you can organize friends into lists, a la the Google+ Circles feature. Facebook Lists rolled out in September. Just go to the left-hand side of your Newsfeed page, click ""More,"" and toward the bottom you'll see ""Lists."" You can add friends individually to lists like Close Friends, Family, or Co-workers. You can click ""More"" next to Lists to add other lists of your choosing â€” ""Acquaintances,"" ""Poker Club Members,"" you get the picture. The average Facebook user has 130 friends, but I'd venture to say that most of you reading this have far more than that, so this will help streamline your Facebooking experience. One last thing: If you're one of those people who's still into ""poking"" your friends, you can still do that. Go to your friend's profile, and the Poke option is listed under a gear cog dropdown menu next to ""Message."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Jane Kean, who played diverse roles during a long career but was best known as Trixie on the TV revival of ""The Honeymooners,"" has died. She was 90. Kean, who lived in Toluca Lake, California, died Tuesday at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, her niece, Deirdre Wolpert, said Friday. She was hospitalized after a fall that led to a hemorrhagic stroke. In 2002, Kean told CNN that her work with Jackie Gleason predated ""The Honeymooners"" revival. They did vaudeville together decades earlier. ""As a matter of fact, we both -- I hate to say how long ago it was -- but we were doing one-nighters, the Loews Pitkin, Loews Melba,"" she said. ""I was the singer on the bill and he was the comic. And we were getting $50 a show."" Her credits spanned decades and ranged from TV series such as ""Growing Pains"" and ""The Facts of Life"" to ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King,"" according to IMDb.com. But Kean, who was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on April 10, 1923, was best remembered for her role as Trixie Norton when Gleason and CBS revived ""The Honeymooners"" in 1966. The actress who played Trixie in the classic black-and-white sitcom was Joyce Randolph. ""I had run into an agent when I went to see 'The Odd Couple' with Art Carney,"" Kean told CNN in 2002. ""And I was with my husband. And we drove back to California, and when I got back there, the agent called. ... So he said, you're not going to believe this, but you're going to be Trixie Norton. And it's going to be a musical and you're going to be able to sing and dance and do the whole number."" Wolpert said a private memorial service will be held at Kean's home in the next couple of weeks. ""She was just an extraordinary person,"" Wolpert said. ""Completely independent, and traveling. Last year she did a two-hour one-woman show, a retrospective with film clips and everything. She was amazing."" Kean is survived by Wolpert and her husband and their two children. Kean is also survived by a stepson from her second marriage and his family. People we've lost in 2013 .","Jane Kean was best known as Trixie on the TV revival of ""The Honeymooners"" in 1966 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Go to the Obamacare website now because ""it has improved,"" with more people completing applications after a month of problems that botched the rollout of HealthCare.gov, the official in charge of creating the online program told a Senate committee on Tuesday. Marilyn Tavenner, head of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, assured the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee the website will be fixed by the end of November, as promised by the administration. She also said the first figures on how many people have enrolled so far under President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms would be available next week, meeting a mid-November deadline the administration has set. However, Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the GOP chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, announced Tuesday he issued a subpoena for the enrollment figures to be turned over by Friday -- November 8, about a week earlier than planned. Administration officials expect the initial enrollment figures to be low, and Republicans want them made public as soon as possible as part of their efforts to depict Obamacare as badly flawed. Tavenner noted the administration's target for the end of November was 800,000 people enrolled, but it was not immediately clear whether that was a prediction for what the actual figure would be or referred to the number projected before the troubled website launch on October 1. She came under tough questioning from Republican opponents of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, who insisted that the law itself is the problem, not the dysfunctional website for enrolling. Tavenner acknowledged she knew of troubles encountered by consumers that GOP senators cited, such as a man in South Carolina whose personal details turned up when someone else registered. In a terse exchange with Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Tavenner said her agency had reached out to the man who complained of the security breach. ""We will find him and we will follow up on his questions,"" she said, to which Scott offered to provide Tavenner with the man's phone numbers. When she said her agency had the numbers, Scott responded: ""He doesn't think so, actually, because no one's called him."" Tavenner replied: ""Well, we have a disagreement there."" Later, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said that as of October 29, only three people in her state had enrolled and she cited ongoing problems with the system that included providing consumers with incorrect information on available subsidies. ""Are you aware of this? Has it been resolved? Are we working on it?,"" Murkowski asked. ""Because the concern is that not only can people not get on to enroll, but if they do their subsidy calculations are incorrect. "" Tavenner said her staff is aware of the issue and is ""working on a fix to the system to correct the Alaska issue specific to Alaska."" In one change to the federal website implemented by tech experts brought in to get it working, Tavenner said consumers can now view and compare health insurance plans online without registering for an account. Obamacare: It's about government's role, future elections . When the website came online on October 1, it got overwhelmed by initial volume, and outside contractors working on the system blamed the requirement that people set up an account before they could view coverage options instead of being able to ""window shop"" without registering. ""In the first few days that we went live, few consumers could create an account,"" Tavenner said, repeating information she first provided at a House committee hearing last week. ""We have now resolved that issue. Users can successfully create an account and go through the enrollment process. We are able now to process nearly 17,000 registrants per hour, or five per second, with almost no errors."" Tuesday's hearing quickly generated the heated rhetoric of the continuing political battle over the Affordable Care Act passed with no Republican support three years ago and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Debunking 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrong . Republicans who have made dismantling or repealing the law known as Obamacare a top priority focused Tuesday on policy cancellations and higher prices facing some people, as well as the website woes that included difficulty logging on, error messages and lengthy delays. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the panel, said Obama broke his promise that people who like their previous plan could keep it. Instead, he noted, polices are being canceled for those who buy their own coverage instead of getting it through their jobs or Medicare and Medicaid. Carney: Obama 'can't go back' and change Obamacare vow . ""For these Americans the new promise is, 'if you want health care, go find it on a website the administration says won't be working properly until the end of November,' "" Alexander said, calling it ""an unwelcome Christmas present."" He called for a proposal to allow people to keep current coverage if they liked it, a concept rejected by the White House. Democratic Chairman Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa noted the benefits already in place from Obamacare, and he encouraged Republicans to work on fixing problems instead of trying to undermine the program.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The Chinese government could embrace Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo with pride and respect ""with a little twist of the mind,"" actor and activist Richard Gere told a small group of activists at a New York rally in honor of Liu, who has been imprisoned by Beijing. The rally took place in Ralph Bunche Park, named for another Nobel Peace Prize winner who was involved in the formation of the United Nations. Standing beneath a portrait of Liu behind symbolic Styrofoam bars, Gere read an excerpt from the jailed dissident's final statement, ""I Have No Enemies,"" issued two days before he was sentenced to an 11-year prison sentence on December 25, 2009. ""I hope to transcend my personal experiences as I look upon our nation's development and social change,"" Gere read. ""And to counter the regime's hostility with utmost goodwill, and to dispel hatred with love."" Gere was invited to remove the first prison bar from the hanging banner of Liu. He joined a group of nongovernmental organization representatives in removing the remaining bars from the banner, created by artists Zhang Hongtu and Tenzing Rigdol. Descending the park steps, Gere said that Liu, alone in jail, is ""more courageous than organizations like the U.N. or the president of the United States."" In the bitter cold outside U.N. headquarters, Gere called for a moment of silence to reflect on Liu's achievements and on his imprisonment. ""It's funny,"" Gere said. ""It just got a little warmer thinking about those things: Liu Xiaobo, freedom and compassion."" During the Nobel ceremony in Oslo, Norway, earlier in the day, Liu's prize was placed on an empty chair, symbolizing the winner's absence. Gere called the empty chair ""an extremely eloquent symbol."" Liu is the first winner in 75 years who was unable to accept the Nobel Peace Prize medal, diploma and accompanying $1.5 million check. The last time a winner did not travel to Oslo was in 1935, when Carl von Ossietzky, a German journalist and pacifist, was barred from accepting the award and attending the ceremony. Ossietzky was imprisoned in a concentration camp and suffering from tuberculosis. The German Propaganda Ministry decreed publicly that he could travel to Norway for the prize, but he was never issued a passport. The government barred the press from mentioning Ossietzky's prize and decreed that no German could accept any Nobel prize.","Protest to honor Liu Xiaobo draws small crowd .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee settled in over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, prompting warnings of heavy rain and flash flooding in areas from Washington up to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said. Several rounds of heavy rain lie in store for much of the region the next couple of days, with an additional 2 to 6 inches forecast -- and in isolated cases as much as 10 inches. This comes on top of the heavy precipitation that already has fallen in the region as the storm, which blew up from the Gulf of Mexico, ran up against an extra-tropical low-pressure system centered across the central Appalachian Mountains and stalled. ""These rains may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,"" the prediction center said. A flash flood warning for the District of Columbia remains in effect till midnight tonight, with damaging wind gusts and severe thunderstorms also possible. A news release from the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency urged people to ""avoid driving when possible, drive very carefully when you must drive, and stay alert for pooling water that you cannot drive through."" Earlier Wednesday, the storm caused a series of air traffic delays across the Northeast. Multiple flights were delayed by over an hour in the New York metro area and by up to 55 minutes in Boston and Philadelphia. The forecast was unwelcome news for waterlogged Vermont and northern New York, which could receive another 1 to 3 inches of rain with up to 4 inches possible in some spots by Wednesday night. ""We could get flooded again,"" Robin Stewart of Paterson, New Jersey, told CNN affiliate WCBS. ""We're real concerned about that."" Garbage remained piled outside Stewart's home after flooding from Irene wrecked her lower level, WCBS said. Stewart hasn't had power for more than a week, and she is afraid more rain will flood her home again and keep her in the dark even longer. ""When everybody else is on their way to recovery, we're getting flooded again,"" Stewart said. Some eye-popping storm rainfall totals in the Northeast were recorded through 5 p.m. Wednesday in Becket, Massachusetts (8.11 inches); Rockaway, New Jersey (8.43); Phillipsburg, New Jersey (7.9); and Forks, Bethlehem and Dover, Pennsylvania (just over 7 inches). Lee left at least four people dead as it crossed the Southeast, dumping as much as 12 to 15 inches of rain in many places. In Gwinnett County, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, firefighters said Tuesday they found the body of a man who drowned in a rain-swollen creek near Norcross. In Baldwin County, Alabama, police said they no longer believe a missing 16-year-old boy is alive. The teen was last seen on a beach near Gulf Shores on Sunday. A flooding death was also reported in rural northeast Mississippi, where one person drowned after floodwater swept away a vehicle in Tishomingo County, emergency officials said. And a woman was struck by a tree and killed in Chattanooga, Tennessee, early Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- One of three convicted killers who escaped from an Arizona prison was captured Sunday in Rifle, Colorado, and authorities are on the lookout for a silver Volkswagen Jetta the remaining escapees may be driving, according to corrections officials. Daniel Renwick, 36, was spotted driving a brown Chevy Blazer by a Rifle police officer who gave chase, Arizona Department of Corrections Director Charles Ryan told CNN Radio. Gunshots were exchanged, and Renwick was ultimately taken into custody. Renwick, who broke out of the Arizona State Prison-Kingman Friday night along with two others, was serving 22 years for second-degree murder. He is being held in Colorado, awaiting questioning by the U.S. Marshals Service. Ryan said the remaining escapees, identified as Tracy Province and John McCluskey, are believed to be driving a 2002 silver Jetta purchased Saturday in west Phoenix. ""If anyone sees this silver, 4-door Jetta, we recommend they call 911,"" Ryan said. The men, who have been described as armed and dangerous, were discovered missing after the 9:45 p.m. count Friday at the privately-operated Kingman facility. The escapees cut a hole in the fence, authorities said. A helicopter and dogs began a search. ""Precisely how they escaped is under investigation,"" Ryan said, noting some ""operational security problems"" at the prison. ""Those are being evaluated and investigated as we speak,"" he added. Province and McCluskey are believed to be with a female accomplice who was on the visitation list for one of the inmates. After their escape, the inmates and the accomplice abducted two truck drivers on Interstate 40 outside of Kingman and hijacked their 18-wheeler, according to the Mohave County Sheriff's Department in Kingman. They released them and the rig five hours later in Flagstaff, about 135 miles to the east. Province, 42, was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. McCluskey, 45, was serving 15 years for second-degree murder and other charges. The suspected accomplice was identified as 43-year-old Casslyn Mae Welch, who is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 135 pounds with brown hair and green eyes.

"(CNN) -- Rescue teams Thursday discovered the bodies of two people killed in a helicopter crash that happened Tuesday in the mountains near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The pilot, Sgt. Andrew Tingwall, was one of two people killed in Tuesday's helicopter crash in New Mexico. The bodies of state police officer Sgt. Andrew Tingwall and student Megumi Yamamoto were being taken to the state medical examiner's office, New Mexico State Police Chief Faron Segotta told reporters. ""Obviously, it's a very somber day,"" Segotta said at a news conference posted on CNN affiliate KRQE television's Web site. Tuesday night, Tingwall and another officer, Wesley Cox, picked up Yamamoto, who was lost in the mountains, and were returning to Santa Fe when their chopper crashed into a snowy face of Santa Fe Baldy, a 12,000-foot-high peak, Segotta said. Visibility was zero because of heavy cloud cover, he said. Tingwall was the pilot, the state's Department of Public Safety said. Cox was able to walk to rescuers Wednesday and was airlifted to a hospital, where he was treated for hypothermia and injuries to his back and right leg. He was in serious condition Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe, said Arturo Delgado, a hospital spokesperson. Cox told police that the helicopter landed hard and tumbled downhill, ejecting all three on board. After finding Cox, authorities were optimistic that Tingwall and Yamamoto might be alive. Search teams discovered the wreckage Wednesday, a day before the bodies were found. Yamamoto, of Tokyo, Japan, was a graduate student at the University of New Mexico, KRQE reported. An online police memorial page said Tingwall had been with the state police since 1995 and had logged 1,300 hours of flying time. Tingwall received a medal of valor after he single-handedly rescued a man from a river last summer, said Cox. Tingwall was embarrassed about receiving the medal because he felt he was only doing his job, said Cox, who said he knows Tingwall as a ""tough, resourceful, friendly guy."" Cox is expected to make a full recovery, Segotta said.","NEW: Pilot, man he was helping to safety killed in New Mexico crash .

"(CNN) -- The suspect in last month's fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport was ordered held without bond Wednesday, after saying he that he understood the charges against him. Paul Anthony Ciancia attended the federal hearing in Southern California handcuffed and wearing a green jail jumpsuit. He appeared frail and with several marks on his face. Standing behind a small glass partition, Ciancia, 23, answered ""yes"" in a seemingly hoarse whisper when Magistrate Judge David Bristow asked him if he'd seen the criminal complaint against him and agreed to be represented by a public defender. Ciancia was never asked to enter a plea during the court hearing. At the end, the judge ordered him ""detained"" after determining he posed a flight risk and danger to the community, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for California's central district, in a statement. His next court hearing -- unless he is indicted before then -- is scheduled for December 18, with an arraignment set for December 26, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Authorities have said that Ciancia faces charges for two felony offenses -- murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport. LAX victim shot 12 times . If convicted, he could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. has said. The U.S. attorney general would decide whether to pursue a death sentence. On November 1, authorities claim, Ciancia walked up to Transportation Security Administration checkpoint and opened fire, shooting TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez ""at point-blank range,"" according to a court document. Ciancia then went up an escalator but returned to shoot Hernandez again after apparently seeing the officer move, the document said. He then proceeded through the terminal, wounding two more officers before being shot himself. Hernandez, 39, eventually died of his injuries, becoming the first TSA employee killed in the federal agency's 12-year history. Obama visits family of slain TSA officer .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid have leapfrogged Manchester United as the most valuable sports team in the world, according to a list released by Forbes on Monday. The nine-time European champions have risen to the top of the list, overtaking English Premier League team Manchester United, with the U.S. business magazine valuing Real at $3.3 billion. Los Blancos' revenue of $650 million is the highest in sport, while the Spanish team's income of $134 million is second only to that of National Football League (NFL) franchise the Dallas Cowboys. Real's coffers have swelled thanks, in part, to a kit deal with German sports brand Adidas, worth $42 million per year, and a $39 million five-year sponsorship agreement with airline Emirates. English champions United sit second on the list, with an estimated value of $3.17 billion. The Old Trafford team, owned by the American Glazer family, announced a seven-season shirt sponsorship agreement with Chevrolet in 2012 worth $559 million. Real's archrivals Barcelona complete a top three dominated by football teams. The Spanish title winners are valued at $2.6 billion. United's EPL rivals Arsenal are the only other soccer club to feature in the top 10, with the north London team sitting 10th on the list with an estimated value of $1.33 billion. The remaining six spaces in the top 10 are taken by U.S. sports franchises. Major League Baseball's New York Yankees are fourth on the list, valued at $2.3 billion, while NFL teams the Cowboys and the New England Patriots are fifth and sixth worth $2.1 billion and $1.64 billion respectively. The average worth of the teams inside Forbes' top 50 has risen to $1.24 billion, an increase of 16% from 2012. American football is the best represented sport on the list, with 30 of the NFL's 32 franchise included in the top 50. Baseball and soccer both have seven teams on the list, while the NBA contributes three franchises. Formula One team Ferrari, at 21, are the highest-ranked motorsport manufacturer.","Forbes name Real Madrid the most valuable sports team in the world .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some Transportation Security Administration airport screeners should be given firearms and arrest powers to protect the larger workforce from shootings like last week's tragedy in Los Angeles, the head of the screeners union said Monday. J. David Cox Sr. proposed creating a ""new class of TSA officers"" that would have law enforcement status. Those officers -- and not airport police -- should be entrusted to protect checkpoints, Cox said. ""We want to make sure we are doing everything possible to secure screening areas,"" said Cox, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents the nation's 45,000 transportation security officers. Friday's shooting has reignited the debates over the proper role of airport screeners and how best to protect the workforce charged with protecting the American public. Ideas run the gamut, from giving screeners guns to taking away their police-like badges. Critics say the Transportation Security Administration erred in 2005, when in an effort to professionalize the workforce and boost morale, it reclassified screeners as ""officers."" The title wrongly implies that screeners carry guns and have arrest powers, critics say, and gives the public a skewed view of their jobs. In 2007, the agency issued screeners uniforms with blue shirts, and the next year, it replaced the embroidered logos with metal badges. The result, critics say, is a work force of more than 45,000 people who hold the job of ""officer"" in name only. ""Despite their title and appearance TSA transportation security officers are not in fact federal officers,"" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said Monday. Arming the officers ""would only make matters worse,"" said Blackburn, who has sponsored legislation to prevent the workers from wearing metal badges and using the title ""officer."" In his two public appearances since the shooting, TSA Administrator John Pistole, a career FBI agent before moving to the TSA in 2010, has sidestepped questions about whether the officers should be armed. Officer safety ""is something we have dealt with really since the standup of TSA, knowing that in many respects TSA employees are the first line of defense when it comes to airport security particularly,"" Pistole said Saturday. ""And so given this tragedy, we will obviously look at and review our policies with airport police both here at LAX and of course around the country."" Officer safety is ""something that we have to assess, evaluate and then see what the best approach is, knowing that in the final analysis we can't guard against all threats and all risks,"" Pistole said. Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge called the idea of arming officers a ""a big mistake."" ""You have literally hundreds and hundreds of armed police officers roaming every major airport in America. And I don't think arming another 40 or 50 or 60 thousand people ... would have prevented this incident from happening,"" he said. ""When the individual removed the firearm, began firing, the response mechanism kicked in. So I personally think (arming screeners) is a bad idea."" Both Pistole and Ridge spoke before Cox proposed creating a new tier of TSA offices. Providing guns to all 45,000-plus officers would be a weighty challenge. Currently, the federal air marshals are the only TSA officers who carry weapons, and most were drawn from the ranks of law enforcement or the military. A change would be time-consuming, distracting officers from their mission: finding people and items that present threats to aircraft. And the change would introduce weapons into checkpoints, where they could be grabbed by deranged passengers and used against officers. Mission creep . Meanwhile, airport police department unions have complained about TSA ""mission creep."" Mission creep ""threatens the security of the airport,"" representatives of the American Alliance of Airport Police Officers wrote in a letter to Pistole in September 2012. ""TSA has expanded the scope of their authority beyond screening areas to more traditional 'police' work without clear lines of delineation with airport police, jeopardizing public safety, contributing to a break in chain-of-command, and delaying timely law enforcement responses,"" the group wrote. ""TSA agents are attempting to investigate and/or correct (security) breaches,"" the letter said, endangering the public, delaying police involvement and causing travel disruptions. TSA employees should be restricted to conducting passenger and bag screening, the letter said. The letter was signed by Marshall McClain, president of the Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association, and Paul Nunziato, president of the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association. McClain said the TSA never responded to the letter. In the letter, the alliance said airport police have had a ""long and productive"" history working with federal law enforcement officers and the TSA's air marshals. ""The only federal entity with which our officers experience constant tension is with TSA non-law enforcement operations,"" it reads. What's next . Although congress could decide to give TSA officers guns or remove their badges, there is a range of other options. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, specifically mentioned the increased use of VIPR teams, which pair armed air marshals with other agencies to patrol airports and other transportation venues. ""I think that with better coordination with local law enforcement should help tremendously,"" McCaul said on CNN's State of the Union with Candy Crowley. But McCaul placed little stock in other suggestions such as moving checkpoints closer to terminal doors. ""It's very difficult to stop these types of attacks,"" McCaul said. ""Anybody can show up, as we saw in the (Washington Navy Yard shooting) with the shotgun, in this case with the semi-automatic. ""It's almost like an open shopping mall. So, it's very difficult to protect. But these VIPR teams, I think, with local law enforcement can't provide that needed security. We are going to be reviewing this along with the director of TSA."" Ridge expressed a similar sentiment. ""At the end of the day, I think there are certain kinds of risks for which there is no sensible, thoughtful, reasonable, economically appropriate way to abandon or to eradicate. And this happens to be one of them, at airports,"" Ridge said.","TSA screeners union says some should get firearms, arrest powers .

"(CNN) -- Who gets to decide when to end life support when a person is brain dead? The mother of 13-year-old Jahi McMath, who was declared brain dead Thursday, three days after undergoing surgery to remove her tonsils, said Tuesday that the family should make the call. ""I don't want her off life support because I really feel like she can wake up,"" Nailah Winkfield told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""I feel like it's just been a rough week for her and, if they just give her some more time, then she'll be able to wake up."" Jahi's family has presented Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland, California, with a cease-and-desist letter aimed at preventing the hospital from taking her off a ventilator, attorney Christopher B. Dolan said Tuesday. ""If the hospital wants to terminate Jahi's life, they should go to court and get a judge to authorize that, not pressure a parent into signing a document in the middle of the night or telling them at 8:30 tomorrow morning your child will be (dead),"" he told CNN. Doctors had recommended the tonsillectomy to treat Jahi's sleep apnea, weight gain, inability to concentrate, short attention span and uncontrolled urination, her uncle Omari Sealey told CNN on Monday in a telephone interview. ""They said that she would have more energy, focus more, lose weight, and the urinating would stop,"" he said. The surgery, which occurred December 9, initially appeared to have gone well, said Sandy Chatman, Jahi's grandmother who is herself a nurse and saw the girl in the recovery room. ""She was alert and talking, and she was asking for a Popsicle because she said her throat hurt,"" Chatman said. But Jahi was then moved to the intensive-care unit, and her relatives were denied access to the eighth-grader for 30 minutes; when they finally were allowed to see her, they knew something was wrong. ""Upon entry, they saw that there was way too much blood,"" Chatman said. ""We kept asking, 'Is this normal?'"" Sealey said. ""Some nurses said, 'I don't know,' and some said, 'Yes.' There was a lot of uncertainty and a lack of urgency."" Sealey said that when Chatman noticed that her granddaughter's oxygen levels were dangerously low, she called for help. But Jahi went into cardiac arrest. The medical staff performed chest compressions to revive her and gave her clotting medications, but nothing worked. On Tuesday, a CT scan revealed that two-thirds of Jahi's brain was swollen. Sealey said that Jahi's brain had been deprived of oxygen. ""Now she is 100% brain damaged,"" he said. ""Medically dead."" CNN could not independently confirm Sealey's account. When asked about the case, hospital spokeswoman Melinda Krigel cited privacy laws. A statement from the hospital's chief of pediatrics, Dr. David Durand, read: ""Our hearts go out to this patient and her family. Unfortunately, we have not been authorized by the family to share information with the public about this matter. Consequently, we are not able to correct misperceptions created about this sad situation. ""Nonetheless, we want to assure the community that we are doing everything in our capacity to provide support to the grieving family. We have been caring for children in this community for over 100 years and have a longstanding commitment to delivering the highest quality care for all."" Dr. Lisa Thebner, a pediatrician in private practice in New York who was not involved in the case, said excessive bleeding -- though rare -- is not unheard of in such operations, given that the tonsils are removed from the back of the throat, an area rich in blood vessels. Still, she said, ""This was a highly unusual complication."" When told that his niece was brain dead, Sealey said the entire family went into ""complete devastation."" ""We pray over her daily,"" Sealey said. ""We kiss her. I charge her iPod and make sure it is in her ears every night when I sleep next to her."" But he said he had accepted that she was legally dead. An official from the Oakland coroner's office told CNN that Jahi's death was reported Thursday to the office. ""Once a death is reported to us, we have a duty and responsibility to immediately proceed to where the body lies, examine the body, make identification, make inquiry into the circumstances, manner, and means of death, and, as circumstances warrant, either order its removal for further investigation or disposition, or release the body to the next of kin,"" the official said, quoting California law. Sealey said that though the family hoped to keep Jahi on life support, hospital representatives had told them Monday that would not be an option. That has left the coroner's office in a delicate position. ""Technically, we can go where the body lies and we can begin our investigation as to the causes of death,"" the official from the coroner's office said. ""We have been gracious and we have allowed the parents and the hospital to maintain the child on life support."" Krigel, the hospital spokeswoman, said that the hospital has no policy about terminating life support. ""We work with the family to determine when that will happen,"" she said in an e-mail. ""There are instances when the coroner may request termination, but we always work with the family to respect their wishes."" The official at the coroner's office said time is critical. ""When the body is on a ventilator, the body is healing,"" the official said. ""If a medical misadventure occurred, and the body is healing and covering up traces of that misadventure, the coroner pathologist has a more difficult time rendering a cause of death."" The bigger issue is deciding whether it is more important to delay removing the ventilator to give relatives time to grieve or to act quickly to determine the causes of death before continued healing could make it impossible to ascertain those causes, the official said. ""We know the parents want answers, and it is our office that will provide answers if they are available to us,"" the official said. ""The longer we wait, the less susceptible we are to getting the evidence we need to render a cause of death. Time is not on our side, from a medical investigation standpoint."" ""This is obviously a horrible and tragic case,"" said Dr. J. Randall Curtis, a professor of medicine and the director of the Palliative Care Center of Excellence at the University of Washington in Seattle. But, he added, ""If the patient is brain dead, they are legally dead and, legally, the doctors and the hospital have the right to stop life support -- without the consent of the family."" Still, giving them a little time to come to grips with the reality can be helpful, said Curtis, who published a study in 2008 that found that when the withdrawal of life support was delayed, a family's satisfaction with care tended to be higher. ""The most important thing in this situation is to provide support for the family,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""To help the family come to understand what's happened, to be able to grieve this loss and to be able to get to a place where they are ready."" But, he acknowledged, in cases where something went horribly awry, ""being able to trust the doctors is going to be challenging."" Arthur L. Caplan, the head of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, said Tuesday there was no doubt about who makes the call. ""The legal right to stop is on the doctors' side,"" he told CNN. ""We don't treat the dead. Sadly, she has died.""

"(CNN) -- South Carolina authorities say a convicted sex offender held a woman against her will for three months, repeatedly beating and raping her during the captivity. The Lexington County Sheriff's Department arrested Paul Thomas Rawl Jr. on Tuesday. He's been charged with kidnapping, first-degree criminal sexual conduct and criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature. The sheriff's department said he held his 52-year-old girlfriend captive in a Pelion home -- about 20 miles southwest of Columbia -- from July 1 until Monday. ""They broke up, and they recently got back together,"" Lexington Sheriff James R. Metts told CNN affiliate WIS. ""This time, things weren't the same. He kidnapped her, and wouldn't let her leave."" Major John Allard of the sheriff's department told CNN that the victim was never reported missing to his agency. The arrest warrant alleges that Rawl, who is also 52, confined his victim to a bedroom that he kept under surveillance and barricaded shut. The victim has not been named. The details of the case are harrowing. According to Metts, Rawl would force her to swallow a Xanax pill every night before sexually assaulting her, and that he ""used aggravated force to accomplish sexual battery as many as nine times daily."" The warrant alleges he threatened to kill her with a loaded bow and arrow, and on one occasion, rammed her head so hard into a wall that it made a hole. ""Rawl physically assaulted (her) in such a manner that (she) feared imminent bodily injury or death,"" Metts said in a statement. Authorities said she was able to escape Tuesday when she persuaded Rawl to take her to a medical exam -- but not before one final act of cruelty. ""Rawl forced the woman to perform a sexual act on him on Tuesday before he agreed to take the woman to the medical office."" He was denied bond and ordered to stay in jail on Wednesday, according to WIS. The sheriff's department said Wednesday night that it had no record of Rawl being represented by an attorney yet. WIS reports that his next court date is scheduled for December 19. Rawl was convicted in 2000 of criminal sexual conduct. His victim in that case was a 12-year-old girl.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- John Edwards took the stage at Indiana University on Tuesday night for a discussion on the 2008 presidential election, but members of the audience may have had something else on their minds entirely. John Edwards admitted in August that he had an affair with Rielle Hunter in 2006. After all, this is the former North Carolina senator's first public appearance since his admission of an extramarital affair sent shockwaves through the political world more than three months ago. Edwards talked about politics, poverty and his hopes for America and the world, according to The Associated Press. Afterward, he answered only written questions that had been submitted before his speech. The affair wasn't mentioned, AP reported. The revelation, confirming a months-long investigation by the National Enquirer, was a political bombshell for the former candidate, who espoused moral values during his White House bid and whose wife is fighting a public battle with breast cancer. The acknowledgment, during an ABC News interview in early August, was carefully timed to coincide with the opening night of the Olympic Games for minimum impact, and Edwards effectively went into hiding immediately after. During the interview, Edwards said he had engaged in an extramarital affair with a former campaign staffer, Rielle Hunter, but he vehemently denied he was the father of her newborn baby. The man who had been considered a major contender for the Democratic nomination instantly became a pariah in his own party and didn't merit so much as a mention at the Democratic National Convention a month later. But with the 2008 presidential election officially in the history books, Edwards may be looking to accomplish what a handful of other national political figures have been able to do: successfully re-emerge from an embarrassing public scandal that by all appearances has left his political career in ruins. It remains unclear how successful the 2004 vice-presidential nominee will be in that pursuit, but Americans have given politicians second chances in the past. Political opponents and members of the media have written off Bill Clinton on more than one occasion after embarrassing sex scandals, and many assumed Louisiana Sen. David Vitter's career was done after his involvement with a Washington escort last year. ""It's possible that so many officeholders have survived sexual scandals simply because the public has a low opinion of politicians,"" CNN polling director Keating Holland said. ""They may not be surprised that politicians are cheating on their spouses and may be more likely to forgive behavior that they assume is happening anyway."" But for every politician that has survived a sex scandal, scores of once-powerful men have not. Just ask former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart, former Republican Rep. Bob Livingston, or Democratic Rep. Tim Mahoney, who lost his re-election bid last week after an affair with a former staffer was disclosed. But Edwards' future just may hinge on how he goes about re-entering the public sphere. While it remains a long shot that Edwards will ever run for office again, he could re-emerge as a powerful voice for a set of issues he championed during the Democratic presidential primary: poverty and healthcare. ""He needs to figure out what the Democratic Party needs post-Obama election and step back and think, 'Well, what can I bring to the table?' "" said James Spellman, a professor at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.  ""It can't be all about him and his resurrection. It has to be about the benefits he can bring to helping the new administration and what he can do to help Obama and his team get the job done."" ""Americans are very forgiving, and their memory is often short,"" Spellman said. ""He can come back if he does it right."" The speech Tuesday night appears designed not to make a political splash -- no reporters or cameras are allowed in the room. But by all outward appearances, it is an attempt by Edwards to dip his foot back into the political waters after a three-month hiatus. ""Whatever he says, his speech is either going to be blogged or taped by people listening,"" Spellman said. ""Social media technologies are such today that nothing is closed. Anytime you give a speech it's public."" Edwards is also set to make a public appearance in San Francisco, California, Wednesday -- and slated to debate former Bush strategist Karl Rove at the American Bankers Association, the San Francisco Chronicle reported over the weekend. But even as Edwards is appearing to take the first steps toward a comeback, former supporters -- many of whom where blindsided by his admission of infidelity -- may be unwilling to give him a second chance this soon. ""I wish he would keep himself locked in a cave for a year,"" a former senior staffer to Edwards' campaign said. ""The best strategy he could adopt right now is to stay below the radar and just be quiet and let people move on."" ""Part of him wants to champion causes others have left behind, and there is a part of him that feels like his own personal mistakes should not sabotage the causes of poverty, but he is not the best messenger for that right now,"" the former senior staffer said.","NEW: Ex-Sen.

"(CNN) -- Online video has gotten a bum rap. YouTube is often thought of as a home for juvenile idiocy, mindless narcissism and not much more. The collective 80 million hours we spend watching it every day seems to some like a terrible waste of human attention. But if you dig under the surface, you can discover something much more hopeful. Hidden among all the cute kittens and pirated TV shows, online video is driving astonishing innovation in thousands of different fields ranging from the ultra-niche to the sharing of truly world-changing ideas. In my TED talk, just posted, I point to numerous examples of this innovation, such as the dance revolution exemplified by a dance troupe called the LXD who played the Oscars this year. And I coin a term for it: crowd-accelerated innovation. The term is new, but the process is old. Actually, this is pretty much the only type of innovation there has ever been. Contrary to the romantic myth, innovation doesn't suddenly emerge from lone geniuses and their eureka moments. It emerges when groups of people spark off each other. In history, progress took off when people came together in cities, and the scientific revolution took off when people around the world could read about each others' discoveries in print. We're a social species. We spark off each other. One of the most significant aspects of the Web is that it has connected vastly larger groups than ever before in history, and thereby sparked massive new types of innovation. For example, the open-source movement that created Linux and scores of other incredible pieces of software would not have been possible before the Web brought programmers together. Similar explosions in innovation have happened in music, photography and animation, to name just three areas. But what these fields have in common is that people's work output could be easily shared digitally -- via still photographs, MP3 files, and software programs, for example. The reason online video is so significant is that it is now allowing the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally. It's not just YouTube, of course, it's all over the Web. Here are some examples: . Unicycling . Makeup artistry . Video Poetry . Dance . Skateboarding . Sports training . Science . The world of ideas . In my talk, I explain that you need just three things in place for crowd-accelerated innovation to take off: a ""Crowd,"" ""Light"" and ""Desire."" Crowd: It can be any group, small or large, of people who share a common interest. The bigger the group, the better the chance that it contains real innovators. But successful crowds also depend on lots of other roles like trend-spotters, cheerleaders, commenters, and even skeptics. Light: You need to be able to see what the very best people in the crowd are capable of. And the amazing thing about the Web is that even when the crowd is in the millions, the best contributors can readily bubble up to the surface -- for example, by winning the most views or highest ratings on a website. Desire: On the Web, this is provided through social recognition. If you can do something innovative and special, you get thousands of people viewing your work and talking about you. It's intoxicating. And it's driving hundreds and hundreds of hours of effort from potential innovators across the globe. The rise of online video has vastly expanded the Crowd, shone a brighter Light on the best talent, and dialed up the Desire by offering participants a form of global fame. Someone sees a video with 50,000 views and thinks, ""That's awesome, I'll copy it and take it to the next level."" They emulate, then they innovate, and the bar gets raised again and again. We've noticed it on our website http://www.ted.com/. Ever since we started posting TED talks online, speakers have started raising their game. They could see what great TED talks looked like. And they had a greater motivation to shine. So the amount of preparation going into each talk rose dramatically. But the phenomenon is everywhere, and it has the potential to transform any organization and give an amazing platform to any individual. I'm convinced that the latest iteration of crowd-accelerated innovation, fueled by Web video, is about to ignite the biggest learning cycle in human history. There are huge implications for the future of global education. Tomorrow's best teachers will be global stars reaching literally millions of kids. And talented students around the world will no longer have their potential destroyed by lousy teachers. They can learn directly from the world's finest. My talk ends with an incredible video shot in Africa's biggest slum, which turns out to be teeming with innovation, innovation that in past years would have simply remained invisible to the rest of the world. If we're in an age where the TED audience can learn from residents of a slum and vice versa, there's reason to be hopeful for our future. Reaction to the talk has been intense. It's sparked dozens of comments and loads of new ideas. But what do you think? Have you had an instance where Web video has taught you something important or provoked you to action? Have you made videos yourself, and has the process of making them motivated you to innovate? If so, I'd love to hear from you. I will be reading every comment submitted below. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Anderson.","YouTube doesn't get enough credit for its productive side, says Chris Anderson .

"(CNN) -- It's becoming a familiar routine. The Dutch turn up in Sochi's speed skating arena and duly finish first, second and third. Once might be notable, twice impressive but when it happens for the fourth time, onlookers are simply left shaking their heads and wondering how it's possible. As they did again on Tuesday when Jorrit Bergsma took gold in the men's 10,000m in a new Olympic record of 12 minutes 44.45 seconds, ahead of Sven Kramer and Bob de Jong. The Dutch have now taken 19 of the 27 medals on offer in speed skating, with their 20th medal also coming in the Adler Arena -- in the short track. No other country has won more medals at these Games. ""What is the secret? Everybody is asking,"" Stefan Groothuis, who won speed skating gold over 1,000m last week, told CNN. ""I don't think there's one particular secret. The competitive model in Holland is really high. It's really hard to qualify for the Olympics. We have some more amazing teammates who have stayed at home because they didn't qualify. ""I also think it's a kind of coincidence that everything is coming together at these Games, because at recent World Cups we haven't been dominating so much. ""But everyone is doing it here - and that's awesome. It's a great feeling that so many people in the Dutch team are doing great, so there's a really nice environment in the village."" To find an indication as to why the Dutch are so dominant at the Winter Olympics, one need only visit the history of speed skating page on the International Olympic Committee's website. ""The Dutch were arguably the earliest pioneers of skating,"" the IOC writes. ""They began using canals to maintain communication by skating from village to village as far back as the 13th century. ""The first known skating competition is thought to have been held in the Netherlands in 1676... In 1889, the Netherlands hosted the first World Championships."" So it's no surprise when Groothuis describes the sport as second only to football in terms of popularity among the Dutch. Meanwhile, De Jong gave a humorous indication of what drove him to bronze. ""I'm really happy. I didn't want to be the only (Dutch) guy without a medal at these Games,"" he said. ""It's unbelievable how many medals the Dutch team has taken from these Olympic Games. We've already doubled the medals from the Vancouver Games. ""It's not only in Holland that you can make money in speed skating. If you qualify for the World Cup, the government can pay you good money. You can live for your skating."" DEFYING LOGIC . In an event delayed a day by Sochi's poor weather on Monday, Frenchman Pierre Vaultier won gold in the men's snowboard cross, ahead of Russia's Nikolay Olyunin and American Alex Deibold. Vaultier was constantly trading the lead position with Olyunin but won gold after an enormous final jump. His victory contravened medical convention, with Vaultier having torn his anterior cruciate ligament in December -- an injury that normally takes six months to heal. ""When I passed the finish line I think I was still up in the air (from the last jump),"" joked Vaultier. ""I had a knee three times the (normal) size and did my cruciate ligament. What's happening to me is just incredible."" Olyunin, meanwhile, said he would be retiring after the Games despite being just 22, while American Alex Deibold celebrated a remarkable rise after working as a wax technician for the U.S. team four years ago. ""It's definitely been really tough, but I remember how hard it was for me back then and I use that as motivation to get myself where I am today,"" said the 27-year-old. Another American celebrating on Tuesday was David Wise, who will forever stay in freestyle skiing halfpipe history after winning the inaugural event at the Olympics. The 23-year-old won the day's last medal event, ahead of Canada's Mike Riddle and Kevin Rolland of France. MAZE FINDS WAY . Earlier on Tuesday, Slovenia's Tina Maze made light of tricky weather conditions to become only the second woman in Winter Olympic history to win both the downhill and giant slalom. Having won the downhill last week, the 30-year-old finished seven hundredths of a second ahead of Austria's Anna Fenninger, who won gold in Saturday's Super-G, with Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany taking bronze. ""It's crazy. I was ready for this, it's what I came here to do,"" said Maze, who emulates the feats of Switzerland's Marie-Theres Nadig in Sapporo in 1972. ""I feel proud. I think I will realize what I have done many years later."" Maze, who won two silvers at Vancouver 2010, is now the most successful Olympian in either the summer of winter Games in Slovenia's history -- with a total of four. Less successful but still celebrating was Thailand's Vanessa Vanakorn, better known as world-famous violinist Vanessa Mae. Competing under the name of her Thai father, the 35-year-old placed last of the 67 skiers who finished -- some 50 seconds behind Maze. ""You can insure yourself up to your eyeballs, but if you don't take risks, what's the point?"" she said in response to a question about the possibility of damaging her arms. ""You have to enjoy life. I nearly crashed three times, but I made it down and that was the main thing. Being here is amazing."" ASIAN GAMES . Asia did celebrate one medal on Tuesday, as South Korea's women won the 3,000 meter relay in another extraordinary final. Four years ago, the South Koreans thought they had won gold in Vancouver only to be disqualified for impeding -- a decision which promoted China to gold. On Tuesday, the roles were reversed as South Korea passed the defending champions on the last of the 27 laps to take the gold, with the Chinese -- who thought they had bagged silver -- later disqualified for impeding on the final lap. ""We were disqualified at the last Olympics and today we picked up the gold medal we left behind back then,"" said team member Seung-Hi Park. ""Only two people from our current team competed in Vancouver, and the younger skaters really stepped up this time."" Canada won silver as a result of China's disqualification while Italy completed the podium. ""I couldn't stop smiling. I was crying. It was amazing,"" said Elena Viviani after her unexpected bronze. BEST OF THE REST . In the men's biathlon, which had been postponed from Monday because of fog, Norway's 11-time world champion Emil Hegle Svendsen won the third Olympic gold of his career. Organizers needed a photo finish to determine whether Svendsen had beaten fast-finishing Frenchman Martin Fourcade, who has already won two golds in Sochi, over the line, with both contestants finishing with the same time. ""I feel very many thoughts but most of all very happy,"" said Svendsen. ""It was a very tight finish, but I had some power left. I had been saving some power on the last loop. It was not a big difference for gold."" Ondrej Moravec of the Czech Republic finished third, meaning Norwegian Ole Einar Bjoerndalen failed in his quest to become the highest medal winner in Winter Olympic history. The 40-year-old needed just one more medal to surpass the all-time record he shares with compatriot Bjorn Daehlie but he finished in a disappointing 22nd place. He has one more chance in the relays. Yet Norway were not to be denied a medal as Joergen Graabak took gold in the Nordic Combined, finishing 0.6 seconds ahead of compatriot Magnus Hovdal Moan. ""I didn't think I would get to realise this,"" said Graabak after winning his first Olympic medal of any color. ""It's pretty obvious how I feel. I cannot really tell. It's a bit surreal. I will need time to enjoy the moment."" Fabian Riessle of Germany finished third, while his compatriot Eric Frenzel -- the pre-event favourite -- struggled to shake off the effects of a virus and so finished 10th. GOLD ON ICE . Elsewhere, Russia kept their dream of winning ice hockey gold alive after beating a limited Norwegian side 4-0 to set up a quarterfinal clash with Finland on Wednesday. The Russians are desperate to win their first Olympic gold since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 -- having won six of the seven Olympics prior to that date. Although Russians formed part of the 'Unified Team' that won gold in 1992, the success was not theirs alone since they counted teammates from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan and Armenia among their number. Despite ice hockey gold seeming to be among the most desired aspects of Sochi 2014 for President Vladimir Putin, the Russians are struggling -- having been forced to negotiate the playoffs to reach the last eight after failing to win their group. This was, of course, a direct result of failing to beat the U.S. in Saturday's extraordinarily dramatic match, which the Americans won on penalties, and the flag-waving crowd was at capacity in the futuristic Bolshoy Ice Dome once again to rally their favorites.","Jorrit Bergsma leads home fourth Dutch 1-2-3 in speed skating .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The image lasts just four seconds, flashed on the screen during the opening sequence of a Filipino news program posted online. It's of an elderly man kneeling on a church pew, his lips moving as though in prayer, and it's given new hope to a woman in Hong Kong who hasn't heard from 30 members of her family since Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into Tacloban in the Philippines last Friday. ""We think this is my uncle! They look identical!"" Daisy Nemeth wrote in an email to CNN, after receiving an overnight message from her sister, Merceditas Tan Ã˜stergaard, in Denmark, who's been scanning online news in the hope of seeing a familiar face. And there it was. The lone, elderly man in silent prayer bears a striking resemblance to 68-year-old Rogelio Tan, the patriarch of the sprawling Tan family who all but disappeared during the storm. ""She was staring at the video clips and he was there in one of them. But his wife wasn't and his children weren't,"" Nemeth said from her home in Hong Kong, her joy of seeing her uncle tempered by the thought of those who weren't there, or couldn't be seen. The family recognizes the church as the Santo NiÃ±o Church de Tacloban, a distinctive pink Roman Catholic Church just one block from the coast where a devastating storm surge swept in, killing hundreds, if not thousands of people. The church withstood the storm, though its towering spire has been stripped of its roofing, as has most of the main building. Yet, it was there that the man suspected to be Tan can be seen praying, as he has done countless times before. His family lived just streets away. The possible reappearance of her uncle four days after the typhoon was not the only news raising Nemeth's hopes that more relatives can be found. On the same day, it emerged her cousin Hazel Tan and her five children, aged between nine and 19, had made it out of the storm. Nemeth has no idea how or where they are, but a family member passed on the news that they're safe and have since left Tacloban. Nemeth says she expected to feel elation after finding some members of her missing family, but days of worry have left her emotionally exhausted. ""You think about what's going to happen when you find them, that it's going to be relief and joy and happiness and it wasn't,"" she said. ""I checked them off the list and moved onto my uncle. And now I've checked him off the list, now I'm moving on to someone else. There's so much going on, feeling relief is impossible in this situation."" Her thoughts have now turned to her other cousin, Rogelio Tan Jr., his wife Vanessa, and their three young children, aged from four to eight years old. The Super Typhoon hit the Philippines coast just before 5 a.m. last Friday, flattening buildings, swamping homes and businesses with flood water and leaving a trail of destruction authorities and locals are still trying to comprehend. ""I'm so tired at this point. I'm not negative about the situation but whatever happens, happens, at this point,"" Nemeth said. ""But I want the kids out. The thought of them living with bodies lining the streets -- it's pure misery there,""","Elderly man seen on Filipino news channel could be missing uncle .

"London (CNN) -- Pakistani girls' education campaigner Malala Yousafzai, who has found international fame since being shot by Taliban militants last year, met with another icon Friday: Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, invited the young activist to a reception at Buckingham Palace, where they met and chatted for a short time. Malala, who was accompanied by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, presented the Queen with a copy of her newly published memoir, titled ""I am Malala."" ""It's nice to meet you and it's a great honor coming here, and I wanted to present you my book,"" Malala said. Queen Elizabeth responded, ""That's very kind of you. Thank you very much indeed."" Malala said she hoped the two could work together to make sure all children receive an education, not just in Pakistan, but in the United Kingdom, too. ""I hope that we will all work together for the education of every child, and especially in this country as well, because I have heard about many children that cannot go to school,"" she said. ""So I hope that we will continue our work on youth empowerment."" In his inimitable fashion, the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, made a joke about children and education when meeting Malala at the palace. ""It's one thing about children going to school,"" he said, ""they go to school because their parents don't want them in the house."" In an interview with CNN last week, Malala joked that she was going ""because it's the order of the Queen, it's the command."" Malala has been based in Britain since she was rushed there for major surgery after the Taliban shot her in the head in her native Pakistan because of her efforts to promote girls' education. Malala: Accolades, applause and a grim milestone . It's been a busy few days for the 16-year-old. Last Friday, as the world marked the International Day of the Girl, she met U.S. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House. Pakistan's educational challenges . Undaunted by the occasion, she challenged the President over U.S. drone strikes in her homeland, saying that they risk ""fueling terrorism"" and that U.S. efforts would be better focused on promoting education, according to a statement she released. The U.S. government has said strikes by the unmanned aircraft are a necessary part of the fight against militant groups, including the Taliban. A day earlier, Malala won the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, awarded by the European Parliament. Parliament President Martin Schulz called her a ""brave advocate for education"" who ""reminds us of our duty toward children and especially girls."" Malala's memoir, which recounts her experiences after she was shot and her determination not to be intimidated by extremists, was released October 8. There had been speculation that she might also be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last Friday, but it went instead to the world's chemical weapons watchdog. Why Malala's bravery inspires us . Malala's activism started after the Taliban banned girls from schools in Pakistan's Swat Valley in 2009. She anonymously blogged for the BBC in opposition to that order and became an open advocate for girls' education. In 2011, Malala told CNN, ""I have the right of education. I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk."" A year later, at age 15, she was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head. She nearly died. Since then, Malala has recovered and continued advocating for girls' education, despite ongoing death threats from the Taliban. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","Malala Yousafzai chats with Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace reception .

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old girl pleads with her parents not to barter her into a marriage. Komol, from India, dreamed of continuing her education, going to college and providing a better life for her parents. But what she wanted counted little. She became pregnant with her first child at age 16, in a marriage she did not want. ""Since then, I have hardly ever been allowed to step out of the house,"" Komol was reported as saying, in a United Nations Population Fund report released Wednesday. ""Sometimes, when the others are not at home, I read my old school books, and hold my baby and cry."" ""She is such an adorable little girl, but I am blamed for not having a son."" One in every five girls (about 19%) gives birth before she turns 18 in developing countries, according to the report. Of the 7.3 million girls who give birth every year, 2 million of them are under the age of 14. The report states that pregnancies -- especially for these girls -- ""are not the result of a deliberate choice"" but rather ""the result of an absence of choices and of circumstances beyond a girl's control,"" affecting their health, education and future job opportunities. ""For these very young adolescents who do not have a say in whether or when they will become pregnant, their futures are destroyed, and their basic human rights are violated,"" said Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund in an e-mail. Countries with the highest percentage of reported births before age 18 were mostly in West Africa, in countries such as Niger (51%), Chad (48%), Mali (46%) and Guinea (44%). Globally, adolescent births are declining. But they are increasing in three regions -- South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. How it relates to child marriages . Underlying factors for early pregnancies include poverty, sexual violence, lack of access to reproductive health and education, and child marriages. In some countries, girls are used as bargaining chips to strengthen alliances, pay family debts, leading to child marriages. Families ""may want to divest themselves of the burden of having a girl,"" said the report. ""In extreme cases, they may want to earn money by selling the girl."" This could stem from poverty, pressures from their communities, partners and even their own families. Police: Mom sold daughters' virginity . Despite near-universal commitments to end child marriages, one in three girls in developing countries is married before age 18, according to the report. In Bangladesh, Chad and Niger, more than one in three girls is married before she turns 15. Niger has the highest child marriage rate and adolescent birth rate, according to the annual report. Why young pregnancies are so dangerous . Every year, 70,000 girls die from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, according to UNICEF. They may lack proper nutrition or health care. And girls who are pregnant at age 15 or younger are also at higher risk for eclampsia (seizures), anemia, postpartum hemorrhage and puerperal endometritis (uterine infection). Girls who are not fully physically developed are at risk for prolonged labor, which could result in obstetric fistula. This condition, marked by a hole in the birth canal, usually results in the death of the baby and makes the mother incontinent. It's not just developing countries... While the vast majority of teenage pregnancies happen in the developing world, the developed world is not immune to such issues. About 5% of teenage births (680,000 out of 13.1 million) occur in developed countries. The United States leads the developed world in teenage births. But teen pregnancy rates there are declining; in 2011, the number of babies born to women aged 15 to 19 was at a record low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rural America has a teen pregnancy problem . Even in countries with low teenage births, ethnic minorities and marginalized groups grapple with socio-economic issues leading to early pregnancies. In Serbia, the teenage birth rate among the Roma minority is more than six times the national average. In Bulgaria, half of Roma girls give birth before turning 18, highlighting the problems of exclusion, child marriage and lack of reproductive health care. What needs to change? Pregnancy prevention campaigns are aimed at changing girls' behaviors, implicitly blaming the girl for pregnancies at a young age, according to the report. ""Such approaches and thinking are misguided because they fail to account for the circumstances and societal pressures that conspire against adolescent girls and make motherhood a likely outcome of their transition from childhood to adulthood,"" wrote Osotimehin. The report makes recommendations to ""build girls' human capital"" and offer ""opportunities so that motherhood is not seen as their only destiny."" It cited a study that found when Kenyan schools began providing children with uniforms free of charge, the dropout rate decreased by 18% and pregnancy rates fell 17%, showing that access to education was an effective tool. In Guatemala, Mayans are the country's most disadvantaged group, with problems of child marriage. A support network for rural Mayan girls provided safe space and taught leadership skills. Results showed girls in the program stayed in school and had much lower pregnancy rates than the national average.","One in five girls gives birth before turning 18, says U.N. agency report .

"Mugello, Italy (CNN) -- Felipe Massa can be forgiven for feeling a little emotional ahead of this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix. After notching up 11 wins in eight years for Ferrari, a longevity that makes him the famous Italian Formula One team's second-longest-serving driver, his last race for the Scuderia will be at the track he calls home. Few nations can deliver the passion for motorsport and race-day color that Brazil offers, or match the country for its production-line output of star drivers such as Ayrton Senna, Emerson Fittipaldi, Rubens Barrichello and Nelson Piquet. But for the latest talent from those shores, there is good reason to be anxious throughout the festivities that will take place at the Sao Paulo-based Interlagos circuit. ""We've always had great drivers in Brazil and many champions, I think racing is in our blood, and it's very special to be part of Brazil and to carry on fighting,"" Massa told CNN's The Circuit. ""But Brazil is getting less and less drivers, you know, so now I am the only Brazilian Formula One driver. ""It's difficult to see other drivers that can replace me for the future. When I was racing in little categories -- Formula Renault, Formula 3000 here in Europe -- in every category there was one Brazilian fighting for the championship, for victories. ""And now you don't see it anymore. It is definitely a worry and is something that ... I think our organization, our federation, should do something to improve our school in Brazil."" The 32-year-old, who has agreed a deal with Williams for the next three seasons after being replaced by Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari, believes Brazil needs to invest more on young talent and build on the strengths of its go-kart program. ""Something's changed, especially in the school categories. We don't have another category after go-karts. Any way I can help ... I would do everything I can because Brazil is a very special country for motor racing,"" Massa added. Despite his fears for the future, Massa is passionate about the role Interlagos has played in his career. ""Well, I love that track. I mean, I started there. On the other side of the wall there's the go-kart track, and this side of the wall is the normal racing track for the cars. I started when I was eight in go-karts, so I spent my life there and it's a fantastic track,"" he said. These fond memories persist despite Interlagos also being the location where Massa was narrowly beaten by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton to the drivers' world title in 2008, finishing just one point behind the Englishman despite his victory. ""Even if I lost the championship there in the last corner, I won the race. I started in pole position, I did the quickest lap of the race, so everything was perfect,"" he said. ""For sure I lost the championship ... but I also had a great race in Sao Paulo and I had also a great championship as well."" Ferrari has not always been the easiest team to be a number two driver -- as Barrichello found out when he had to take a back seat to the ambitions of Michael Schumacher from 2000-05. Massa, likewise, has had second billing at Mugello since the 2010 arrival of double world champion Fernando Alonso. Team orders have often been enforced to the detriment of Massa's own goals, but he says there are no regrets over his time driving behind the ""Prancing Horse"" badge. ""For sure you always have days where you expect better results and better things, but ... I had a lot of great times with Ferrari and very good years,"" said Massa, who suffered a horrific accident in Hungary in 2009 that kept him out of the car until the following season due to serious head injuries. ""Good fights, you know, victories and some difficult days, even one big accident that I had, which was also part of my history and my life. But I think I would not change anything in my life. I am very happy and I have zero frustrations in my life,"" he added. No frustrations, maybe, but he still has an unfulfilled ambition of becoming world champion which, despite the domination of Sebastian Vettel and the Red Bulls, burns on inside his heart. Getting back in the winning habit in front of a home crowd would be a big step in the right direction. ""When I don't believe anymore, I would stop racing,"" he said. ""I mean, I really believe in myself, I know what I can do and I am really looking forward to having my championship, my title, and working on that."" Massa's bid for a ""home victory"" got off to a steady but unspectacular start Friday, claiming seventh fastest time in afternoon practice in his Ferrari, but quicker than teammate Alonso, who was 11th best. Nico Rosberg set the fastest time in both sessions for Mercedes, with four-time champion Vettel second best in the afternoon runs as he bids for his ninth straight win and 13th of the season.","Felipe Massa is lining up for his final race for Ferrari this weekend at his home circuit .

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Billy Graham's son is requesting prayers for his ailing father. Franklin Graham said that his father, who turned 95 in November, is extremely weak, but his vitals are good. ""Our family would appreciate your prayers for him that the Lord would strengthen him,"" the son wrote in a prayer request posted Tuesday on the website of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. ""Only the Lord knows what is in store as we move forward in service to Him,"" he said. The elder Graham returned home late last month, two days after he was admitted to a hospital for pulmonary-related tests and observation. He was admitted to the hospital in October for similar tests. Graham, who lives in western North Carolina, has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents, beginning with Harry S. Truman. Staging revivals that he called ""crusades"" around the world, the founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has reached untold millions of people in person. Graham began his missionary work in 1944 when he started speaking at rallies for the Youth for Christ/Campus Life ministry. Five years later, he was holding a ""crusade"" in tents in downtown Los Angeles. ""We value your prayers -- in fact, we depend on them,"" his son wrote in the request. ""We find words of comfort and praise in the psalms, 'Oh, bless our God ... and make the voice of His praise to be heard, who keeps our soul among the living, and does not allow our feet to be moved. Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for my soul. Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer.'

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The Other Hundred, a photo-book project featuring 100 photo stories of people across 91 countries, launched its first exhibition in Hong Kong on Thursday. The project takes aim at media rankings such as the Forbes Billionaire List and is instead dedicated to people whose lives deserve recognition but who would never make the cut, said Chandran Nair, creator of the project and CEO of the Global Institute For Tomorrow (GIFT), an independent pan-Asian think tank based in Hong Kong. ""The goal of The Other Hundred is both to inform and to provoke thought. The implication of many of the rich lists and articles put out by the media is that being rich is the only way to succeed or live a life of meaning. The reality is that the majority of the people are not rich and we wanted to tell their side of the story,"" Nair said. ""It's ridiculous there are such lists like the world's 100 most beautiful people when they really look nothing like me or you,"" Nair added. GIFT received 12,000 submissions from 1,500 photographers in 156 countries. Nair, together with five other judges selected 100 for the accompanying photo book, published in July. The book includes short essays by acclaimed writers, such as author Pankaj Mishra, renowned Chinese poet Bei Dao and award winning journalist Amy Goodman. While the project aimed to shed light on the unspoken majority, Nair said that it does not attempt to celebrate poverty or criticize wealth. ""We're trying to provoke people to define for themselves what it means to have a rich and fulfilled life. We're not trying to criticize those who seek material wealth, but the reality is that not everyone aspires to be rich, and not everybody can,"" Nair said. ""You can tell the world is crying out for a more nuanced look at the human condition."" One of the winning photographers, Theodore Kaye, said that he appreciated how the project also challenged the commercialization of the editorial market for professional photographers like himself. ""There's a lot of pressure to deliver what the media wants and everybody at some point is going to bow down to it,"" Kaye said. ""The project shows how life as it is for normal people and things as they truly are."" What was most important, said Nair, was photographers' connection to the photo narratives. ""We didn't want to pick the photographer who parachuted into Afghanistan and got the photo of the exotic young girl in the shadows. We want a name to put to the faces and a story to tell,"" Nair said. The exhibition will move next to Mumbai, New York, Beijing and Berlin in 2014.

"(CNN)  -- The head of the Beltran Leyva drug cartel has been captured, Mexican federal police announced. Carlos Beltran Leyva, 40, was arrested Wednesday in the northwest city of Culiacan after showing a fake driver's license with the alias ""Carlos Gamez,"" which authorities knew to look for, police said Saturday in a statement. He later admitted to his identity. Police also found at least two guns, several cartridges, cell phones and other items during the arrest. It came just two weeks after the drug boss' brother, Arturo Beltran Leyva -- known as ""El Barbas"" or ""The Bearded One"" -- was killed in a shootout in Cuernavaca, outside Mexico City.","Carlos Beltran Leyva arrested after showing fake driver's license .

"(CNN) -- As the fallout from the botched launch of Affordable Care Act's exchanges continues, it grows ever clearer that website glitches are only a small part of the problem with the cumbersome -- and increasingly unworkable -- law. One has to ask: Is President Barack Obama making this up as he goes? It's hard to imagine that the President and the team charged with implementing Obamacare couldn't have foreseen the problems that have continually popped up. Yet, here we are, bringing in ""tech surges"" to examine the website problems, security experts to mitigate privacy concerns, insurance executives to ""brainstorm"" ways to actually insure people. And all the while the President has implied he was the last to know that storm clouds were on the immediate horizon. There are two possible scenarios here: . One, the President is lying, and quite effectively. If he knew that the website wouldn't be up to snuff, or that millions of Americans would not, in fact, be able to keep their insurance plans if they liked them, then he simply made a calculation that many politicians make: Lies aren't necessarily fatal. Except when they are. Just ask Richard ""I'm not a crook"" Nixon, George ""Read my lips"" Bush, or George ""WMD"" Bush. Or two, Obama is hopelessly out of the loop. Whether it was the IRS scandal, the NSA spying program or these ACA collapses, no one in his immediate circle appears to have felt it necessary to inform the President of looming problems that he might have to answer for, let alone solve. If I were a Democrat like Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York, who recently told the New York Daily News, ""Saying you're sorry doesn't help me worth a damn at the polls,"" I might be hoping it's the former. Politicians who lie are hardly exotic. Chicanery is often merely the price of successful political salesmanship. Incompetence, on the other hand, is far more damaging to the Democratic brand. Whereas the left and much of the narrative in the popular culture have already written Republicans off as impolitic and inept, liberals, on the other hand, assert their intellectual superiority and tout their ""willingness to govern"" and get things done as party mantra. Not only is the left smarter and more sophisticated, they insist, they're also supposed to prove that government can solve problems. More pointedly, that big, unwieldy bureaucracies like the Department of Health and Human Services and the IRS can solve massive problems, like healthcare. Whether he was uninformed of or simply incurious about the potential failures, Obama's lack of preparedness and competence in implementing his signature piece of legislation not only diminishes his credibility as a problem-solver, but it jeopardizes the faith in government that liberals rely on. When government looks hapless, private-sector innovators are empowered and emboldened. For liberals, that's bad for business. Better they hope he was merely being dishonest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","S.E. Cupp: Repeated snafus in health exchange rollouts make it seem Obama's playing it by ear .

"(CNN) -- All of us as drivers have failed at one point or another to yield at a stop sign. Most of the time we get away with it. Sometimes we get stopped by the police. The punishment usually includes a court date and/or a fine. Sometimes, apparently, it can lead to something much worse. In Deming, New Mexico, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court, failing to yield can lead to ... an anal cavity search. The shocking allegations of David Eckert's complaint are worth a read, though at least the defendant-prosecutor has denied many of them. The other defendants include the arresting police officers, the hospital and doctors. Irrespective of whether the allegations are ultimately proven, this lawsuit raises some larger questions: How do police get from a traffic stop to a colonoscopy? The Fourth Amendment protects all citizens from unreasonable search and seizure by the government. It requires that the greater the intrusion upon the person, the greater must be the reason for conducting a search. Is there ever a good reason for this kind of search? The answer is yes. The police can get access to your most intimate parts and even their interiors. The law is clear: Sometimes a search of one's cavity is justified. Fortunately, police can't do this on a whim. They need what we call ""probable cause"" that that part of your body contains contraband. That means a lot more than an arbitrary hunch or guess. Then, beyond that, they have to convince a judge or a magistrate of the likelihood of contraband in your rectum, and that judge has to issue a search warrant independently -- though defense attorneys would argue this is less an independent process and more a one-sided affair. The only real way around the warrant requirement is an exigency -- that is the evidence is likely to disappear during the delay in securing a warrant. A warrant for an anal cavity search must also provide specifics on the medical procedure to be used to be reasonable. But the underlying question remains: How were the police in this case able to articulate probable cause for a rectal warrant from a traffic violation? Bad posture? According to the complaint, one of the officers noticed Eckert's ""posture to be erect and he kept his legs together."" It's often said you can read a lot into the way someone carries himself. A lot of people stand different ways. Sometimes it means you have good, militarylike bearing. Other times it means you have a strong back. To police in this case, apparently, standing erect can mean something else: You may have drugs in your anal cavity. And with that interpretation, police have a starting point for their probable cause to get that warrant. To bolster their probable cause, police also allegedly justified the ""search"" by citing Eckert's reputation. A reputation . Perhaps in school you had a friend who had a reputation for being cheap. That's one kind of reputation. To police, according to the complaint, Eckert had a reputation, too -- for carrying around drugs in his rectum. To most civilians, that doesn't even sound like a kind of reputation. To police, however, that reputation was allegedly further justification for an invasive warrant. It will be interesting to see in this litigation how substantiated this prior reputation was. How does a rumor like this get started? The police in this case also used a narcotics canine to sniff Eckert's vehicle. The canine apparently alerted police to the driver's seat of Eckert's truck. While courts have held that a police canine alert is sufficient probable cause for a drug search of a car, there is no question that the upholstery of a car seat should not be considered the same as the interior of someone's body cavity. Even a canine alert of someone's pants area should not automatically constitute probable cause for a colonoscopy warrant. The law is well-settled in this area: For a rectal search, police need a high degree of probable cause and a warrant. Persistence . Once police were armed with a warrant, Eckert's complaint alleges he was subjected to a prolonged detention, including two trips to different hospitals, two rectal searches, three enemas, two X-rays and a colonoscopy. At each stage, the complaint alleges, no drugs were found, but according to Eckert, the search continued well into the next day with increasingly invasive procedures. If anyone other than the police conducted this kind of nonconsensual physical invasion of another's rectum, based upon a posture and a reputation, they'd likely be civilly and criminally liable. But when the police physically invade your person, they often enjoy what's called ""qualified immunity"" from lawsuits. To be sure, the idea behind immunity for police action is sound: It would be a massive disincentive to law enforcement if it feared liability over every decision. Generally, police won't be liable for bad searches if they have a good argument for probable cause. Courts will consider whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that he failed to establish probable cause and that he never should have applied for the warrant. As a society, we accept that the police are empowered to invade our privacy in ways members of the public cannot. If they have the requisite probable cause and a warrant, law enforcement has the power to invade our homes, our vehicles, and -- like it or not -- our rectums. This has led many to ask whether the very people entrusted with the power to invade our bodies physically should legally be subjected to more scrutiny rather than general immunity. Members of the public who are concerned they will be subjected to this kind of cavity search as part of a routine traffic stop can probably rest easy; it appears from the face of the complaint that Eckert was someone who was on law enforcement radar for some time. Just being ""known to"" police doesn't justify a cavity search, but it assuages the average citizen that his own body is not a high-value target. But at minimum, Eckert's ordeal may make us all think twice about rolling through that next stop sign. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","New Mexico man sues, alleges traffic stop led to anal cavity search by police .

"(CNN) -- Today, the nation commemorates the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. All 278 words. Three days later, on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Americans will recall his most moving speeches, also crisp and concise. The lesson is clear: To express big ideas, use few words. New media, such as Twitter and texting, demand brevity. But brevity is also important if you're communicating as Americans did before ""tweet"" became a noun and a verb. The newest technologies reinforce the oldest technique of effective writing and speaking: Keep it simple. Although the Gettysburg Address was deceptively simple -- 10 sentences, consisting mostly of one or two-syllable words -- it communicated complex concepts. As the historian Garry Wills has written, by stressing the egalitarian ideas of the Declaration of Independence, ""Lincoln had revolutionized the Revolution, giving people a new past to live with that would change their future indefinitely."" Lincoln's new vision of ""a new nation, conceived in liberty,"" rather than a loose federation of states, foreshadowed a national government that takes the lead in protecting the rights and promoting the well-being of its citizens. Ken Burns: Learn Lincoln's words by heart . Almost a century later, President Kennedy looked to Lincoln's oratory as a model of clarity. Preparing his inaugural address, Kennedy asked his speechwriter, Theodore Sorensen, to read every previous inaugural and also the Gettysburg Address. As Sorensen later recalled, he was impressed by how ""Lincoln never used a two- or three-syllable word where a one-syllable word would do, and never used three words where one word would do."" Sorensen's early drafts reflected this lesson, and, as historians and memoirists have agreed, Kennedy's revisions made the speech sparer still. The most memorable line -- ""Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country"" -- includes only one word (used twice) longer than one syllable. Lesson from Lincoln: Mr. President, you're talking too much . Still, some despair that Twitter has dumbed-down public speech. They should re-read history. Long before Twitter, TV sound bites, telegraph dispatches and tabloid headlines all put a premium on big ideas, briefly expressed. The best way to grab someone's attention has always been to say something simply. Let's look at some of the most memorable lines from the first inaugural addresses of four 20th century presidents. Although written before Twitter, they are tweet-able: 140 or fewer characters. And they foreshadow big ideas in their presidencies. 50 years after JFK's famous 'Ich bin ein Berliner' speech . Kennedy's entire ""Ask not ..."" takes only 78 characters, yet it is credited with motivating movements from the Peace Corps to the civil rights struggle. In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" Eminently tweet-able -- only 44 characters. And he restored Americans' self-confidence, making possible the ""bold, persistent experimentation"" of the New Deal. In 1981, Ronald Reagan said, ""Government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem."" With these 72 words, he set the stage for cuts in federal taxes and social programs. In 1993, the most quoted line in Bill Clinton's inaugural was, ""There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."" The longest line of the four -- 85 characters -- but still tweet-able. As a speechwriter working on the inaugural address, I remember the sighs of relief when its relative brevity -- 14 minutes -- briefly convinced The New York Times' language maven, William Safire, that ""Clinton proved he could edit himself, a happy augur of discipline elsewhere,"" presumably in Clinton's economic and social policies. To be sure, memorable lines must be rooted in thoughtful speeches. ""Ask not,"" ""Nothing to fear,"" and ""Government is the problem"" succeeded because they were clarion calls for historic endeavors. But history is kindest to those who speak simply. As Muriel Humphrey reportedly advised her eloquent but often long-winded husband, Hubert Humphrey, in order to be immortal, a speech should not be interminable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Kusnet.","David Kusnet: The Gettysburg Address was only 278 words, JFK's best talks were brief .

"(CNN) -- It was the first major terrorist attack in history in which the group that mounted the operation used Twitter to announce to the world it was responsible. The group then quickly tweeted what its rationale was for the attack and also gave operational details of the assault -- all in real time. On Saturday a group of armed gunmen stormed the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, shooting at shoppers and mall staff with automatic weapons, killing at least 61 civilians. Several hours into the assault a Twitter account used by the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab tweeted: ""The Mujahideen ('holy warriors') entered Westgate mall today at around noon and they are still inside the mall, fighting the Kenyan kuffar ('infidels') inside their own turf."" It was the first confirmation that the attack was the work of Al-Shabaab, and journalists around the world quickly reported this. The terrorist group soon provided a tweeted explanation of its motives: ""What Kenyans are witnessing at #Westgate is retributive justice for crimes committed by their military."" The Kenyan army is part of a larger U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping operation that has recently been fighting Al-Shabaab with much success, for instance, a year ago expelling the group from one of its last strongholds, the Somali port city of Kismayo. As the attack on the Nairobi mall unfolded, Al-Shabaab tweeted, ""Since our last contact, the Mujahideen inside the mall confirmed to @HSM_Press that they killed over 100 Kenyan kuffar."" HSM_Press is the name that Al-Shabaab has used as its Twitter handle. Crucially, Al-Shabaab then explained in a tweet that the mall attack was going to be a fight to the death in which there would be no negotiations for the lives of the hostages the gunmen had taken: ""We'll not negotiate with the Kenyan govt as long as its forces are invading our country, so reap the bitter fruits of your harvest #Westgate."" This key aspect of the assault on the mall was then reported around the globe. A day into the Nairobi assault, Al-Shabaab tweeted that three Americans were involved in the attack. Since 2007 some 40 Americans have traveled to Somalia to fight with Al-Shabaab, including at least three who volunteered to become suicide bombers for the group, so this claim is not implausible and the FBI is looking into it. Indeed, whoever was live tweeting the Nairobi attack for Al-Shabaab has a command of colloquial English with a sardonic edge that you might pick up somewhere such as London or Minneapolis. During the massacre, for instance, Al-Shabaab tweeted, ""Like it or loathe it! our mujahideen confirmed all executions were point blank range!"" The group also wrote, ""#Westgate: a 14-hour standoff relayed in 1400 rounds of bullets and 140 characters of vengeance and still ongoing. Good morning Kenya!"" At one point during the mall siege, responding to media speculation that British-born Samantha Lewthwaite -- whom Kenyan authorities suspect of being a financier of jihadist militants in Kenya -- was part of the operation, Al-Shabaab took to Twitter to deny that a woman had any role: ""We have an adequate number of young men who are fully committed & we do not employ our sisters in such military operations #Westgate."" (On Thursday, Interpol issued a red notice -- an international wanted alert -- for Lewthwaite.) According to an authoritative study of Al-Shabaab's use of social media by the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, the group has been active on Twitter since December 2011, sending out a steady stream of tweets to at one point more than 15,000 followers that has included a good number of journalists and terrorism analysts. Al-Shabaab's Twitter account first used the handle @HSMPress, an acronym based on the group's full official name, Harakat Al-Shabaab Al Mujahideen (Movement of the Holy Warrior Youth). Since then Al-Shabaab has used other Twitter accounts with some slight variations on the same name such as @HSMPRESS1, @HSM_PressOffice, @HSM_PROffice and the current @HSM_PR. Al-Shabaab seems to change the name of its Twitter account as it gets taken down, likely because the account is in violation of Twitter's terms of service, which explicitly explains that users cannot ""publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others."" It's impossible to tell definitively if all the tweets on Al-Shabaab's purported accounts are really from the group, but the tone and content of the tweets have generally been consistent over the past two years, and information that the group has tweeted about the Nairobi mall attack, such as its responsibility for the assault and its unwillingness to negotiate for the release of hostages, has, unfortunately, proved to be accurate. An analyst who has tracked Al-Shabaab's Twitter feed carefully is J.M. Berger, the author of a book about Americans fighting overseas for groups such Al-Shabaab titled ""Jihad Joe."" Berger has filed a number of reports with Twitter that Al-Shabaab is in violation of its terms of service. Twitter doesn't comment on why it suspends a particular account -- a representative told CNN, ""we don't comment on individual Twitter accounts, for security and privacy reasons"" -- but clearly Al-Shabaab is egregiously violating those terms of service, and during the Nairobi attack the group had to use five different Twitter handles as its account kept getting taken down, presumably by Twitter employees. Since Tuesday, Al-Shabaab has tweeted at its newest site and, as of this writing, it had more than 5,000 followers and had tweeted some 40 times. Berger says that Al-Shabaab militants have also taken to Twitter in recent weeks during other smaller-scale operations: ""They have also tweeted bombing attacks on Mogadishu and attempts to assassinate Somalia's president within the last several weeks."" On Wednesday Al-Shabaab posted via Twitter audio of a short speech by its leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, crowing over the attacks and congratulating the ""holy warriors"" who carried out the Nairobi operation. He gloated, ""The attack has also glaringly illuminated the sheer vulnerability of the different sections of the Kenyan forces, be they police, intelligence or the military. ... It's a disaster for the Western politicians and their intelligence apparatuses who have miserably failed to save their own citizens. "" Abu Zubayar also goes by the name Ahmed Abdi Godane, and a U.S. official has told CNN the belief is he ordered the Nairobi operation. The fact that on Wednesday Al-Shabaab posted to Twitter a speech by Abu Zubayar taking ownership of the operation would seem to confirm that belief. In 1974 terrorism analyst Brian Jenkins wrote an influential paper for Rand in which he made a key observation in the then-fledgling field of terrorism studies. ""Terrorism is theater,"" Jenkins wrote, explaining that the real point of a terrorist attack is not the violence that is visited on its victims but the large number of people watching the event that serves to advertise the terrorists' cause. A decade later British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave a speech in which she made a similar point, declaring that terrorists depend on ""the oxygen of publicity."" Nothing had underlined this better than the Munich Olympics in 1972 during which 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists. All the Israelis were killed either by the hostage takers or during the course of a botched rescue operation. The hostage-taking was covered by TV networks from around the world who came to cover the games but ended up providing coverage of a terrorist event that unfolded before the first truly global audience for such an attack. More than any other single event, it brought the Palestinian cause to the world's attention. On 9/11 untold hundreds of millions around the world watched the attacks as they happened in New York and near Washington on live television. Osama bin Laden himself listened to live coverage of the attacks on BBC Arabic radio in his hideout in Afghanistan. The 9/11 attacks, which took place in the city that is many ways the capital of global media, thrust bin Laden and his terrorist group al Qaeda onto the world stage in a spectacular manner. But in neither the Munich Olympics hostage-taking nor on 9/11 did the terrorists have actual control over the content of the coverage, which was instead determined by those media networks covering the event. So what we saw unfold in the attack on the mall in Kenya is something quite new: a terrorist group shaping the media coverage of the event in real time through the medium of Twitter. The next logical step will be for terrorists to cover their deadly operations using their own real-time live video feeds linked to sites such as Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. If that happens, terrorist attacks will become a form of theater in which terrorists not only get to write the play but also act as the primary producers of the coverage of the event. A dark glimpse of this brave new world could already be seen in Al-Shabaab's assault on the Nairobi mall. Unfortunately, that may not be the end of Shabaab's terror attacks outside Somalia. On Thursday Shabaab posted the following chilling tweet: ""The mesmeric performance by the #Westgate Warriors was undoubtedly gripping, but despair not folks, that was just the premiÃ¨re of Act 1.""","Peter Bergen: Kenya was first major attack in which terrorists provided Twitter commentary .
Terrorism has always been about theater, but use of social media takes it further, he says .
Bergen says Al-Shabaab's tweets were a way for the group to shape media coverage ."
"Glasgow, Scotland (CNN) -- There is a feeling of palpable shock in the Merchant district of Glasgow after a police helicopter crashed into a the Clutha bar, which was packed with about 150 people. The accident, which killed at least nine people and left at least 14 seriously injured, happened in a bustling part of the city, where the drinks are served strong and the nightlife goes late. What's been remarkable are the stories of how people behaved on the night. There are no tales of people pushing and climbing over each other to get out. Rather the opposite is true -- those inside set up chain gangs to move debris, helping the injured get out. Passerby including a local Member of Parliament rushed towards the danger to help out. Next to the crash site is the local Holiday Inn, which has remained open throughout. It makes an odd sight: cranes and rescue workers digging through the debris of the collapsed pub while guests at the hotel drag their bags up and down the closed roads passing the media and having their names checked by the police to get back in the hotel. The Clutha was a pub everyone knew and loved with a feeling of community. One man who was there on Friday night came to lay flowers, his head fully bandaged, and with cuts on his face from injuries he received in the crash. Moira, who turned up to lay flowers at the scene of the crash, told me she would regularly go there to hang out and hear music. She had decided not to go last Friday night. All weekend Glaswegians have been coming to get as close as they can to see the crash site with the helicopter rotors just sticking out from the roof. And in the streets around the pub the police continue to go door to door asking finding out what people may have seen. The locals are calling this unthinkable and even those who were nowhere near the site are dazed when they come here and see what happened. There is now the slow, painstaking work of removing the helicopter from the pub, piece by piece. So far the rotors have been dismantled and now they are planning how to lift the body of the aircraft out of the building. It is dangerous since the slightest wrong move could bring down the rest of the building and potentially injure the rescuers. The Chief Constable of Police Scotland summed up this tragedy. Paraphrasing he said imagine the scene, you are having a drink and a good night out when a helicopter crashes through the roof. This is the awfulness of what happened here: the very ordinary suddenly became out of this world.","Locals in Glasgow stunned by crash of a police helicopter into a busy pub .

"Washington (CNN) -- White House veteran John Podesta has an impressive Rolodex, deep policy expertise, and an invaluable background as a political strategist and Washington fixer -- all things that could benefit President Barack Obama as he assumes a top-level advisory role. Podesta, who served as former President Bill Clinton's chief of staff during the last tumultuous three years of his presidency, announced via Twitter that he is joining the White House during a critical time in the Obama's tenure. He plans to stay for a year as presidential counselor. Obama faces record low approval ratings as he winds up the first year of his second term. The disastrous roll out of the Affordable Care Act, his signature domestic achievement, an economy still not working for millions of Americans, fallout over NSA spying, and criticism of his diplomatic responses to Syria and Iran, have all weighed him down with the public. 'Peripheral vision' Podesta's hire, which has been confirmed by CNN but not yet announced by the White House, is seen as a politically necessary step for a White House back on its heels and at times criticized as inexperienced. Andy Card, who has seen -- and managed -- the inner workings of an administration as a Cabinet member and a White House chief of staff, said Obama is making a good decision by allowing fresh perspective into his inner circle of close-knit advisers, although he said it should have happened earlier. ""It's important for the President to allow peripheral vision in so you don't get stuck with the same old tunnel vision,"" Card told CNN, cautioning that it's easy for Presidents and their staff to become trapped by their own ideology and emotional attachment to issues and policy. Should Obama get credit for the economy? Card left the George W. Bush White House after 5Â½ years. He said most reelected presidents have faced similar obstacles at about the same point in their second terms. Ronald Reagan got bogged down by the Iran-Contra scandal, Bill Clinton faced impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky affair and George W. Bush suffered backlash over Hurricane Katrina and the ongoing Iraq War. ""I can't think of a sitting president ... that didn't have these challenges and didn't address it the same way,"" Card said. He said he used to tell Bush that policy changes cannot be the only way to fix a problem facing the administration. ""I would remind the President that if you address a policy concern but you haven't changed personalities, the public doesn't see it,"" Card said. Because the media is talking about Podesta's arrival signals that this change might be significant enough to actually make a difference, he noted. Liberal left . Jim Manley, former communications director for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said Podesta will help Obama overcome some hurdles. ""It's a step toward getting the administration back on its feet again,"" he said. After his three-year stint as Clinton's top aide, Podesta built the think tank Center for American Progress, which became a powerhouse of liberal thought and communications. And just weeks ago, he launched the Washington Center for Equitable Growth to focus on income inequality, which was around the same time Obama began talking about the issue from the bully pulpit. ""Podesta's one of the great progressive strategists of his generation,"" Bill Burton, former Obama communications adviser, said. ""Having him at the White House is a great thing for folks who really care about some of the key fights for folks on the left."" Podesta, who led the President's transition team in 2008, has also been a leading advocate of policies to address climate change, an Obama policy priority that has gone nowhere during his time in office. Link to Congress . Podesta has the expertise to take the climate change issue and income inequality into greater prominence during the next year as he is thought to have good relationships with members of Congress. ""There are probably some people on Capitol Hill who are saying, 'Oh, finally,' "" Card said. Senate Republicans still angry over filibuster change . But Manley said a better working relationship with a sharply partisan Congress could be a heavy lift, even for the politically astute Podesta, and especially as the President enters his lame duck years. There's always executive action. And that's a tool at Obama's disposal with which Podesta has familiarity. He worked with Clinton during his lame duck years when Republicans in Congress were trying to force him out of office. Ron Brownstein, CNN senior political analyst and National Journal editorial director, said Podesta will help Obama work his will ""through the levers of the executive branch"" where he is ""more likely to make a mark"" in the final years. Whether it's fixing problems or promoting new priorities, Podesta is widely respected in Washington and might have the gravitas to right the president's ship. ""They've got a lot of work to do,"" Manley said. CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this story .","John Podesta served as President Bill Clinton's chief of staff during tumultuous time .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- It's late afternoon on a recent Friday when Shree McKinley walks past the Women's Medical Society. Making her way toward a large picture window, she peers inside the shuttered medical clinic, cupping her hand on the glass to block the glaring sun. Backing away, she gasps at a series of petite baby hands made of plaster fastened to the windowsill. ""That is sad,"" she said. ""But I guess it's the memory of the little kids that never made it."" McKinley said she was a patient of Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia physician who was accused of killing babies born after attempted abortions in the sixth, seventh, and eighth months of their mothers' pregnancies at his Pennsylvania clinic, while operating in dangerous, deplorable conditions. Gosnell carried out those killings in a particularly brutal manner: using scissors to cut the babies' spinal cords. He also was charged in the death of a 41-year-old woman during an abortion procedure. He was found guilty Monday of three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of the babies, and involuntary manslaughter for the woman's death. The grisly allegations in the case -- dirty procedure rooms, blood-stained and weathered equipment, babies born alive, breathing and crying, and unlicensed staff administering anesthesia -- shocked the nation and prompted McKinley to rethink what she went through six years ago. Gosnell horror fuels fight for abortion laws . The 36-year-old now wonders if maybe her child was born alive and had its neck snipped. ""I try not to think about it. But I think about it, and it's sad. I wish I never did it,"" she said. ""If I would have known what I know now, I never would have had an abortion."" McKinley, now a mother, said she was approximately six months pregnant at the time Gosnell performed her abortion, which was not part of the criminal case against him. CNN could not independently verify McKinley's account. It's illegal to perform an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy in the state of Pennsylvania. Generally, most doctors will not perform abortions after 20 weeks, Philadelphia district attorney Seth Williams said following Gosnell's arrest in January 2011. Prosecutors say Gosnell, who is not certified to perform abortions, falsified gestational ages on records. ""This doctor gained the reputation far and wide that he'd perform abortions at any time,"" Williams said. Struggling with the idea of having a child, McKinley ultimately decided to terminate her pregnancy. So one evening, her father escorted her to Gosnell's crowded and unkempt clinic in West Philadelphia for the procedure. Opinion: Gosnell case shows why abortion rights need protection . ""He seemed like he was a helpful person,"" she said of Gosnell, adding that her abortion cost $1,600. ""I didn't have (all) the money up front. So I was able to give him partial money and come back and pay the rest off in payment plans."" Although unaware of the salacious allegations that later surfaced during the investigation of the clinic, McKinley said she felt ""uncomfortable"" and ""scared"" at the doctor's office. ""All the equipment was old, it was rusty. It looked like stuff from back in the 70s. And it was dirty,"" she said. ""But I had to, you know, at the time, I had to do what I had to do."" During the trial, prosecutors accused Gosnell of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some having litter boxes and animals present during operations; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. Gosnell's defense attorney Jack McMahon maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. The conviction on three counts of first-degree murder mean Gosnell, who is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist, could be sentenced to death. ""He deserves to die,"" McKinley said.","Shree McKinley says Kermit Gosnell performed an abortion on her years ago .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta resigned Friday after less than a year in office, according to a statement released by the Italian presidential palace. The country's President, Giorgio Napolitano, has accepted the resignation, the statement reads. Letta, of the center-left Democratic Party, announced Thursday that he would be standing down, plunging the country into fresh political uncertainty. He's likely to be replaced by Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi, a rising political star who won the party's primary a couple of months ago. Letta's decision followed a Democratic Party meeting at which Renzi said a change of government was needed, in order to bring about reforms and stay in power through 2018. The party then officially asked Letta to recognize the need to start a new phase, implying that he should resign. There has been growing disillusionment with Letta in the past couple of months, with many feeling that reforms are moving too slowly and that he is failing to act decisively. Renzi probably will be asked to form a government by Napolitano but it's not yet clear whether he will be easily able to do so. He has alienated many people on the left in his party but, as a perhaps more centrist leader, he has been able to pick up some disgruntled supporters of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Letta was sworn in last April at the head of a coalition government, formed after about three months of uncertainty following inconclusive elections. Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, has had more than its share of political turmoil over recent years. The last election to produce a leader was in 2008, when Berlusconi became Prime Minister for a third time. Since then, all the country's leaders have been appointed. Berlusconi, a billionaire tycoon who has dominated Italian politics for two decades, was the last elected leader. He resigned in late 2011 after coming under pressure for Italy's economic woes. Berlusconi was subsequently expelled from parliament after his conviction for tax fraud and can no longer run for office. CNN's Hada Messia and journalist Barbie Latza Nadeau reported from Rome, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta tenders his resignation .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- The incumbent Basque nationalists won the most seats in Basque regional parliamentary elections on Sunday, but they could lose a 29-year hold on power because three non-nationalist parties won a combined majority for the first time, according to official election results. Socialist candidate Patxi Lopez speaks to reporters after voting Sunday in regional parliamentary elections. The vote for the powerful 75-seat regional parliament and Basque president are seen as a bellwether of the region's sentiment on how to end decades of violence by the Basque separatist group ETA. The moderate Basque Nationalist Party won 30 seats, and its traditional smaller party allies won seven more. But the crucial 38-seat majority went to the Basque branches of Spain's ruling Socialist Party, with 24 seats; the conservative Popular Party, with 13 seats; and the new Progressive Union and Democracy party, with one seat, according to official results. The Socialist candidate, Patxi Lopez, told supporters the vote ""legitimized"" his bid to ""lead the change."" Negotiations with other parties to make Lopez the next Basque president were expected in the coming days. The non-nationalist parties have taken a forceful line on trying to end ETA's violence, blamed for nearly 800 deaths. ETA stands for Euskadi ta Askatasuna, or ""Basque Homeland and Liberty"" in the Basque language. The group wants an independent Basque homeland, but is classified as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States, because of car bombings and fatal shootings. The Basque Nationalist Party seeks self-determination for the 2.1 million Basques but does not support ETA's violence. Some 600 ETA suspects or convicts are in Spanish jails, and three alleged top leaders of the group were arrested last year. But ETA has continued to defy officials -- bomb attacks, including a major blast that damaged a construction company office in Madrid three weeks ago, continue to be attributed to the group. For the first time, political parties linked to ETA were banned from running in the Basque elections. Spanish courts in recent years outlawed a leftist party called Batasuna, and others, saying they secretly and actively aided ETA. One such party holds nine seats in the outgoing parliament. The incumbent Basque president and nationalist leader, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, scolded the Socialists and the conservatives during the campaign as being outsiders and puppets of their national offices in Madrid. But Lopez, the Basque Socialist leader, accused the Basque nationalists of trying to divide the Basques, between those who favor self-determination and those who prefer to remain firmly a part of Spain. The Basques want ""dialogue and a change of course,"" Lopez said. He has vowed to govern for all Basques, and Spain's Socialist Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, campaigned in the Basque region to support Lopez. For years, Socialist and conservative politicians, even low-level town councilors, in the Basque region have been protected by police or private bodyguards due to ETA death threats. Several have been killed nonetheless. But this year, the Basque nationalist party also has come under ETA attack. ETA violence is a regular feature of Basque and Spanish elections. Earlier this week, a predawn bomb attributed to ETA heavily damaged a new Socialist party clubhouse in the Basque town of Lazkao. The next day, the son of a former Socialist councilman there allegedly swung a heavy mallet to smash the glass windows and damage a social club linked to leftist pro-independence supporters. That man reportedly has now fled the town. An ETA statement on Friday, issued to the Basque newspaper Gara, called Sunday's elections ""anti-democratic"" and predicted they would result in a ""fascist parliament."" Spain's economic crisis was somewhat less an issue in the relatively prosperous Basque region -- heavy on industry and services -- which still has slim economic growth and an unemployment rate of 8 percent, compared with the national average of nearly 14 percent. The three-province Basque region, whose largest city is Bilbao, has extensive home-rule powers, including a regional police force that is involved in the fight against ETA, control of education and health care, and tax collection. Elsewhere on Sunday, in Spain's northwest Galicia region, the opposition conservatives won a majority in the Galicia regional parliament. They will dislodge the leftist governing coalition, led by the Galicia branch of Spain's Socialist Party. The defeat was seen as blow to Prime Minister Zapatero.","Elections held for 75-seat regional parliament in Spain's Basque region .

"Krokos, Greece (CNN) -- It's a meticulous harvest which forbids the use of a spade, let alone tractors. Crouched deep within a field full of purple crocuses, groups of villagers come together every year for a back-breaking fortnight, harvesting saffron. With great precision, and grubby fingernails, flowers containing the rare, precious spice are snapped away from the stems and dropped inside white buckets.

"(EW.com ) -- Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave is an agonizingly magnificent movie: the first great big-screen dramatization of slavery. Based on actual events, it begins in 1841 and tells the story of a free black man from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a musician named Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who walks around in a natty gray suit, secure in the courtly modesty of his life as a husband and father of two. But then he accepts an offer to go to Washington, D.C., with a pair of traveling entertainers, and when they're out at a restaurant drinking wine, we get the queasy feeling this is too good to be true. It is. Solomon isn't being hired for his talents. He's being trafficked. He wakes up in a cold, stark prison cell, with a spiderweb of chains shackling his arms and legs. The traffickers have drugged him and are sending him down to Louisiana, where he'll be sold into slavery. Gazing at his chains as if he were in a bad dream he simply has to wake up from, the brilliant Chiwetel Ejiofor places us right inside Solomon's skin, and instantly we're sharing the horror this man's life has become. Ejiofor may have the most eloquent eyes of any actor now working. They are orbs of pure expression, and in this movie they need to be because Solomon can rarely speak what he's feeling. What we read in his intensely private thousand-yard stare is the agony of a man robbed of freedom, but also the renunciation of despair. Whatever happens, he will persevere and survive. He will know misery, but he will not fall into the trap of madness. He will transcend. The scalding power of McQueen's artistry begins with this: He uses the fact that Solomon wasn't born into human bondage to draw us into the experience of slavery. Solomon has to learn to answer insults or bear whippings with silence, to pretend he's a toady who can't read or write, and the cruelty of that process becomes the film's way of dramatizing the unnaturalness of slavery. Is it just Solomon who's really a free man? No, every slave is. 12 Years a Slave is based on a book Northup wrote about his ordeal, and McQueen, working from a superb script by John Ridley, has structured the film as a diarylike series of incidents. There are no trumped-up arcs to pad out what we're watching. The crushing reality of Solomon's day-to-day existence is all the drama the film needs. Solomon's first slave owner (Benedict Cumberbatch) reveals a few humane instincts — as much as a slave owner's behavior can be called ''humane.'' But then, after showing too much pride, Solomon gets sold off to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a seething plantation owner who's a kind of diabolical psychologist of sadism. He can see the fire in Solomon's heart and is driven to break him. When he learns that Solomon has tried to get a white laborer to send a letter north, he holds Solomon's face close, saying he knows what's going on, and Solomon defuses the situation with an ingenious lie that he must sustain for minutes on end, without a tremor, staring his overseer right in his taunting eye. This is virtuoso filmmaking that lays bare the degraded relationships with a terrifying intimacy. Edwin has a consuming obsession with Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), the slave who picks more cotton each day than any other slave (500 pounds of it) and whom he regularly rapes. Their ''relationship'' becomes part of a debased triangle, since Edwin's wife (Sarah Paulson) is aware of his fixation. Due to her jealousy, and to Edwin's disgust at his own desires, Patsey is subjected to the torments of hell. Lupita Nyong'o's performance is shattering. She goes to a place of private terror and communion beyond pain. When Edwin is whipping Patsey, McQueen plays a startling trick: He holds on the image of Edwin brandishing the whip — a Hollywood cliché — and then, as we're lulled into that familiar ''it's only a movie'' mode, the camera, without a cut, spins around to show the obscene violence of the whipping. The mortification of flesh hits us in the solar plexus. It's Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds 12 Years a Slave together. He gives Solomon a deep inner strength, yet he never softens the nightmare of his existence. His ultimate pain isn't the beatings or the humiliation. It's being ripped from his family, blockaded away from all he is. 12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments it's hard to watch, yet it's a film of such emotion that in telling the story of a life that gets taken away, it lets us touch what life is.

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Iran appears keen to progress swiftly toward a deal reining back its nuclear program in return for relief from international sanctions that have crippled its economy, a senior U.S. administration official said Wednesday. She was speaking on the eve of a fresh round of talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Geneva between the five permanent -- and nuclear-armed -- members of the U.N. Security Council, along with Germany and Iran. ""For the first time, we believe Iran is ready to move this process forward quickly. For the first time, we're not seeing them just use this as a way of buying time,"" the senior U.S. administration official told journalists in a background briefing. ""I do see a potential for the outline of a first step. It can be written on a piece of paper or probably more than one. I hope this can be sooner rather than later,"" she added, declining to answer questions whether that outline deal may be reached before the weekend. Opinion: Do we want a deal or a war? Iran has consistently said its nuclear program is strictly for peaceful, civilian use and power generation. The United States accuses Iran of covertly developing a nuclear bomb. In its latest quarterly report published in August, the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency suggested Iran's nuclear program had ""possible military dimensions."" The United States and its negotiating partners -- Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany -- are looking to work out a two-phase deal with Iran, according to the official. So far, negotiators from all parties have declined to spell out specifics of any potential deal. However, the senior U.S. administration official spelled out that Iran would be required to take action regarding its nuclear program first in exchange for some initial relief from the international sanctions that have targeted Iran's key oil sector and banking operations. Once that was in place, all sides would continue talking about what she termed a ""final deal."" ""We're looking for a first step that stops Iran's nuclear program moving forward for the first time in decades and that rolls parts of it back,"" the senior U.S. administration official said. ""We're prepared to offer limited, targeted and reversible sanctions relief. We're not talking about changing the architecture of sanctions in this first step,"" she explained. Sanctions have hit oil output hard . In just the past two years, oil experts estimate international sanctions have forced Iran to cut its crude oil output from around 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to less than 900,000 barrels a day last year. Sanctions imposed on its banking sector and foreign currency exchange have also made it tough for Iran to pump earnings from its oil sales back into its economy at home, sparking a currency devaluation, inflation, unemployment and recession, economic analysts say. The senior U.S. administration official speaking in Geneva attributed Iran's new willingness to compromise on its nuclear aspirations -- seen since this summer's election of President Hassan Rouhani -- to the severity of those sanctions. ""We support sanctions. Sanctions have been instrumental on Iran coming to the table, to change the strategic calculus of Iran,"" she said. Such comments, however, seem likely to irritate Iran's negotiating team. Despite coming to the talks table, Teheran maintains its right to a peaceful, civilian nuclear program, including uranium enrichment. In comments published via Twitter in late September before previous talks, one of Iran's lead negotiators, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, wrote: ""Pres. Obama's presumption that Iran is negotiating because of his illegal threats and sanctions is disrespectful of a nation, macho and wrong."" The U.S. Senate is due to debate a bill proposing stiffer new sanctions on Iran, including measures that could cut its oil output further. But the senior U.S. administration official said the government had asked Congress to hold off on a vote for now. ""We have asked Congress to pause (in its consideration of wider sanctions), not indefinitely and not a long pause. Our diplomatic strategy must be in synch with Congress,"" she said. What the negotiators want from Iran . The parties involved have steadfastly refused to detail their negotiating stances publicly. But political analysts say some of the key demands from the P5+1 revolve around Iran temporary halting all uranium enrichment activities and shipping stockpiles of more highly enriched uranium abroad for safekeeping. The United States and its international partners also want to impose a comprehensive inspections regime on all Iran's nuclear-related facilities. Especially concerning are an underground enrichment plant at Fordo, near the holy city of Qom, that they believe could be a military facility, and a heavy water reactor at Arak, which weapons experts warn could be used to process weapons-grade plutonium. For its part, Iran wants an end to the economic and political sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. In comments reported by Iran's state-run Press TV this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, also scheduled to play a lead role in this week's talks, sounded caution on prospects for a deal. ""We have a tough road ahead. In Geneva, we will get into the details of the steps, and we hope to bring closer the views of both sides, which are [currently] far apart,"" Araqchi said. Iran's supreme leader 'not optimistic' about nuclear talks . The senior U.S. administration official acknowledged differences between the sides but sounded more optimistic. ""There are gaps between the two sides, which remain quite real. We're coming to understand each other and to understand what the equation looks like,"" she said. Enough processed uranium for a nuclear bomb? In parallel with its talks with the P5+1 group, Iranian officials have been meeting separately with IAEA representatives to try and allay their fears about Iran's nuclear program. According to the IAEA's August report, since declaring its nuclear facilities, Iran has enriched just less than 10 metric tonnes of uranium to 5% purity, the grade used for energy generation. The IAEA estimates Iran has enriched around 370 kilograms to 20% purity, further processing part of that for medical and research purposes and stockpiling about 185 kilograms. Some weapons experts suggest Iran could enrich enough uranium -- at 90% purity -- for a single nuclear bomb within months. Others argue it could take more than a year. All appear to agree that so far, Iran has not shown signs of developing a weapons system to deliver such a warhead. Iran says it has no desire to build a bomb. Five of the nations negotiating in Geneva have nuclear weapons. According to the Washington-based Arms Control Association, the United States has around 5,000 nuclear warheads, Russia has around 4,500, the United Kingdom an estimated 225, China around 240 and France around 300 warheads. Israel, which is neither a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty nor has declared its own nuclear program, is estimated to have as many as 200 warheads, according to the ACA.

"(CNN) -- Sochi has been preparing for an Olympics invasion -- but perhaps it didn't expect a former Soviet soldier to be leading the charge. At least on this occasion, Sandis Ozolins wasn't armed with a Kalashnikov rifle when he marched into Russia. This time, the 41-year-old skated into Sochi holding the Latvian flag and an ice hockey stick -- not to mention the memories of a Stanley Cup triumph in his bag. Not bad for a man who only realized he'd been given the opportunity of a lifetime to become a star in the glitz and glamor of the National Hockey League while serving in the Soviet army back in 1991. ""Somebody came with the newspaper and showed me,"" Ozolins tells CNN's Human to Hero series of his time in the barracks. ""I had no idea I was going to be drafted -- I didn't know what the draft was. That came as a big surprise again and the team was the first-year team in the NHL, San Jose Sharks. ""I didn't even know where it was! I thought it was somewhere in Latin America -- my association was completely off! ""Then afterward when I found out what the draft meant and I found out who the team was, I started realizing, 'OK, this is something happening.' ""What's going to happen? How is this all going to work out? I had no clue but it worked out pretty good for me."" To say it worked out ""pretty good"" would be an understatement given Ozolins' achievements. During a 15-year U.S. career, he won the NHL's biggest prize -- the Stanley Cup -- with the Colorado Avalanche and played in seven NHL All-Star Games. Ozolins scored 167 goals in 875 NHL appearances and made 397 assists with franchises also including Carolina Hurricanes, Florida Panthers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and New York Rangers. It was at Colorado where Ozolins enjoyed his most successful time. Top of his achievements was helping the Avalanche defeat Florida Panthers in the 1996 final of the Stanley Cup -- a series which his side won in emphatic fashion 4-0. Even now, some 18 years later, the memory of that day remains fresh, although his memento of the day, his winner's ring, has since managed to disappear. ""That was the peak of the whole thing and, of course, I was young and I thought it's going to continue like that for many, many years,"" recalls Ozolins. ""I thought I was going to have a whole collection of these Stanley Cups but in reality, it worked out a little bit different."" Ozolins suffered heartbreak the following year when the Avalanche was defeated in the Conference playoff final by Detroit Red Wings. After starting skating at the age of five, it was not until he was 15 that the lure of ice hockey become irresistible. A number of appearances for the Soviet junior national side followed before army service intervened. From there it was on to America, where his early success ended up earning Ozolins a $25 million deal with Carolina Hurricanes in 2000. However, he failed to shine in Carolina and moved on to Florida Panthers in January 2002 before ending up at Anaheim Ducks 12 months later. He reached the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals but the Ducks lost 4-3 to the New Jersey Devils, then a serious knee injury wrecked his time in California and he was traded to the New York Rangers in March 2006. It was there that his off-rink problems began -- he was forced to enter the league's substance abuse program after being found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol. After taking a year out to deal with his demons, he took up a 12-month deal in a return to San Jose -- but after that rejected the chance to play a further season with the Los Angeles Kings, and instead returned to Latvia in 2009. But that was not to prove the end of his career -- far from it. ""I took a year off in hockey and basically, I thought I was retired,"" he recalls. ""That's how I understood it but it turned out that I only took a year off and then the general manager of Dinamo Riga gave me a call and asked when I was thinking about coming home and playing for the team. ""I told him, 'Give me two weeks, I'll let you know.' So during those two weeks, I started training again and I wanted to see if I wanted to play. ""I wanted to play on a level where I wouldn't just be a mascot on a team but able to contribute on the ice. ""After two weeks I said, 'OK, I can do it,' and it was like coming home. That's where I began my career, my professional career. It's my childhood, this is my home."" Now back playing in the Kontinental Hockey League with Dinamo Riga, Ozilins is hoping to help his home country impress on the international stage. As a true veteran of the game, this may be the final time he gets to compete in front of billions watching across the globe. Latvia is not expected to challenge for a medal at the Sochi Games but the opportunity to appear at the Olympics for a third time is something which Ozolins says he will relish for the rest of his life -- especially after being Latvia's flag bearer at last week's opening ceremony. ""For us to go to Sochi, I only realized when we qualified how much it meant not just to us but also for the people that were at the arena and the whole country,"" he says. ""We're going to have all these experiences, Olympic experiences. It's indescribable how much energy you get from that. ""Being with the best winter athletes in the world at the time, in the same village, eating lunch next to figure skaters, skiers or bobsled teams, it's -- especially for younger guys but even for me -- it's so much. ""If winning trophies and cups on a club level is one thing, then Olympics is more of a national pride. It's more being there for your country and representing your country.""","Sandis Ozolins carried the Latvian flag at the Sochi Games .

"(CNN) -- Preparations are under way on India's east coast ahead of Saturday's expected landfall of a massive cyclone now gathering strength in the Bay of Bengal. Tropical Cyclone Phailin is expected to make landfall somewhere near the border of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh states in India. The cyclone, which is packing sustained winds of 155 mph (about 250 kph), with gusts of up to 190 mph, could hit densely populated areas that are vulnerable to flooding. Roughly 80,000 people have been evacuated from low-lying areas in the region, with many leaving on foot or by bicycle, said Kamal Lochan Mishra, the Odisha Disaster Management Authority deputy general. Evacuations are continuing, he said. Some fear a repeat of what happened on October 29, 1999, when Cyclone 05B, also known as the Odisha Cyclone, made landfall in the same area, causing the loss of more than 10,000 lives. The strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the Bay of Bengal, it packed winds of 155 mph at landfall and caused more than $2 billion in damage. Phailin may be less intense than that at landfall and is likely to weaken as it moves on shore, but will still bring storm surges and dump heavy rainfall on inland areas in its path. The India Meteorological Department warns that Phailin is a ""very severe cyclonic storm"" and urges the evacuation of coastal areas. The storm will bring gale-force winds and a storm surge that may reach about 10 feet (3 meters) above the usual tide level and could inundate low-lying areas of the Odisha's Ganjam, Khurda, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts and the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh during landfall, it said. Rainfall, some of it very heavy, is expected in coastal Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh starting Friday evening, its forecast said. By Saturday evening, inland areas of Odisha and west Bengal state will also get heavy rainfall, it said. Seas off the coast of Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh are expected to become extremely rough as the cyclone approaches. Fishing operations are suspended, and all fishermen are advised to return to shore. The meteorological department warns of extensive damage to so-called kutcha houses, those made of flimsy materials such as mud and bamboo, as well as some damage to old buildings. Power and communication lines are likely to suffer large-scale disruption. Extensive flooding will also disrupt rail and road traffic, and crops are likely to suffer major damage, it said. People in affected areas may be at risk from flying debris, as well as the flooding of escape routes. Residents are advised to stay indoors as the cyclone makes landfall, the forecast said.","NEW: Roughly 80,000 people have been evacuated, an official says .

"(CNN) -- When photography first became a method to document events, both large and small, more than a century ago, there was a certain understanding that what one was seeing in a picture was more or less what happened. The ability to use photography to recount life in a visual way and replicate it in the mass media allowed people around the world to see and understand things they may only have imagined before. The ""truth"" of photography, embodied by the phrase ""the camera doesn't lie,"" was something that came to be generally accepted. Yet the camera, like most tools used by people, is more than capable of lying if used in the wrong way. A picture is simply a moment, and although we might think we can divine what it is we are looking at, there are times when a visual representation of life is simply neither the whole truth, nor nothing but the truth. Increasingly, with the ubiquitous arrival of smartphones, what matters most is simply that someone, not necessarily a trained professional, was able to take a photograph by the simple fact that he or she was present. According to an old press photography saw, when a long-time pro was asked how he made a picture, he replied ""f/8, and be there,"" capturing the essence of what news photography is really about. It is the ability to witness, and capture, a moment in time. Does it always tell the ""truth?"" That is a good question, since what we define as truth can sometimes have many meanings. If a picture is meant to be the sole, definitive description of what happened, and no one else is around to see, then to a certain degree, we might have to accept its veracity. But the ever-increasing presence of cameras, both traditional and camera phones, has added a new dimension to what we see. And with the invention and perfection of Photoshop and other photo editing software, it has become much easier to add to, take away from, or alter an image to change its very nature. Can the camera lie? Not sure. Can photographers or editors lie? Most assuredly, if they are of a mind to. The photograph of President Obama taking a ""selfie"" with the British and Danish prime ministers is a case in point. Many news organizations and social media platforms jumped on the bandwagon to showcase the photographs where Michelle Obama is looking away, with what could be considered an angry expression. Yet those pictures may not necessarily tell the whole story. The AFP photographer who took the photos wrote a blog describing how surprised he was at the reaction to them. And though he released no photos showing the first lady looking more light-hearted, he says, the glum look in the published pictures was simply a moment ""captured by chance."" A photojournalist covering an event will take dozens, sometimes hundreds, of pictures in the process. For large-scale events -- the Olympics, political conventions -- often the photographer doesn't even get to edit his own pictures, that job being handed off to an editor. In the digital, WiFi, connected age, this becomes the efficient way of getting work processed and out into the real world. In the end, as viewers, we have to try to sift through not only what we are seeing, but try to understand what we are not seeing. The growth of social media and the concept of so-called ""citizen-journalists,"" has created a real quandary for the older forms of media and news delivery. Most professional journalists, both photographers and writers, try to adhere to a code of fairness and objectivity. In the United States, it's only in the last generation that politically charged, partisan reporting has started to become the norm. It may seem old-fashioned to think that the light of truth is the most important force for good. But that is the place where most professional photographers stand. When you decide on your message first, and then try to make the reporting adjust to it, you have created a place where truth becomes the first casualty. And if you ask it to, the camera -- like the people who use it -- can certainly lie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Burnett.","David Burnett: People used to believe that photojournalism depicted the truth .

"New York (CNN) -- Three members of two popular Iranian indie bands who were living and working in the United States were shot and killed in Brooklyn early Monday by a fellow rocker who then turned the gun on himself, police said. The dead included Soroush Farazmand, 27, whose rock band the Yellow Dogs was featured in a 2009 CNN report about Iran's burgeoning underground rock scene. Police found the guitarist dead from a shot to the chest in a second-floor bedroom of the East Williamsburg building where band members lived and practiced. Farazmand's brother, Arash, 28, a drummer with the band the Free Keys who later joined the Yellow Dogs, was also shot and killed at the same location, as was a third Iranian musician, Ali Eskandarian, 35. An Iranian street artist was shot in the arm, police said. The shooter, who took his own life on the rooftop of the building, was identified as Ali Akbar Mohammadi Rafie, 29, police said. A spokesman for the Yellow Dogs told CNN that he had been a member of the Free Keys. Ali Salehezadeh, who handles publicity for the Yellow Dogs, told CNN that a ""petty conflict"" resulted in a break of communication between the gunman and the band. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters that the gunman used a .308-caliber assault rifle, apparently to settle a ""dispute ... over money"" between the bands. The gunman shot and killed one of the victims through a window before entering the building in the East Williamsburg neighborhood and shooting the others on the second and third floors, Kelly said. Rafie shot himself on the roof after scuffling with at least one of two other people who hid in a bathroom. In the 2009 CNN story, members of Yellow Dogs described performing in an improvised, clandestine music studio to avoid the wrath of Islamic authorities. The band settled in East Williamsburg after attention generated by the group's contribution to the soundtrack of a film called ""No One Knows About Persian Cats,"" a movie about Iran's underground music scene that won an award at the Cannes Film Festival. ""The law has a problem with rock music so we can't play it,"" Siavash Karampour, the Yellow Dogs band leader, told CNN in 2009. Karampour was working at another job at the time of the shooting, Salehezadeh told CNN. Karampour told CNN that Iranian authorities viewed the band members as ""anarchists."" ""They're like my brothers,"" Karampour said of the band members. ""They're more close than my brothers."" In the CNN story, Yellow Dog members described their brand of music as rock played with bad equipment and said it touched on subjects ranging from Iranian oppression to American greed.

"Washington (CNN) -- Everywhere 10-year-old Gabriella Miller went, from Philadelphia to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, she brought along a frying pan, and used it to smash a walnut. It was a tradition that started about a year ago, when Gabriella's father broke the news to his young daughter that she had a terminal brain tumor. ""They told us it was about the size of a walnut in her head,"" recalls Mark Miller. ""We went from store to store to store to find a whole bag of walnuts, found them, took them out to the deck outside, and got a frying pan out, and said we're going to visualize ... smashing the walnuts. Smashing the tumor inside your head,"" Gabriella's father said. ""I'm Gabriella Miller, I'm 10 years old, and I have brain cancer,"" she would say after smashing the walnuts. It's one example of how a little girl's devastating news transformed her into a warrior -- against her own cancer and on behalf of other children. ""We told her that we live in an amazing country, and we have access to great medical care, and great doctors, and they'll help us. But you also have to be part of your recovery. And she embraced that,"" Gabriella's mother, Ellyn Miller, recalled. Searching for clinical trials as Gabriella suffered from toxic treatments, the Millers quickly learned how little was available for kids with cancer. ""Gabriella questioned, all the time, 'Why they don't have a real drug that will help us kids? Why are they using us as guinea pigs?' "" Ellyn Miller said. Less than 4% of $5 billion in cancer research goes to childhood cancers. Budget deal aims to avert another shutdown . ""There's no money in it for the drug companies, which I understand. It's capitalism. There's only a couple hundred kids a year in North America that get diagnosed with what Gabriella had. So all of the millions of dollars it would take to find a drug to fix it, they wouldn't make their money. And I get that,"" Mark Miller said. ""But that's where we also hope the federal government can step in."" Gabriella embraced activism -- gathering 250,000 letters for Macy's Make a Wish campaign last Christmas, and later giving speeches and making online videos that have gone viral. ""It's not fair that us kids get so little from the world, just because we're smaller, just because we don't know as much,"" Gabriella said in one of those videos. She spoke eloquently, like someone well beyond her 10 years, about the gravity of her situation and that of other children with cancer. ""Sometimes at night, I'll be with my mom and dad and I will be absolutely crying and I'll be saying, 'I don't want to leave you. I want you to go first,' "" she said in a video. ""Once you get cancer, you kind of have to be all grown-up,"" Gabriella said, in tears, ""you don't really have a childhood."" But she combined very adult concepts with little-girl ideas. She made a list of things she wanted her parents to do after she passed away, including going to the haunted mansion at Disney World, and always saving her a piece of birthday cake. And her message for politicians was simple enough for anyone to understand. ""Stop talking and start doing,"" she said. Two weeks after Gabriella made that blunt statement, her condition worsened, and she was placed in hospice care. Six weeks ago, on October 27, she lost her 11-month battle with cancer. But her message got through to some in Congress. Patty Murray emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal . Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Mississippi, and Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, crafted a bipartisan bill to take $126 million in federal money over 10 years, set aside for political conventions, to direct it to pediatric research. After meeting Gabriella's parents, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, named the Kids First Research Act after Gabriella Miller and brought it to a vote on Wednesday. The measure passed, 295-103. This ""could be a really inspiring story for so many people,"" Cantor said in an interview. ""Instead of spending money on political conventions for the political parties, shouldn't we have as our priority medical research for kids?"" Still, it's not without controversy. Democratic leaders pressed their members to vote against the legislation, and a majority of House Democrats opposed it. Leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate currently have no plans to bring the bill to a vote. ""This bill of Leader Cantor is an absolute fraud,"" said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York, ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Lowey says the bill would not do what Cantor says it would. She says not only is $13 million a year a drop in the bucket when it comes to cancer research, she also notes it would not appropriate money, so it's not even guaranteed. She and others senior Democrats oppose it as a publicity stunt, to paper over billions in cuts to federal cancer research. ""As a mother and a grandmother, my heart goes out to Gabriella's mother. To lose a child is the most pain any person could suffer. So what Leader Cantor should do is have the Republicans bring back the $1.55 billion that they cut from the National Institutes of Health, and the almost $300 million cut as a result from the National Cancer Institute, so we can really focus on saving lives for the future,"" Lowey told CNN. After the House vote, Mark Miller said, ""We took into consideration that it may be a publicity stunt to use Gabriella's name."" ""But they're talking about it,"" he told CNN. ""They're talking about the lack of funding for pediatric disease research, pediatric cancer research (and) brain cancer research like Gabriella had."" ""So as long as they're talking about it, we felt comfortable letting them use Gabriella to help build support and momentum for it."" As for the bill's long political odds, Ellyn Miller said she and her husband ""thought that if it didn't pass (the House), that's fine. It's the first step and it's raising a lot of awareness."" But ""Gabriella's hand"" was ""in there"" for the House vote, she said. And now Gabriella's ""thinking, 'OK Senate. It's your turn now!' "" First on CNN: Republicans moving to overhaul 2016 primary process . Welch, the Democratic sponsor, says he too wants billions reinvested for cancer research, but says you've got to start somewhere. ""We've got to learn to work together. Gabriella found a way to work for other people, even though she was a little girl who knew she was going to die. But every day, every moment of her life -- her young, small, short life -- was spent trying to help other people, so why don't we?"" Welch asked. ""Can we just put the battle axes down for a while and take a step forward? I think we can,"" said Welch. Gabriella said these words just a few weeks before she died: . ""If I lose my battle, then I want other people to carry on the war, and we're going to win this war. I'll be in a good place, and it won't be all that bad.""","10-year old Gabriella Miller was diagnosed with brain cancer .

"(EW.com ) -- When it comes to adapting beloved novels, Hollywood has a lot of blood on its hands. We all have our own personal laundry lists of books we spent our childhoods poring over that wound up getting sapped of their original spark and power on the way to the big screen. I could be wrong, but I suspect that diehard fans of Orson Scott Card's 1985 sci-fi allegory Ender's Game might walk out of Gavin Hood's lavish, eye-candy adaptation with a similar sensation â€” that they've spent more than two decades waiting for what ends up being an oddly lifeless and emotionally unaffecting film. For the uninitiated, Ender's Game is the story of 12-year-old Ender Wiggin (Hugo's Asa Butterfield), a shy loner with a beautiful mind. His gift, if it can be called that, considering what happens in the last third of the film, is that he's a bit of savant when it comes to strategy and analyzing thorny no-win situations. He'd give Captain Kirk a serious run at Star Trek's Kobayashi Maru scenario. This is a particularly valuable skill set in the wake of a devastating attack on Earth years earlier by an alien insect race called the Formics. There are reports that these intergalactic praying mantises are about to launch a second assault and the military powers that be are scouring our planet, looking for the best and the brightest to outwit these blood-thirsty beasties. Harrison Ford, all gravel and growl, plays Col. Hyrum Graff, the head of recruiting. He sees in Ender the last best hope for Earth's survival: And a child shall lead them...and all of that. He taps Ender for a spot in the elite Battle School, where he faces down bullies using his unique brand of psychological jujitsu. The problem is, these initiation and training scenes go on forever. He forms a sort of chaste romance with a fellow cadet (True Grit's Hailee Steinfeld), becomes an ace at an anti-gravity laser-tag variation of Quidditch, and earns the grudging respect of his classmates. While the movie looks stunning, it's also all a bit dull. I kept thinking what Ender's Game could have used was some of the fizz and subversive bite of Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers. Card's public stance against gay marriage has been controversial, but none of those views have made it into the film. The movie actually contains an anti-bullying theme of tolerance. Mostly, it's a harmless, slightly clunky story in which the undercooked plot and unremarkable performances fail to match the visual ambition. The revelations in the film's downbeat but satisfying final act hint at deeper wrinkles that were ironed out of the novel on its journey to the multiplex. But by the time the movie finally manages to get interesting, audiences may be too numb and their retinas too fried to win back. Grade: C+ . See the original story at EW.com.

"Washington D.C. (CNN) -- Pyongyang announced on December 12 the trial and execution of Jang Sung-taek, former vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission and uncle to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Although Kim has already purged hundreds of officials during his two year reign, Jang's ouster is highly unusual, even by North Korean standards. Jang is married to the sister of the late leader Kim Jong-il and it had been expected he would be safe from a purge until after her death. In the past, when members of the North Korean senior leadership strata were purged, they usually simply stopped appearing in North Korean media. Instead, the BBC and other media reports showed that Jang was first erased from existing official photos and videos in tactics reminiscent of the Stalin-era Soviet Union. North Korea stability fears after execution . Jang was arrested during a special meeting of the leadership with the photos and lengthy list of his crimes promulgated to the North Korean public. That Jang was executed was also rare for someone in the inner circle of power. While Kim is emulating the power politics of his father and grandfather, he has taken it to new levels of brutality. In addition to Jang -- previously referred to as the ""second most powerful man in North Korea,"" Kim replaced both the minister of defense and chairman of the general staff. Clearly, no one is safe from Kim's wrath. According to South Korean media reports, Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was executed last year per Kim's dictate to leave ""no trace of him, not even his hair,"" though it is not clear exactly how he was killed. Some reports suggest he was executed with a mortar round during the official mourning period after Kim Jong-il's death. Jang -- the ""despicable human scum who was worse than a dog"" -- was accused of plotting a coup to ""overthrow the state [and] to grab the supreme power of our party and state."" Perhaps. But had Jang wanted to grab the ring of power he would have had more success immediately after Kim's father's death in December 2011, before his son acquired the six titles conferring power over the state, party, and military. How Kim Jong Un got rid of his uncle . It is more likely that the accusation of treason -- as well as the litany of his personal foibles of gambling, drugs, womanizing, pornography, and drinking -- were to undermine Jang's reputation and justify the execution. An uncle's ambition cut short . The young Kim also used the purge to make Jang the scapegoat for North Korea's economic problems. Jang was described as controlling all major economic fields of the country and accused of scheming ""to drive the economy of the country and people's living into an uncontrollable catastrophe."" Jang was then able to be blamed for the disastrous currency revaluation of 2009, poor construction in Pyongyang, selling off of the Rason economic zone and precious resources at low prices, and creating ""a great confusion in financial management system of the state."" So much for the political and economic reform that some experts predicted Kim would implement, as they had similarly predicted about his father. Jang's accusation emphasized the ""the unitary leadership (and) absolute authority"" of Kim Jong Un."" The military court derided Jang's ""despicable true colors as (economic) reformist known to the outside world."" Jang's ""cunning and sinister means"" were compared with the ""strategic patience policy and waiting strategy of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group of traitors."" If there was any lingering naive doubt that Kim would be just as merciless as his father and grandfather, it died along with Jang. During his two years in power, he has escalated the subjugation of the populace. He has increased public executions, expanded the gulags for political prisoners, and increased government punishment for people caught with information from the outside world. Photos show scale of North Korea's repressive prison camps . Earlier this year, Kim showed that he is willing to go even higher than his father in raising tension on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang threatened U.S. military bases in the wider region with nuclear attacks. He also warned of tactical attacks on South Korean targets. He defied U.N. Security Council resolutions by conducting nuclear and long-range missile launches and was credited by the official North Korean media as being the mastermind behind Pyongyang's two deadly attacks on South Korea in 2010. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . The United States should have no illusions about Kim. His government vows it will never abandon its nuclear weapons and Pyongyang continues to augment and refine its nuclear and missile arsenals. South Korea's minister of defense believes Pyongyang's missiles can already reach the continental United States. The North Korean threat -- always high -- has gotten worse under the young leader. He is just as dangerous as his father -- and less predictable.

"(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as ""Law & Order,"" ""Crime Story,"" and ""Miami Vice,"" has died. He was 69. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,"" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. ""Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues."" Farina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, ""Thief."" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as ""Miami Vice"" (in which Farina played a mobster) and ""Crime Story"" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). Farina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including ""Midnight Run"" (1988), ""Get Shorty"" (1995), ""The Mod Squad"" (1999) and ""Snatch"" (2000). In 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running ""Law & Order"" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff ""Trial by Jury."" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. Farina was on ""Law & Order"" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show. In recent years, Farina was one of the stars of ""Luck,"" the ill-fated HBO series about horse racing, and had an occasional role on the Fox series ""New Girl."" Farina was born in 1944 in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood. He became a police officer in the late '60s and soon graduated to detective. His switch to acting was a fluke. A friend was an adviser on ""Thief"" and recommended Farina to Mann, who was looking for a guide to the city. The director gave Farina a small part in the film. ""The process was interesting to me, very interesting, but no way did I think this was a full-time career,"" Farina told Cigar Aficionado in 1999. ""I was 35 years old and had put in more than a decade as a policeman."" But one thing led to another -- including encouragement from the Steppenwolf Theatre's John Malkovich -- and soon Farina was getting more than bit parts. Throughout his career, he was loyal to his hometown. Chicago Tribune writer Rick Kogan once wrote of the actor, ""Dennis Farina has a Chicago neighborhood face. ... Dennis Farina has a face that should be found at dawn, unloading crates of lettuce from the back of a truck on Randolph Street."" Farina repaid the courtesy. ""My personality was formed by Chicago,"" he told Cigar Aficionado. ""It's very American, very straightforward. If you can't find it, or make it there, you won't make it anywhere. It's a very honest place."" Farina had three sons and several grandchildren. He is survived by his longtime partner, Marianne Cahill.","Actor Dennis Farina was known for cop and tough-guy roles .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Ryan O'Neal choked up on the witness stand Wednesday as he told a jury he would be crushed if an Andy Warhol portrait of longtime companion Farrah Fawcett is taken from him and given to the University of Texas. Fawcett died of cancer in 2009 and left her artwork to her alma mater. The university is suing O'Neal for the portrait, which hangs in the bedroom of his Malibu beach house. ""I talk to it. I talk to her."" O'Neal said, his voice choking with emotion. ""It's her presence in my life and her son's life. We lost her. It would seem a crime to lose it."" He said he would never consider selling the portrait, which has been valued in court at between $1 million and $12 million, depending on whose expert is talking. But O'Neal insists it's not about the money. ""I plan to keep it in our family as long as there's a family,"" O'Neal told a rapt jury of six men and six women. O'Neal's second turn on the witness stand came during the third week of a trial that has focused on art and legacy and the sometimes stormy relationship of a Hollywood golden couple torn apart by infidelity but reunited by their battles with cancer. That disputed Warhol: A portrait of the final days of Farrah Fawcett . A little art history . The Oscar-nominated actor previously testified that the portrait, a 40-inch by 40-inch silkscreen on canvas, was given to him by Warhol in 1980. A nearly identical portrait, which he said was given to Fawcett at the same time, was bequeathed to the university and hangs in its Blanton Museum of Art. O'Neal testified that he had been friends with Warhol since the late 1960s; they met when the artist painted his ex-wife Leigh Taylor-Young -- or rather, he painted a butterfly on her leg. O'Neal introduced the artist to Fawcett in 1980, shortly after O'Neal began seeing her. He said the deal for the two paintings was hatched at a Warhol book-signing party in Houston. O'Neal described how Warhol painted hearts on a tablecloth at the Houston party. ""It was a series of hearts coming together, and he could see Farrah and I were falling in love and he wanted to express how he felt about us coming together."" The tablecloth, signed by Warhol, includes the artist's New York phone number, the dedication ""To Farrah F and Ryan O' "" and ""Houston Texas"" in a semicircle. The university has the tablecloth and a napkin drawing of Fawcett's eye. O'Neal has another napkin drawing of his lips, and he's countersued the university for the tablecloth. He testified that he did not object when the trustee for Fawcett's estate signed it over to the university but that he considers the tablecloth his property as well. ""We both ate off it,"" he said. He now wishes he'd spoken up about keeping it after Fawcett died. 'They're heirlooms' ""I was in a state of shock for some weeks prior to losing her and months afterward,"" he said. ""It's for her son. These are keepsakes. This is not art, sorry. They're heirlooms."" After the Houston party, O'Neal said he received a call from Warhol, who said he was ready to paint Fawcett and asked if they minded if the television news magazine show ""20/20"" filmed the sitting. The show was working on a piece about Warhol at the time. ""He said she could keep the portrait he would paint of her and I could keep mine,"" O'Neal testified. He said he and his daughter Tatum, then 16, attended the session at Warhol's New York studio, called The Factory, and described the scene in detail. ""There was no easel, no paint. There was just this strange dentist's Polaroid camera. He just snapped her at different turns, maybe 25 shots."" The session was taped by ""20/20,"" and a producer for the show testified earlier that she did not see O'Neal there. The actor told the court he was keeping a low profile because Fawcett was getting a divorce from actor Lee Majors and didn't want to be photographed or seen publicly with other men. ""Are you certain you were there?"" defense attorney Marty Singer asked. ""As God is my witness,"" O'Neal replied. ""Are you certain Tatum was with you?"" ""As God is my witness."" About two weeks later, O'Neal said, he received a call and he and Fawcett picked up the portraits. He saw portraits of famous people stacked one on top of the other at The Factory -- Mao Zedong, Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger, ""and some people I didn't recognize."" He was handed one portrait, and Fawcett was handed the other, he said. Afterward, ""we went down to the streets of New York to find a cab where these two paintings would fit."" Over the years, the couple repeated the story to friends many times over dinner. He said Fawcett never disputed his version of events. He also described several other dinners the couple had with Warhol. During those dinners, the artist -- who was fascinated by celebrities -- would whip out a tape recorder, as well as a marker or paint brush, and decorate the napkins and tablecloths. O'Neal said he and Fawcett would always agree to be recorded as long as they could leave with a signed keepsake. O'Neal: Warhol portrait of Fawcett 'is mine' Backing up O'Neal's story . O'Neal's story was backed by other members of Fawcett's inner circle who testified for the defense this week. They include two close friends: Alana Stewart, the former wife of actor George Hamilton and rocker Rod Stewart; and Mela Murphy, who left her job as news anchor Katie Couric's hairstylist to help care for Fawcett after she was stricken with cancer. The women, and O'Neal, were at Fawcett's side when she died on June 25, 2009. The defense witnesses gave jurors a vastly different version of events than that painted by witnesses called by the university, which claims Fawcett loved her days as a student at its art school and left both portraits to her alma mater. The university's witnesses include Fawcett's college boyfriend, a reality show producer and a former personal assistant. They said Fawcett and O'Neal were estranged at the time of her death and that she never intended for him to have one of the two Warhols. The university's star witness was reality show producer Craig Nevius, who said O'Neal stole the Warhol off the wall just days after Fawcett died. He testified that she didn't want O'Neal to have it. But he also said he blamed O'Neal for ""hijacking"" a documentary about Fawcett's battle with cancer. He also acknowledged he had been involved in a flurry of lawsuits against O'Neal and had filed criminal complaints against O'Neal, Stewart and the trustee of Fawcett's estate. Bernie Francis, the trustee, had been the couple's business manager for many years. He testified earlier that he believed O'Neal when he said he owned the Warhol and gave him permission to remove it from Fawcett's Los Angeles condominium about a week after her death. 'Their love dates for 30-odd years' ""Ryan said one of them was his, and I trusted Ryan,"" Francis testified. ""I knew his life, and I knew her life. They were practically a married couple. ""Their love dates for 30-odd years. I was never going to question what Ryan was doing. He said 'This belongs to me.' There never was a question. These things went back and forth between them."" A nurse who cared for Fawcett also said she was told the portrait, which hung outside Fawcett's bedroom, belonged to O'Neal. The nurse came forward last week after reading about the trial, and the judge allowed her to testify. ""I talked to her one day in the bedroom and then I saw the painting,"" Maribel Avila told the jury. ""I said, 'Oh, Mrs. Farrah, you look so beautiful in that painting.' And she said 'Thank you.' Then she said, 'That painting is Ryan's. Let me tell you the story.' And then she say, 'A friend of mine, you know, his name is Andy Warhol, painted that for Ryan and he did one for me, too.'"" Murphy the hairstylist said Fawcett told her she owned one Warhol portrait and O'Neal owned the other. ""She told me that Andy Warhol had contacted Ryan, and Ryan had asked her to pose for a portrait for Mr. Warhol and she did, and he gave one to her and one to him."" Another friend, Dave Pinsky, said he heard the same story from both Fawcett and O'Neal. He said he was too polite to interrupt O'Neal, who went ""on and on and on"" as he told it. ""She told me that she owned one and Ryan owned one. Ryan told me that he owned his and she owned hers. I think Farrah is very smart in her business life, and she agreed to do this so she'd get a portrait and Ryan would get one,"" Pinsky said. Alana Stewart also said she heard the story over dinner. ""Andy had called him when they first started going together. He wanted to paint Farrah. (O'Neal) said, 'You have to do one for each of us.' They went to The Factory, walked down 5th Avenue carrying the paintings, laughing and trying to get a cab big enough to carry the paintings."" Stewart said O'Neal would take the lead telling the story and Fawcett would chime in. Pinsky and Stewart also testified that there was no estrangement between the couple at the end. O'Neal was a devoted caretaker. ""I would say when she was stricken with cancer, he was basically glued to her side. He was always there for her,"" Pinsky said. ""He was doing nothing but taking care of her and being loving to her,"" Stewart agreed. ""We were all taking turns feeding her when she needed it.""","Actor Ryan O'Neal tells a jury he doesn't want to lose a portrait of Farrah Fawcett .

"(CNN) -- Uganda's President has declined to sign a bill that would punish certain homosexual acts with life in prison, but the move was not designed to protect the civil rights of gays and lesbians. President Yoweri Museveni believes that parliament illegally passed the bill, and gays and lesbians are ""sick people who need help,"" his spokesman said. A Ugandan lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009 with a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts. It was briefly shelved when Britain and other European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. The nation's parliament passed the bill last month, supplanting the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality."" It was awaiting the President's signature for passage. News came Friday that the President had sent a letter to the speaker of the parliament, saying he can't sign the bill because there weren't enough parliament members present when it was passed. ""There was no quorum which (was) mandated for bill passage. Thus, he is unable to sign a bill that was not legally passed,"" spokesman Tamale Mirundi said. The spokesman further explained Museveni's thinking about the issue. ""Homosexuals need help. They are sick,"" Mirundi said. ""Homosexuals were present in Africa in the past and were not persecuted."" The President also believes that the issue is not a priority for his country. ""It might be important in Europe, but not here,"" Mirundi said. ""The President's inability to sign the bill is very clear and his stance has not changed. ... There was no quorum, and homosexuals are sick people who need help."" According to Amnesty International, the bill's definition of ""aggravated homosexuality"" includes acts in which a person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors. The bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. But lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation, saying the influence of Western lifestyles risks destroying family units. ""This is a piece of legislation that is needed in this country to protect the traditional family here in Africa, and also protect the future of our children,"" said David Bahati, the lawmaker who introduced the bill. Rights groups and the international community had urged Museveni to veto the bill. Parliament is in recess and won't reconvene until February 18, parliament spokesman Moses Bwalatum said. The bill can become law without the President's signature if Museveni returns it to parliament twice and it garners the support of two-thirds of lawmakers, he said. Journalist Samson Ntale and Gregory Branch contributed to this report.","President's spokesman: ""There was no quorum, and homosexuals are sick people""

"(CNN) -- Next time you go to the grocery store to pick up steaks or some hamburger, you'll know where the cow it came from was born, raised and slaughtered, thanks to new labeling rules that became final Saturday. The Country of Origin Labeling, or COOL, rule went into effect in May, though companies were given six months use up older labels ""to clear the chain of commerce, thus preventing retailer and supplier confusion and alleviating some of the economic burden on regulated entities,"" the U.S. Department of Agriculture explains. But as of Saturday, that leeway period was over. Here's how it works: If everything happened domestically, the label would say, ""Born, Raised and Slaughtered in the United States."" A product that crisscrosses multiple countries would have wording like, ""Born in Mexico, Raised and Slaughtered in the United States."" If it is entirely imported, the label would state -- as it would have previously -- ""Product of"" whatever country it came from. This new labeling system aims to bring the U.S. in compliance with World Trade Organization guidelines. In addition to ""muscle cuts of beef"" (including veal), the COOL law applies to similar cuts of lamb, pork, goat and chicken; wild fish and certain nuts and other food products. Ground meats have to have such labels, too, ""listing all countries ... that may be reasonably contained therein,"" the USDA explains. ""'Reasonable' means when any raw material from a specific origin is not in a processors inventory for more than 60 days, that country should not be included."" The Agriculture Department said the ""program is neither a food safety or traceability program but rather a consumer information program."" The new regulations have riled some in the meat industry. Tyson Foods, for instance, said they are others ""are very disappointed by the changes."" ""These new rules significantly increase costs because they require additional product codes, production breaks and product segregation, including a separate category for cattle shipped directly from Canada to U.S. beef plants, without providing any incremental value to our customers,"" Tyson Foods said in a statement announcing it was suspending cattle shipped from Canada to its beef plants. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association likewise has spoken out in opposition, with its president calling the action ""short-sighted"" and fearing it would spur ""increased discrimination against imported products"" in light of anger internationally about the move. ""While trying to make an untenable mandate fit with our international trade obligations, USDA chose to set up U.S. cattle producers for financial losses,"" said association President Scott George, a dairy and cattle producer from Cody, Wyoming. Others, though, have applauded the move -- and fought efforts against it. Some are in the industry. Dr. Patricia Whisnant, the head of the American Grassfeed Association, said that ""the meat business needs more transparency, not less."" And Jonathan Lovvorn, an official with The Humane Society, argued that the change makes sense because it serves consumers' best interests, whether or not it affects some companies' bottom lines. ""Consumers deserve to know where their food comes from,"" he said. ""And factory farming organizations that seek to have it otherwise are out of step with their customers.""","New labels must be on meat sold in the United States .

"(CNN) -- To assess this weekend's nuclear deal with Iran, here are the key questions that must be answered: . 1) How close was Iran to building a nuclear weapon? The deal does not stop the Iranian nuclear program. It merely slows certain elements of that program for six months while others continue. After six months, Iran can resume where it left off. Iran made no concessions that cannot be reversed. More telling, Iran has protected its top nuclear priority. The deal allows it to continue enriching uranium, a stark departure from previous U.S. policy and a clutch of U.N. Security Council Resolutions that declare enrichment by Iran illegal and unacceptable, period. If Iran was on the verge of a nuclear breakout, it might make sense to pay a high price to slow the Iranian nuclear program. If nuclear breakout was less imminent, the trade-off looks reckless. 20 questions about the Iran nuclear deal . 2) How close was Iran to economic collapse? The Iranian economy is staggering. Its currency has lost three-quarters of its value over the past two years. Goods have vanished from shops. Unemployment is high, and inflation roars. This year -- and over the objections of the Obama administration -- Congress imposed the most effective round of sanctions yet: the Kirk-Menendez sanctions that barred Iran from the international payments system. Sanctions have squeezed one of the world's major oil producers to the point where it has access to perhaps only $20 billion in usable hard currency, barely more than Bangladesh. This deal unfreezes $7 billion in cash, a big infusion. Potentially even more important, the deal relaxes sanctions on gold, opening the way to the resumption of an old sanctions-busting trick: selling oil abroad in exchange for gold trucked in from neighboring Turkey. Iran will also be allowed to buy spare parts for its aging civilian aircraft. 3) How much do we care about making Iran's new president look good? Iran is no democracy, but it has a political process. Elections are manipulated, and candidates unacceptable to the religious establishment are barred from the ballot, but there is some space for some limited discussion of issues. In the presidential elections this summer, the winning candidate, Hassan Rouhani, pledged to obtain relief from sanctions. Some in the Obama administration seem to have decided that Rouhani is an Iranian Mikhail Gorbachev, a leader with whom the West can do business. In this view, a ""win"" for Rouhani is important to the West, strengthening moderates against hardliners and opening the way to a broader detente. The trouble with this view, however, is that the evidence is strong that Rouhani is really the Iranian Yuri Andropov, the former Soviet secret police chief who preceded Gorbachev. Less doctrinaire and stupid than other Communist leaders, Andropov was no less hostile to the West. Rouhani led the long effort to dupe Western governments about Iran's nuclear program in the earlier 2000s. There's every reason to fear that the ""detente"" he wants is one that allows Iran to obtain a respite from sanctions while continuing its development of weapons of mass destruction. 4) How little do we care about the anxieties of regional allies? Israel and Saudi Arabia have vociferously voiced their dismay at this agreement. Smaller allies such as the United Arab Emirates have been less vociferous but no less dismayed. The Obama administration answers, ""We know better. We have larger interests and therefore larger perspective. We put our interests ahead of yours."" That's what great powers do. But is this particular great power correct at this particular time? Being big is not the same thing as being smart. 5) How much do we care about other forms of Iranian misconduct? Even if Iran had never started its nuclear program, it would qualify as a major bad actor. Without Iranian support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad, that country's civil war would have ended long ago. Iran makes mischief in Iraq and Afghanistan, bankrolls terror attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia, and trains and supports anti-U.S. movements and regimes in places as far away as Venezuela. None of that behavior was on the table on Geneva, and therefore that behavior will continue after Geneva. Does that behavior not matter? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Was deal smart? If Iran wasn't close to building a nuke, deal looks reckless .
He says deal relaxes sanctions just when they'd left Iran close to economic collapse .
He says some view President Hassan Rouhani as a Gorbachev-type figure .

"(CNN) -- The nation's new ""first dog"" has heightened interest in its breed -- Portuguese water dog -- but not necessarily a thorough understanding of the dogs' needs, a pair of owners and breeders told CNN. Bo the Portuguese water dog meets the camera. Bo was a gift to the Obama girls from Sen. Ted Kennedy. The dog, Bo, has triggered ""the most publicity the breed has ever had since its introduction into the U.S. in the late 1960s,"" the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America said in a news release. President Obama and his family welcomed Bo into the White House this week. Shortly afterward, the club's Web site was receiving a million hits an hour, said Susan Teasley, a club member. Jane Harding, a fellow member of the club, said she has ""received about a 10 percent increase in calls"" since Tuesday, and some of the other breeders she knows also have reported more calls. ""Thankfully, people want to know more about the breed,"" Teasley said. ""But water dogs are not for everybody, and it would be sad to see people getting the dog without doing the proper research."" Portuguese water dogs are ""active athletes,"" far from couch potatoes, she explained. In fact, they are more likely to rip a couch into pieces than lounge on it, Harding said, recalling a friend who had lost a sofa that way.  Watch more water dog fun » . Portuguese water dogs can be miserable and destructive when alone, Teasley said. And don't think you can close the door and keep them out. ""They want to be with you at all times -- even if it's in the bathroom or your bed,"" she said. Teasley and her husband breed Portuguese water dogs and often allow them to run free on the two and a half acres of land they own. They are ""not apartment dogs,"" she said. Harding agreed. ""They aren't for people who want a tie-out dog or an apartment dog. For people like that,"" she joked, ""we recommend a stuffed dog."" Portuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family's flowers. Harding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because ""they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work."" For other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, ""Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed."" Teasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the ""Dalmatian syndrome."" After the movie ""101 Dalmatians"" came out in 1996, ""thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels,"" Teasley said. What those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said. Both Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog » . ""For the first six to seven months of the puppy's life, they need training,"" Harding said. She has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said ""produces phenomenal litters ... and has multiple titles"" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America. Such organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners. But it takes time to get a membership, Teasley said. Prospective members must apply for a one-year associate membership before they can receive a permanent one, she explained. That provides a cushion while they decide whether the dog is the right fit. ""It sounds like I'm trying to discourage people from getting (a Portuguese water dog),"" Teasley said, ""But I'm not. We just don't want dogs to come back because owners don't know what they are doing.""","Breeders fear too many people will try to get dog like the Obamas' Bo .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A request by Casey Kasem's children that a temporary conservator be appointed for their ailing father was denied by a judge on Tuesday. Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed a conservatorship petition in a Los Angeles court last month, claiming the retired radio host ""has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family"" by his wife. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lesley Green ruled Tuesday that Kasem, 81, was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem. ""As my clients haven't had the opportunity to see their father for some months now, they were happy to learn through investigation of the court appointed expert and the probate investigator that their father was being physically well taken care of,"" said Andrew Katzenstein, the lawyer for Julie Kasem. Kasem, who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40,"" is suffering from Parkinson's disease and ""may have early onset Parkinson's dementia,"" according to a court filing. He retired in 2009. The children, who have been fighting with their stepmother, are hoping they can soon see their father, Katzenstein said. While they have not spoken to her, their lawyers are discussion a visitation plan, he said. ""Also they were happy that the judge focused her attention on the important issue of visitation,"" he said. ""Mr. Kasem has a long strong and loving relationship with his adult children and we are continuing to try and reach resolution with the other side so visits can begin again."" Green will hold another hearing on December 20 to decide if she will appoint a permanent conservator. Kasem has the ""ability to shuffle short distances, but is mainly bedridden and requires the assistance of a wheelchair to move any distance,"" a court document said. The petition claims that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. They ""have been prevented from exercising their duties"" by Jean Kasem, who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades, the filing contends. ""There is no communication between Jean and us and his daughters,"" brother Mouner Kasem said Saturday. ""We have no knowledge of how he is, what he's doing, if he's better, if he's worse, and we're scared that we'll never see him again."" The petition claims Kasem's wife has refused to provide the children with the name of their father's primary care physician. That doctor would be consulted to determine Kasem's ""ability to act on his own behalf,"" which is the question that would cause the health care power of attorney to take effect, it said. Daughter Kerri Kasem said last month that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him about three months ago. She said she was perplexed by the decision. ""I don't get it, I don't understand it,"" said Kerri Kasem, who co-hosts the radio show ""Sixx Sense"" with Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx. ""He has Parkinson's, and all the research we've done indicates socialization would help him."" CNN has reached out to get a statement from Jean Kasem, but has been unsuccessful. Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem's Holmby Hills house to raise public attention to their dispute last month. The fight is not about an inheritance, Kerri Kasem said. ""My dad told us a long time ago we were not in the will, and we're OK with that. We've known that for years,"" she said. ""I've never asked him for anything, nor have I asked Jean for anything."" Don Pitts, Kasem's agent of more than 35 years, said he did not want to take sides in the argument, but he did say Casey is still of sound mind. ""He has Parkinson's, has it very bad. It took his speech, and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift, that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating. But he's handling it very well,"" Pitts said. ""His mind is very sharp, his brain works well. You can tell in his eyes he understands everything you're saying. He just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords."" Besides the famed countdown shows, Casey Kasem was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ""Scooby Doo"" and an announcer for NBC. He was a popular DJ and occasional actor before ""American Top 40"" began in 1970. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Kasem's daughter and her husband filed a conservatorship petition last month .

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- The opening ceremony for the 2010 Winter Olympics began on a somber note Friday night as members of the delegation from Georgia mourned the loss of one of their teammates just hours earlier. The seven-athlete delegation, wearing black armbands in tribute to luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, entered BC Place to a standing ovation from the more than 60,000 spectators in attendance. A black ribbon was tied atop the Georgian flag. Kumaritashvili was killed after crashing on a training run at the Whistler Sliding Center. He was set to compete in Saturday's men's singles luge event. Officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and British Columbia coroner's office are leading an investigation into his death. The luge course is closed until the inquiry is complete. Blog: Opening ceremony flawed but perfect . ""The whole Olympic family is struck by this tragedy, which clearly casts a shadow over these Games,"" International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said in a written statement earlier Friday. Some athletes from other countries also donned black armbands during the otherwise upbeat ceremonies that featured lively performances from Canada's indigenous people, who danced throughout the lengthy introductions of the delegations from the 82 competing nations. Luge death happens on track that caused concern, Georgian says . A high-flying snowboarder opened the ceremonies by jumping through a giant set of Olympic rings, prompting roars from the crowd inside the domed stadium -- a first for a Winter Games. Many of the fans were dressed in red, the prominent color on the Canadian flag. The crowd erupted when Canadian speed skater Clara Hughes, carrying the Canadian flag, led her team into the arena. The Canadians hope to top the medal tally at these games, and count on winning gold in both men's and women's hockey, the country's favorite sport. After a tribute to the athletes, sung by Canadians Bryan Adams and Nelly Furtado, the ceremony turned into a technological spectacle celebrating the country's diversity and natural beauty. More than 100 screens around the stadium projected video and images to turn the venue into a re-creation of Canada's constellations, oceans, rivers and forests. Singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, a British Columbia resident, sang as members of the Alberta Ballet danced among holographic images of the huge trees of an old growth forest. John Furlong, the chief executive of the Vancouver Organizing Committee, told the athletes that they were role models. ""You are our beacon of hope in a world so much in need of peace, healing, unity, generosity and inspiration,"" he said. ""Youth the world over aspire to be just like you."" There was a mechanical glitch when four Canadian sports legends tried to light the Olympic cauldron. Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, speed skating hero Catriona LeMay Doan, NBA star Steve Nash and alpine ski star Nancy Greene each were supposed to light one beam of the structure and then watch the flames rise to meet in the cauldron. But one beam failed to emerge from the floor of BC Place, the first indoor arena to host the opening ceremony. A second cauldron, near Coal Harbour, was lit by Gretzky. Olympic officials said that because the caldron was too hot for an indoor arena, a second cauldron, near Coal Harbour, would be lit by Gretzky. Speculation had focused on who would light the Olympic cauldron. Many campaigned for Betty Fox, the mother of the late Terry Fox, a national hero. While battling osteosarcoma in 1980, Terry Fox set out to cross Canada, running about the equivalent of a marathon each day to raise money for cancer research. But Fox, who had a prosthetic right leg, had to quit after 143 days as his cancer spread. He died less than a year later. The idea of a hologram of Fox carrying the torch the final steps also has been floated.","Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky among Canadian sports legends lighting Olympic cauldron .

"(CNN) -- Square, the mobile app and hardware that turns a smartphone into a cash register, is now letting users send and receive money as easily as sending an e-mail. Square Cash can be used between friends, say as a way of paying back a buddy for picking up the tab last night, or for small businesses that have been using its plastic card reader to accept credit card payments. ""Square has always believed in creating solutions for individuals and businesses that work with the tools they already have in their pocket,"" Brian Grassadonia, head of the Cash project, said in a post on Square's website. ""Square Cash makes it convenient to send money to anyone -- without making them jump through hoops to retrieve it. ""Now it's easier than ever to split a bill, send a birthday gift, or settle up with a friend, no matter where you are."" Sending money via Square Cash will be free, according to the company's post. Created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, the current Square model charges 2.75% of the transaction cost plus a 15-cent fee -- a price in line with what larger retail stores pay in order to accept cards. Users don't need to sign up to use Square Cash. Someone can simply send an e-mail to the recipient, with cash@square.com cc'ed and the amount of the payment as the message's subject line. That user will then receive an e-mail prompting them to link a credit card to their account. The recipient enters a debit card number once, and will have that account associated with their e-mail afterward. In addition to e-mail, there is a Square Cash app for Apple's iOS devices and for Android. The service launched Tuesday and is currently only available in the United States. Founded in 2009, Square offers services that are available in the United States, Canada and Japan.

"(CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush briefly jumped back into the national conversation Tuesday night with his interview on ""The Tonight Show."" Bush told host Jay Leno that ""I don't miss the spotlight"" and that he was thoroughly enjoying his post-presidential life. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton is in the news as he receives a Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. The two former presidents have taken a very different approach to their time after the White House. In an era when former presidents are often younger and healthier than in the past, the post-presidency offers a huge opportunity for them to help shape their legacies. Former President Jimmy Carter raised the bar after he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Rather than going into political hiding, the Georgian launched the Carter Center, which has been a hub of international diplomacy. Carter remained an important voice in discussions about foreign policy and has even played a role in resolving some tense diplomatic situations. Clinton's approach to life after the White House has reflected his general style of politics. Clinton has never been passive. As governor of Arkansas and as president of the United States, Clinton has believed it is essential to maintain an aggressive and proactive stance. In an era when many Democrats felt defensive about their ideas, Clinton never let his opponents define him. He responded to every attack throughout his presidency by going on the attack and tried to influence the national conversation about how he was doing. When Republicans shut down the government in 1995 claiming to be fiscally responsible, Clinton turned the tables on them by depicting them as politically reckless. When House Republicans moved to impeach him for perjury in 1997 and 1998, Clinton painted his opponents as partisan zealots who were using the constitutional process for crass political ends. Since 2000, Clinton has continued to inject himself into the political arena. Understanding that presidential legacies evolve in real time, Clinton has remained a forceful presence in the Democratic Party. He has worked hard to strengthen his image as an effective partisan fighter who knows, and knew, how to make things work in a dysfunctional political period. During the 2008 campaign, while supporting his wife's candidacy he promoted a vision of Democratic politics that he said would be most effective in getting things done in Washington. After Obama won office, Clinton made his peace with the President and in 2012 was one of the most effective advocates for the White House by articulating a powerful critique of Republican economic policies. In recent weeks, Clinton spoke out on the health care program, urging Obama to honor his commitment for people to keep their insurance plans and aiming to shore up Democrats as they have struggled through the problematic rollout of the Affordable Care Act. Not only does Clinton want to demonstrate his political skills, but he remains devoted to a Democratic Party that is strong and effective -- which in his mind would be the best proof that his term in office helped to revitalize a party that had been politically devastated in the Age of Reagan. Clinton also would like his wife to be elected president so as to create a political dynasty of sorts. Bush has taken a different approach, letting his record stand on its own. Bush left the White House hugely unpopular and controversial. Bush had little appetite for the toxic environment of Washington and has been remarkably quiet since leaving. Although Americans saw some of him following the release of his book and in relationship to the opening of his presidential library, that's about it. The strategy follows the kind of politician he was. Bush liked to call himself ""The Decider"" and in many ways he was. Bush preferred to make decisions and let them stick, regardless of how controversial or problematic they were. We have seen the same strategy in his post-presidential career. Rather than being part of the political conversation and trying to shape his party in the years that followed, Bush has let the record speak for itself. By many accounts, he has watched as the GOP moved rightward despite his own inclinations about what would be best for the future of the party. Each strategy carries its rewards and risks. For Clinton, his stance allows him to be part of the conversation and to try to make sure that his party remains in a strong position. He can paint himself in a good light as people examine what he was doing as president. The danger is that his actions make him a target of controversy and that by making himself so doggedly political he undermines the aura of a statesman that has been so beneficial to rebuilding the damaged image Americans often have of their leaders. During the 2008 presidential campaign, criticism from the African-American community about his statements regarding Obama weakened some of the strong support that the community held toward his presidency. For Bush, the benefit of his relative silence is that he avoids all of the pitfalls that face Clinton. As feelings about him start to soften simply because we are further removed from his presidency, he has created the space for more careful and rigorous analysis of what he did during the White House. By showing how difficult the political environment is regardless of whether he is in office, Bush can allow for more sympathy to develop of challenges he faced. The dangers for Bush are twofold. By being so removed, he can convey a level of dispassion for politics that plays into criticism that it was never a job he was driven to do in the first place. He has also failed to play a forceful role as his party plunges in its approval ratings. Presidential legacies are a tough thing to predict. Like the weather in New England, they change by the minute. As the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, we can see how presidential reputations fluctuate dramatically (historians often remember his failures as president, while many others recall his presidency in heroic terms). But in this day and age, former presidents have significant opportunities to shape how the nation remembers them and to influence the political world in which they will be judged during their lifetime. As Obama reaches the final period of his presidency, he would do well to look at what his predecessors have done and start thinking through what his strategy will be in the years ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","George W. Bush goes on ""The Tonight Show""; Bill Clinton gets Medal of Freedom .

"(CNN) -- The Kills celebrated the 10th anniversary of their first live gig with a concert/blowout party in New York this past weekend. Other rockers might not remember the exact date of their first gig, but it's easy for singer Alison Mosshart to recall: She has the date tattooed on her hand. You probably haven't heard the Kills on the radio. But you may have heard their songs on TV shows like ""House,"" ""True Blood,"" and ""Cops"" and not known it. And if you're into more mainstream rock, or celebrity gossip, you've probably read about Mosshart and co-Kill Jamie Hince for other reasons. Mosshart moonlights as the lead singer for one of Jack White's two post-White Stripes bands, the Dead Weather. Hince married supermodel Kate Moss last year in a wedding breathlessly covered by the British press. Despite their busy lives outside the Kills, Mosshart and Hince still passionately focus on the band that changed their lives. Hince said when the duo started as ""an odd two-piece social group ... I think our souls knew we would still be doing it [10 years later], but I don't think our brains did."" ""This band might never be a global phenomenon, but it's the most successful thing in the world to me,"" Hince said. Serendipity brought the two together. When Florida native Mosshart was touring Britain with her band, they stayed in a London flat that happened to be below Hince's apartment. ""I'd be making a noise, playing guitar and stuff, and unbeknownst to me, she was outside my window, listening,"" Hince recalled, ""When we actually first spoke, she probably knew a lot more about me than I realized, because she'd been sort of listening to me playing for about a week."" Mosshart soon moved to London to join forces with Hince, but there was one problem: She didn't play an instrument. ""We presumed we would be a normal band with this orthodox band set up, with a drummer and a keyboard player and a bass player,"" Hince said. ""While we were talking about it, we'd also be writing songs together. Then, we'd talk further about what kind of drummer we wanted. Then, we'd play some more music. A week would go by, and two weeks. Then, a month, and two months. And we'd got a mountain of songs and we listened back to ourselves, and it sounded like a band, and we just stopped talking about meeting other people."" Mosshart said sounding like a band wasn't so easy at first, ""He kind of had to re-learn guitar entirely because of me, because we were a two-piece band and I didn't know how to play anything. So, he had to develop this guitar style that was like playing bass and guitar at the same time to compensate for me."" Ten years later, Mosshart plays guitar, drums, and keyboards in concert, as well as ferociously prowling the stage as the lead singer. While the Kills are incorporating two drummers into some songs on their current tour, they play many tunes the way they're created on record, with just the two Kills and a drum machine. Mosshart worries that opens up a lot of possibilities for error on stage. ""Two of us playing to a drum machine is like walking a tightrope, because if you take the wrong turn at any point, you're off, and you're off somewhere all by yourself ... and that's kind of it for the song,"" she said. Despite those fears, you shouldn't expect to hear ornate orchestration in any Kills songs anytime soon. ""I think it's more important what you leave out of a song than what you put in it,"" Hince said. ""The only thing you need on a song is that attitude and that burning electricity. You don't need layers of music or, you know, a thousand drums, or string sections. You don't even need an electric guitar to be electric."" ""I think that minimalist sound is really attractive to us, just kind of instinctually,"" Mosshart added. ""We'll try a lot of things and we usually get rid of almost everything. We just kind of leave the stuff that we think is important, because it sounds the best to us."" That minimalism has been a hallmark of edgy rock bands for more than 45 years, since the Velvet Underground, the ""house band"" for Andy Warhol's Factory in the '60s, ""created"" the sound. When Hince and Mosshart first met, they bonded over a shared love of the Warhol scene. ""All that time was so romantic and beautiful, because there weren't a bunch of bands that were part of the scene. There weren't a bunch of artists that were part of the scene. It was just the Velvet Underground and these kinds of freaks, and these people with fake names, and these drag queens, and Andy Warhol, and then, these photographers,"" Mosshart said. ""That appealed to us so much, because that's kind of what we grew up doing. We wanted to do everything. We didn't just want to do one thing. We didn't just want to be in a band. We didn't just want to be artists."" The Kills display multimedia skills, producing artwork and photos for their CD jackets, creating pamphlets of Polaroids to hand out at concerts and even generating the concepts for many of their music videos. The disturbing video for 2008's ""Last Day of Magic"" depicts the couple beating each other in back alleys and bedrooms. A lot of articles over the years have alluded to sexual tension between Hince and Mosshart, but both insist romance has never been part of their dynamic. ""I think it's really difficult for people to see a friendship -- not just a friendship between a man and a woman, but a creative, productive relationship. People do find it really hard to see that it could be possible, without there being some kind of regular love interest around it,"" Hince said. ""I always wanted to be in this kind of creative, artistic relationship that was beyond anything else, and it's like we willed it. We kind of yearned for it and we willed it, and we got it."" They also yearned for -- and are getting -- more mainstream recognition. ""It's incredible when you go somewhere like South America and kids are going bananas to you and you've never been there before,"" Hince said. ""Equally, when Rolling Stone names this band I still see as this little sort of underground band, names [the Kills' latest album Blood Pressures] as one of the best albums of [2011], it means the world to me."" ""I have this very strong feeling that we need to be part of the world,"" Mosshart said. ""If you're not, what are you doing?""","The Kills are Alison Mosshart and Jamie Hince .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's record winning start to the Bundesliga season came to an abrupt end Sunday as they were stunned 2-1 at home by Bayer Leverkusen. Going into the match at the Allianz Arena, Bayern had racked up eight straight wins, but a late own goal by their German international defender Jerome Boateng saw them slip to defeat. They still have a four-point lead at the top from Schalke, while Leverkusen have moved up to fifth. The visitors took the lead when Andre Schuerrle left striker Stefan Kiessling with a close range tap-in after 42 minutes. Bayern drew level with 13 minutes remaining as striker Mario Mandzukic headed home, but Leverkusen were to enjoy their first win in Munich since 1989. Boateng's attempted to head away a shot but it just flew past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on 86 minutes. In other action, Eintracht Frankfurt missed the chance to move back above Schalke when they lost 2-1 at Stuttgart. Snow can't stop Dortmund victory . Vedad Ibisevic scored Stuttgart's winner for the second straight week. Alexander Meier had leveled for Frankfurt after Christian Gentner's sixth-minute opener for the home side . Borussia Moenchengladbach came from two down to score three late goals in a 3-2 win at Hanover. In Serie A, champions Juventus maintained their lead at the top with a controversial 1-0 win at Catania, who finished with 10 men. Chilean star Arturo Vidal put Juve ahead after 57 minutes before Catania defender Giovanni Marchese was sent off mid-way through the second half. But the real arguments came in the first half as Catania thought they had gone ahead when Argentine striker Ruben Bergessio tapped home a rebound. The referee ruled it out to the fury of the home side and their president Antonino Pulvirenti, who was sent from the bench for dissent. Inter Milan kept up their pursuit of the Old Lady with their fifth straight win, 3-2 at Bologna to stay four points behind. Andrea Ranocchia and Diego Milito put Inter 2-0 ahead before Nicolo Cherubin hit back for the home side. Esteban Cambiasso's first goal of the season sealed three points for the Nerazzurri. In La Liga, Atletico Madrid drew level on points with Barcelona at the top as man of the moment Radamel Falcao scored his 10th league goal of the season in their 3-1 win over Osasuna. Joao Miranda and Raul Garcia put Atletico 2-0 ahead in the Vincente Calderon Stadium before Roland Lamah pulled one back for Osasuna, who stay bottom of the table. Falcao sealed the three points 17 minutes from time. In the late match, reigning champions Real Madrid won 5-0 in Mallorca with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain both scoring twice. But they remained eight points adrift of the leading pair in fourth place.","Bayern Munich beaten 2-1 at home by Bayer Leverkusen .

"(CNN) -- Baseball's not a contact sport. It is not football, where rock-abbed men brutalize each other to get the ball. It is not hockey, where a guy on ice skates gets ""checked"" (aka whacked) if he's got the puck. It isn't even basketball, where 7-foot mastodons give each other a shove on the spine and a thump in the rump, jostling for a few precious feet of space by the hoop. No, baseball is not played that way. With one exception. ""Collisions at home plate."" That is what they are called, in the lingo of the game. ""A collision at the plate."" It occurs principally when a man is running at full speed, attempting to score a run for his side. If the ball gets there ahead of him, a catcher, shielded by equipment that includes a mask, shin guards and a Kevlar-like protective vest, like a cop from a SWAT squad, blocks the plate. Wham. Runner smashes into catcher, who must ""tag"" him with the ball (and not drop it) before that runner can step on home plate. Savannah Guthrie, co-host of NBC's ""Today"" morning show, innocently professed her ignorance of baseball on Thursday, saying: ""I never thought that was a play. ... I thought it was an accident."" No, it is quite deliberate. A runner runs as hard as he can into a catcher, becoming a human crash-test dummy. Very exciting. Unfortunately, there is a side effect. Somebody stands a chance of getting seriously hurt. Broken bones. Cartilage damage. Brain trauma. Is this necessary? Is the ""collision at home plate"" such a key element of a centuries-old sport that the show must go on? Are we a bunch of wusses now, no longer willing or able to play this game in the way that our daddies and granddaddies did? Or are we finally coming to our senses? Major League Baseball believes the latter to be true. A proposal is being made, to be formally presented to team owners in January, to forever eliminate the ""collision"" from the baseball vernacular and rulebook. No more bowling over the catcher. No more trying to ""knock the ball out of his hands."" No more trying to ""knock him into the middle of next week,"" to quote some lame 20th century slang. From now on, if agreed upon by all, a runner must slide into home plate -- or at the very least try to dodge the catcher and the ball -- rather than plow into him like a steer into a matador. Concussions are becoming much too commonplace. Up-to-date medical knowledge is demonstrating how many ex-athletes suffer everlasting degeneration from the impacts of violent incidents on the field of play. No matter how much you love the great game of baseball, you couldn't possibly believe that it would be less great a game if we no longer make a catcher ""stand his ground"" and await a blunt-force crash with a fellow human being. Or could you? People who follow baseball get their noses out of joint whenever somebody tries to change a rule. Instant replay would be a big help? No, it wouldn't. A time clock on the batter or pitcher would speed things up? Nuts to that. Warnings to both benches and mandatory ejections if a pitcher throws a ball at a batter on purpose? Namby-pamby nonsense. Don't fix what ain't broke! (Some people say.) But come on, this is a good thing, right? Keeping a catcher from getting killed? Or a runner from breaking his neck? Because that's what ""collisions"" cause, yes? Serious injury and potentially even death? How did ex-catcher Bruce Bochy, now the manager of the San Francisco Giants, put it in a New York Times piece this week? ""I think it's better to be proactive before we carry a guy off the field paralyzed and think, 'Why didn't we change this rule?' "" Amen to that. Ballplayers current and past understand the danger. Bochy saw his star catcher, Buster Posey, severely injured in May 2011 when he was smashed into by Scott Cousins of the Florida (now Miami) Marlins, breaking a fibula and being lost for the rest of the year. Brian Sabean, the Giants' general manager, described Cousins' actions that day with the word ""malicious."" But rules are rules, until we change them. Managers galore are former catchers: Bochy, Mike Scioscia (Angels), Joe Girardi (Yankees), Joe Maddon (Rays), Mike Matheny (Cardinals), Ned Yost (Royals), Bob Melvin (A's), Fredi Gonzalez (Braves), John Gibbons (Blue Jays), Mike Redmond (Marlins). Each of them wore that backstop gear in their playing days. Each could tell you a story of a violent man-on-man crash. Many are old enough to have a memory of the most famous baseball collision of all. It happened at the 1970 All-Star Game. (Yes, a game that didn't even count.) Pete Rose on second base. Jim Hickman singles. From center field. Amos Otis throws the ball to Ray Fosse, his catcher. Rose barrels toward home plate. He slams into Fosse like a whale into a fishing boat. Fosse goes flying. So does the ball. Rose's team wins the game. Fosse, however, is never the same. He is seriously injured and supposedly can still feel a twinge of pain from that experience, 43 years later. Occupational hazard? OK, maybe. No one ever promised a catcher that baseball was going to be a waltz in the park, with nothing but love taps. But maybe enough is enough. What would it hurt, trying to prevent someone being hurt? MLB rule committee votes to impose rule eliminating home plate collisions . I went to a Detroit vs. Boston game on a June night in 1983. Kirk Gibson was at bat. Lou Whitaker was on first base. A fly ball sailed over Red Sox outfielder Tony Armas' head. Whitaker had to wait to make sure it wasn't caught. He then ran full speed, with Gibson right on his heels. Whitaker was tagged out by Rich Gedman, the catcher. Gibson kept coming. The umpire, Larry Barnett, got in his way, while calling Whitaker out. Gibson smashed into both the catcher and umpire. The ball ended up on the ground. The ump ended up in the hospital. ""I was going to run over whoever was in my way,"" Gibson said afterward. ""I was out if I don't."" The crowd, as they say, went wild. It was thrilling. It also was scary. Runner, catcher AND umpire could have been hurt, even paralyzed, from a single play. The score at that moment was 6 to 1. It wasn't a World Series, wasn't a walk-off game-winning run, wasn't a big deal. But that's the way guys like Gibson were taught to play, giving everything they've got, risk be damned. He was playing to win, period, and by the rules. Nobody's fault. But time for those rules to change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Baseball becomes contact sport when catcher blocks plate to keep runner from scoring .

"(CNN) -- One of the most high-profile appointments President Obama will make in his second term is the director of the CIA. Here's a tip for the president: The time is ripe for the first woman to head the agency. Choosing a woman isn't just about narrowing the intelligence community gender gap. It's also about drawing from the whole pool of talent to ensure the best national security apparatus and responding to Americans' apparent desire for more women in government. Here are the Top 10 reasons President Obama should name a woman as the next CIA director. 1) It would inspire more women to enter the fields of foreign policy and intelligence. The intelligence and foreign policy community is predominantly male. According to a 2009 report published by Women in International Security, women comprise about 13% of the Senior Intelligence Service, and between 21% and 29% of key agencies that grapple with national security matters, like the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Defense. That should be rectified. 2) The November 6 elections showed Americans want to see more women in senior government positions. Women make up 20% of the Senate, a historic high. Overall, the next Congress will have almost 100 women. 3) Women at the CIA are increasingly playing significant behind-the-scenes counterterrorism roles.  Women were instrumental in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Mike Scheuer, the first chief of the CIA's first unit focused on tracking bin Laden, has noted that female intelligence analysts were integral in the first captures of senior al Qaeda leaders after 9/11. In his book ""Manhunt,"" al Qaeda expert and CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen writes, ""The prominent role that women played in the hunt for bin Laden was reflective of the largest cultural shift at the CIA in the past two decades."" Bergen: Tough choice for Obama on Petraeus' successor . 4) Appointing a woman could assist on the public relations front. The reputations of the intelligence and defense communities have been somewhat tarnished byevents surrounding the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus and the investigation of Gen. John Allen; a big change at the top could help. 5) It's a high-profile moment to appoint a woman as director. Pop culture reflects today's obsession with national security and intelligence issues. Media coverage of Petraeus' resignation and the attacks on the Benghazi consulate have fueled this interest. The movies ""Argo,"" ""Skyfall"" and the upcoming ""Zero Dark Thirty"" about the hunt for bin Laden, as well as Showtime's ""Homeland,"" have fed into the fascination with spying. Too bad the most-watched woman in national security, ""Homeland's"" protagonist Carrie Mathison, is fictional. 6) Motivating more women to join the community is a national security issue: Staying safe in a world with increasingly complex and transmuting threats requires intelligence leaders to recruit the best and brightest; tapping half the population isn't enough. 7) More women in senior intelligence and national security positions could have a positive impact in unanticipated ways. In general, diversity can help temper group-think, generate innovative problem-solving, bring new issues to the agenda and change meeting dynamics for the better. 8) Plenty of women are qualified for this role. Some examples: former Rep. Jane Harman, head of the Woodrow Wilson Center and former ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee; Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee; Hillary Clinton, secretary of state; Condoleezza Rice, former secretary of state; Anne-Marie Slaughter, former director of policy planning at the State Department; MichÃ¨le Flournoy, former under secretary of defense for policy and Frances Townsend, former homeland and counterterrorism adviser to President Bush and a CNN contributor, to name a few. Of course, many other senior women with less name recognition from within the intelligence community would be excellent candidates. 9) Women hold the top post in many other countries and it's time for the United States to catch up. Women hold the highest office, as president or prime minister, in Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Argentina, India, Australia, Brazil, Jamaica, Trinidad, Liberia and many other countries. Great Britain, Israel, Finland, France, Turkey, Pakistan, and many others have had women serve in those positions. The United States is still behind on this front and has another four years before this even becomes a possibility. 10) Once a woman is appointed to a top position, it opens the door to others with immense talent. Since President Clinton appointed Madeleine Albright to serve as the first female U.S. secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton followed. In a recent New Yorker article titled ""The CIA's Next Leader,"" Steve Coll writes: ""The United States has never had anyone but white men run the (CIA), the Pentagon, or the FBI -- an increasingly absurd and shameful record."" A woman at the helm of the CIA wouldn't simply make another crack in the intelligence glass ceiling, it could effectively shatter it. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Tara Maller.","Tara Maller says President Obama should appoint a woman as head of the CIA .
She says it would inspire more women to join an agency dominated by men .
Maller: Americans want more women in government, and many women are highly qualified .
It's time for a change as women play more and more prominent roles in intelligence, she says ."
"(CNN) -- Colleen Ritzer was the kind of high school teacher who made geometry and algebra classes fun. Just a few years older than her students, she used Twitter to send homework assignments and inspirational messages. Her Twitter profile description read: ""Math teacher often too excited about the topics I'm teaching."" Ritzer's lifeless body was found in woods near Danvers High School early Wednesday morning. Prosecutors in Massachusetts charged one of her students, Philip Chism, 14, with beating the 24-year-old teacher to death. Ritzer was ""a dynamic and brilliant ray of light,"" the school district's statement said. ""Colleen Ritzer was everything one could ask for in a teacher -- dedicated, passionate and invested in her students. Our entire community will feel this loss for many years to come."" Family, friends and her students echoed those sentiments over and over again Wednesday as they struggled to comprehend the loss. ""She was just a young caring girl who had whole world ahead of her,"" her uncle Peter Martellucci told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""And to be taken so tragically, it's awful."" Ritzer's aunt, Shirley Martellucci, said her niece never had any trouble with students. ""She always wanted to be a teacher, all her life. It's just unbelievable that someone would take her life at such a young age."" At a vigil Wednesday night, students were visibly distraught as they remembered their beloved teacher. ""There were no words that could describe how upset and heartbroken everyone was from the loss of Ms. Ritzer,"" student Brianna Wallis told CNN's Piers Morgan. A statement by her family called Ritzer an ""amazing, beautiful daughter and sister."" ""Everyone that knew and loved Colleen knew of her passion for teaching and how she mentored each and every one of her students."" Her family asked for privacy ""at this most difficult time,"" but Ritzer's social network postings offer insight into her personality and passions. Teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens . Ritzer loved 'Home Alone,' 1990s sitcoms, math . Ritzer's idea of a great night apparently was watching ""Home Alone"" for the hundredth time or a marathon of ""Full House"" or ""Boy Meets World"" episodes on television. ""Sunday note: Home Alone is the best holiday movie ever made :)"" she tweeted in December. While it's her name now in the latest tragic headlines, she mourned when 26 students and adults were killed by a lone gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. ""Such a devastating, unbelievable tragedy in CT. Please keep the innocent children, teachers, and their families in your thoughts,"" Ritzer tweeted that day. When the Boston Marathon was interrupted by bombs in April, Ritzer wrote: ""This world is a crazy place. Love who you love and live every day. Thoughts and prayers to those affected at the Boston Marathon."" She also posted a quote she credited to the late children's TV host Mr. Rogers: ""I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.' "" On last month's anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, she tweeted: ""Always thinking of the innocent victims of 9/11 and the loved ones left behind who live in their light every day."" She also used Twitter to share her philosophy on life and tough times: ""Every day may not be good, but there is something good in every day."" ""No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind."" To students in her geometry and algebra classes, she once wrote: ""Full school week ahead. That can only mean one thing: lots of math fun :)"" 'She cared about every single student' When Ritzer took the job at Danvers High School, it meant she could live with her parents in Andover about 15 miles away. This would save money as she also worked on a master's degree in school counseling at Salem State University. ""As a dedicated teacher, Colleen wanted to work with and help children with special needs,"" an e-mail from Salem State University read. ""She believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals. In her application to Salem State she said she was dedicated to 'helping students in times of need.'"" After graduating magna cum laude from Assumption College in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 2011, her first teaching job was at a middle school. Former colleague and friend Charlotte Dzerkacz told CNN on Wednesday that she knew after just her first few weeks that she wanted to be a teacher for the rest of her life. ""She was energetic and compassionate,"" Dzerkacz said. ""You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend. She cared about every single student and put in many hours after school every day, always thinking about how she could be better and better help students. She was truly a beautiful person."" Ritzer ""always had a smile on her face"" and ""was extremely approachable, so I don't know how she could be the target of something like this,"" Dzerkacz said. Her students were shattered by the loss. ""There's not words to describe her,"" freshman Spencer Wade said. ""She's such an excellent teacher."" Kyle Cahill, another Danvers student, said Ritzer was the kind of teacher who would go the extra mile for her students and would routinely stay late after school to provide extra help. When student Alex Taylor celebrated his birthday last week, Ritzer tweeted to him: ""Happy Birthday! Hope you had a great day :)"" Taylor tweeted about her Wednesday: ""Actually unbelievable, one of my favorite teachers ever, a great teacher and a great person #RIP"" Chris Weimert said he was just visiting with Ritzer in her classroom on Monday. ""It's just surreal that how quickly someone can go, and how much we take for granted everyday,"" Weimert said. Just days before this school year began, Ritzer posted a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson on her Facebook page. It resonated Wednesday: ""To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded."" CNN's Alexis Weiss contributed to this report.","Colleen Ritzer ""always wanted to be a teacher,"" an aunt says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Citing economic progress and other achievements, President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the contention that 2013 was the worst year of his presidency. Polls show Obama's approval rating at record lows for the nearly five years he's been in office, but he told reporters at a year-end news conference that his concern is whether things are getting better for the American people. ""If you're measuring this by polls, my polls have gone up and down a lot through the course of my career,"" Obama said. ""If I was interested in polling, I wouldn't have run for President."" Instead, he cited continuing economic growth after the recession he inherited when he took office in January 2009 and other progress, such as more than 1 million people signing up for health insurance so far under the controversial reforms he championed. ""That is a big deal. That's why I ran for this office,"" Obama said. Nagging controversies . Later in the news conference that lasted just over an hour, he shrugged off persistent questions about controversies involving Obamacare, government surveillance and other issues with a rudimentary summation of how he sees his administration's role. ""We get this privilege for a pretty short period of time to do as much as we can for as many people as we can to help them live better lives,"" Obama said. At the end, he wished the assembled journalists happy holidays and walked out a few hours before the first family's trip to Hawaii on Friday night. Obama can't be sad to see 2013 ending. His legislative agenda outlined in his inauguration address last January after winning re-election and his State of the Union speech a few weeks later made little headway in the divided Congress. Classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed details of U.S. surveillance efforts that raised questions about whether the government spied on its own people. Then came the botched rollout in October of the new HealthCare.gov website. Instead of cementing Obama's legacy as the President who helped uninsured Americans get affordable health coverage, the dysfunctional website opened the 2010 Affordable Care Act to a new wave of attacks by Republicans seeking to dismantle the reforms. Obama frustration . Obama acknowledged the website problems caused ""great frustration,"" but he rejected GOP claims the overall reform law was failing and should be scrapped. Asked what was his biggest mistake of 2013, the President cited the website woes and accepted responsibility, saying: ""Since I'm in charge, obviously we screwed it up."" Another disappointment cited by the President was the inability to get any of his main legislative priorities of 2013 passed by Congress, and he called for 2014 to be a ""year of action"" on immigration reform, job creation, expanded background checks on gun purchasers and extending long-term unemployment benefits. ""We head into next year with an economy that's stronger than it was at the start of the year,"" Obama said. ""I firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America."" Noting a compromise budget agreement recently passed by Congress after two years of partisan impasses on government spending, Obama said: ""It's probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it's also fair to say that we're not condemned to endless gridlock."" However, he refused to budge in his rejection of Republican calls for concessions in return for their agreement to increase the federal borrowing limit -- known as the debt ceiling -- when required as soon as early March. ""No, we're not going to negotiate for Congress to pay bills that it has accrued,"" Obama said. ""It is not a negotiating tool."" NSA snooping . Asked about the NSA surveillance, Obama defended the government collection of telephone metadata -- records of the time and numbers called with no information on content -- revealed by Snowden's classified leaks. He said he would make ""a pretty definitive"" decision in January on recommendations from an independent panel that advised stronger oversight and transparency for the surveillance network without dismantling it. However, Obama added that ""what is also clear from the public debate, people are concerned about the possibility of abuse,"" such as someone listening in on their phone calls. ""This is only going to work if the American people have confidence and trust,"" he said, adding there had been no alleged instances of the NSA acting beyond its legal authority in the use of data it collects.

"(CNN) -- Apple's Mac Pro, the high-end show horse of the company's desktop line, goes on sale Thursday, restoring some luster to deskbound computers that have been overshadowed by the mobile revolution. In some ways the Mac Pro, which will be available for preorder on Apple's website and Apple stores, is like the fancy haute couture dresses that get walked down the runways of Paris and New York. At more than $3,000, the sleek machine is more computer than most people need or can afford. But it serves as a showcase for what its creator can do. ""Can't innovate any more, my ass,"" Apple Vice President Phil Schiller said when he unveiled the new Mac Pro in June. It was a response to some analysts who say rivals like Samsung and Google have been rolling out fresher ideas than Apple the past couple of years. The Mac Pro certainly doesn't look like anything else on the market. It's a silver and black cylinder and stands just 10 inches tall. Packing a range of Intel Xeon processors, the new Mac Pro is more than twice as fast as its predecessor, released three years ago, Apple says. And, starting at $2,999 (with custom modifications that could push prices upward of $12,000), it's for a select group of power users like graphic designers, photographers, videographers, animators and the like. The machine has six of Apple's Thunderbolt 2 ports, enabling up to 36 external devices to be attached. Apple says the Mac Pro has been designed and manufactured in the United States. Pro users are a small part of Apple's overall business. Only 19% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of this year came from Macs. That's just shy of the 21% it made selling iPads, and a far cry from the 49% Apple made on the iPhone.","Apple's new Mac Pro starts at $2,999 .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan were held to a drab goalless draw by Genoa in the San Siro on Sunday to leave them four points clear of arch-rivals AC Milan in Serie A. It proved a frustrating night for the reigning champions and in particular their coach Jose Mourinho, who was serving the second of a three-match touchline ban. He fielded a three-strong attack of Mario Balotelli, Goran Pandev and Diego Milito, but they drew blank against a determined visiting side. Only in the closing minutes did Inter threaten with Maicon, striking substitute Samuel Eto'o and Wesley Sneijder going close. Inter moved to 59 points, with Milan their nearest challengers after being held goalless by AS Roma on Saturday. In other action on Sunday, Palermo stepped up their campaign for a Champions League place with a 1-0 win over Livorno. Fabrizio Miccoli's goal nine minutes from the end took the Sicilians into fourth place in Serie A, two points clear of Juventus, . Palermo beat Juve in Turin last weekend in a match which could prove crucial in the battle for qualification. Sampdoria are in sixth, a point further back, after a 2-1 home win over Lazio. The struggling visitors took a seventh-minute lead through Sergio Floccari but goals later in the first half from Stefano Guberti and Giampaolo Pazzini were enough to give Samp the three points. Napoli continued to slip down the table after a 2-1 defeat at Bologna, with Marcelo Zalayeta and Brazilian Adailton scoring early goals to claim the three points.","Inter Milan held to a goalless draw by Genoa in San Siro .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday that South Sudan ""stands at the precipice,"" as deadly clashes spread in Africa's newest nation. He spoke out the same day government officials said rebels have taken the town of Bor. The town, which lies about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital, Juba, was under heavy shelling, said Col. Philip Aguer, an army spokesman. Bor Mayor Mhial Majak Mhial said the town was under rebel control and heavy artillery was in use. ""In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people,"" Obama said in a statement. ""In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history. ""Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past,"" the President said. Amid violence this week, Obama sent 45 U.S. service members to South Sudan. In a letter to Congress, he said the troops were deployed ""to support the security of U.S. personnel and our Embassy."" The State Department said earlier this week that U.S. citizens currently in South Sudan should leave immediately, and it ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel. Obama stressed that leaders in South Sudan have a choice. ""South Sudan's leaders must recognize that compromise with one's political enemy is difficult; but recovering from unchecked violence and unleashed hatred will prove much harder,"" he said. The fighting has been spreading in South Sudan after a reported coup attempt in Juba over the weekend. President Salva Kiir has blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president, Riek Machar, for starting the violence. ""The government has lost control of Jonglei state to the forces of Col. Machar and his group,"" government representative Ateny Wek Ateny told CNN, referring to the state where Bor is situated. The government could not yet confirm the number of fatalities from the violence, but ""casualties are in the hundreds, including army forces and civilians,"" Ateny said. The government tweeted that its troops had lost control of Bor and that it was doing all it could to ""make sure citizens are secure & safe."" Earlier, Joseph Contreras, acting spokesman for the U.N. mission in South Sudan, told CNN the situation in Bor was ""still unstable."" The violence, which the government said Wednesday has killed about 500 people, began Sunday evening. In an interview with the online Paris-based Sudan Tribune published Wednesday, Machar denied Kiir's claims that he was behind an attempted coup, saying: ""There was no coup. What took place in Juba was a misunderstanding between presidential guards within their division."" Kiir told reporters Thursday he was ready for dialogue ""with anyone who is willing."" Attack on U.N. base . Also Thursday, unknown assailants attacked a U.N. base in South Sudan, possibly killing or injuring civilians who had sought refuge from the fighting. The attack happened on the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) base in Akobo. ""There are indications that civilians may have been killed and wounded in the attack, but this remains to be verified. Should these reports prove true, those responsible must be held accountable for their crimes,"" read a U.N. statement. At the time of the attack, 43 Indian peacekeepers, six U.N. police advisers and two U.N. civilian staffers were present at the base. UNMISS has more than 6,800 troops and police in the country. The deepening crisis has alarmed South Sudan's neighbors, prompting African nations to send mediators. The African Union said the team was made up of ministers and high-level officials from Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and other countries -- the first major peace initiative since clashes first erupted. Tensions high . Tensions have been high in South Sudan since Kiir dismissed his entire Cabinet, including Machar, in July. The move further inflamed deep tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. U.N. officials have said they are worried the recent fighting is based on ethnic divisions. Citing reports it had received, Human Rights Watch said Thursday that in the fighting in Juba, South Sudanese soldiers fired indiscriminately in highly populated areas and targeted people for their ethnicity. According to witnesses and victims, soldiers specifically targeted people from the Nuer ethnic group, it said, adding that it had also received reports that Nuer soldiers may have targeted ethnic Dinka in Juba and in the town of Bor. ""The awful accounts of killings in Juba may only be the tip of the iceberg,"" Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""Government officials -- whatever their politics -- need to take urgent steps to prevent further abuses against civilians and quickly deescalate rising ethnic tensions. ... We are deeply concerned that ethnically-based attacks on all sides will lead to revenge attacks and more violence."" It was not immediately possible to independently verify the reports. Government officials have disputed that the fighting is along ethnic lines. Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth said Wednesday that people from different states and tribes rose up against the government, which is now fighting back. Eleven people have been arrested in connection with the foiled coup, according to a statement the South Sudan government posted Thursday. Two of them were from the Nuer community, it said. Tens of thousands displaced . Up to 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting so far, according to Defense Minister Gen. John Kong Nyuon. Many of the displaced people have crossed the Nile River, he said, adding that he feared a humanitarian disaster was unfolding. On Wednesday, South Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said order had been restored in the country, adding that government forces were in charge and flights had resumed at Juba International Airport. U.N. officials have expressed deep concern about the unrest, saying as many as 35,000 people have taken shelter at the organization's compounds. The U.S. and Britain have both sent planes to airlift their nationals out of the country. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been reaching out to key leaders seeking a political end to the crisis. The U.N. Security Council has urged all parties to immediately cease hostilities and exercise restraint to prevent the further spread of violence. South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country.

The 28-year-old songstress from Kingston, Jamaica, triumphed over third-place finalist Will Champlin and runner-up Jacquie Lee, with her performance of Whitney Houston's ""I Have Nothing"" on Monday night's show being the icing on a season of top-notch performances. After her big win, Chin was left in ""just complete and utter shock,"" she told CNN. ""Those moments you're standing there waiting for (host) Carson (Daly) to say your name are torture.

"(CNN) -- On September 27, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had a 15-minute phone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama. This was a historic moment, breaking a 34-year spell, and roundly applauded in Washington and Tehran. There was, however, one notable exception. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the head of the elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), promptly called the Obama-Rouhani phone conversation a ""tactical mistake."" The Iranian president, according to Jafari, should have waited to make such a call until after ""America's sincerity"" in negotiating with Iran ""can be proven,"" as he put it. Many in Tehran interpreted Jafari's comment -- not as goodhearted advice on foreign policy strategy -- but as a slap on the wrist on President Rouhani. Anxious supporters of Rouhani now wonder if the Revolutionary Guards will soon have an open season against the eight-week-old Rouhani administration and kill off any hope for U.S.-Iran dÃ©tente before it is given a proper shot. After all, the IRGC generals see themselves as the epicenter of anti-Americanism in the Islamic Republic. Look at the Iranian political formation and you will see that when Jafari speaks it matters. He is the top general in Iran's top military-political force. He answers directly to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who appointed Jafari back in 2007. And on Jafari's watch, the Revolutionary Guards have entered the realm of politics as never before. These days the IRGC generals regularly face off all other factions in Iran's Byzantine bureaucratic setup. Green movement . Just take developments since 2009 as an illustration. During the heyday of Iran's Green opposition movement, triggered by the disputed presidential elections in June 2009, won by the incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the IRGC took the lead in cracking down on the anti-regime -- and anti-Ahmadinejad -- protesters. In the months that followed, hundreds of protesters were arrested and scores allegedly killed in the clampdown. The IRGC generals went out of their way to brand the leaders of the Green movement as traitors, as foreign agents and spearheads of ""seditionists."" Read more: Iranian lawmakers call for execution of leaders . To the generals it mattered little that these Green leaders had at one point been pillars of the same Islamist system. Now that they were questioning the wisdom of the regime's policies they had to be punished, and harsh punishments were duly handed out. The two main Green leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi, a former prime minister, and Mehdi Karroubi, a former speaker of the parliament, have been under house arrest since February 2011. But while the IRGC's brutal intervention in 2009 secured Ahmadinejad's second term as president, they soon turned on him too. As Ahmadinejad began to wander off on his own political path, the IRGC by late 2010 began to denounce him as an imposter. He was denounced as the head of the ""Deviant Current,"" a catchall phrase that IRGC gladly now applied to the supporters of the same Ahmadinejad they had gone out of their way to keep in the presidential palace. Ahmadinjead hit back and famously labeled the top IRGC generals as his ""smuggler brothers,"" a jab at the illicit economic activities of the IRGC cartel, and ask them to stay out of politics. But the already unpopular and now weakened Ahmadinejad could not outshine the senior men from the Revolutionary Guards. Not while they still had Khamenei's blessing. On August 3, Ahmadinejad left the presidential palace but the IRGC generals are still looming large. 'Heroic flexibility' But not even Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's utmost power, is immune to IRGC's predatory ways. On September 17, Khamenei told a group of IRGC commanders that he is not against ""heroic flexibility"" when confronted by adversaries. Everyone understood this phrase to mean that Tehran should now be open to serious negotiations over its nuclear program. Rouhani shortly after flew to New York, emboldened that he had Khamenei's full backing to open a new round of talks with the Americans and the other nations in the P5+1 group. But not everyone in Tehran was on message. Two days before Rouhani's much-anticipated U.N. speech, an IRGC general sought to throw some cold water on the buzz around Rouhani and his mission of seeking dÃ©tente with the United States. In a statement that seemed to question Khamenei's directive from a week earlier, the general said Iran ""will not make any heroic exercise in regards to [its] nuclear rights."" The man behind those words is General Hossein Salami, the second-in-command in the IRGC. Salami and his boss Jafari and the other IRGC generals know better than openly defy the wishes of Khamenei. This is why they go about it cautiously. They do not explicitly condemn Rouhani for talking to Obama, but call it a ""tactical mistake."" They don't say Ayatollah Khamenei's idea of ""heroic exercise"" is a bad one, but say it cannot apply to the one topic that matters, Iran's nuclear program. If Khamenei wants to instil ""heroic flexibility"" in Iranian diplomacy, simply because the sanctions are bleeding Iran and his regime to death and he needs a way out -- then the IRGC generals do not have it in them to shoot down the trial balloons that he has launched. The IRGC generals are politically not that powerful that they can override the Supreme Leader. But it is very obvious that the IRGC generals do not like any thawing in Iran's strained relations with the United States. They are principal stakeholders in the Iranian regime and fearful they will lose out if the status quo is somehow transformed. The question is whether the generals will sit fuming at the sidelines and limit themselves to critiquing attempts to overhaul Iran's foreign policy or actively look for ways to sabotage it. Supporters of Rouhani and his foreign policy agenda suspect sabotage and even violence. As Rouhani returned from New York, his motorcade came under attack by hardliners just as he was leaving Mehr Abad Airport in Tehran. This could be a harbinger of more to come. Read more: Shoe thrown at Rouhani -- report . This week former President Mohammad Khatami warned about the return of ""terror"" of the 1990s when reformist candidates were frequently hounded and sometimes assassinated. ""These are not random but organized operations, he warned. There is no doubt that he had the IRGC generals in mind too when he said that. Sanctions . In the fast unfolding saga of U.S.-Iran relations, the IRGC generals can be expected to play the role of a spoiler for some time to come. This reality no doubt disheartens the supporters of Rouhani. But the IRGC generals are just that, namely spoilers. They have not presented a single credible blueprint for Iran's to come out of international isolation and ways to stop the plummeting economic conditions. They have put on the old mantle of the armed defender of Iranian nation but no foreign armies are lining up to invade. The IRGC generals still look for legitimacy by pointing back at the role they played in defending Iran against Saddam Hussein's invading army during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War. But Iran's conflict today is not comparable to the circumstances of the Iran-Iraq War. Iran is bleeding today because there is a global economic sanction regime against it, backed by a strong international consensus. Ayatollah Khamenei, certainly never a fan of the West or the United States, grasps the difference. That is why he conceded to the need for ""heroic flexibility"" and looking for ways to break the stalemate. That is why Rouhani says he has the Supreme Leader's full backing to negotiate with the world. And unless the IRGC generals can come up with an alternative narrative for the way forward for Iran, then all they can do is sabotage Rouhani's efforts and hope that they can get away with it.

"(CNN) -- In retrospect, there were plenty of signs that something was wrong: reports of a naked woman roaming the backyard. A child peering from an attic in a house where no children lived. Sealed windows, muffled screams and accounts of what sounded like people pounding on the walls from inside. But the incidents were spread out over years. Even now, it is not precisely clear who saw what or when. Attempts to report the odd occurrences to the police seem to have been sporadic, and the police response appears to have been equally limited. So, after a while, 2207 Seymour Ave. would lapse back into silence, with no one opening the door to knocks and nothing amiss that a fresh coat of paint could not fix. It was indeed so silent much of the time that some neighbors thought no one lived there. The house that Ariel Castro bought more than 20 years ago for $12,000 is in itself unremarkable. Built in 1890, it is situated in one of Cleveland's oldest neighborhoods, Tremont, and real estate records indicate that the house underwent a major renovation in the 1950s. With a little over 1,400 square feet of living space, it is neither unusually large nor small. It has a detached garage and two porches: the front one small and open, the back one enclosed. It holds two floors, an attic and a basement. If you walked in through the front door that Amanda Berry used for her escape, you would be greeted by a staircase going up directly ahead of you and a small living room to the left. Tito DeJesus (no relation to one of the women being held, who has the same surname) walked through that door. ""He kept his musical instruments in the living room,"" DeJesus said of the owner, Castro. ""He was a bass player."" Timeline: From missing to liberated . As a fellow musician, DeJesus went inside the house three times to see Castro. He described a few simple pieces of furniture, a sofa and a chair or two. He notes that Castro kept his bass, amplifier and speaker out in the living room, where he could easily pick them up and play, and that that room led directly into the dining room, and from there, a closed door led to the kitchen in back. The house was reasonably tidy when DeJesus stopped by and ""quiet ... like it was empty."" Upstairs, where one witness occasionally saw a woman looking out from a window before it was covered over, real estate records suggest there are four bedrooms and the only bathroom. No one who has been voluntarily up there has come forward with any details of the architecture or descriptions of the attic. And nothing is known about the basement, which a witness says can be reached by stairs that run underneath the staircase that leads to the second floor. A local construction and home repair worker who has been in the neighborhood for years says typically, basements here are made of ""unfinished concrete blocks ... or sometimes cut stone"" and hold ""the guts of the house,"" meaning the furnace, water heater and sometimes the electrical boxes. Usually, due to the sandy nature of the surrounding soil, basements here are made smaller than the houses above, and he adds, ""they all leak."" Police deny neighbors called about suspicious activity . That is what we know about the Castro house. But it is the unknowns that have the neighbors sitting up late, talking, and wondering how it could be. Where were the chains and ropes that police say were used to bind those three women? Are the stories of padlocked doors true? Were the women and that child kept together or apart? What, if any, sort of mental games were used to dissuade them from escaping a place that from the outside looks so easy to slip away from? That last question may prove very important in solving the mystery. There have been cases in which kidnappers have instilled such fear of reprisal in their victims -- by making all pay painfully for the transgressions of one -- that the hostages wind up essentially forced to control each other. All that is certain is this: The evidence suggests that for a long time, these women were held undetected inside a seemingly normal house, on a normal street, while the homeowner saw neighbors, entertained their kids, ate at McDonald's and appeared perfectly normal. That does not make the house on Seymour Avenue haunted, but it certainly makes it haunting.","The house where three women were found appeared normal from the outside .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- After 10 days of mourning and thousands of emotional eulogies and speeches, South Africa finally buried its most famous son, Nelson Mandela, on Sunday at his rural village of Qunu in the Eastern Cape. Speaking at the funeral, Ahmed Kathrada, Mandela's close comrade and a man he spent 26 of his 27 years in prison with, brought tears to the 4,500 assembled dignitaries and the nation when he concluded his eulogy: . ""When Walter [Sisulu, another Rivonia trialist with whom the two were imprisoned] died I lost a father. Now I have lost a brother. My life is in a void and I don't know who to turn to."" Today the country blinks the tears away from its eyes and confronts its own void: Mandela is gone, and what now? South Africa is a country adrift. Despite the admirable peace and stability of the past 20 years, storm clouds are looming for the nation today led by President Jacob Zuma, Mandela's third successor. Mandela's passing will not herald any shock new direction, but his funeral took place against the backdrop of massive political and economic disappointment, most powerfully demonstrated by the booing of Zuma -- for traditional Africans an unprecedented break with culture -- at Mandela's memorial service at the FNB stadium on December 10. The spat over the apparent failure by government to make proper arrangements for Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu -- a fierce Zuma critic -- to attend Mandela's funeral added to perceptions that a small coterie of arrogant, out-of-touch leaders around Zuma were at the helm of the country. In the same week, Parliament published a notorious new secrecy law (the Protection of State Information Act) which will criminalize whistleblowers and journalists for exposing stories such as the spending of ZAR208-million ($20M) of taxpayer funds on Zuma's rural palace in his home village, Nkandla. Zuma ascended to power in 2009 with promises of jobs for the poor, but unemployment has stubbornly hovered at 25%. About 52.8% of young people under 34 are on the streets. The economy is in trouble, with growth forecasts cut again and again over the past four years. Third quarter growth was an anaemic 0.7%, and full-year GDP growth is forecast at 1.9% by most economists, while the rest of South Africa's peers such as Nigeria forge ahead at growth rates of about 5.6%. Perceptions of corruption are on the rise, says the non-governmental organization Corruption Watch. The country slipped three places in Transparency International's corruption index this year to 72nd out of 177 countries. Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor who was removed from the presidency by Zuma in 2008, said last week that there was increasing frustration among ordinary people about the direction the country was taking. ""So when they look at some of the things that are happening....when they see this corruption in the country, which seems to be increasing at all levels of government, the people are aggrieved. They are saying but this is not what freedom was for,"" he said. The 10-day period of Mandela's mourning amplified Mbeki's words. 'Fake interpreter' scandal . The now internationally notorious ""fake interpreter"" at Mandela's memorial, for example, has extensive links with the ruling ANC: he is employed at a company owned by the party's religious desk chief. The man is not proficient in sign language. He is also schizophrenic -- and he stood a meter from some of the world's most powerful leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama. Not a single person has been sanctioned for hiring him, seven days after the scandal broke. Ordinary South Africans inured to corruption told me last week that they have no doubt that his hiring was corruptly influenced. Apart from shining a harsh new light on our current leaders' failings, though, there is an added silver lining to Mandela's death. Members of the ruling ANC and society are now asking questions about the current crop of leaders' ability to get South Africa out of its current slump. As Mandela was buried, the big political question is whether Zuma's presidency -- wracked by scandal and presiding over a protest for services such as water and electricity every second day -- would survive after he was booed in front of the international media and more than 91 heads of states and dignitaries. Zuma has a firm grip on his party's machinery (he was re-elected with 74% of the votes at the party conference in December 2012), but he is increasingly seen as a liability by party insiders. A snap poll by South Africa's largest weekend newspaper, the Sunday Times, published on the day of Mandela's funeral, shows that 51% of registered ANC voters believe Zuma should resign following widespread coverage of the use of taxpayers money to build his rural palace. South Africa's fifth democratic elections will be held in the next six months, and although analysts expect the ANC to win without much trouble, few expect the party to hold on to its huge majority. From its current 65.9% the ANC's support could fall to less than 60% according to one group. Is South Africa about to descend into racial conflagration because Mandela is gone, though? Doomsayers have beaten this drum many times before in the past 19 years, even when Mandela left government in 1999. It has not come to pass, and is a scenario that is unlikely. The real challenges for South Africa today are poverty, inequality and unemployment. Zuma's presidency has failed to implement necessary structural changes -- the ANC is in alliance with the powerful trade union federation Cosatu and kowtows to it on labour policy, leading to government paralysis -- to create jobs and economic growth. Education is poor -- last year the government failed to deliver textbooks to some pupils for up to nine months. The young are ubiquitous on the streets and they are now being attracted in significant numbers by the young, former ANC radical Julius Malema's breakaway party Economic Freedom Fighters. It advocates Zimbabwe-style nationalization and land grabs. It is highly unlikely that these challenges will unseat Mandela's ANC from power - yet. However, with Mandela gone and the halo of the liberation era slowly slipping away, coupled with revulsion in many quarters of the rampant corruption and stasis of the current regime, a change is coming. For many here, that change will come with the 2019 national elections. In the meantime, South Africa will have a noisy election in 2014, remain on an unremarkable growth path and fail to live up to the promise it showed when Mandela became president in 1994. It is a path that the unemployed young, standing at the fence outside the largesse enjoyed by their leaders, may one day want to tilt at unless something is done, urgently, to improve their lives.","After Nelson Mandela's death, South Africa is a country adrift, says Justice Malala .

"(CNN) -- Visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese officials, including the younger brother of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, ignited criticism from China and Korea, which see the visits as an homage to Japan's past wartime aggressions. Over the weekend several officials, including Abe's brother, senior vice foreign minister Nobuo Kishi, visited the shrine, according to Kyodo News. The visits started last week as part of an autumn festival and included 159 members of the Diet, Japan's national legislature. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe refrained from visiting the shrine, but sent an offering. An editorial in Global Times, a Chinese state-run newspaper, blasted Japanese officials for their deference to the shrine. ""Chinese and Koreans will never accept the Yasukuni Shrine, whether it is a matter of rationality or sensibility. No matter how much trade with Japan grows, or how interdependent their economies are, the positive elements are flushed away once the Japanese politicians stage a group show at the shrine,"" it stated. The Japanese lawmakers who went to the shrine defended their decision to go to the site where 14 of Japan's Class-A war criminals from World War II are enshrined with thousands of Japanese soldiers. The group insisted the visits have been misrepresented by the foreign media and that the shrine is where Japanese visitors go to ""pray for peace."" The site, built in 1869, enshrines those who ""devoted their lives to their country,"" the group said in a statement. Past visits by Japanese prime ministers and other political leaders to Yasukuni Shrine have ignited a firestorm of controversy with China as well as North Korea and South Korea. The shrine is regarded by those nations as a symbol of Japan's imperial military past. The visits are seen as honoring war criminals and denying its atrocities in Asia. Millions of Chinese civilians and soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of Koreans died in wartime. The Japanese lawmakers who visited the shrine remained unapologetic. In 2012: Shrine visit could inflame tensions between Japan, China . ""How the war dead are commemorated is determined according to each country's own culture and tradition,"" the group stated. ""This long tradition of homage and commemoration is a matter of national sovereignty and should not be subjected to distortion by outside interference and propaganda."" Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan, described the shrines as ""the talismanic ground zero of the unrepentant view of Japan's wartime history."" ""To say that they're going there only to venerate the war dead is disingenuous on their part,"" he said. ""On the conservative side, they cheer them on, because they represent a voice that finds Japan's war crimes as justifiable. On the left, the newspapers like Asahi or Mainichi are quite critical of these visits, precisely because of the political mischief intended,"" Kingston said. An editorial published in the Japanese newspaper, The Asahi Shimbun last week called on Abe to ""establish a new way to pay a tribute to the war dead that allows Japanese to remember them quietly and comfortably and does not cause diplomatic friction."" It stated: ""We cannot support visits to the shrine by the prime minister or other political leaders."" On Sunday, Abe's cabinet minister Keiji Furuya visited the Yasukuni Shrine and maintained that he did not want to ""irritate neighboring nations."" But he also added that, ""Offering condolence to the heroic souls that sacrificed their lives for the country and pledging for the peace for Japan and the world is a natural duty for a national Diet member."" Chinese officials summoned the Japanese ambassador to the country last week to voice its displeasure. A spokesman for the South Korean foreign ministry expressed ""deep concerns and regret."" The cycle of Japanese politicians visiting Yasukuni, prompting foreign criticisms, is well-worn. ""In a sense, if the Chinese government or Korean government criticizes Japan for doing this, this gives them (Japanese politicians) attention. And then they can say to voters, 'These countries are trying to bully us, they're interfering with our internal affairs.' In a way, it creates a dynamic and they feed off the criticism in some sort of odd way,"" Kingston said. Polls in Japan, he said, indicate that most oppose the shrine visits by the prime minister. Whether Abe will visit the controversial shrine remains a source of constant speculation in east Asia. Michiaki Okuyama, the director of Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture, said approximately half of the general population support the shrine. ""Especially under the heating-up of nationalism in the current East-Asian context, the number of supporters among the general public might have been growing,"" he said. ""If this is the case, some politicians may well think that visiting Yasukuni can help in their re-election."" Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel paid their respects, laying wreaths at the Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Tokyo, which sits less than a mile away from Yasukuni. The secular cemetery holds the remains of unknown Japanese soldiers and citizens who died overseas during World War II. The Americans' visit was seen by many as suggesting an alternative to venerating the war dead at Yasukuni. ""I think Abe has heard that message,"" Kingston said. ""He has refrained from going to Yasukuni in the spring, summer and fall festivals. I think he gets it, that not only it would complicate relations between Japan and it neighbors, but also its most important ally, the U.S."" CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report from Tokyo.","Several Japanese officials and lawmakers visited controversial shrine .

"(CNN) -- From Wall Street to the City of London, the world of finance has long been marred by a gender imbalance in the coveted C-suite. But Lloyd's of London, the oldest insurance market in the world, took the sector by surprise when it named industry veteran Inga Beale as the next CEO -- the first ever female to take on the role in the organization's 325 year history. On the heels of Lloyd's historic appointment, CNN names some fellow female financial trailblazers also making an impact on the world economy. Inga Beale . When Inga Beale joins Lloyd's of London this January, she will become the first ever female chief executive to lead the insurance market in its 325-year-old history. With a slew of international experience built up over her 30-year career, she most recently served as group chief executive of Canopius, a privately held Lloyd's insurer. Beale also worked as the global chief underwriting officer at Zurich Insurance. Taking over from current CEO Richard Ward, she will be responsible for pushing through the tech modernization drive along with boosting growth in Latin America and Asia. Sri Mulyani Indrawati . Since serving as Indonesia's minister of finance and coordinating minister of economic affairs, Sri Mulyani Indrawati has moved to the international stage with a senior leadership role at the World Bank. Joining in 2010, she became the managing director and chief operating officer for the prestigious international finance institution where her role involves providing financial capital to developing countries -- the World Bank's ultimate goal of reducing world poverty. Christine Lagarde . As managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde has become a force majeure in the world of global finance. In 2007, she became the first woman in France to serve as minister of finance, economy and trade -- experience which seems to have proven invaluable since assuming the top job from Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the IMF in June 2011. Janet Yellen . Upon Senate confirmation, Janet Yellen is poised to become the first female chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve when current head Ben Bernanke steps down in January. She has extensive experience as a public servant -- she currently serves as Bernanke's deputy in a role she has held for the last three years. Her longstanding career in academia has also put her in good stead to assume leadership of the central bank. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala . Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has had an impressive career serving as Nigeria's finance minister and then briefly Foreign Affairs Minister -- the first woman to hold either position. A graduate of Harvard, she earned a Ph.D. in regional economics and development at MIT and then spent 21 years as a development economist at the World Bank working her way up to managing director. As Nigeria's current finance minister, she has continued to work to fight corruption, bring transparency to the nation's finances and institute reforms to make the economy more attractive for foreign investment.

"You've been told for years that popping a multivitamin every day might help you live longer. But the daily multi habit has been getting a bit of bad press lately. Vitamins can help provide key nutrients for individuals whose diets are low on fruits and veggies. First, ConsumerLab.com, a watchdog of the supplement industry, found that more than half of the 21 multis it tested had too much (or too little) of certain vitamins -- or had been contaminated with dangerous substances such as lead. Then a controversial paper from researchers in Denmark and other European countries, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, made the claim that taking vitamins may actually shorten your life. What's the real story? Health talked to leading nutrition experts at Harvard and Tufts universities to find out and to get some answers on this and other confusing info about vitamins. Are multivitamins safe? Vitamins have been recommended for years because they help you get key nutrients if your diet's low on fruits and veggies -- and may even help prevent cancer and heart disease. And it's unlikely that one critical paper (speculating that vitamin supplements might upset your body's natural healing process and boost your risk of death) will change that. Health.com: Your vitamin cheat sheet . Longtime vitamin experts at Tufts University and the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University continue to say multis aren't dangerous and the paper's findings are wrong. The paper analyzed previous studies, including many with people who were sick before taking vitamins, so there's a good chance vitamins weren't responsible for shortening their lives. Experts say the paper also ignored two major studies that found vitamins reduced the risk of death. At the same time, the study from ConsumerLab.com shows that you can't assume just any vitamin is safe. Because there are no uniform manufacturing rules for supplements, a multi may not contain what the bottle claims, could be contaminated with something from the manufacturing plant, or might have tainted ingredients. Health.com: 20 antioxidant powerhouses . Your best bet: Avoid the vitamins singled out by ConsumerLab.com, and stick with mainstream names such as Centrum Silver and One-A-Day Women's, which were found to be free of impurities and accurately labeled. Also, check vitamin bottles for the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), NSF International (NSF), or ConsumerLab.com (CL) seals. The USP and NSF are nonprofit groups that verify whether companies offer contamination-free products and use good manufacturing practices. Not every brand has the seals -- some don't want to submit to testing--but those that do (Kirkland and Nature Made carry the USP seal, for instance) are reliable. How much should I spend to get the biggest benefits? Price isn't a sign of quality. In fact, some of the priciest vitamins -- like The Greatest Vitamin in the World and Eniva Vibe, which cost more than $39.95 per bottle -- failed the Consumer Lab.com tests. A mainstream brand such as One-A-Day Women's is $8.99 for a bottle of 100 tablets at drugstore.com, about 9 cents per day. How do I find the right multi for me? In your childbearing years, make sure your multi has 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid, which helps make and maintain new cells. And pregnant women should take a vitamin with 600 mcg of folic acid daily; this nutrient also reduces the incidence of neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. A premenopausal woman should look for a multivitamin with iron to replace the iron lost during menstruation. Menopausal women should go without the iron. ""Too much iron may raise the risk of heart disease,"" says Meir Stampfer, Ph.D., professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health. Health.com: A new way to ""pop"" your vitamins . If you're taking a prescription, check with your doctor about risky interactions. (Vitamin E, for instance, may be a problem if you're taking a blood thinner.) If you're a cancer patient, you should ask your doctor about risks before taking vitamins. ""Cancer cells need vitamins to grow, too,"" Stampfer says. Plus, some vitamins can interfere with chemotherapy. What's the best way to avoid that queasy feeling after taking a multi? ""Consider switching brands,"" Stampfer suggests. Trial and error is the best way to determine which brands won't break down poorly in your stomach and lead to irritation. Also, take your multi with food because your body needs some fat (or lipids) to absorb some of the individual vitamins. The delivery method (pill, liquid, gummy bear) makes no difference. But vitamins in liquid form may degrade more quickly on the shelf. How much of each vitamin should my multi have? The amount per serving numbers on the label should match the government's Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). It's OK if they're higher as long as they don't exceed the tolerable upper limit (UL). (To find the DRIs and ULs, go to Health.com/links.) While most vitamins are listed in milligrams (mg) or micrograms (mcg), the label may use IUs (international units) for vitamins A, D, and E. The DRIs are 2,300 IUs for vitamin A, 200 for D, and 22 for E. What about the label's % Daily Value column? Look at it with a skeptical eye: Those numbers haven't been updated since 1968.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea kept the pressure on English Premier League title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City with a dominant victory over Manchester United -- and heaped more trouble on the defending champions. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o grabbed his first hat trick for Chelsea to seal a 3-1 win Sunday which edged Chelsea to within two points of league leaders Arsenal. Manchester United had started strongly at Stamford Bridge and the opening strike from Eto'o, which took a heavy deflection, came against the run of play. United pressed on and both Belgian teenage winger Adnan Januzaj and England striker Danny Welbeck came close to equalizing but it was effectively game over when Eto'o pounced again on the stroke of halftime, poking in Gary Cahill's cross. The pair combined again after the break, with Eto'o dinking in Cahill's rebounded header before dancing away to celebrate his hat-trick. The home side took their foot off the gas in the closing stages of the match and Javier Hernandez slid in to grab a consolation goal for United. But United boss David Moyes could only roll his eyes in despair when his captain Nemanja Vidic was shown a straight red card for a late challenge on Eden Hazard in the closing seconds of the match. Chelsea's victory also brought up 100 EPL victories for manager Jose Mourinho in just 142 matches. The feisty Portuguese manager might be pleased to know that he has ticked off 100 Premier League wins faster than his old rival Sir Alex Ferguson, who needed 162 matches in charge of Manchester United to reach the milestone. For United, who are seventh in the table and 14 points off Arsenal's lead, and Moyes, victory over their chief rivals would be tonic enough for now. ""Of course 100 matches is nice, it's one more fantastic thing for my career,"" Mourinho told broadcaster Sky Sports. ""But the most important thing is to win the match. ""It now opens a little gap between us, Man Utd and Liverpool and we are in contact with Arsenal and Manchester City."" Commenting on the title defense, Moyes added: ""It's a long way away. We'll never say it's gone for us and we'll do our best to get back in it if we can."" In Sunday's other match, Tottenham moved level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool with a 3-1 away win at Swansea. Emmanuel Adebayor scored twice while Swansea defender Chico Flores inadvertently turned the ball into his own net. Tottenham are unbeaten in the EPL since Tim Sherwood replaced Andre Villas-Boas at the helm while Swansea, under the leadership of Michael Laudrup, have now gone eight league games without a win and hover near the drop zone. Atletico Madrid threw away a golden chance to take the lead in the Spanish league as they settled for a draw with Sevilla. David Villa found his scoring boots again to fire the home side into the lead only for a rash challenge from Juanfran to undo his good work. The defender pulled back Sevilla's Carlos Bacca in the box late on and Ivan Rakitic coolly slotted the resulting penalty beyond the reaching fingertips of keeper Thibaut Courtois . Atletico stay second behind La Liga champions Barcelona, who were also held to a 1-1 draw by Levante. Loukas Vyntra headed the home side into the lead in the first half only for Gerard Pique to do likewise at the opposite end of the pitch to level the score. Barcelona, who welcomed star man Lionel Messi back for his first league start of 2014, poured forward but the home side dug in and delivered a defensive display which earned them a share of the points, a result which the Levante home fans joyously celebrated like a victory. The Spanish league is proving to be as fiercely fought as the EPL with Barcelona and Atletico both on 51 points with Real Madrid one point further back. At least in France Paris Saint-Germain can bask five points clear at the top of Ligue 1 following a 5-0 thrashing of Nantes. Brazil centre-back Thaigo Silva opened the scoring for PSG after just 10 minutes and the league's top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic soon doubled their advantage from the penalty spot. Thiago Motta and Edinson Cavani got on the scoresheet before star striker Ibrahimovic sealed the rout. Monaco ticked off a 2-0 win over Toulouse thanks to goals from Layvin Kurzawa and Lucas Ocampos. The victory for Claudio Ranieri's men kept them within touching distance of PSG. ""It's an important win but we need to back it up,"" Ranieri said. ""We hadn't played well in our last two matches and it's good for the group's confidence to rediscover winning ways."" It was an anxious wait for new AC Milan coach Clarence Seedorf but the player-turned-coach had Mario Balotelli to thank for making it a winning start to his management career. The former Manchester City striker stroked home a late penalty, after Kaka was brought down, to seal a 1-0 win over Verona Sunday. ""We dedicate this win to the new coach,"" said Balotelli. ""Because the first game in charge of a team is always difficult."" Milan are 11th in Serie A, which is led comfortably by Juventus from Roma, Napoli and Fiorentina.","Chelsea defeat Manchester United 3-1 with Samuel Eto'o hat trick .

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- Heisman Trophy hopeful Jameis Winston and his accuser had consensual sex the night she told police he had sexually assaulted her, the attorney for the Florida State star quarterback said Thursday. Tim Jansen said his client's DNA was found on the clothing of the woman, who nearly a year ago said she was raped. ESPN, which first reported the DNA development, said the Florida crime lab determined that the possibility it was someone else's DNA would be one in 2.2 trillion. Jansen and state attorney Willie Meggs confirmed two DNA samples have been taken in the case, one from Winston and the other from a witness. ""I will tell you from Day 1, December of 2012, our defense (has) not changed whatsoever,"" Jansen told Capitol News Service. ""These DNA results had no effect on it. It had no effect on the testimony on the eyewitnesses that were there."" The case grew more curious Thursday when the recently retired police chief of the Tallahassee Police Department told CNN he was unaware there was a rape investigation against Winston, who has led the Seminoles to a No. 2 national ranking, until he learned about it in the media. Dennis M. Jones, who left the post in October, said when he was the city's top cop that he always knew about cases involving athletes, even if the players weren't charged. ""I'd like to know why it didn't make it to me,"" he said. ""It could be because the victim didn't want to prosecute. I don't know. But that's a question I have."" The case began in December when the woman, a student at Florida State in Tallahassee, reported she had been sexually assaulted. A month later she accused Winston of the alleged rape. Tallahassee Police Department Interim Chief Tom Coe told reporters Wednesday night that the accuser ""broke off contact"" with them in February and didn't want to go forward with the case. The news conference followed a statement from the family of the accuser criticizing the department's investigation. The lengthy message, which was printed by the Tampa Bay Times newspaper and other media, blasted the lead detective on the case. The accuser's family said Detective Scott Angulo warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and her life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Angulo has not responded to several CNN requests for comment. Jansen, Winston's attorney, said he believed the case was closed months ago. But Coe said the case is still open. ""We hope to move it forward as quickly as we can in coordination with the state attorney's office and bring closure to it,"" he said. No one has been charged in the investigation, and Meggs said his office has yet to interview the accuser. He will meet with his staff Friday, he said, to determine their next steps. Jones called Angulo a good investigator and said he finds it hard to believe the detective would pressure an accuser. The story became public when some media outlets put in public records requests for the alleged victim's complaint. Tallahassee police have released a heavily redacted incident report documenting a sexual assault allegation in early December 2012. The family's statement said they never leaked information about the case, a response to Jansen's comment last week that the timing of the media discovering the case -- in the middle of the college football season -- was ""very suspect."" Jones also questioned the timing. The woman's attorney strongly disputed that Thursday. ""We did not want this to blow up in the press,"" Patricia Carroll told CNN. ""Everybody is asserting about the timing and implying the victim (tipped off the media), that's not the case. She was in classes at FSU. Exams were coming up. She had to leave school and come back home because of this."" She found it ""inherently contradictory"" that Jones said Angulo was a good detective, but Jones said he was left unaware of the case. Jones said his former department never gave athletes preferential treatment. Police are aware of the perception, he said. ""So anytime we got a case involving an athlete we would go above and beyond in our investigation. It's almost to the contrary of what people perceive,"" he told CNN. The Heisman Trophy is awarded in December and goes to the player who voters believe had the best college football season. Winston has thrown for 28 touchdowns for the Seminoles, who are 10-0 and with three more wins could play in January for the national championship. Winston didn't play during the 2012 season but came to Florida State as one of the nation's top quarterback recruits, according to recruiting rankings. Jones pointed out that when the accusation was made Winston was not famous, as he is now. Florida State has said university officials cannot comment on an open investigation. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: DNA from accuser's clothes matches that of Jameis Winston, lawyer confirms .

"(CNN) -- He left it late but Sergio Garcia finally won his first tournament of the year. The Spaniard beat the world's hottest golfer, Henrik Stenson, to claim the Thailand Golf Championship on Sunday. Struggling in the past to close out events, this time Garcia protected his overnight advantage and downed the Swede by four shots at the Amata Spring Country Club in Chonburi. The secret to his success? Maybe it was his girlfriend, Katharina, acting as his caddy. ""It was great, an amazing week ... obviously being the last week of the year and for having Katharina caddie for me,"" Garcia told the Asian Tour's website. ""I knew Henrik was going to make it difficult for me. He's been playing so amazingly great, and he did. He kept hitting good shot after good shot."" But Garcia wouldn't be caught. He carded a four-under-par 68 in the final round and ended at 22-under overall. Stenson, the Race to Dubai and FedExCup champion, admitted he was running on ""fumes"" after a tiring season. ""I've had a great year but coming here really on the fumes left in the tank, not too much going for me to perform in that sense,"" Stenson said. ""But I played really nicely yesterday and I was hanging in there today. I was just coming up a couple short."" France's Alexander Levy completed the top three, with U.S. Open champion Justin Rose tying for fourth.","Spaniard Sergio Garcia wins the Thailand Golf Championship by four shots .

"(CNN) -- Defense or attack? Is there a preferred way to clinch the English Premier League title? Arsenal and Manchester City, the two title rivals in action Saturday, displayed opposing tactics as both recorded victories. Anxious Arsenal fans had to wait for the London club to beat rivals Fulham and hang onto their English Premier League lead by a single point from City. Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla struck twice in quick succession in the second half to seal a 2-0 win for Arsene Wenger's side. But the Arsenal manager was quick to praise the defensive bedrock of the team, which had done well to deny Dimitar Berbatov and Ashken Dejagah in the first half and Pajtim Kasami late on. ""That stability is vital to us,"" Wenger told Sky Sports after the match. ""We were seriously defensive for 90 minutes today. Our defenders deserve credit."" It was a different story further north in Manchester where free-scoring City raced to a 4-2 victory over Cardiff. Edin Dzeko scored City's 100th goal of the season -- a neat feat so early in the campaign -- as he opened the scoring with 14 minutes on the clock. The bobbling goal was verified by goal-line technology, making its debut in the EPL this season, as an electronic signal sent to referee Neil Swarbrick's watch confirmed the ball had crossed the line. Although Cardiff pulled back a surprise equaliser thanks to Craig Noone, City were undeterred and Jesus Navas soon nosed them back in front. In the second half, Yaya Toure and the returning Sergio Aguero linked up to help each other score and put the game beyond Cardiff. City's attacking game had done enough to keep the 2011/2012 EPL champions snapping at Arsenal's ankles but manager Manuel Pellegrini felt his side deserved more. ""The score does not reflect the match,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It was one of the matches where we missed more chances to score. ""It's very important to score 100 [goals] because this moment in the season the team has a clear style of play and we continue exactly what we're doing so far."" Chelsea, third in the table, invite defending champions Manchester United to Stamford Bridge on Sunday when Swansea also host Tottenham. This season the Premier League is fiercely competitive not only at the top of the table but throughout the swathe of 20 teams. The bottom 10 teams are separated by just five points. A late 1-0 victory for Crystal Palace against Stoke helped the south London club move up to 16th while struggling Sunderland also scored late on to salvage a 2-2 draw against Southampton. Real Madrid were on the move in the Spanish La Liga as they drilled five goals past bottom club Real Betis to join Atletico Madrid and Barcelona at the top of the table on 50 points. Cristiano Ronaldo proved why he was picked to receive the prestigious Ballon d'Or this week as he set Real on their way with a stylish long range strike. Gareth Bale sailed in a free-kick for 2-0 before Karim Benzema hit home his 100th goal for Madrid. Angel di Maria and Alvaro Morata rounded off the scoring in the second half. ""Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema were very effective,"" coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""The whole team gave them a lot of chances to score because we played quickly up front. ""This match was important because we were trying to get into first place. It may only be for one night, but we'll sleep well tonight."" Barcelona and Atletico have a chance to pull clear Sunday when they return to domestic action. In Italy, Juventus pulled eight points clear of rivals Roma at the top of the table as they ticked off their 12th straight Serie A win Saturday. Arturo Vidal scored twice -- once from the penalty spot after he had been brought down in the box -- while Fernando Llorente and Paul Pogba also found the net to seal a 4-2 win over a dogged Sampdoria side. Earlier, Roma had beaten Livorno 3-0 to send them back to the bottom of Serie A.","Second half goals help Arsenal to 2-0 win over Fulham .

"(CNN) -- Two of the five children pulled from a car Thursday after it plunged into an icy pond in Minnesota have died. Five-year-old Zenavia Rennie died, according to Lt. Eric Roeske with the Minnesota State Patrol. Later Thursday, seven-year-old Alarious Coleman-Guerrido died, family member, Tamy Johnson told CNN affiliate KARE. The other three children-- ranging in ages of 1 to 6 -- suffered serious injuries, according to the Minnesota State Patrol, which received a report of the car sinking in a retention pond early in the morning. The 1998 Pontiac Grand Am, the children were traveling in, ran off the road into the water, which was about 9 feet deep. Its driver, 23-year-old Marion Guerrido, got out of the car on her own, and suffered no apparent injuries. Those who lived near the scene said they heard Marion Guerrido's harrowing wails for help. ""She was screaming we could not hear what she was saying,"" Jessica Ressler told KARE. One neighbor said he saw a man jump in the water before emergency crews arrived and desperately tried to help Guerrido get the kids out of the car but couldn't, KARE reported . Medical personnel initially attempted to reach the vehicle. But because of the cold water, and how far the car sank, they were unable to get to the children immediately, according to Roeske. The first child was removed some 20 minutes after the incident began; the last child was in the water for roughly 40 minutes, he said. Authorities do not believe weather, drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash, which is under investigation. Guerrido is the mother of three of the five victims. The others are her stepchildren, KARE reported. ""Devastating. It does not get any worse than that,""John Sedey, executive director of Odeyssey Acedemy the school that four of five children attended, told KARE ""It's devastating to our staff because everybody feels so close to all of our students.""

"(CNN) -- When you mix the neon-lit, art-deco splendor of Miami beach with one of the world's most bankable art fairs, throw in a horde of fashion designers and a seemingly unending list of parties, you'd be hard-pressed to stop the celebrities from showing up. Still, this year's Art Basel Miami Beach, which wrapped last night, might as well have been staged on a red carpet. Kevin Spacey, Adrian Grenier and Princess Eugenie were spotted hobnobbing at a party hosted by British artist Tracey Emin. At DuJour magazine's party to honor artist Marc Quinn, guests included Kanye West, Lionel Richie and Tommy Hilfiger, who co-hosted the spectacle. Eva Longoria and Serena Williams were just two of the celebs who enjoyed a champagne-fueled private dinner hosted by Gerard Butler and Dom Pérignon at the W South Beach. ""The parties are rammed, they're like catwalks, and there are tons of them,"" says Lucie Greene, the editor of LS:N Global, the trends network forecasting agency The Future Laboratory. ""I've seen Pharrell Williams, Karolina Kurkova and Val Kilmer floating around. It's like the Coachella of the art world."" Serious business . Don't be deceived. For many of these stars, Art Basel Miami Beach is about much more than lavish parties and bacchanalian nights. ""I've bumped into Jay Z and Beyoncé in Miami a couple of times,"" says Emily Tsingou, a private art dealer based in London and a regular at Art Basel. ""They are celebrities, but they are also building up collections."" To make the most informed decisions, celebrities and other high-net-worths typically employ an art adviser, who will steer them toward art worth its price tag. Advisers also negotiate deals on their client's behalf. Todd Levin, the director of the Levin Art Group in New York City, has been advising clients for more than 25 years. ""If an adviser does their due diligence, they will request and receive packing lists from galleries well in advance of the fair,"" he says. ""An adviser will discuss with their clients any art works that may be of interest. Based on those discussions, they will isolate and purchase pieces in advance of the fair."" Of course, seeing a .jpeg image in advance is not the same as seeing the work in front of you. Advisers like Levin need to bring a comfortable pair of shoes for all the running they are likely do for clients. ""I may be working with one client when my phone receives a text from another,"" Levin says. ""I will disengage for a moment with the first client and meet the second who requires immediate information on an art work they have just encountered."" Andrew Renton, a London-based collector, adviser and the director of the Marlborough Contemporary art gallery, has at times mapped out routes through the fair so that his clients can strike early. ""All the great stuff goes very quickly,"" he says. ""There is not much room for dithering on day one. You might want to call your wish list a hit list."" The need for speed was clear on December 4, when the fair opened its doors exclusively to VIPs. Within hours they had dropped tens of millions of dollars. New York's Van de Weghe Gallery reported that an American collector purchased Gerhard Richter's ""Abstraktes Bild (595-3)"" for $3.2 million. The gallery also sold ""Beautiful, I Pushed the Controls and Ahead of Me Rockets Blazed, I Don't Want to Be a Dead Artist Painting"". The 2005 spin painting by Damien Hirst, which has two expired credit cards embedded into it, went for $580,000, or $29,000 for every word in its title. On the lower end of the spectrum, London's Lisson Gallery sold Ai Weiwei's ""Jade Handcuffs"" for 70,000 euros. New York City's David Zwirner Gallery reported the sale of a Jeff Koons sculpture for $8 million to an unnamed buyer. The phantom shopper must have faith in photos: The sculpture was not physically present at the fair. And while we don't know the names of all the buyers, Leonardo DiCaprio is probably on one of the buyer's lists. He was spotted on his cell phone directing his advisers to various works. Officials will never know the exact amount of sales, only the sales that galleries choose to report. However, Dr. Bodo Sartorius, the chief technical officer at AXA insurance, an official partner of Art Basel, estimated that the art present in Miami this year exceeded $3 billion. Marc Spiegler, the director of Art Basel, says that the fair in Miami Beach is going from strength to strength. ""The 250-plus galleries showing at Art Basel represent the best galleries from across the world,"" he says. ""Our exhibitors are reporting strong and consistent sales, including many to museums - not only on the first day but throughout the show."" Bubbly and beyond . Despite all the glitz surrounding the event, there is an element of democracy at the fair. Gallerists selling works care little about what films you've been in or whether you have an Oscar on your mantle. They're most concerned with making a sale. That means that VIPs cannot always expect the VIP treatment. ""It doesn't matter if you flew in on your private jet, you are still going to have to stand in line for a sausage like everyone else,"" says Renton. ""I've heard of collectors who have someone in tow whose only job is to line-up for provisions along the way."" Given the potential indignity of having to queue, it's only natural that celebs will want to regroup when the sun goes down. But their encounters are not all air kisses and froth. For the most serious collectors these parties are a gateway to like-minded people, and a chance to learn more about new artists. ""Through those parties and the socializing something else is formed in Basel,"" Renton says. ""You find that these moments are great points for meeting people you've been trying to speak with from around the world for a long time. An art fair can focus that.""","Celebrities have become major art collectors .

"(CNN) -- On the eve of the anniversary of the tragic massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, yet another shooting broke out Friday -- this time in a high school in the suburbs of Denver. A few people were reported injured, so far, while the gunman took his own life, police said. And once again, an American community reels -- bewildered that such violence could occur among its young people. While the vast majority of youth murdered in the U.S. are gunned down in the street, school shootings that are rare in other countries occur far too frequently in America. The U.S. does not have unusually high rates of crime, violent behavior or mental illness compared with other high-income countries; but our rate of homicide with firearms is nearly 20 times higher. Lax gun laws that allow dangerous people easy access to guns plays an important role in this disparity. There was reason to believe that Congress would be forced to put public safety interests ahead of the special interests of the gun lobby after 20 young children and six adults were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School a year ago. Public opinion surveys showed near unanimous support for expanding background checks and broad support for other measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Grass roots movements including parents and faith-based groups mobilized to advocate for stronger gun laws. For the most part, Congress once again caved to the gun lobby. However, 15 states plus the District of Columbia, accounting for roughly 44% of the U.S. population, strengthened their gun laws in 2013. Eight of these states, including Colorado, Delaware and Illinois, made fairly substantial changes by enacting background-check requirements for all handgun sales. Maryland adopted a licensing system for handgun purchasers and stronger regulation of gun dealers. California, Connecticut and Maryland expanded firearm prohibitions for high-risk individuals. Moreover, the Obama administration took action on many relevant executive orders. A director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has finally been confirmed by the Senate. Federal agencies are funding research on gun violence. But widespread gun trafficking from states with weak gun laws to states with stronger laws underscores the need for better federal laws. Congress will likely act only when more gun owners who support policies to keep guns from dangerous people become engaged on the issue. In a large national survey my colleagues and I conducted in January 2013, 84% of gun owners and 74% of National Rifle Association members supported background checks for all gun sales. Other surveys show similar findings. What is keeping so many gun owners on the sidelines? One likely impediment is the way the issue has been cast as a cultural battle as opposed to a public safety problem. Another may be gun owners' susceptibility to the gun lobby's bogus talking points. The frame for this cultural battle is not accidental. Pushed by the gun lobby and fanned by news media's tendency to highlight conflict, widely favored, commonsense safety measures such as background checks are portrayed as attacks on gun owners' way of life. The gun lobby's claims that background checks restrict gun ownership and lead to gun registries and confiscations are repeated and often left unchallenged. When you hear something enough times, you begin to think it's true. And that's exactly the intent of the NRA and other groups. Here's the reality check: Background checks pose no threat to lawful gun ownership. Federal law forbids the federal government from maintaining anything resembling a registry of gun owners. Federal law has mandated background checks for guns sold by licensed gun dealers since 1994 without creating a registry. Exempting private gun transactions from background check requirements facilitates gun trafficking. Fixing this fatal flaw in the system would curtail the diversion of guns to criminals. In the year since the tragedy in Newtown, it is likely that more than 12,000 Americans have died of gun violence and countless others live in fear of being shot. We should stick to facts, dispel myths, and call a truce to cultural battles. Current federal gun laws aid criminals and the gun industry at the expense of public safety. Requiring background checks for all gun sales would give the vast majority of gun owners what they want while keeping guns from those who shouldn't have them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Webster.","On the eve of Newtown massacre anniversary, there's a school shooting in Colorado .

"(CNN) -- Every day, Jason Dinant chows down 16 hard-boiled egg whites, one and a quarter pound of meat and four cups of vegetables, sprinkled with an occasional carbohydrate. Jason Dinant does 150 crunches daily and eats lean protein in an effort to turn his flat stomach into a six-pack. The lean protein and carbohydrates, he hopes, will help him get six-pack abs. Two months ago, the 27-year-old began crunching initially 500 times a day and exercising to try to turn his flat stomach into a rippling six-pack. His New Year's resolution is to get a six-pack by June, in time for his 10-year high school reunion, and to have a toned upper body for his video blog. Dinant, an iReport contributor, often peels off his shirt and gives what he calls ""the naked truth about today's news"" in Web videos he posts on his blog called ""Naked Boy News."" Watch Dinant's video . The Las Vegas, Nevada, resident submitted his story after CNNhealth.com asked viewers to upload photos and videos about their journey to change for the new year on iReport.com. Last month, the svelte salesman by day and club emcee by night shared his exercise routine, which consists of ab crunches, cycling on a stationary bike and using weights for his upper body. Dinant, who had hardly ever exercised, also had to modify his diet. The former junk-food aficionado had to give up his chocolates and hard candies for grilled chicken breasts, red potatoes, brown rice and steamed carrots and zucchini. ""Everything is natural,"" Dinant said.  ""There is no processed food, no junk stuff. People think that's crazy. They say, 'You're on a crazy diet. Why are you starving yourself?' People think eating healthy is starving yourself, which I don't get."" He's far from starving himself. He eats nearly six meals a day to increase his metabolism. Jim White, a registered dietitian and American Dietetic Association spokesman, reviewed Dinant's menu. ""This reminds me of what I was doing trying to get ripped for bodybuilding competition,"" White said. ""It's tough to follow, but you can definitely get a six-pack with this diet."" Despite the diet's repetitiveness, ""this is what it takes"" for  men to get a six-pack, White said. But White had some tips for an even better diet -- add more fat.  Yes, fat. Fats compose 8 percent of Dinant's current diet. ""Even diets put together for weight loss or fat shedding, I don't recommend under 12 to 15 percent fat,"" White said. ""Some studies say omega-3 fats can minimize body fat. ...You can get a six-pack while incorporating fats in the diet."" Skip the saturated and trans fat and go for good fats found in flaxseed oils, olive oil, natural peanut butter, nuts and avocados, which are beneficial.  And add fruits to the diet, White suggested. ""Fruits are loaded with fiber, vitamins, and I think you should definitely have two fruits in the diet,"" he said. Brown rice, oatmeal and sweet potatoes are great carbohydrates for the diet, he said.  There were some glaring similarities between White's diet and Dinant's. ""This is pretty much my diet every day,"" White said.  ""I eat around eight to 10 eggs a day. I always get asked if I'm baking a cake or egging houses when I'm at the grocery."" Eating lean proteins helps build muscles, but Dinant may be getting too much for his weight. ""Eating protein has great benefit for rebuilding muscle and speeding up the metabolism,"" White said.  ""But too much can cause weight gain, increase the urinary loss of calcium, and cause dehydration."" He recommended that Dinant cuts back his egg whites to six and each protein portion to four ounces. Dinant said he's not sick of his diet, which relies heavily on the same ingredients. ""I'm so used to eating the same things,"" he said.  ""I usually eat chicken all the time. This is nothing new for me. You can season as much as you want, as long as it's a no-sodium seasoning like garlic powder or barbecue powder or barbecue rubs. It's tasty and good. It's a little different."" Dinant can keep his diet interesting by adding healthy ingredients to staples to make the foods taste better.  For example, White suggests adding fruits such as blueberries to a half-cup of oatmeal and veggies and low-fat cheese to an all-white egg omelet. In addition to revamping his diet, Dinant works out five times a week. He has cut back his abdominal crunches to 150 a day using 25 pounds of weight. ""My core abs are good. They're solid,"" he said.  ""When I do side abdominals, I feel sore the next day. It's a good burn. I've been so happy, I went tanning for the last two weeks. I look in the mirror and I'm like, 'Wow.' "" He lost fat on the top of his midsection and said he definitely sees his abs protruding in the lower midsection of his stomach. And his quest has brought him some attention. ""I cannot go anywhere in Vegas without people asking me how my abs are doing,"" he said.","Man who wants six-pack revamps diet to consume 1 ¼ pound of meat and 16 eggs .

"(CNN) -- The Zumba instructor in Maine who ran a prostitution ring out of her fitness studio Saturday was released from jail early for good behavior and participating in a work program, according to a York County Jail spokesman. Alexis Wright, 29, walked out of the Maine jail at 8 a.m. Saturday after serving nearly six months of a ten-month term for a prostitution case that last year rocked the sleepy New England town of Kennebunk. Her client list, including accountants, lawyers and even a local TV personality, became the talk of the picturesque Maine town. The State Police and the Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating the prostitution ring in 2011 after receiving a tip that there was more going on at the studio than a Latin dance fitness party. In February 2012, Wright's Zumba studio was raided. Court documents showed that Wright videotaped intimate encounters with some of her customers in three locations -- including her store-front Zumba exercise studio -- and would send the footage to her business partner, Mark Strong. Attorneys act to conceal names in Zumba sex case . According to Strong's sentencing memo, Wright would not engage in a prostitution session unless Strong had ""prior knowledge of the session and was actively watching via the Skype connection."" More than 13,000 Skype video call snapshots were recovered from Strong's computer, according to the memo. Strong was found guilty of promotion of prostitution and conspiracy to promote prostitution in March. He was sentenced to 20 days in jail, court documents said. In addition to jail time, Wright was ordered to pay $57,000 in restitution and $1,000 in fines. Prosecutors dropped more than 80 other counts and reduced more serious tax-related charges from felonies to misdemeanors, according to the sentencing documents. CNN's calls to Wright and her attorney were not returned. Talk of the town: Who's on 'The List' of alleged sex clients?

"(CNN) -- In an effort to curb prescription painkiller abuse, the Food and Drug Administration is banning generic versions of the original OxyContin formula. ""The FDA has determined that the benefits of original OxyContin no longer outweigh its risks,"" the agency said in a statement. OxyContin was first approved in 1995. The drug became attractive to abusers who crushed it to snort, or melted and injected it. OxyContin tablets have a time-release formula that delivers the drug over a 12-hour period. But when a pill is crushed, the entire dose is immediately absorbed into the bloodstream. Purdue Pharma, the producer of OxyContin, stopped selling the original formula to pharmacies in August 2010 after reformulating the pills to make them crush-resistant. The reformulated pills make the drug more difficult to inject or snort, according to the FDA. The agency has approved new labeling for the drug that makes it clear the pills are more difficult to abuse. Any generic version of OxyContin that is submitted for approval should be based on this formula, the FDA says. Prescription painkillers have killed more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 12 million Americans over the age of 12 reported using prescription painkillers recreationally in 2010. According to the CDC, enough were prescribed that year to medicate every American adult around the clock for a month. Deaths have skyrocketed during the past decade. In 2009, about a half a million people visited emergency rooms as a result of abusing or misusing prescription drugs like Vicodin (hydrocodone), OxyContin (oxycodone), Opana (oxymorphone) and methadone, the CDC found. In May 2007, Purdue Pharma settled a lawsuit that alleged the company used promotional materials that contained misleading or inaccurate data and downplayed the addiction risks of OxyContin, according to Fortune. The company paid a $600.5 million fine and three of the company's top executives pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of misbranding. In December, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy sent an alert to law enforcement, particularly along the Canadian border, warning that Canada had approved non-abuse-resistant generic versions of oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin, Percocet and about 40 other painkillers. ""ONDCP expects companies will begin offering these generics without the abuse-resistant features in Canadian pharmacies within the next month,"" according to the alert. The letter warned of the potential for these generics to show up in the United States. Going forward, the FDA will continue ""to encourage the development of abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids,"" the agency said. ""(We believe) that such products will help reduce prescription drug abuse. At the same time, the FDA remains committed to ensuring that patients with pain have appropriate access to opioid analgesics."" CNN's Saundra Young contributed to this report.","""The benefits of original OxyContin no longer outweigh its risks,"" FDA says .

"London (CNN) -- The case of three women allegedly held captive for more than 30 years in London is one of brainwashing and emotional abuse, London's Metropolitan Police said Friday. Police announced Thursday they had arrested a couple on suspicion of being involved in forced labor and domestic servitude after authorities took a Malaysian woman, 69, Irish woman, 57, and 30-year-old Briton to safety from a property in Lambeth, south London. However, police told CNN on Friday that while the man and woman were arrested under the slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labor section of the Coroners and Justice Act of 2009, that law did not necessarily describe the alleged crime. ""It is not as brutally obvious as women being physically restrained inside an address and not allowed to leave. What (Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland) and his team are trying to understand is what were the invisible handcuffs that were used to exert such a degree of control over these women,"" Commander Steve Rodhouse said. ""Trying to label this investigation as domestic servitude or forced labor is far too simple. What we have uncovered so far is a complicated and disturbing picture of emotional control over many years. Brainwashing would be the most simplest term, yet that belittles the years of emotional abuse these victims have had to endure."" Rodhouse said the investigation has uncovered ""something that is, so far, unique to us and does not compare to any previous investigations we have carried out."" Hyland said there were ""clear allegations of slavery,"" but officers were still establishing the details of the ""complex and complicated"" case and could not jump to conclusions. Coercion, violence allegations . ""Clearly the allegations are that people were being controlled, subject of coercion, violence. And as you're aware, the case goes back three decades -- so there's a lot for us to untangle,"" Hyland said. He said the women were subjected to physical abuse like beatings, as well as psychological pressure: ""We are trying to figure out the nature of those invisible handcuffs."" Police have not released the names of the man and woman -- both 67 -- alleged to have held the women captive but say they are not British nationals. They revealed Friday that the two suspects were arrested in the 1970s but would not say why or whether they have a criminal record. The couple have since been released on bail, but have not returned to the Lambeth property at the center of the allegations, police said. ""They have also been arrested on suspicion of immigration offenses, and we are working closely with the Home Office Immigration Enforcement,"" Hyland said . British lawmaker Tessa Jowell said Friday that the house is in her constituency. She represents the south London neighborhoods of Dulwich and West Norwood. CNN's Atika Shubert said police had told her that the group of people involved had presented themselves as a normal family, but officers would not detail how they were related. ""I'm both looking at the relationships -- as in biological -- and I'm also looking at relationships -- how they interacted,"" Hyland said. He said police did not believe the victims had been trafficked into the UK. Earlier, police said the 30-year-old alleged victim ""appears to have been in servitude for her entire life."" They said she and the two other women were ""highly traumatized"" and being cared for in a place of safety. Police said Freedom Charity alerted them to the suspects in October after receiving a phone call from one of the victims. ""The woman found the courage to contact the charity after seeing a documentary on television we are informed was aired by the BBC,"" they said in a statement. 'Controlled freedom' With the ""help of sensitive negotiations"" by the charity, police met with the Irish and British women on October 25. The women identified the place where they said they had been held, allowing police to rescue the 69-year-old Malaysian woman and take all three to safety, Metropolitan Police said. ""We believe that the women had some controlled freedom, but at this stage we are still trying to find out to what extent and what form this took. The relationship between the women is part of an ongoing investigation, and we are not willing to speculate,"" police said. Hyland said it was an unprecedented case for the Met's Human Trafficking Unit. ""We've seen some cases where people have been held for up to 10 years, but we've never seen anything of this magnitude before,"" he said. ""Our unit deals with many cases every year but has never unearthed such a staggering example of people held against their will for their whole lifetime."" He said authorities are in the early stages of a ""complicated and sensitive"" investigation. ""These women are highly traumatized, having been held in servitude for at least 30 years with no real exposure to the outside world, and trying to find out exactly what has happened over three decades will understandably take some time."" Sensitivity and secrecy . Police said they had seen no evidence ""to suggest anything of a sexual nature,"" but the investigation is ongoing. Freedom Charity spokeswoman Aneeta Prem said the organization took ""immediate action"" to plan a rescue after learning of the women's situation. ""Facilitating their escape was achieved using utmost sensitivity and secrecy and with the safety of the women as our primary concern,"" she said, describing the work of those involved as ""outstanding."" A television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of Freedom Charity prompted the call for help. ""They'd seen me on various news channels talking about forced marriage and dishonor violence, and they said I had a face they trusted, so they called our 24-hour helpline,"" Prem told CNN. She said the process was ""very difficult"" and charity CEO Vineeta Thornhill was personally involved in the negotiations . ""Throughout the process until they were rescued -- so it was over a week of speaking to them -- she gained their trust and confidence, and they believed that when they came out, they would be taken to safety, they would be looked after,"" Prem said. ""These ladies have spent 30 years in captivity as slaves and have come out with absolutely nothing at all,"" she said. ""The road to freedom isn't going to be an easy one."" 'Harrowing' Thornhill told CNN she believed the youngest woman was born in captivity. The 30-year-old is not related to the other two victims, but police are investigating whether she is related to the couple who were arrested, she said. Prem said she has seen the women on a number of occasions since their rescue. ""They're doing remarkably well considering how harrowing it's been for them."" Read more: I'm a modern-day slave in America . She said such cases could occur in a city the size of London, where she said people often didn't know their neighbors.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 72 years after surviving the attacks from the menacing skies over Pearl Harbor, Ewalt Shatz found himself fighting another battle: this time, just to make it to the islands. The 90-year-old former sailor told CNN affiliate KHNL that he had intended to fly Wednesday from Los Angeles International Airport to Honolulu, Hawaii, to take part in a memorial on Saturday at Pearl Harbor in honor of more than 2,400 who died in the Japanese air attacks in 1941. But he was bumped from his United Airlines flight. ""I thought that they just overbooked the deal and they were trying to get rid of a couple of customers, because somebody had my seat, and that's what made me mad, because I paid for that seat, and somebody else was sitting in it."" United said it wasn't at fault. ""Severe weather in the path of United flight 1226 required the flight to carry additional fuel and reduce the number of passengers on board by 41,"" said Charles Hobart, a spokesman for the airline, in an e-mailed statement. ""United agents in Los Angeles noticed Mr. Shatz in the lobby attempting to check in for the flight and, after approaching him and offering assistance, proactively rebooked him on the best available alternate flight. We look forward to following up with Mr. Shatz and having an opportunity to welcome him back."" But Shatz, who was flying alone, said an agent told him that only two customers were taken off the flight, and the only other person he saw was a man in a wheelchair, according to KHNL. He was rebooked on an American Airlines flight eight hours later for Maui, where Hawaiian Airlines representatives greeted him and escorted him to a first-class seat aboard a flight to Honolulu. He arrived there shortly before midnight. Shatz's story had preceded him on social media, and he was met at the airport by dozens of people, most of them in uniform. ""We're here to show our respect for him,"" said Rex Parmelee, chief Navy counselor. ""It's a tremendous honor; that's why we take it so serious, because heritage is huge."" Shatz enjoyed the support. ""Everybody wanted a picture with me, and they were making out like I was a hero, but I'm not, really,"" Shatz said. ""It was embarrassing in a way, but I liked it."" The airline ran into blowback on social media, where one person wrote, ""United should be ASHAMED!"" ""United has just lost another loyal customer,"" said another. And this: ""Will never fly United again."" On December 7, 1941, Shatz was an 18-year-old seaman aboard the USS Patterson. Last year, he was honored for having shot down a Japanese plane with a .50-caliber machine gun -- the first time he had used one -- during the attack. He said he had not heard from United since the incident and planned never to fly on the airline again. Shatz is one of 50 Pearl Harbor survivors and 10 World War II veterans expected to attend Saturday's ceremony, which is slated to begin at 7:45 a.m. (12:45 p.m. ET) and last 90 minutes, said Eileen Martinez, a spokeswoman for the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument and the USS Arizona Memorial. At the end of the ceremony, current enlisted military personnel will form an honor cordon through which the WWII veterans, Pearl Harbor survivors and civilian witnesses in attendance will walk or, in some cases, ride in wheelchairs, Martinez said. ""As they make their way out, the military salutes them,"" she said. ""It's an act of honoring those that have sacrificed, that have served and that are so precious to us. ""Of course, they are in their twilight years, so now is the time to honor them."" Some 2,000 to 2,500 of the more than 70,000 military forces who survived the attacks on Oahu are still alive, she said.","90-year-old Pearl Harbor survivor gets bumped en route to Honolulu .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts grand jury Thursday indicted 14-year-old Philip Chism on charges of murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in connection with last month's slaying of his algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer, according to the Essex district attorney. Citing Massachusetts law, prosecutors said they would ask that Chism be tried in an adult court. ""The indictments ... detail horrific and unspeakable acts,"" said District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett. The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism, armed with a box cutter, robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. The aggravated rape indictment alleges that he sexually assaulted her with an object. Under the aggravated rape and armed robbery indictments, Chism was charged as a youthful offender, but prosecutors said they will move to join those charges with the murder case in Superior Court. ""This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family,"" Blodgett said. Ritzer was known to her friends and family as a woman who inspired many, whether it be in the classroom or online, with her heart, intellect and positive spirit. ""She was happy,"" said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. ""I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought."" A 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master's degree at Salem State University, Ritzer seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school. ""She was energetic, she was compassionate,"" Dzerkacz said. ""You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend."" In a statement, the Ritzer family said: ""We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen."" Chism allegedly killed Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in the girl's bathroom of Danvers High School with a box cutter he brought to school, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Ritzer went to a regular girls bathroom on the second floor when someone was using the locked faculty bathroom. Chism followed her in, according to the source. Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed, officials said. Her body went into a recycling bin, then outside the school where it was tossed, the source said. Authorities found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment some 100 feet away from Ritzer's body. After changing his clothes, Chism went to a Wendy's restaurant and a movie, according to the source. Dressed in pink, hundreds mourn Colleen Ritzer, slain Massachusetts teacher . Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, declined to comment. Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . A week after the slaying, about 400 Danvers High School students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects at the church where the family of popular math teacher worshiped. Many mourners wore pink clothing -- Ritzer's favorite color -- and pink flowers decorated the outside of Andover's St. Augustine Church. The Rev. Peter G. Gori, in his homily, offered advice on how to approach Ritzer's death. ""Perhaps we should ask not why, or even how she died, but rather why and how did she live,"" Gori said. Authorities are still investigating the motive for her killing. Documents filed in a Tennessee court 12 years ago may shed light on Chism's past. The court papers showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of ""prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse."" The documents said the parents were attempting to reconcile. Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN in the days after the crime that the boy's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida. The suspect's mother, Diana Chism, last month released a statement through her son's attorney saying her ""heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer."" ""Her son was born in love and is dear to her, very dear,"" the statement said. Teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens .

"(CNN) -- A Congolese nun working in the Democratic Republic of Congo is making a difference. Sister Angelique Namaika has been recognized for her extraordinary humanitarian work with victims of atrocities committed by members of the Lord's Resistance Army, the militant group led by African warlord Joseph Kony. The LRA took up arms against the Ugandan gvernment in the 1980s and soon became notorious for killing, kidnapping and brutalizing people throughout central Africa. Its members are known for hacking off the lips and ears of their victims, looting villages and burning huts, and stealing clothes and medicine from the communities they terrorize. Those who survived attacks have been deeply scarred. Namaika, who has received the Nansen Refugee Award United Nations award for her work in the DRC, has helped rebuild the lives of more than 2,000 women and girls caught in the LRA's web. She has dedicated the award to all the women and children who were abducted by the LRA. Namaika said she was inspired to follow the path of social work as a child when she saw a German nun, Sister Tone, who used to visit her village to help the less fortunate. ""I thought it was worth giving more efforts for the women that had suffered at the hands of the LRA for two to three years,"" she told CNN. ""It was very difficult because I had to bring some sort of cure, to relieve them of what they had been through. One of the main goals of providing these trainings was for the women to feel valued within society and be autonomous."" Pope Francis offers blessing . The number of people trying to recover from the LRA's reign of terror is staggering. The group has displaced 2.5 million people in the DRC, Uganda, South Sudan and the Central African Republic over the last 30 years, according to the U.N., making it the world's largest and longest-running displacement predicament. Countless families have been destroyed or split apart in this time. Namaika told CNN: ""Some women did not directly witness the atrocities performed by the LRA, but they saw them through their children whom they counted on. This one woman had three of her children taken from her, two boys and a girl, one of the boys was killed in the jungle, the other had both his arms amputated, and the girl had a sexually transmitted disease. And this woman carries this pain in her heart."" Namaika recently met with Pope Francis and sought blessing for the victims of the LRA. Just before the meeting she said: ""I am going to ask him for a special blessing for us and for me, for me to continue to have the courage I need to fulfil my mission to help women to find their lives again.""' Working in the north-eastern Congolese town of Dungu, Namaika said she has worked with women who were captured by LRA rebels when they were as young as 11 or 12. ""For me, the impact on the country is what they have done in the hearts of thousands of Congolese children. He kidnapped children, who represent the future of the country. It is as if they destroyed the future of the country."" ""They still spread fear throughout the local villages, and no matter what anyone thinks, even if someone feels safe, Kony could come out with his group very unexpectedly. People are still very afraid of going through what they went through."" After years hiding in the jungle, the number of LRA fighters is thought to be down to a handful, and the U.N. report says there's been a drop in the frequency of attacks against civilians. It is good news, but as Namaika knows, the healing will go on for years to come.","Sister Angelique Namaika recognized by U.N. for work with LRA victims .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Anti-government protesters and Thai security forces maintained their delicate day-old truce, despite provocative moves by demonstrators determined to break into the main police headquarters here. Hundreds of whistle-blowing demonstrators organized a raucous gathering at the gates of the Thai Royal Police Headquarters on Wednesday morning. ""We will not leave until we enter police headquarters, but there must not be violence,"" said one elderly woman who was armed with a whistle and seated in a folding chair. Moments later, demonstrators dressed in makeshift protective gear, including gas-masks, goggles, bicycle helmets, and plastic bags, used ladders and wire cutters to dismantle coils of razor protecting the police headquarters' main gate. On the other side of several layers of barbed wire and concrete barriers, rows of hundreds of riot police stood and watched. They did not intervene, however, even after cheering demonstrators toppled and pulled away concrete barriers, one giant block at a time. ""We want police to treat us our people fairly the same way they behave towards the reds,"" protest leader Thavorn Seniam announced into a loudspeaker. He was referring to government supporters known as ""red shirts."" Opposition activists differentiate themselves by dressing in yellow or black. A temporary truce . Last week, scores of people were wounded and at least three people killed during several consecutive days of street battles in Bangkok. On Tuesday, protesters and security forces agreed to bring an end to the violence as a show of respect for Thailand's much-revered king, who will celebrate his 86th birthday Thursday. But protesters refused to give up their week-old occupation of the ministry of finance and a separate government complex on the outskirts of the Thai capital. Instead, opposition leaders continue to demand the resignation of Yingluck Shinawatra. The democratically-elected prime minister easily survived a no-confidence vote in parliament last week. ""The proposals of the protesters are undemocratic and unconstitutional,"" said Suranand Vejjajiva, a top aide to Yingluck, in an interview with CNN. ""What they are trying to do is just topple the democratically-elected government, which is totally unacceptable,"" he said. But Suranand added that the government would do its best to avoid violence. Avoiding violence . Those orders appeared to be strictly followed at police headquarters on Wednesday. As demonstrators slowly, deliberately cut through fortifications at the gate, a police commander ordered a line of hundreds of female police officers to replace the rows of helmeted riot police. The smiling women, who carried baseball hats and wore colorful kerchiefs, were then ordered to clap along with music blaring from the loudspeakers of several trucks manned by protesters. It was clearly an effort to defuse tensions at the gate. Eventually, a protest leader met with police commanders, who later made a show of waving to the demonstrators. Meanwhile, protest organizers prevented their crowds from streaming into the grounds of the police compound, even after the main gates were opened. ""We welcome them (the protesters) because we don't want to have any violence today,"" announced Deputy Police Chief Aumnart Anartram on his own speaker system. ""They were a bit impatient so they tried to cut the barbed wire and get into our compound."" Aumnart ordered the female police officers to wave to the demonstrators. They did so, and then marched off in formation, still smiling. At that point, the demonstrators also loudly and peacefully withdrew.","Police don't intervene even as demonstrators topple barriers .

"(CNN) -- When my publisher first suggested the title for my new book, ""Work Like A Spy"" I bristled. Being called a spy is a pet peeve shared by everyone I know in the intelligence community, after all. So, to set the record straight, CIA officers are not spies â€” a spy is someone who commits espionage against his own country. CIA officers recruit spies. Semantic quibbling aside, the primary purpose of the CIA's clandestine service is to identify and then to recruit sources of intelligence. Spies. Done well, this yields the sort of information that can change policy, shape strategy, and even save lives. But individuals who have access to the sort of information sought by the CIA are few and far between. Individuals who have both the access and a willingness to provide said information to the U.S. government are even rarer still, and this dearth of suitable candidates presents constant challenges. It can be said, then, that the CIA knows a thing or two about finding and recruiting the right people. So, although the CIA's version of recruitment may involve higher stakes and greater risks than the corporate version, there are still business lessons to be learned from the recruitment practices used in the clandestine world. Here are a few: . Know the gaps . Every case officer in every posting around the globe has a deeply ingrained sense of mission, and that mission is spelled out in the form of requirements. In a nutshell, these are the ever-changing and rank-ordered intelligence gaps in need of filling. Issues related to terrorism top everyone's list, of course, as do a number of other global topics. But other requirements may be specific to the region in which the officer works, or even the officer's specific area of expertise. A case officer in one part of the world may concentrate on long-range missile programs, whereas an officer on the other side of the globe may focus more on political reporting. These requirements guide CIA officers during every networking opportunity, every meeting and every chance encounter, helping them determine if and how to proceed. Be honest, are the leaders of your organization similarly aware of the skill gaps impacting your company's success? And, if so, are they prepared to seek out those skills during every networking opportunity? Too often, recruiting is viewed as little more than a list of current job openings managed exclusively by the HR department. But just imagine being able to tap into the collective social and business networks of every employee in your organization. The pool of talent that such a meta-network can yield has the added benefit of built-in screening by the people you already trust. Identify your targets . The intelligence gaps I just mentioned are also used in a more active way â€” to initiate and drive targeting efforts. More specifically, when critical information is needed, teams of officers from both the analytical and the operational sides of the CIA set about identifying exactly who might be able to provide the answers and fill the gaps. These individuals are then systematically targeted for recruitment. Corporate recruitment practices, on the other hand, tend to be passive: a job vacancy is posted, and respondents are screened. Even relatively proactive efforts such as attendance at job fairs or college recruiting events rely on job seekers making the first move. Instead, consider adopting targeting techniques from the CIA to identify those individuals who are instrumental to your competitors' success. These are the people you want on your team; these are the people you want to hire. Before you raise an ethical objection to ""stealing"" employees, remind yourself that your competitors will quite cheerfully steal your customers. Assess motivation . For every spy who demands an exorbitant sum in exchange for sensitive data, there's another who would do it for free simply because he believes that it's the right thing to do. There are as many reasons for spying as there are spies, and it's a CIA officer's job to understand and cater to specific motivations. The recruitment approach that would appeal to someone who yearns for the sense of adventure and intrigue afforded by working with the CIA would almost certainly fail to persuade an individual motivated by more ideological matters. The business world would be well served by the same degree of sensitivity to specific motivations, especially when it comes to critical skill sets. Everyone knows that salaries are negotiable, but the corporate world is still largely reluctant to negotiate other terms of employment. We've acknowledged the benefits and the appeal of flexible work hours and conditions for decades now, but it's the rare organization that uses its full arsenal of motivating forces to lure the top talent from their competitors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of J.C. Carleson.","CIA recruitment techniques can be applied to corporate life .

"(CNN) -- It's not being called a bear attack yet. But authorities are setting traps and scouring parts of central Florida for the animal that mauled a woman and left her face severely injured. The woman, identified as 54-year-old Susan Chalfant, was walking her dogs in Longwood when she was wounded. Her face bloodied, she rushed to the house of a neighbor, who called 911. ""She thinks it was a bear,"" the neighbor said in the 911 call. ""How old is she?"" the dispatched asked. ""I can't tell,"" the neighbor replied. ""She's so bloodied, I can't tell."" Authorities say the woman is resting in a hospital. Florida Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Karen Parker said officials aren't ready to call the case a bear ""attack"" yet because it's not clear what led up to the incident. ""We're calling it a bear incident simply because we simply don't know what happened,"" Parker said. ""Bears are very, very elusive. They're pretty much more afraid of you than you are of them, and normally when they see a human and they've not been fed and have not been habituated -- they're going to run away. They don't want to encounter us any more than we want to encounter them."" A common sight . Neighbors in Longwood, north of Orlando, say bears often roam through the area -- especially when looking for food thrown out by humans. ""There's an actual walkway of the bears between my home and the immediate neighbor,"" said one resident, who only wanted to be identified as Richard. ""We see them on a regular basis, especially the nights before garbage pickups."" Wildlife officials say if homeowners aren't careful with their trash, the bears will keep showing up. ""Unless we get the full cooperation with everybody in every neighborhood around here, the bears are going to come in for a free lunch,"" Parker said. Whose territory? Unprovoked black bear attacks in Florida are extremely rare. The first one ever documented by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission was last year. The problem, biologists say, is that people are now living in areas that bears once called home. And bears like to roam. If wildlife officials catch a bear in the traps, they'll try to determine if it's the same one that injured the woman through DNA testing. If the results match up, the bear will likely be euthanized. 12-year-old bear attack survivor: 'I just thought I was going to die' CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","A woman walking her dogs near Orlando was injured in a ""bear incident""

"Washington (CNN) -- A day after Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer rankled the administration of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with allegations that his office withheld Superstorm Sandy relief funding over her refusal to push through a redevelopment project, Zimmer now says the threat was ""a direct message from the governor."" ""It's stunning. It's outrageous. But it's true,"" Zimmer told CNN's Candy Crowley in an interview Sunday morning. Later in the day, she released a statement saying that she had met with the U.S. Attorney's Office for several hours at its request and provided the office with her journal and other documents. ""As they pursue this investigation, I will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to Hoboken and told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project,"" she said. Zimmer appeared on MSNBC on Saturday to level charges that members of Christie's administration pressured her to approve a redevelopment project sought by The Rockefeller Group, a real estate developer with ties to the governor's office. Zimmer said Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno made the threat on behalf of Christie at a May 13 event they both attended in Hoboken. Later recording the conversation in a journal entry she shared with CNN, Zimmer recalled the lieutenant governor warned her she had ""to move forward with the Rockefeller project"" and labeled the demand ""a direct message from the governor."" ""She came and made a direct threat to me,"" Zimmer said of her conversation with Guadagno. In light of Zimmer's new claims, a spokesman for the Governor's office, Colin Reed, stuck by his initial dismissal of the MSNBC report Saturday, saying the mayor's allegations are nothing more than ""partisan politics."" ""Mayor Zimmer's categorization about her conversation in Hoboken is categorically false,"" Reed told CNN. The Hoboken mayor refuted that characterization. ""I haven't been a part of the Democratic machine,"" Zimmer said, citing her frequent praise of Christie and what she describes as a solid working relationship between the two executives. ""I did have a really good relationship (with the governor), so I couldn't believe they were doing this."" ""This is wrong. This is not fair to Hoboken,"" Zimmer added. Of her conversation with Guadagno, Zimmer told Crowley she sensed the lieutenant governor felt remorseful for relaying the message that no funds would be given to the city until The Rockefeller Group's project was approved. ""She felt almost guilty about saying it,"" Zimmer said. ""She knows it's wrong,"" Steadfastly clinging to her account, Zimmer predicted that if the matter ultimately gets folded into the ongoing investigation of the George Washington Bridge controversy, Guadagno would confirm her story. ""If she's asked to testify under oath, I think we're going to see the truth come out because I will she be truthful under oath,"" Zimmer said. Zimmer's claims center around a property owned by The Rockefeller Group, which had its plan for ""redevelopment"" of a three-block area of Hoboken rejected by the city's planning board. Instead, the panel voted to classify the area owned by the company as available for ""rehabilitation."" The ""redevelopment"" tax incentives offered a much more lucrative deal for the development company. In an e-mail to Zimmer, Lori Grifa, counsel for The Rockefeller Group, lobbied on behalf of the company, asking to speak directly with the mayor regarding the property. Grifa was previously commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs for the Christie administration. Asked by Crowley on Sunday why she had not come forward sooner, Zimmer said she was afraid her story -- accusing an overwhelmingly popular governor of the same kind of political corruption he once targeted as a U.S. attorney -- would have been ignored. In a June Quinnipiac University poll, New Jersey voters overwhelmingly approved of Christie's job performance, 69% to 27%. He won re-election in November by a crushing margin over Democratic challenger Barbara Buono. ""I didn't think anyone would believe me,"" Zimmer said Sunday. ""I probably should have come forward sooner, but I really didn't think anyone would believe me."" Zimmer was unequivocal in her allegations the Christie administration continues to hold relief funds hostage until she approves the redevelopment project. Hoboken was one of the cities hit hardest by the 2012 hurricane, which ravaged the eastern seaboard, destroying an estimated $100 million worth of property. In its response to Zimmer's charges, Christie's office pointed to nearly $70 million in federal aid that was approved to help Hoboken in its recovery from the still-visible impact of Superstorm Sandy and said more funds are set to be earmarked for the city once the White House approves the next round of funding for the state. Zimmer described this claim as a half-truth, telling Crowley that the $70 million Trenton says the city received is from the federal flood insurance program, not from the pool of cash Congress approved specifically to help New Jersey recover from the storm. Christie took some members of his own party to task when they threatened to deny the state the funds in the name of fiscal responsibility. The Hoboken mayor said the governor's response, thus far, to her claims has danced around the central issue at stake. ""They did not respond to the No. 1 question: Are they linking Hoboken funding to the Rockefeller project?"" Zimmer said. ""The fact is, they are.""

"(CNN) -- There are certain moments of parental pride you know are coming: their first words, first steps, first date. And then there are the ones that blindside you. Like this: The night before the Nelson Mandela memorial service, my 13-year-old son said, ""Dad, I'm going to wake up at 4 to watch the Mandela memorial."" I was so proud that he was so inspired. He's an all-star basketball player who mainlines ESPN. Now he wanted to get up in the middle of the night to watch CNN. Great success. And when President Obama spoke for our nation, I was grateful we'd heard his remarks live. Obama captured President Mandela's remarkable capacity to awaken activism. Across oceans, across continents, across racial divides, across generations, Mandela sparked what Robert F. Kennedy described to the South African people as ""ripples of hope."" One of those ripples of hope inspired a skinny college kid with a funny name who'd been more interested in rebounds than revolution. ""Over 30 years ago,"" Obama said, ""while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today."" Same here. Unlike our president, I was always interested in politics. (As an athlete, I was small but slow.) But at the University of Texas, something deeper happened. The Black Student Alliance erected shanties on the West Mall. They challenged their fellow Longhorns to take responsibility for UT's role in apartheid. The university's endowment, flush with billions of petrodollars, invested in corporations that did business in South Africa. That meant my ridiculously cheap tuition was in some way subsidized by profits from propping up apartheid. I learned names like Biko, Tambo, Sisulu, Tutu and of course, Mandela. Most important, I learned, as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. taught, that ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,"" that we are all tied into ""a seamless garment of destiny."" It was thrilling to be a part, however infinitesimal, of something larger than myself. Even then, with my government on the side of apartheid, I knew we students were on the right side of history. I saved my ""Free Nelson Mandela"" t-shirt all these years. This week, I dug it out and showed my sons. I told them about the anti-apartheid movement and how, years later, I joined President Clinton in a White House meeting with Mandela, the prisoner-turned-president. We talked about the confidence that comes from knowing you're on the right side of history. It is that same confidence that, I believe, was behind Obama's decision to shake the hand of Cuban leader Raul Castro. Raul's brother, Fidel, had been a steadfast supporter of Mandela's African National Congress, even when the United States was on the wrong side of history. And Mandela never forgot a friend. That is not to excuse the horrendous human rights record of the Castro dictatorship. In his oppression, his censorship, his decades-long war on basic democratic rights, Fidel Castro was the anti-Mandela. I believe Obama shook Raul Castro's hand for the same reason Reagan shook Gorbachev's or Mandela shook that of F.W. de Klerk, the last president of an apartheid South Africa: because he knows he's on the right side of history. Years ago, I accompanied Clinton to a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Moments before the President was to speak, I peeked out into the audience, gasped and sprinted back to Clinton's holding room. ""Mr. President,"" I said gravely, ""Fidel Castro is on the front row."" No one had told us Castro would be there. Clinton was unflappable. ""Good,"" he said. ""Maybe he'll learn something."" Clinton stood before Castro and the other assembled world leaders and spoke confidently of ""a revolutionary idea: that freedom, freely elected governments, free markets, the free flow of ideas, the free movement of people (are) the surest route to the greatest prosperity for the largest number of people."" I doubt Fidel actually learned much from Clinton's speech. And I am not naive enough to believe Raul Castro will emulate Mandela simply because Obama shook his hand. But I do believe in the transformative, unpredictable power of sending out a ripple of hope from the right side of history. And I was thrilled that Obama's ripple of hope bobbed over a sleepy seventh-grader in the predawn darkness, watching the arc of the moral universe bend toward justice. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- Twenty-three homeless shelter pods barnacled to the side of a railroad station in Marseilles, France, are safe, for now. Once they touch the ground, most legal bets are off. That's sort of the point, bien sûr. Architect and former graffiti artist Stéphane Malka seeks out these neglected armpits of cities' public space and transforms them into light, flexible, emergency housing. He calls the process ""architectural kama sutra"" because of the unorthodox (and exciting) positioning of the structures next to, above, or below traditional buildings and city elements. A-kamp47, as the Marseilles project is called, will be included in a series of similar efforts for Malka's book, Le Petit Pari(s), coming out in February of next year. Malka designed A-kamp47--the title a nod to the city's drug-fueled gun violence problem--in 2009, but it was erected this past September in just 12 hours. The domes, which resemble a group of camouflage spider eggs, feature thermal blankets and storage space, the simplest requirements for temporary stays. All but one pod can fit two people, hence the number 47. Putting up the structure in September was also part of Malka's strategy. ""In France, there's a rule saying in wintertime, you can't take someone out of housing,"" Malka explains. Meant to protect low- and middle income workers from being pushed out of housing and into the suburbs by obscene rent increases, recently passed laws now guarantee that most renters won't end up on the streets during the coldest months. According to Malka, the rule applies to A-kamp47. And because the structure is tacked to the side of the Marseilles-Saint-Charles train station, and not sitting horizontally on the property of the nearby cultural center, it also qualifies as public space. Hoisting shelters on a wall plays another role as well -- that of visibility. While low and middle income workers might be quietly shuffled out of city centers in the spring, summer, and fall, Malka's work turns French cities' housing crisis into a living, breathing billboard year-round. ""Homelessness is very important, but it's almost like a caricature of what's happened. People in the low class and even in the middle class don't have the power to afford to stay in decent houses, especially in France,"" Malka says. ""This is a failure of the housing system as we know it. We'll be facing in the years to come more climate refugees, more political refugees, and the city will have to stand massive amounts of people coming."" Oddly, though, the people using the A-kamp47 aren't native Marseillais. When Malka went back to visit the structure in October, it was mostly populated by young travelers. (Those would be the groups of curiously well-dressed homeless people you see in pictures above). Still, Malka hopes his project inspires other architects to work on more community-minded projects that take advantage of public space. ""I really think that for architects now there are new ways, technical ways and methods, that would take us out of not only being the arm of the government,"" he says. ""We can be more open to societal problems."" Copyright © 2010 FastCompany.com, a unit of Mansueto Ventures, LLC.

"Editor's note: Joseph Flaherty writes about design, DIY, and the intersection of physical and digital products. He designs award-winning medical devices and apps for smartphones at AgaMatrix, including the first FDA-cleared medical device that connects to the iPhone. (Wired) -- Many of England's bridges have become pop culture icons—London Bridge inspired a song known by kindergarteners the world over and the Tower Bridge has its own Lego set. However, if architect Thomas Heatherwick has his way, the River Thames will soon have a new plant-filled pedestrian crossing inspired in part by Leonardo DiCaprio. (More on that in a second.) The Garden Bridge will span the 1,204 foot-wide river and contain 2 million pounds of soil, giving root to 270 trees, as well as innumerable shrubs, bushes, and flowers. The project is led by actress Joanna Lumley, star of the cult favorite Absolutely Fabulous. Inspired to commemorate Princess Diana's death, she labored for over a decade establishing a trust to secure financing and political support. As pedestrians proceed, stately oaks and manicured shrubs will dot the landscape. In 2012 she turned to architect Thomas Heatherwick, who crafted the cauldron for the London Olympics and successfully redesigned the city's iconic double-decker buses, to help make it a reality. This is no mean feat. ""We need to hold up this large weight, complete with worms, rainwater and decomposing leafy mulch, without letting the bridge structure become visually more important than the garden,"" says Heatherwick. ""To do this and not resort to tall steel columns and cables that compete with the trees on the bridge, we are bunching all our structure underneath the garden around the two river columns."" Read more: Do these buildings turn you on? The strange psychology of curvy architecture . So how does Leo figure in? Distributing the weight to the two pylons necessitates an hourglass shape. The perimeter could have been smoothed, but Heatherwick saw potential in a saw-toothed solution. He was inspired by the scene in Titanic when DiCaprio took Kate Winslet to the bow of their doomed ship and proclaimed, ""I'm the king of the world!"" Adding these ridges to the perimeter creates semi-private ""balconies"" allowing couples to reenact the scene. His hope is that this feature, and others, provide places to pass the time, kiss, and even propose while traversing the city. The design thinking that goes beyond movie catchphrases, romantic notions and the landscape has been carefully orchestrated. Plants near the entryways on either side will be wild common river varieties like birches and willows. As pedestrians proceed, stately oaks and manicured shrubs will dot the landscape, and the center of the bridge will have little vegetation to create better views of the river and skyline. The concept is conceptually similar to other elevated gardens like New York's High Line or Paris' Promenade plantée, but the technical challenge is ratcheted up given its location over the river and the new construction that's required. Structural engineering firm Arup and landscape designer Dan Pearson helped give the concept form, while dealing with the unique technical challenges of a green bridge. ""We will only be using plants which we feel will cope with the special challenges posed by a garden in the middle of a river,"" says Pearson, who also promises that there will be species that thrive in each season, giving residents and tourists something to look at no matter when they cross. Read more: Bali's spectacular bamboo village sets new heights for barefoot luxury . Heatherwick's design takes advantage of modern materials and simulation, but he believes it's more of a throwback to the London Bridge of Henry VIII's reign. During that time the bridge contained homes, shops, and was a center of commerce and community as well as a river crossing. However, since the last building was demolished in 1762, bridges have become more utilitarian. ""It's not surprising that for centuries it has been treated like an obstacle to breach, rather than an opportunity for people to spend time above a vast piece of nature in the heart of our city,"" says Heatherwick. The Garden Bridge is expected to cost $245 million, and Lumley has already raised half that amount from private backers. London Mayor Boris Johnson has promised another $50 million, and if the trust set up to fund the project can harvest the balance of the seed money, it could be ready by the spring of 2017.

"(CNN) -- Never underestimate Brazil's love for football -- a lesson learned the hard way by a member of one of the world's biggest rock bands. Chad Smith, drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, has apologized to fans of Brazilian football team Flamengo after wiping his backside with one of the club's shirts. The incident occurred during a drum clinic in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte last week, when Smith shoved a red and black Flamengo shirt down the back of his trousers prompting booing from large parts of the gathered crowd. The 52-year-old has since attempted to build bridges with fans of Flamengo, which claims to be Brazil's best-supported club with 30 million fans. ""I want to apologize for my inappropriate antics at the drum clinic, my joke about team rivalries went too far. Flamenco (sic) fans...I'm sorry,"" Smith tweeted to his 269,000 followers. Smith, a key member of the American band since 1988, later sought to further endear himself to Flamengo fans by posting a picture of himself cheering on Instagram wearing one of the club's jerseys. Flamengo is one of Brazil's most successful clubs and is one of five to have never been relegated from the top division.","Drummer apologizes after wiping his backside with Flamengo jersey .

"(CNN) -- An American man, jailed without formal charges in Bolivia for 11 months, is nearing one month on a hunger strike to call attention to his case. Jacob Ostreicher, 53, became ensnared in a criminal investigation linked to drug money and was arrested in June of last year on a preliminary charge of money laundering. But his wife and lawyer say they have proven that the source of all the money is legitimate, and wonder if other forces are keeping Ostreicher, a businessman from Brooklyn, locked up. Since his arrest, at least 15 hearings have been scheduled, but only three have actually taken place. After hearing the defense team during one of those sessions last year, a judge ordered Ostreicher released on bond. His family paid, but before Ostreicher left the grounds of the notorious Palmasola prison in Santa Cruz, the judge unexpectedly rescinded his own decision. A new judge was assigned recently, but the case has not moved forward in months. The Bolivian prosecutors in the case were not available for comment. In mid-April, Ostreicher began a hunger strike, hoping to kickstart the justice system in Bolivia as well as to rally support back home. Supporters in New York held a demonstration for Ostreicher in front of the Bolivian Mission there this month. The back story of his arrest is complex. It starts with an investment that Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew and flooring contractor, made in 2008 in a rice operation in Santa Cruz. A group of investors saw opportunity in growing rice, and though Ostreicher didn't put down a lot of money, he began traveling to Bolivia to look after the project, his supporters say. Ostreicher told CNN in a telephone interview from prison last year that what he found in Bolivia was that the investors had been swindled by the woman who they hired to run the project, who had ties with a Brazilian drug trafficker. Ostreicher fired the woman and tried to set things straight, but the ownership of the land was tied to the drug trade and he found himself a suspect. Ostreicher's detention comes at a low point in U.S.-Bolivian relations. Under leftist President Evo Morales, the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia was expelled in 2008 in a diplomatic row. His supporters are suspicious that the judge who reversed his decision on his release was subsequently promoted. But no corruption has been proven. Yimy Montano, Ostreicher's Bolivian attorney, said that the real problem may not be a conspiracy against him, but the result of an ailing justice system under Morales. ""The justice system is passing through one of its worst moments, and Mr. Jacob is suffering the fallout of that,"" he said. Many Bolivians face the same kind of maddening delays, he said. Still, Montano said, the court's decision to keep Ostreicher jailed is confounding. At the most substantive of the hearings, the defense presented more than 1,000 translated documents that showed the source of all of Ostreicher's investment and proved it came from legitimate sources, Montano said. ""Penny by penny, we've shown that every cent came into the country legally,"" he said. Prosecutors told CNN in September that they are suspicious of Ostreicher because of the lengths he went through to try to recoup the investors' losses and his continued negotiations with the landowner. But prosecutors have not presented any evidence to back up their claims, Montano said. ""I don't know why he remains in prison,"" he said. Under Bolivian law, a suspect can be held on preliminary charges for 18 months, at which time the state has to file formal charges or dismiss them. ""We're just in limbo. As far as I'm concerned, Jacob has been kidnapped,"" said his wife, Miriam Ungar. ""There's no end to this."" Ungar and Montano said that Ostreicher's condition has deteriorated since he began his hunger strike. ""He's not doing well,"" she said. Ungar shared her story with CNN and others in September of last year, and said she faces legal action by the state because of her comments. Court documents show that the state ordered a prosecutor to begin an investigation into obstruction of justice by Ungar, her lawyers, Ostreicher and others who spoke to the media. ""It's in the back of my mind. I am afraid of it,"" she said of the possibility of facing charges herself. All this happened right before the hearing where the judge ordered Ostreicher released before changing his mind. Montano said that at this point, he wants Ostreicher to go to trial. ""We want him to be absolved,"" he said. In the meantime, despite his delicate health, Ostreicher is refusing to end his hunger strike. ""It's the only way to be heard,"" Montano said.","Jacob Ostreicher has been in prison since June 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Exxon Mobil will pay all of the costs related to last week's oil spill in an Arkansas neighborhood, a company spokesman said Wednesday. Between 3,500 and 5,000 barrels of heavy crude leaked from a ruptured pipeline -- not 12,000 barrels, as previously reported, according to Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers. The company has no timeline yet for when the cleanup around the two dozen homes in a Mayflower, Arkansas, subdivision would be completed, Jeffers said. Excavation of the contaminated soil is under way, weather permitting, he said. He did not have an estimate of the costs of the effort. Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel has opened an investigation into what caused a 2- or 3-inch gash in the underground Pegasus pipeline, which began spewing crude Friday. McDaniel said Tuesday he asked Exxon Mobil, the owner of the 60-year-old pipeline, to preserve all documents and information related to the spill and cleanup efforts. ""This incident has damaged private property and Arkansas's natural resources. Homeowners have been forced from their homes as a result of this spill,"" McDaniel said in a statement Tuesday. ""Requesting that Exxon secure these documents and data is the first step in determining what happened and preserving evidence for any future litigation."" The Pegasus pipeline carries Canadian crude from Illinois to Texas, a state transportation engineer said. Exxon Mobil met with displaced residents over the weekend to explain how they can make claims for losses. ""If you have been harmed by this spill then we're going to look at how to make that right,"" Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co. President Gary Pruessing told them.","Between 3,500 and 5,000 barrels of heavy crude leaked from a ruptured pipeline .

"(CNN) -- Nokia is getting into the tablet business. The company announced a new 10-inch tablet called the Lumia 2520 on Tuesday at a press event in Abu Dhabi. The Windows RT device is Nokia's first full-sized tablet. The Finnish company is also going bigger with its smartphone line. It is releasing a new pair of colorful, big-screen smartphones: the 6-inch Windows Phone 9 Lumia 1520 and the lower-end 1320. The Lumia 2520 tablet will cost $499 and run Windows RT 8.1, a limited variation of the Windows 8 operating system that uses that system's tile-based touchscreen feature. The tablet gets 4G LTE, has a 2.2 GHz Quad Core processor and includes a 6.7 megapixel back-facing camera. The company says it has upped the screen's peak brightness so it's extra visible outdoors in direct sunlight. For its new smartphones, Nokia has chosen to continue its focus on the camera as the killer feature that can set its devices apart. Its Lumia 1020 smartphone's primary selling point was its impressive 40 megapixel camera. The new big-screen 1520 smartphone will have a smaller but still powerful 20 megapixel camera and cost $749 before any carrier subsides. The the cheaper 1320 has a more ordinary 5 megapixel camera and cost $399. The Nokia Camera app is getting an update across all Nokia devices. Six inches is a hefty size for smartphones, but Ifi Majid, Nokia's head of product marketing for North America, said the size was key because it's the largest a phone can go and still be held with one hand. While they haven't yet taken off in the U.S., ""phablet"" devices are a bigger hit in developing markets where the larger size is considered a status symbol. This is Nokia's first big product rollout since it was announced that Microsoft was going to purchase part of the company. The $7.2 billion deal, which will include Nokia's devices and services businesses, is still pending. It's unclear what kind of different direction Nokia's products will take when Microsoft is fully in charge, and where the new 2520 tablet will fit in with Windows own similar Surface line. Apple is the leading tablet manufacturer in the world, followed by Samsung, but all the major manufacturers are eager to get in on the growing market. Though Microsoft has been pushing its own Surface tablets and touchscreen-ified operating system, Windows 8, it still trails far behind iOS and Android tablets. Nokia was once the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It still holds on to a sizable chunk of the feature phone market, but is struggling to stay competitive against smartphones from Apple, Samsung, and other companies. Instead of making an Android-based smartphone like most non-Apple companies, Nokia took a bet on a third operating system, Windows Phone 8. Colorful and simple, but with an anemic selection of apps, Windows Phone 8 has struggled but slowly grown since making its debut a year ago. Getting big name apps has been one of the operating systems biggest challenges. Nokia says photo-sharing app Instagram will finally come to the platform in the next few weeks. There is still a market for less advanced phones that can last more than a day on a single battery charge. Nokia also announced three new Asha devices on Tuesday. Asha is Nokia's super simple, very cheap phone line. The tiny handsets cost between $60 and $99 and can make calls and text, run a few apps and even connect to the internet. Aimed at developing markets, they can also hold a charge for up to a month.","Nokia announced its first tablet, the 10-inch Lumia 2520 running Windows RT .

"(CNN) -- Nearly one in 10 U.S. adults get news from Twitter, and they tend to be younger, more educated and more mobile than news consumers overall, says a new report. About 8% of American adults say they rely on Twitter for news, according to a new report from the Pew Research Journalism Project. The report defines news defined as ""information about events and issues that involve more than just your friends or family."" The report comes as more and more people turn to social media as a source for news, and as Twitter prepares to begin trading shares this week as a public company. It was published Monday by the Pew Research Center in collaboration with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The report follows a similar study last month from Pew that found 30 percent of Americans get news on Facebook. Twitter news consumers skew younger and more educated than those who get their news from Facebook, and are more likely to consume news on a mobile device, according to the new report. Monday's report found that 40% of all U.S. adults get news ""at least sometimes"" on mobile devices, compared to 85% of Twitter news consumers and 64% of Facebook news consumers. Information seekers on Twitter are relative youngsters. Forty-five percent of Twitter news consumers are 18-29 years old, while only 2% of Twitter news consumers are 65 or older. By contrast, 34% of Facebook news consumers are 18-29 years old and seven percent are 65 years or older. Compare this to the 21% of the total U.S. population who are between 18 and 29, and the 18% who are 65 and up. On Twitter, 40% of news consumers have at least a bachelor's degree, compared to 30% of Facebook news consumers and 29% of Americans overall. The Pew report includes analysis of Twitter conversations related to major news events, such as the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man accused in the shooting death of teen-ager Trayvon Martin. The analyses showed that breaking news, not opinion, made up the majority of Twitter news content. In the case of the Zimmerman verdict, the largest segment of the Twitter conversation -- 39% of all sentiments expressed about the verdict -- shared news without offering an opinion. The study also found that conversations on Twitter can evolve quickly, and entiment about a news topic can shift. For example, in the two weeks after Supreme Court hearings on same-sex marriage in March, Twitter sentiment was against legalizing same-sex marriage by a wide margin of 55% to 32%. Yet a month later, opinions on Twitter favored same-sex marriage by 43% to 26%. But the report noted that Twitter sentiment doesn't always reflect the population at large. The Pew report is based on a survey of more than 5,000 U.S. adults in late August and early September, along with an analysis of Twitter conversations surrounding major news events. Researchers analyzed Twitter posts for ""information shared, sentiments expressed and ebb and flow of interest.""

"(CNN) -- French first lady Valerie Trierweiler has left the hospital where she had checked in for stress and fatigue after a tabloid's allegations of an affair between President Francois Hollande and an actress, Paris Match magazine reported Saturday. The same magazine -- where Trierweiler is a longtime correspondent -- reported that she will recover for ""several days"" in an official residence in Versailles. CNN affiliate BFM-TV also reported the departure from the hospital, citing unnamed sources close to the first lady. ""Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all who sent messages support and recovery via twitter, SMS or email,"" Trierweiler wrote from her verified Twitter account on Saturday, hours after her reported release. ""Very touched."" Trierweiler has been Hollande's partner for several years. The Elysee palace told CNN on Saturday that there was ""no comment"" on Trierweiler's departure. Hollande is visiting his home district this weekend and made his first visit to see his live-in partner Friday, just over a week after she checked into the hospital. New claims emerged Friday about the reported liaison between the President and French actress Julie Gayet, including allegations that it has been going on for two years. In its online edition, the French magazine Closer, which first published reports of an affair a week ago, says the ""couple"" also made use of a second apartment near the Elysee Palace for romantic trysts and went on weekend breaks in the south of France. The tabloid's latest allegations come a day after it said that Gayet is suing the magazine over its earlier report. Her lawyers want 50,000 euros for invasion of privacy plus 4,000 euros in legal fees, according to the magazine.","NEW: Trierweiler tweets a ""thank you,"" saying she's ""very touched"" by support for her .

"(CNN) -- A man convicted of running a charity scam that stole millions of dollars intended for Navy veterans was sentenced in an Ohio courtroom Monday to 28 years in prison -- including solitary confinement on every Veterans Day during that span -- the Ohio attorney general's office said. The man, who calls himself Bobby Thompson -- but who authorities say is lawyer and former Army Capt. John Donald Cody -- also was ordered by a judge to pay more than $6.3 million in fines and more than $330,000 to cover court and prosecution costs. The defendant was convicted in a Cuyahoga County court last month of running a telemarketing scam through his Florida-based U.S. Navy Veterans Association. Authorities have said the charity raised about $100 million from donors in 41 states from 2002 to 2010, but little went to help veterans, The Plain Dealer newspaper of Cleveland reported. Google search reveals true identity of suspect in Navy charity scam . ""It's horrible when a scammer victimizes people, but to do it under the cover story of helping veterans is just plain evil,"" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said Monday. ""Ohioans thought their hard-earned money was going to help honorable veterans. I am glad Bobby Thomson/John Donald Cody is now being held accountable for his despicable actions."" ""Thompson"" disappeared in 2010 after the St. Petersburg Times in Florida ran stories questioning the charity's legitimacy. U.S. marshals arrested him in Oregon after a two-year nationwide manhunt, during which he was placed on the list of TV's ""America's Most Wanted"" fugitives. Investigators said they found more than $980,000 in his suitcase, located in an Oregon storage unit. U.S. marshals said Thompson is really John Donald Cody, now 67, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1972, served as a captain in the U.S. Army's military intelligence unit and once practiced law in Arizona. The Ohio attorney general's office prosecuted the case, alleging that donors from that state gave more than $2 million to the charity. Cody was convicted in November of 23 charges relating to crimes in Ohio, including engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, racketeering, money laundering, records tampering, theft and identity theft, CNN affiliate WKYC reported. At his trial, prosecution witnesses testified that Thompson forged identification cards with stolen identities, and faked signatures and addresses of charity offices, The Plain Dealer reported. Monday's fines of $6.3 million aren't the first to be put on Cody's tab. In 2011, while Cody was a fugitive, an Ohio judge ruled against the charity in a civil lawsuit that the state attorney general had filed, ordering the charity to pay about $3.9 million. The judge in the criminal case, Steven Gall, ordered Monday that the $980,000 found in the suitcase be put toward the $3.9 million civil judgment. DeWine's office said it would distribute the money to legitimate veterans' charities. Veterans' charities already have received $101,000 that authorities seized from bank accounts associated with Cody or the charity, DeWine's office said. If investigators find any other money connected to the case, DeWine's office likely would ask that it be applied first to the civil restitution, and then to the criminal fines, said Dan Tierney, spokesman for the state attorney general's office. Cody had faced a prison sentence of between 10 and 70 years, according to the newspaper. He plans to appeal the conviction, The Plain Dealer reported, citing defense attorney Joseph Patituce.","Man known as Bobby Thompson sentenced to 28 years, $6 million in fines .

"(CNN) -- In my first job in high school stocking the shelves with fresh produce at the grocery store, I often saw parents struggling with misbehaving children. Some would scream, while others would spank their kids. It was always awkward to witness, because I felt sympathy for both sides. Were the children choosing to act out because the parents were busy and stressed buying food? But surely the parents could think of a better way to handle a defiant child? I'm now a researcher at the Columbia School of Social Work and a specialist in child welfare, and I have just completed a study of this very issue. Columbia colleagues Eric Nicklas, Jane Waldfogel and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn and I published findings in the journal Pediatrics (PDF) this week showing that the children who are spanked by their parents are at greater risk for later problems in both vocabulary and behavior. We found that children who were spanked by their mothers at age 5, even relatively infrequently, went on to have higher levels of behavior problems at age 9, even after taking into account other family risk factors that also affect child behavior. Given the chicken vs. egg cyclical nature of this, we also controlled for earlier problems with the children to ensure that it wasn't just that kids who acted out were simply being spanked more. And 5-year-olds who were spanked frequently, defined as two or more times a week, by their fathers also went on to have lower vocabulary scores at age 9, even after controlling for an array of other risk factors and earlier child vocabulary. This is an important finding, because few studies in this area have examined effects on cognitive development. A leading researcher on child spanking, Elizabeth Gershoff from the University of Texas at Austin, correctly suggests that some of these cognitive effects may be indirect rather than a result of spanking only. Parents who spank may not talk to their children as often, or kids with behavioral problems may be more distracted at school. To account for some of these possibilities, we did control for a host of other family factors, such as the mom's IQ, the child's earlier verbal intelligence, the child's behavioral problems as well as a measure of how cognitively stimulating the home environment was. So, it appears that spanking is having an effect on vocabulary above and beyond those other factors. Changing people's minds about something they care about by presenting data is a tough thing to do, particularly around something so emotionally laden as spanking. Thinking back to my times in that grocery store and what the parents were going through, spanking actually worked for immediate compliance: It gets the child to stop misbehaving. The child stops grabbing food off the shelves; at home, the child stops touching the outlet or breaking his sister's toy, providing parents with immediate feedback that what they are doing is working. But that makes it more difficult to see what is happening in the long term. How parents discipline their kids is intimately tied to cultural, religious and family traditions, including the meaning parents attach to their own experiences. Many of us say to ourselves, ""I was spanked as a kid, and it made me a good person. So what's wrong with spanking my own kids?"" This is a very sensitive topic. That might explain why, even though the evidence is mounting that spanking leads to the very acting-out behavior most parents want to stop and even hurts a child's development, many parents in the United States continue to spank. More than half of the parents we questioned reported spanking their kids at age 3 and at age 5, even though our question just focused on spanking in the past month. Studies that simply look at whether children have been spanked at all find that the vast majority of American children are still spanked today. Parents who are interested in exploring alternatives to spanking that might be a good fit for their family can talk to their pediatrician about effective strategies. They can also check out healthychildren.org from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has some guides for parents on communication and discipline techniques. Perhaps we researchers need to get better at telling the story. Families sometimes think we are accusing them of abusing their kids and challenging who they are as parents, and in turn they dismiss our findings as coming from out-of-touch academics. Most parents are doing the best they can by their children and must contend with advice from many corners, whether solicited or not. Researchers and health practitioners must not lose sight of the burden and stress faced by so many families today, particularly since the tools we hope to see replace spanking sometimes require more upfront effort and consistency in implementation, which can be difficult to maintain without support. We also need to do a better job of conveying to parents what they could do instead of spanking. Parents have a host of tools they can use -- talking, using time-outs and so on -- and all of us who see young parents and children can help demonstrate how effective these other forms of discipline can be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael MacKenzie.","Michael MacKenzie: Spanking gets results but can harm development .

"(CNN) -- The climate change crisis is upon us. The world's leading climate scientists agree that time is rapidly running out and that urgent steps are needed in the next 10 years to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions. But exchanging global warming for nuclear meltdown is not the answer. From a purely practical standpoint â€” and ignoring for a moment nuclear power's other showstoppers such as cost, unmanaged nuclear waste, atomic weapons proliferation and catastrophic accident â€” there simply isn't time to choose nuclear power. There are faster, affordable alternatives, including energy efficiency and renewable energy installations such as wind farms and solar arrays that can be completed in months to a few years. The average construction time for a new nuclear power reactor is close to 10 years. A 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study concluded that more than two new reactors would have to start operating somewhere in the world every month over the next 50 years to displace a significant amount of carbon-emitting fossil-fuel generation. Such a fantasy does not pass the reality check in corporate boardrooms or on Wall Street where nuclear power has been soundly rejected. The exorbitant costs and unpredictably long completion time -- a reactor at Watts Bar in Tennessee, for example, was ""under construction"" for 23 years and may be connected to the grid by 2015 -- make nuclear power an unappealing, even reckless, business choice for corporations and shareholders. Construction costs for a new reactor are predicted to top at least $15 billion, assuming the project remains on budget, which those under way in France and Finland have demonstrably failed to do. Meanwhile, since 2008, the world market cost of solar photovoltaic modules has fallen by 80%. In the U.S., the four reactors currently under already-behind-schedule construction in Georgia and South Carolina would never have begun without fleecing ratepayers in advance through a surcharge on their electricity bills. This cost is shouldered by ratepayers even if the reactor they are paying for is never completed. Government support does not sweeten the pill. Constellation Energy abandoned its application for a new reactor in Maryland after being offered a federal loan of just under $8 billion, a burden that would likely have been shouldered at least in part by taxpayers. Constellation pulled out because it was unwilling to risk $880 million of its own money in federal financing charges. Advocates of allegedly ""new"" designs such as the sodium-cooled integral fast reactor (IFR) touted in ""Pandora's Promise"" are reaching back into the atomic dark ages. Previous incarnations of this design have suffered fires, leaks and disastrous economics. For example, Monju in Japan, cost $10.11 billion and generated just one hour of electricity before closing. The ""new"" IFR design is decades away, economically unappealing, proliferation risky, and its safety claims are unproven. The IFR cannot magically eat nuclear waste for lunch as some claim. Theoretically, it can gradually reduce the amount of the more dangerous isotopes in the waste, but the process comes at very high costs with marginal benefits and would take hundreds of years. Energy efficiency measures and renewable energy, which have been marginalized by decades of disproportionate federal handouts to the nuclear sector, are the real answer. They can be deployed fast, far more cheaply and safely, are more practical in rural, developing countries, and are more effective in displacing carbon than nuclear power. Germany has stepped in where the United States failed to lead, well on the way to a 100% renewable energy economy by 2050, with a revitalized supply chain and 380,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector compared with 30,000 in nuclear. Nuclear France, meanwhile, must import electricity in winter and during summer droughts and heat waves. The ongoing nuclear crisis in Japan in the aftermath of the triple reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex serves as a permanent reminder of the unacceptable risks posed by the current fleet of nuclear plants. Given the latency period between exposure even to ""low"" doses of radiation and the manifestation of disease, we may not know the true health effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster for decades. The experience of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident demonstrates that negative health effects can last generations, cause immense suffering and trigger other fatal and non-fatal illnesses as well as birth defects. Even the routine radioactive releases from nuclear power plants can prove fatal. Studies in Germany and France found elevated rates of leukemia among children living near nuclear power plants. The situation at Fukushima remains perilous and could still become orders of magnitude worse. A technology that has the capacity to poison human resources and render vast areas unfit for habitation for decades, even centuries, cannot be endorsed by environmentalists and runs contrary to the best interests of humanity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of  Linda Gunter and Kevin Kamps.","Authors: There isn't time to choose nuclear power as a way to stop climate change .

"New York (CNN) -- New York police Thursday were investigating a sucker-punch assault on a 23-year-old man for a possible connection to a series of attacks known as the ""knockout game."" In the latest assault, the unidentified man was walking on a street in the Bronx on Wednesday afternoon when he was punched in the head and fell to the ground, police said. After he was down, two other men punched him several times before running away. Nothing was taken from the man, and police were looking into a possible link to assaults around the country where teens randomly try to make strangers unconscious with a single blow. The victim suffered bruising and swelling to his face but refused medical treatment. At least eight suspected ""knockout"" attacks have been reported since October in New York, but police have said they see no evidence of a trend. Possible 'knockout' game victim: 'The whole group of kids laughed' Authorities have reported similar incidents in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri and Washington. In New Haven, Connecticut, police said there were seven reported incidents possibly connected to ""knockout"" assaults, but it was unclear if they were carried out by the same person. There were no major injuries in the attacks, which occurred in the same three- to four-block area on November 17-18. The assaults stopped after police questioned a suspect, though no arrest was made. ""We have no reason to believe this is a hate crime,"" said Officer David Hartman, a New Haven police spokesman. Some previous assaults in the region have targeted Jewish people. Hartman said police believe the attacks were copycat crimes spurred by media attention. Youth violence expert Chuck Williams blamed the media and parents for what he called extreme aggression by America's youths. Negative attention, he said, is often rewarded. ""That's America. America loves violence, and so do our kids,"" he said. ""We market violence to our children and we wonder why they're violent. It's because we are."" Williams, a professor of psychology and education at Drexel University in Philadelphia, said some young people are desperate for attention. He called it the ""Miley Cyrus effect,"" where teens will do anything to get noticed, no matter how unconscionable. ""These kids know the consequences,"" he said. ""They want to get arrested. They want to get caught, because they want that notoriety. They know they won't go away forever because they're kids. It's a win-win all around for them.""

"(CNN) -- To Portia de Rossi, Ellen DeGeneres is more than a spouse. She's also the woman who stood by the actress when de Rossi truly came out as a gay woman to the public. De Rossi, now 40, recalled the moment on ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" Thursday, as she sat among her ""Arrested Development"" co-stars. The program's host, James Lipton, had been asking de Rossi about her name change -- she took DeGeneres' last name in 2010 -- and the couple's 2008 marriage. As de Rossi explained, it actually wasn't that long before she tied the knot with DeGeneres in an intimate ceremony in Los Angeles that she was totally transparent about her sexuality.

"London (CNN) -- Prince Harry is ending his time with Britain's Army Air Corps and is taking a staff officer role in London, Kensington Palace announced Friday. The move takes him out of a potential combat role flying Apache helicopters and gives him a desk job in London. His deployments included a four-month stint in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, known as a Taliban stronghold. The move to a new role comes at a time of increasing British media speculation about his relationship with Cressida Bonas. Harry, who is known as Captain Wales to his fellow servicemen, will keep the same rank in his new position. His responsibilities ""will include helping to co-ordinate significant projects and commemorative events involving the Army in London,"" a Kensington Palace news release said. Prince Harry spent 3Â½ years in training and operational service with the Apache Force during his time with the Army Air Corps. He was awarded the prize for best co-pilot gunner during training and became a fully operational Apache pilot in February 2012. He qualified as an Apache aircraft commander in July of last year. Lt. Col. Tom de la Rue, Harry's commanding officer in the Army Air Corps, said: ""Captain Wales has reached the pinnacle of flying excellence as an Apache pilot, particularly in Afghanistan and, in the process, has proved to be a real inspiration to the many Army Air Corps officers and soldiers who have come to know him so well over the last two years."" Harry has embraced an increasingly public role in the past couple of years. In December, he and a team made up of wounded UK veterans reached the South Pole, after a grueling trek across the Antarctic with the Walking With The Wounded charity. The prince hit the headlines for the wrong reasons in 2012, after he was photographed naked while in his swanky Las Vegas hotel suite with friends and a group of women they had met. The images were widely published on the Internet and by Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper The Sun. But in the months preceding that, Harry had won praise from the UK media for embracing a more central public role in support of the Queen in her diamond jubilee year. This included representing his grandmother at the Olympics Closing Ceremony and on a royal tour to the Caribbean.","Prince Harry moves to a desk job in London, keeps rank of captain .

"(CNN) -- No one may ever know for sure whether Ohio's execution of Dennis McGuire -- in a procedure during which he reportedly gasped, snorted and struggled -- was inhumane, but his family and medical and legal experts said Friday the ordeal points out fundamental flaws in the use of lethal injection. McGuire, 53, was convicted in 1994 for the rape and murder of 22-year-old Joy Stewart, who was seven months pregnant. He was executed Thursday morning at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville with an injection of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, an analgesic. Columbus Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson witnessed the event, his 19th. ""This one was different,"" he said in a posting on the newspaper's website. ""After three to four minutes, Dennis McGuire began gasping for breath, his stomach and chest were compressing deeply, he was making a snorting sound, almost a choking sound at times. ""And I didn't notice it at first, but his left hand -- which had been waving at his kids -- had clenched into a fist."" For about 10 minutes, McGuire appeared to be straining against his restraints, Johnson recalled. ""Obviously, he couldn't get up, but he appeared to be trying to get up or at least raise up in some fashion."" Such a response should never have happened, according to Jon Paul Rion, a lawyer representing the killer's family. McGuire's children, Dennis Ray McGuire and Amber McGuire, were among the witnesses. Controversial execution in Ohio uses new drug combination . ""Before the execution, there was a series of experts who testified in federal court that this is a possible to likely outcome to that procedure,"" Rion told reporters. He said the family plans to file a lawsuit next week in federal court seeking an injunction against the state's use of the drug combination, alleging that it represents cruel and unusual punishment and, as such, violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. ""The family will be satisfied if this process stops,"" Rion said. ""That is their goal."" Douglas Berman, a professor at The Ohio State University and the Moritz College of Law, said in a telephone interview that such a suit would be ""groundbreaking."" But, he added, the family did not appear to have the standing needed to file it. The family's concern that other people should not have to endure such treatment makes ""a nice political statement,"" Berman said, but may not be enough to file a claim related to the fait accompli. ""It's done,"" he noted. ""There's nothing to enjoin."" Deborah Denno, an expert on the death penalty at Fordham University Law School, was sympathetic to the family. ""What happened to Dennis McGuire is consistent with what a number of prominent medical experts said would happen,"" she said. But lawyers for McGuire's relatives need not prove he suffered to show cruel and unusual punishment, she said. Knowledge that there was a risk the procedure could have been faulty might suffice, she said. Also, autopsy results might show evidence he did not receive enough sedative to render him unconscious, she said. ""Ohio will have to review this new procedure they've put in place,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, about the drug combination that was used for the first time on McGuire. ""I think, now, the judges are going to ask more of the state and not just assume that they have it right."" Dieter, who opposes the death penalty, called the event ""an embarrassment"" for Ohio, but acknowledged it was not clear whether the movements witnessed by Johnson and McGuire's relatives as well as relatives of the murdered woman were involuntary physical responses or a response to suffering. Previously, Ohio used a single drug, pentobarbital, for many of its executions, but the manufacturer has said it did not want its product to be used in executions and the state's stockpiles of the drug had expired, Dieter said. The backup two-drug alternative was originally intended for use only in cases where a vein could not be found, he said. A similar response came from the maker of propofol when Missouri considered using the drug linked to the death of Michael Jackson in an execution. Missouri gave back its supply. As different states begin to use different drug combinations, ""some of this is a bit of an experiment,"" Dieter said. But what happened Thursday was no experiment, a word that has a specific meaning among scientists, said Dr. Joel Zivot, assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, who pointed out that he was not speaking for his employer. ""There is no monitoring Institutional Review Board, no ethical oversight, no gathering of data,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""This is just the state -- with the decision that it's going to execute someone -- taking compounds and giving them to people and then seeing what happens. And then that's all."" He said he was puzzled over how the court -- ""with a shrug of its shoulder"" -- could allow the possibility of cruelty taking place. Though he, too, acknowledged that no one can be certain whether the execution caused pain and suffering, ""we can only surmise."" The description of McGuire's final moments ""sounds like suffering to me,"" he said. ""All you have is how it looks and this one didn't look very good, by all accounts."" Zivot accused the state of ""playing doctor, and playing it poorly."" The problem had nothing to do with what drugs may have been used and everything to do with how they were used. ""None of these compounds are intended for the purpose of executing people,"" he said. ""They are medicine."" The compounds used by Ohio are in short supply, and their diversion from use in treating people to use in execution is questionable, he said. ""It's hard to imagine that that's ethically justifiable,"" he said. Dr. Jonathan Groner, who has studied lethal injections, agreed that executions have been medicalized. ""We've turned executions into outpatient surgery,"" said the pediatric surgeon in Columbus, Ohio. But the medicalization of the procedure has been perfunctory, he said in a telephone interview, noting that neither of the two drugs used on McGuire appears to have been tested in animals for lethality. ""Thomas Edison tested the electric chair on all sorts of animals"" before it was used on people, he said. The answer may be to return to the firing squad, which remains a legal way of execution and works surely and quickly. ""I think they take about 10 seconds,"" he said. ""And prison guards are actually trained to shoot guns; they're not trained to shoot drugs -- and the equipment is cheaper, too."" But lethal injection is called for by all 32 states that have the death penalty. Opinion: End secrecy in lethal injections .","""This one was different,"" says witness to execution .
