"A two-year-old Virginia boy who was born without both thumbs is learning to use his hands for the first time after doctors were able to recreate the digits using his index fingers. Connor Woodle was born in Charlottesville in 2012 with a condition called thumb aplasia, which affects one in about 100,000 infants. Doctors said it was incredibly rare for a child to be born without thumbs but still have four normally-functioning fingers on each hand. But Connor's parents worried it was an ailment that would substantially affect him for life. Scroll down for video . The boy born without thumbs: Connor Woodle was born without thumbs on both hands but with eight normally-functioning fingers . Rare condition: Thumb aplasia affects aly about one in every 100,000 . Adjustment: As he grew older, Connor adjusted to life without thumbs, and would pick things up like a crab . Worried: Connor's father, Jason Woodle, was the first to notice his son's hands when he was born . 'My first thoughts were: How is he going to be able to function in the world?' his father, Jason Woodle, told TODAY Health. 'Everything from five-fingered gloves to being able to reel in a fishing rod to being able to play a video game.' 'Even something as simple as hitting a space bar on a keyboard – we take our thumbs for granted.' As he got older, Connor adjusted to not having thumbs and would use his fingers like a crab claw to pick things up. But his parents wanted more for him. After an assessment at the University of Virginia Hand Center, doctors believed they could perform a surgery called digit polliciza­tion. The procedure involved removing Connor's index fingers, shortening them, and then attaching them to the place where he thumbs would have normally been. Concerned parents: Jason and Joan Woodle went to great lengths to ensure the best for their son . Expert: Orthopedic surgeon at the University of Virginia Hand Center, Dr. Bobby Chhabra, was the doctor who decided to perform the digit polliciza­tion on Connor . The end result would still leave him only four fingers, but he would have a fully-functioning hand. It was a multi-hour surgery for each hand and extremely complex. The doctors would reconnect the vessels and nerves to create Connor thumbs. 'It’s an incredibly elegant operation,' the orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Bobby Chhabra, told TODAY. 'This is one of the more complex operations that I do because a child’s hand is very small. 'The structures, blood vessels, nerves — everything is miniscule.' A major part of the procedure was ensuring that the new thumbs would grow naturally with Connor, so that he wouldn't have tiny baby thumbs for the rest of his life. He underwent the surgeries at the age of one. Because of the intensity of the operations, they were performed seven months apart. And both were a success. New lease: Connor has quickly adjusted to his new thumbs and picked up how to use his hands . Success: Connor still only has four fingers on his hands - he is missing his index fingers - but he as able to use his hands as a normal person would . Growing up: Connor is now able to use the strength he couldn't when he was without thimbs . 'I was in tears. It was a big, big thing for me to be able to see that,' Mr Woodle said. 'For him, too. For his first hand, when we took the cast off he held his hand up and he kind of stared at his hand.' Now two-and-a-half, Connor has quickly adjusted to his new hands and is capable of most things children the same age as him are. Most people are also unable to tell he is missing his index fingers.","Connor Woodle was born without thumbs  but eight normally-functioning fingers .

"Same sex couples are able to have their marriages legally recognised for the first time in New South Wales. Many Australian couples who have got married in places like New Zealand because gay marriage is still not legal in Australia. Alex Greenwich, independent member for Sydney, campaigned for the change in the law and was supported by the NSW government, and now marriages performed overseas have been legalised under the Federal Marriage Act and has been recognised by the NSW Relationships Register. Scroll down for video . Independent Member for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, won support for the bill . The new law was passed by the NSW Federal government yesterday. Mr Greenwich said: 'Under these changes, same sex couples who marry overseas will be able to reflect their marital status on relevant forms and will no longer have to declare that they are not married. 'The eligibility section of the guide for couples will also be updated to clarify that same sex couples who marry overseas are eligible to register their relationship.' The new law was passed by the NSW Federal government yesterday. Mr Greenwich said: 'Under these changes, same sex couples who marry overseas will be able to reflect their marital status on relevant forms and will no longer have to declare that they are not married. 'The eligibility section of the guide for couples will also be updated to clarify that same sex couples who marry overseas are eligible to register their relationship. Australian same sex couples have so far been forced to get married overseas . 'This change acknowledges that a growing number of NSW citizens must travel overseas to marry the person they love, while waiting for the Federal Government to legislate for marriage equality' 'The inaction of federal governments, past and present, on marriage equality remains an embarrassing blight on our nation's reputation for fairness, freedom and equality.' 'Fortunately the NSW Relationship Register will now ensure these marriages receive a level of protection and recognition in NSW, and I thank the Attorney-General for working with me towards this outcome.' Marriage equality advocates at the Australian Marriage Equality have welcomed changes to the NSW Relationships Register to recognise same-sex couples married overseas. Prime Minister Tony Abbott is against gay marriage in Australia and has blocked two bills in government . Ivan Hinton-Teoh, acting director of Australian Marriage Equality, added: 'Every year Australians are travelling to a growing number of countries that recognise the value of building an inclusive society, countries that have already achieved marriage equality.' 'In the absence of federal reform, NSW now provides legal recognition for these overseas marriages and, in doing so, has highlighted the importance of this reform for all Australians.' 'We call on the Federal Government to recognise the commitments that are made by Australians overseas. As we legally recognise foreign commercial contracts it should go without saying that we should also recognise these enduring, lifelong commitments.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott is against gay marriage in Australia and has blocked two bills. Thousands of Australians have rallied nationwide for same-sex marriage protesting for it to become legalised.","For the first time same sex couples will have marriages recognised in NSW .

"A Japanese girl's shocking anti-Korean rant has gone viral as protests against immigrants in the country increases. The girl is cheered by crowds during a protest in Osaka as she says she wants to kill all the Koreans living in the area. The video, which has been seen more than 45,000 times, comes as Japan sets about preparing itself against a missile attack by North Korea. More than 40,000 people have seen the video in which a Japanese protester calls for a Korean massacre . Crowds are heard to cheer as the girl, wearing cat-ears and knee-high socks, calls for Koreans to leave Japan . Japanese media are reporting that the army is readying itself for another missile launch or nuclear test from the Communist country. Threats have been increasing from Pyongyang in recent weeks, ramping up tensions in the region. News outlets in Japan quoted the country's defence minister as saying that destroyers with missile interception systems have been put on alert. 'We are doing all we can to protect the safety of our nation,' chief . Cabinet spokesman Yoshihide Suga was quoted as saying on Fox News. However, he refused to elaborate on the plans. North Korea has made repeated threats to Japan in the past weeks and there are fears the country, an ally of the U.S., would be in range of its missiles. North Korea has unleashed a flurry of war threats and provocations over the U.N. sanctions and ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills, which the allies say are routine but Pyongyang says is a preparation for a northward invasion .

Standing in front of rows of uniformed police, she shouts into a microphone: 'I hate the Koreans so much I can't stand it. I just want to kill them all now. 'We will start a massacre like Nanking Massacre. If the Japanese people are angry, we can do that.' The anti-Korean protesters were met by opposition Japanese demonstrators who said their racism 'shamed' Japan. Today, North Korea announced it was halting work at the Kaesong industrial complex, that is jointly run with the South.

"Businesswoman Karren Brady has criticised UKIP leader Nigel Farage over his claims some mothers are 'worth less' to employers than male colleagues. The star of TV's The Apprentice - who last week took her seat as a Tory peer - said Mr Farage's attitude made her 'shudder'. Baroness Brady, who is David Cameron's small business ambassador, spoke out at a meeting with entrepreneurs and bosses while campaigning in Rochester and Strood ahead of next week's by-election. Karren Brady has attacked Nigel Farage for his views on women who take time off work to raise their children . Baroness Brady, who is the Prime Minister's small business ambassador, pictured with Kelly Tolhurst the Conservative candidate for Rochester and Strood (right) - the by-election takes place on November 20 . The Apprentice judge criticised the comments made by Nigel Farage saying it made her 'shudder' Tory defector Mark Reckless is widely expected to take the seat from his former party - making it the second to fall to the Eurosceptics after fellow defector Douglas Carswell convincingly won the seat of Clacton last month. In comments he has subsequently stood by, the UKIP leader has said a woman who takes two or three years off to have a child 'is worth far less to her employer when she comes back' because of losing her client base. 'I do not believe there is any discrimination against women at all,' he said. 'I think young, able women that are prepared to sacrifice the family life and stick with their career will do as well, if not better, than men.' UKIP leader has stood by his comments that a woman who takes time off work is 'less useful to her employer' Karren Brady was appointed managing director of Birmingham Football Club at the 23. During her 16 years in charge the club went from almost bankrupt to being worth £82 million. In August 2006 she joined the cast of BBC's The Apprentice as one of Lord Sugar's advisors. She is now vice-chairman and CEO of West Ham United and has secured a major stadium deal, moving the club to the Olympic Stadium from 2016. In addition, she has slashed the club's debt from £100million to £20million. The couple have one daughter and a son. They live near Birmingham but have a home in Knightsbridge, central London . Baroness Brady, who became the managing director of Birmingham City FC at the age of 23, said she admired women who give up work to raise children. Today she said: 'When I read comments from UKIP MEPs saying that women ""don't have the ambition to go right to the top"" and when Nigel Farage says women are ""worth less"" in business, I shudder. 'These are the attitudes that make women less likely to put themselves forward - just as we need more of the skills and insight they can bring.' Earlier this month, Baroness Brady took a seat  in the House of Lords after being appointed a Conservative member of the house. During the short ceremony of introduction she was flanked by Apprentice co-star Lord Sugar and Conservative Party co-chairman Lord Feldman of Elstree. She was introduced as ‘Baroness Brady, of Knightsbridge in our city of Westminster’, but will be known simply as Baroness Brady. She was one of 22 new party political peers announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in August.

"Workers at an animal rescue operation in Oregon were caring for 68 cats on Thursday after the animals were found crammed into a van, many in wretched shape, and another that were five dead. It took 20 volunteers and three veterinarians to get the petrified animals out of the van after they were found on Sunday in Ontario. One of the rescue workers said there were only three litter boxes and that the stench was 'horrifying'. 'It was just a swirling mass of cats around your feet,' Elizabeth Lyon of the Ontario Feral Cats Project said about the discovery on Sunday. 'Every step I took down that center aisle, I had to wiggle my foot in so I didn't step on somebody.' Disgusting: An Oregon animal rescue group is caring for 68 cats after they were found in 'a swirling mass' in the pack of van. Many were emaciated, some had lost eyes to infection and five were dead. Police are investigating the 55-year-old woman who owned the van . Scene: This is the van police seized from a 55-year-old Oregon woman after they discovered it was filled with frightened cats . Sick: Many of the poor animals were emaciated and petrified, with some, like this one, missing an eye . Major operation: At least 20 animal rescue volunteers had to be called in to care for the 68 cats . Adorable: The woman cooperating with police is believed to have recently moved to Oregon from Texas, suggesting the cats may have driven across the country with her . The vehicle also held the bodies of five cats that died, the Ontario Argus Observer reported. Many of the living cats were emaciated. Some had lost an eye to infection, a few were missing both eyes. Officers made the disturbing discovery after getting a cat-hoarding complaint. They have since questioned 55-year-old Cynthia Allen, who has relinquished the van and cooperated with deputies, Malheur County Undersheriff Travis Johnson said. Johnson said deputies haven't learned much about her background or how she came to have so many cats. He said it appeared she had the cats before she left Eastern Oregon for Texas about three months ago. However she had recently returned to the area, he said. He said reports on the case have been turned over to the district attorney's office, which will determine if charges are filed. Allen will likely face charges of Animal Neglect I and II. Lyon she didn't want to 'vilify' Allen and noted that 'hoarding is a psychological disease'. Allen couldn't be reached for comment. Help: The animals needed food, water and medication . Emaciated: Many of the dear creatures were sick and in need of attention . Scene: This is the animal rescue operation where the 68 cats are now being cared for . Much-needed help: Elizabeth Lyon, a volunteer for the Ontario Feral Cat Project, checks on a rescued cat during the clean-up phase in Ontario, Oregon, on Wednesday . Disturbing: Some of the cats, like this one, lost their eyes after living in such a small space . At least 20 volunteers and three veterinarians spent two hours getting the frightened animals out of the vehicle . More than 20 volunteers and three veterinarians spent two hours getting the frightened animals out of the vehicle on Tuesday, Lyon said. It was full of bedding and 32 cat carriers holding shoes and other possessions. The cats have been treated for parasites and worms. One small male was to get surgery for an eye that was swollen out of its socket. As of Thursday, all the cats were reported still alive at the building where the rescue operation sheltered them, Johnson said. Lyon described the cats as stressed and frightened but tame, friendly and sweet. Many were spayed or neutered, she said. The rescue group appealed to the community for donations, and for cages to borrow. It promised the cages would be sanitized and disinfected before they are returned, in about a month. 'We'll be showing cats at the stores as soon as they are healthy enough to be shown,' said Lyon.

"Cross-Channel ferry passengers are facing severe disruption today due to a French dockers' strike. Ferry companies operating Dover-Calais services had to cancel some crossings while Kent police put its lorry parking Operation Stack policy into use on the M20 southbound. Three ferry companies - P&O Ferries, DFDS and MyFerryLink - would normally have use of up to nine berths at Calais but due to today's industrial action, the three companies are having to share just the one berth. P&O Ferries have confirmed there will be cancellations and that it will be difficult to get day-trippers back . A P&O Ferries spokesman said: 'The three companies would normally operate around 40 sailings a day between Dover and Calais but there will be cancellations today. 'We have told day trippers not to travel. We might be able to get them to France but it could be difficult getting them back. The main problem today is going to be for freight traffic. We understand the industrial action will end at 9pm UK time today.' Kent Police said Operation Stack phase one was expected to remain for at least the rest of today. Non-freight traffic is being diverted on to the A20 from junction eight and rejoining the motorway at junction nine. This allows backed-up freight traffic to park on the coastbound carriageway. Operation Stack is where parts of the M20 are used to queue lorries  to avoid causing gridlock across Kent's road network. It is only introduced as an emergency measure. There is a reduced number of berths in operation at Calais owing to strike action, meaning cancellations . The strike action will have a knock-on effect in and out of the Port of Dover and surrounding roads . The Port of Dover website reported: 'The Port of Dover wishes to advise its customers and the local community that an industrial action in Calais has commenced. 'There is currently a reduced number of berths available for discharge and loading. This is likely to have adverse impact on ferry services and capacity at the Port of Dover. 'Customers are strongly advised, where possible, to travel through Dover before midday (12pm) on Friday. The traffic in Dover is currently free flowing with space available at the Port of Dover.' Travellers took to social networks to voice their anger with the latest round of strikes. Phil McDermott wrote on Twitter: 'French striking at Calais again been floating outside for an hour going to be another hour before we can land, while Paul Woodbury added: 'Industrial strike action in Calais is taking place.

"Legislation has been introduced to strip suspected Nazi war criminals of their Social Security benefits after it emerged at least four are living U.S. taxpayer-funded lives in Europe. The Nazi Social Security Benefits Termination Act comes in response to an Associated Press investigation published in October that revealed millions of dollars in benefits have been paid to dozens of former Nazis who were forced out of the United States in a 'Nazi dumping' scheme. The legislation would end benefits for the four surviving Nazi suspects who have lost their American citizenship, a step called denaturalization, but maintain certain perks. SS guards: Martin Hartmann (left), anbd Jakob Denzinger (right), who patrolled Auschwitz, agreed to leave the US in a deal which let them keep receiving benefits. Hartmann lives in Berlin now, while Denzinger is in Croatia . Death camp: Some of those the U.S. paid - and continues to pay -  were involved with the infamous Auschwitz death camp in Poland, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were systemically slaughtered . U.S. law currently requires a higher threshold - a final order of deportation - before benefits can be terminated. A companion bill to close this so-called loophole was introduced in the Senate by a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Thursday. Mike Long, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said 'we're eager to get this done' during the lame-duck session that will last until a new Congress begins in late January. The AP's investigation found that the Justice Department used the loophole to persuade Nazi suspects to leave the U.S. in exchange for Social Security benefits. If they agreed to go voluntarily, or simply fled the country before being deported, they could keep their Social Security benefits. The Justice Department denied using Social Security payments as a tool for expelling former Nazis. 'Our bill will eliminate the loophole that has allowed Nazi war criminals to collect Social Security benefits,' Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the bill's main sponsor, said in a statement. Until their deaths: Two suspected war criminals, rocket scientist Arthur Rudolph (left) and SS guard Martin Bartesch (right), continued to receive US Social Security until their deaths - in 1996 and 1989 respectively . 'We should work in a bipartisan and expeditious manner to terminate these benefits once and for all.' Republican Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Leonard Lance of New Jersey joined with Maloney to introduce the legislation. There are 11 other co-sponsors. 'This is a matter of principle,' Chaffetz said. 'Taxpayers should not be funding the retirement of war criminals.' The Senate bill is sponsored by Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla. The White House and the Social Security Administration have signaled support for denying benefits to former Nazis. The Justice Department said it is open to considering proposals that would terminate the Social Security payments. 'This legislation is long overdue, and we are pleased that lawmakers in Congress are taking this seriously,' said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Still taking the cash: Jakob Denzinger, pictured in his Croatian home earlier this year, refused to answer questions about the financial arrangements . Overseeing persecution: According to internal documents, the government departments involved in ridding the U.S. of Nazis saw striking the Social Security deal as preferable to drawn-out deportation battles in court . The legislation specifically targets individuals who were denaturalized because of their roles in the Nazi persecution or lost their citizenship through a settlement agreement with the Justice Department. The bill requires the Justice Department to notify the Social Security Administration of their identities and locations so the agency can shut off their benefits. The Justice Department and Social Security Administration also would be required to submit a report to Congress six months after the bill's enactment identifying the total number of individuals found to be participants in the Nazi persecution and the total number of individuals whose benefits were effectively revoked. 'War criminals': Pictured above as Nazi officers talking to Jews in the Warsaw ghetto - many of whom were brutally killed. A living Social Security recipient - Wasyl Lytwyn, 93 - was part of the unit that killed them . The Social Security Administration has refused the AP's request for the overall number of Nazi suspects who received benefits and the dollar amounts of the payments. The AP in October appealed the agency's denial of the information through the Freedom of Information Act. The appeal also cited several concerns about the Social Security Administration's handling of the FOIA request, including the agency's decision to change the request 'in a manner serving both to undercut AP's inquiry while simultaneously sparing the SSA from having to disclose potentially embarrassing information,' the Oct. 16 appeal said.","Bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced law to officially deport them .
Suspects including SS guards and Nazi scientists got government payouts .
Continued to receive Social Security as deals to get them to leave US .
After leaving, US suspects lost their citizenship - but kept payments .

'Given that you've got these long . stretches you can drive on, having a nice car is a bigger attraction . than being in a city-state where it's just a status symbol,' said Gill, . who is based in Singapore. Organizers of the four-day show, which . ends Sunday, expected about 60 percent of visitors to be from mainland . China, with another 20 percent from Hong Kong and the same amount from . Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. 'The growth in China has been . exponential and the various manufacturers who are represented here today . have all noticed that their biggest market is China,' said show . organizer John Hardyment. China's supercar 'market is growing . rapidly, growing a lot faster than the entire car market,' said Wilson . Lee, Lamborghini SpA's Beijing-based head of China operations. Only 99 GTA Spanos will be made in the world, in order to maintain exclusivity . The supercar market is a small portion of China's overall auto sales, which rose 32 percent last year to 18 million vehicles. Sales have slowed this year and analysts forecast growth of less than 10 percent. Lamborghini, owned by Volkswagen AG, expects to sell about 350 cars in China this year, 70 percent more than last year, Lee said. China overtook the U.S. this year to become Lamborghini's biggest market and Lee predicted similar sales growth for 'another two years before it levels down a little bit.' The company opened five dealerships in China this year, adding to 14 existing ones. When the 20th opens next year, China will have a sixth of the company's 120 dealerships worldwide. Most Chinese Lamborghini buyers are worth at least $16million and nine in 10 pay in cash, Lee said. About two-thirds are younger people aged 20 to 32 from wealthy families while 10-20 percent are older auto enthusiasts who drive their supercars mainly at the track on weekends. The remaining 10 percent don't drive them at all. 'We call them collectors. They just put it at home like a fine painting or piece of art or sculpture. They have huge houses and they will have their whole collection of luxury cars on display,' Lee said. 'Some of these cars don't have a single kilometer on them. They basically forklift it and put it down at home because they don't want to put any miles on the car.'","High end manufacturers target the world's biggest car market .

"A woman who has been accused alongside her husband of brutally stabbing her ex-boss and his wife in revenge after being fired from her job is now claiming it was all her husband's idea, and she did not even realize what was happening. Alecia Schmuhl said at a bail hearing that she had no idea her husband planned on stabbing Leo Fisher and his wife Susan in their swank suburban home in McLean, Virginia on Sunday, adding that she was in the car the entire time and forced to participate in transporting her husband. It has now been revealed that Andrew actually shot at Mrs Fisher and put Mr Fisher in cuffs, torturing him until he was sent fleeing when Susan activated the couple's alarm. Scroll down for video . Villains: Alecia Schmuhl (left) claims that it was her husband Andrew (right) who decided to stab her ex-boss and his wife Sunday night, and that she was forced to participate . Accessory: Alecia (above) is also claiming she just drove the car, and was not inside while her husband was torturing the couple . Andrew was found shortly after, covered in blood and wearing nothing but a diaper, with his clothes and the weapon in the trunk of his car. ABC News reports that a judge refused to consider bond for Alecia, stating that she posed an 'extreme danger' to the community. He added that there would be a whole lot more information about this case coming in the weeks ahead. Andrew knocked on the door of the $1 million home on Sunday and gained entry claiming he was a law enforcement officer. He then Tasered Mr Fisher and shot at his wife, before putting him in cuffs and stabbing and torturing him. Eventually, Mrs Fisher was able to set off an alarm, which sent Andrew running.

Scene: It all happened at the Fisher's swank suburban home in McLean, Virginia . Watch the full report on NBC4 here. Emergency responders who arrived at the home on the 900 block of Spencer Rd found the Fishers suffering from stab wounds to their upper body, and the couple was rushed to Inova Fairfax Hospital. Victim: Leo Fisher, Alecia's ex-boss, was stabbed and tortured by Andrew . They are still hospitalized, and Mr Fisher is unable to speak, communicating with officers using notes. It is believed that Alecia then drove the two away, and an hour later police found them in their car near Interstate 95. They have both been charged with two counts each of abduction and malicious wounding in connection with the attack, and are being held without bail. Now, police are trying to figure out what motivated this young couple to commit such a heinous crime. Even former coworkers and friends of the two seem completely baffled. 'It’s a horrendously sad situation,' Merrit Green, a lawyer who worked with Alecia at a previous job, told The Washington Post. 'She was on a good, bright career path, and so was her husband. It’s just unbelievable.' Alecia, 30, spoke three languages and served on the board of a local homeless charity. A fellow board member said he was 'completely shocked' by the arrest. The couple met when they attended Indiana’s Valparaiso University Law School, and Andrew, 31, had held various legal positions over the past few years, though it seemed he was currently unemployed according to his Linked In page.

"A poaching ring illegally slaying deer in a spree of 'thrill killings' was cracked after one member posted a picture on Facebook. The incriminating photograph appeared to show Jose Manuel Ortega-Torres lumbering a dead animal over his shoulder in the baking summer sunlight - months before the fall hunting season. Game officials were tipped off in June 2013, sparking a lengthy investigation that uncovered a gang of 'thrill killers' in Las Vegas, Nevada, who shot game for no other purpose than to kill them. Spotted: This picture of Jose Manuel Ortega-Torres lumbering a dead deer in the summer was uploaded to Facebook and sparked a widespread investigation that cracked an illegal poaching ring of 'thrill killers' Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Edwin Lyngar said: 'People do not poach to feed their families. In the vast majority of cases, the meat is left behind. We call these thrill killings, where people do it for their ego. 'They were taking some of the meat, but that doesn’t seem to be the motivating factor.' A search of Ortega-Torres's home found illegally-killed deer, migratory birds and a stash of weaponry, Fox News reported. The findings led them to his associates: Adrian Acevedo-Hernandez, 36, Jose Luis Montufar-Canales, 31, and J. Nemias Reyes Marin, 31, . The group is believed to have illegally obtained licenses and tags to hunt. Nevada Department of Wildlife said the gang, here in another Facebook post, shot animals for an ego boost . Uncovered: Investigators found fridges full of dead animals shot under illegally-obtained hunting licenses . 'We had a systematic killing, illegal killing, of wildlife,' Lyngar said. 'We will never know the total amount that they killed.' All bar Ortega-Torres are facing federal charges for possessing firearms as it is believed they are illegal immigrants. Awaiting further trials, Acevedo-Hernandez has already been convicted of unlawfully possessing three deer, ordered to pay $5,000, and forfeit seven firearms and a truck. Montufar-Canales was convicted of falsely obtaining a hunting license.","Jose Manuel Ortega-Torres was pictured lumbering dead deer in summer, months before fall hunting season in Las Vegas, Nevada .

"Julia Marshall-Wessendorf, 37, was diagnosed with MS in 2010 after an MRI scan revealed lesions on her brain and spine . A mother-of-three who spent two years being treated for multiple sclerosis has been cured with a simple course of antibiotics – after it was revealed that her symptoms were actually caused by a tick bite. Julia Marshall-Wessendorf, 37, was facing life in a wheelchair after being mistakenly diagnosed with MS, a condition which attacks the central nervous system. But when her symptoms deteriorated, she carried out her own research and discovered she may have been infected with Lyme disease following a bite from a parasitic tick. Now, after years of expensive drug therapy and injections for MS, a simple course of antibiotics has cleared all of her symptoms. Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf's troubles first started in 2010 after she went to her GP complaining of a numb finger two months after the birth of her daughter, Peggy. She initially thought she had trapped a nerve carrying newborn Peggy around, but when she was sent to a neurologist she began to worry. An extensive MRI revealed lesions on her brain and spinal cord, consistent with MS. ‘Initially, . I was really glad of the diagnosis because MS was a well-recognised . illness and a lot of money had been put into researching it and . providing medication,’ Ms Marshall-Wessendorf, from  from Bath, . Somerset. ‘In hindsight, I wonder if the diagnosis . was too quick - and now I know it is Lyme disease, I wish I had pushed . further for more tests.’ It was only when she started to get . muscle pains - which she was told were not symptoms of MS - that her . suspicions were roused. She then spoke to a friend who told her to check . for the tick-borne disease. She spent two years on a grueling drug regime for MS before developing other symptoms which were not consistent with the disease. She did some of her own research and realised she could have Lyme disease . Ms Marshall-Wessendorf, a trained landscape architect, could . not find a bite on her body, but, after undertaking some research, she . learnt she could have been bitten years ago. The mother, originally from Germany, said: ‘Ticks are very common in Germany. You are told about them from a very young age. ‘Once you get bitten you might have a . rash or flu-like symptoms quite quickly, but, if for some reason . you don't get the rash, you might think you are a bit under the weather. ‘But . if it is not treated it travels through your body and can then cause . long term damage because it can cross the blood, brain barrier. That is . how a tick bite can be mistaken for MS. ‘I spoke to a friend in Germany who told me they tested for Lyme disease before ever diagnosing MS. ‘It can lie dormant in you for years . so it could have been in my system for a while. I don't think it is very . recent. I'm convinced I have had it for years.’ She went to see her doctor who carried out tests which confirmed her suspicions. Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf believes that she was bitten by a tick many years ago as they are common in her native Germany . Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by infected ticks - most of which are found in woodland or heath areas. The first symptom tends to be a rash that is red and circular around the area of the bite. Someone who is newly infected may also develop flu-like symptoms. If it is left untreated, Lyme disease can cause further symptoms including muscle pain, joint swelling and neurological symptoms such as temporary paralysis of the facial muscles. In the later stages, the disease can also cause chronic fatigue. It is usually treated with antibiotics. It affects about 2,000 to 3,000 people in the UK every year. Source: NHS Choices . Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf took her findings to her doctor and demanded a Lyme disease test, which came back negative. But while another more detailed test was taken and sent to a specialist in America, she asked for antibiotics for the disease just in case. Within four days, her symptoms had disappeared and just a month later the test came back positive for Lyme disease. Mrs Marshall-Wessendorf, who lives . with husband Jack, 37, and her three children Betty, six, Albert, four, . and Peggy, two, is now calling for greater awareness to be made of the . tiny parasites. She said: ‘It is brilliant not to have MS. It is like a black . cloud hanging over you. You don't know what is coming. ‘They . tell you, you may never have a relapse but then you read that you could . be in a wheelchair in 10 years. I used to look at my children and . think, “I want to be there for you and I won't be able to”. ‘Psychologically, with Lyme disease, you know what you are fighting, you know what can happen and you know how to stop it. ‘With MS that was never the case. ‘The medicine for MS is so expensive too. I was injecting myself with it every other day, which is not pleasant. ‘I still have £2,500 worth of medication left which has to be destroyed now. It would have been so much cheaper to test for Lyme disease at the start of the process. ‘It is so important to get the message out about it. Especially with children playing outside at this time of year, ticks live in grass and could bite anyone at any point. ‘More needs to be done in this country to spread awareness; it could save so much hassle, worry and heartache.’","Julia Marshall-Wessendorf, 37, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2010 .

"A former Masterchef contestant is giving new meaning to home cooking - opening her first restaurant just metres away from her back door. Kathryn Minchew, who made it to the semi-finals of the hit BBC show in 2008, is launching the intimate dining experience in a small wooden hut at the foot of her garden. The Studio, which is built around a single hexagonal table, can fit just six diners, who sit across from each other on wooden benches that are covered in reindeer hide. Their three-course meals is eaten off wooden plates. Scroll down for video . Cosy: Masterchef semi-finalist Kathryn Minchew, pictured in her new restaurant, is opening the doors to The Studio at the end of the month . Intimate: The restaurant can fit just six guests who all sit across from each at an unusual hexagonal table that is built around a central log fire . Unassuming: The wooden shed, pictured, at the foot of Ms Minchew's garden in Gloucester makes an unlikely location for her first restaurant . And Ms Minchew promises to cook at least one part of the £35 set menu  in front of her diners. But if the rustic setting does not appeal the chef is also opening a second restaurant - in her dining room. Her business venture was inspired by a recent trip to Barcelona, where she visited Tast-Ller, located in an apartment. The unassuming front door gives no clue to chef Mikel Rivas Nuria Peinador's tasting menu, and sparked Kathryn's idea for her new venue. Ms Minchew said: 'Tast-Ller was fantastic. The secrecy of it made it exciting and actually not having to make a decision on the food or wine was incredibly refreshing. You get what he's cooking and I loved that. 'I already had a Kota hut, which originate in Finland, in the garden and I was looking at that and thinking I had a ready-made restaurant there.' She is keeping the exact location of The Studio under wraps to add to the anticipation, but revealed it was about a mile from Gloucester Quays shopping centre. Top secret: The rustic three-course meal, part of which will be cooked in front of the diners, will be eaten off  wooden plates, pictured . Next venue: Ms Minchew, 38, wants to offer guests a more spacious dining experience when she opens her next restaurant in her living room . Ms Minchew made it to the penultimate round of Masterchef in 2008 but said she never had a desire to work 'in someone else's restaurant'. The Studio, an octagonal hut, sees diners sit around a crackling fire and Kathryn has promised at least one element of the meal will be cooked in front of their eyes. 'I'm a copywriter for a living and I've been running workshops in the hut but what I found was people were here all day and wanting some food,' said Kathryn, who has two stepchildren and a son with her husband. 'I spoke to the council and met all the regulations to be catering here so I already had all of that in place to make it more of a real restaurant.' Roaring fire: Reindeer hides add a touch of comfort to wooden benches that line the walls of the hut, while open flames warm the room . Sample menu: Guests can enjoy a mug of mead followed butternut squash and Chinese mushroom soup with aubergine crisps as a starter . A sample three-course menu, set at £35 per person, will feature a mug of mead to start, followed by butternut squash and Chinese mushroom soup with aubergine crisps. The main course will be a beef bourguignon served with fire-baked potatoes and petits pois a la Francaise. A dessert of brandied fruits of the forest with brown sugar ice cream is followed by coffee. Her dining room features five-courses, with a glass of champagne, cheese gougeres and a selection of cheeses with homemade crackers adding to the menu. The Studio launches on November 28 and will open on alternate Friday nights.","Kathryn Minchew is launching The Studio in an intimate wooden hut in the garden of her home in Gloucester .

"A strange animal captured by a Texas couple and believed to be the legendary 'goat sucker' beast el chupacabra has been put to sleep. Jackie Stock and her husband Bubba discovered the hairless, growling creature eating corn outside their Ratcliffe home on Sunday but have since had it euthanized because it appeared to be suffering. 'It went to sleep peacefully,' she told TMZ. 'I had gotten attached.  I was calling him Chupie.  He will be missed.' Scroll down for video . Is this El Chupacabra? A Texas couple found this mysterious creature in their yard on Sunday and believe it is a legendary chupacabra . 'He called me to come and look, and I said ""Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,¿' said Jackie Stock after her husband first happened on the creature . Officials at the DeWitt County Sheriff's Office referred inquiries about the animal to local game warden Mike Hoffman, who has yet to respond to interview requests from MailOnline. The woman also told the gossip site that she had received several complaints over the bizarre animal being kept in a cage and not receiving proper care. The couple was in disbelief after first discovering the creature, which she said is likely only a raccoon with mange. 'He called me to come and look, and I said 'Bubba that looks like a baby chupacabra,' Stock said. The animal was not very large--perhaps the size of a house cat. But its wrinkly black skin and bulbous eyes still lent it a look of menace. The couple kept it in a cage, fed it and made sure it had water. They also gave friends and neighbors the opportunity to come take a peek. Neighbor Arlen Parma spoke from experience, and insisted it was likely the blood-sucking chupacabra. 'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' Parma told KAVU. 'We've never seen anything like it before': The couple has kept the animal around in order to show it around in hopes someone can ID it . Jackie Stock shows where she first happened on the animal she thinks is a chupacabra . 'I hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and I ain’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there,' said the Stocks' neighbor Arlen Parma . And his identification wasn't just based on looks: . 'A coon doesn’t make that noise, or a possum. What makes that noise? I guess a chupacabra does,' Parma said. Stock and her husband say they kept the animal in a cage, not to harm it, but out of curiosity. 'We were just trying to figure out what it is because we've never seen anything like it before,' Stock said. No chupacabra has ever been positively identified, of course, and if the Stock's find is ever ID'd, it will likely be as a mammal, possibly with a parasitic infestation that has caused its hair to fall out. The Stocks are feeding the animal and making sure it has plenty of water . Mangy? Many believe chupacabra sightings are nothing more than mammals like foxes or raccoons with hair loss caused by mange . LEGEND OF EL CHUPACABRA . The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat. The first reported sighting was In 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born. Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world. A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012. Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra. Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July . SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN . Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites. Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange. Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast. In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin. 'Goat . sucker': The legend of El Chupacabra likely originates from a 1995 case . in Puerto Rico where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds. It . has been described as hairless, or as having spines along its back, and . as having blue or red eyes .","The small, black critter that some believed to be the legendary beast was put down to end its suffering .

"The Justice Department is collecting data from thousands of cellphones through high-tech gear deployed on airplanes that mimics communications towers, . The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the hunt for information about criminal suspects is also collecting data from many innocent Americans. Citing sources familiar with the operations, the newspaper said the U.S. Marshal's Service program, which became fully operational in 2007, operates Cessna aircraft from at least five metropolitan-area airports, selected as they cover most of the American population, to collect the data. Operation: According to sources, the U.S. Marshal's Service program operates Cessna aircraft from at least five metropolitan-area airports, selected as they cover most of the American population, to collect the data . The airports were not identified in the Journal story. The planes are equipped with devices called 'dirtboxes,' that mimic cell towers of large telecommunications firms and trick cellphones into reporting unique registration information. The two-foot-square devices allow investigators to collect data from thousands of cellphones in a single flight, the Journal reported. The devices collect their identifying information and general location. The Justice Department would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program to the Journal. An official told the newspaper that discussion of such matters would allow criminal suspects of foreign powers to determine U.S. surveillance capabilities, adding that Justice Department agencies comply with federal law, including by seeking court approval. Calling it 'a dragnet surveillance program,' Christopher Soghoian, chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said: 'It's inexcusable and it's likely — to the extent judges are authorizing it — they have no idea of the scale of it.' No comment: The Justice Department would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program . The device being used by the Marshals Service identifies itself as having the closest, strongest signal — though it doesn't — and causes all the cellphones that can detect its signal to send in their unique registration information. Cellphones are programmed to connect automatically to the strongest cell tower signal. Phone companies are cut out in the search for suspects. Law enforcement has found that asking a company for cell-tower information to help locate a suspect can be slow and inaccurate. This program allows the government to get that information itself. People familiar with the program told the Journal they do get court orders to search for phones, but it isn't clear whether those orders describe the methods used because the orders are sealed.","A U.S Marshal Service program collecting data became operational in 2007 .

"A major power firm faces a ban on hunting for new customers after an IT fiasco left thousands in the dark about what they owe. Huge backlogs in demands followed the introduction of a new computerised billing system by Scottish Power. Regulator Ofgem has now threatened to stop any sales activity unless the firm deals with the issue and the tidal wave of complaints it has caused. Scottish Power faces a ban on hunting for new customers after an IT fiasco left thousands in the dark about what they owe . The move follows recent revelations by Money Mail over how the company was letting customers down and how Ofgem effectively failed to deal with it. Scottish Power's billing system has been in chaos for more than a year, leaving 75,000 families still waiting for demands. Others are said to be facing 'unacceptably long' waits on the phone as call centres are overwhelmed by complaints. The firm has now been told to speed up call handling and reduce the number of overdue bills to 30,000 by the end of the year. It has also been given until the end of November to deal with a backlog of Ombudsman decisions it has failed to act upon. Ofgem warned: 'If it misses any of its targets its proactive sales activities will instantly be suspended.' Gillian Guy of Citizens Advice said the firm was guilty of 'woeful customer service' and said complaints have doubled since January to 256 per 100,000 customers. Scottish Power chief executive Neil Clitheroe said the billing system had been 'challenging' and apologised for poor levels of service. He vowed to help 'correct every problem, pay appropriate compensation and ensure that no customer is disadvantaged'. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said it was another example of big energy companies 'failing their customers' Sarah Harrison, senior partner in charge of enforcement at Ofgem, said: 'Scottish Power's customers are experiencing unacceptably long call-waiting times and a drastic drop in overall customer satisfaction . 'Ofgem's action today will drive immediate improvements for Scottish Power customers.' She said the need for intervention was further evidence that the energy market was not working for consumers and backed up its decision to refer the sector for a full-scale probe by the Competition and Markets Authority. 'The investigation we launched today is the third time we have used our new standards of conduct to make suppliers treat consumers fairly. 'This is a clear signal to suppliers to up their game and give consumers the service they are entitled to.' Scottish Power will each month have to publish its progress towards the new commitments and any missed targets will mean proactive sales activities have to be instantly suspended, Ofgem said. The regulator took action earlier this year against rival npower, ordering the supplier to put right billing and complaints issues or face a telesales ban. In September, it announced npower had met targets. It came as figures from the energy ombudsman service showed that it received 5,011 complaints in October, the second highest figure on record. The total was a nine per cent increase on September and nearly three times as many as the 1,850 complaints in October last year. The vast majority of complaints related to billing problems, such as disputed charges, inaccurate invoices and the failure in some cases to send out any bill at all. Energy UK figures this week showed customers switching away from the Big Six - British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, npower, E.ON and EDF - towards smaller suppliers. Chief ombudsman Lewis Shand Smith said: 'While October's figures have shown that consumers are ever more willing to escalate complaints when they feel like they have been wronged, it's particularly encouraging to see more consumers willing to vote with their feet by going out and finding the best deal for them.' Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said:  'This is yet another example of the big energy companies failing their customers. 'Under David Cameron people are paying more than ever for their gas and electricity, but all too often the customer service they receive is not good enough.'","Scottish Power faces a ban on hunting for new customers amid IT fiasco .

"A U.S. Army veteran is fighting for his life in hospital after allegedly being beaten and so badly burned that he was forced to have his arms amputated by a man he met in a gay bar. Former soldier Stephen White, 46, reportedly met Garry Gupton, 26, at Chemistry Nightclub in Greensboro, North Carolina, last Saturday night, before traveling to a nearby hotel with him. But at 4.30am, an employee at Battleground Inn  called 911 after hearing Gupton screaming loudly from the fourth floor. At the same time, the building's fire alarm was activated. Police and firefighters arrived at the scene to find flames and black smoke pouring out of the pair's room. Inside, they discovered Mr White lying unconscious and critically injured on the floor.

In police custody: Mr White, 46, reportedly met Gupton (pictured) at Chemistry Nightclub in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Saturday night, before traveling to Battleground Inn in Westover Terrace with him . Gupton, a Greensboro city employee, was arrested at the scene, while guests were evacuated. Mr White, who served in the Army during the late 1980s, was rushed to hospital in a serious condition. In subsequent hours, the victim was forced to have the majority of both of his arms amputated due to severe burns, his longtime partner, Alex Teal, told The Associated Press. He was also treated for life-threatening smoke inhalation and injuries 'consistent with an assault', he said. He remains in hospital in a critical condition. Now, Gupton has been charged with aggravated assault with intent to kill in connection with the attack in Westover Terrace. He has not entered a plea and is being held in lieu of $250,000 bond. Couple: At 4.30am, an employee at Battleground Inn called 911 after hearing Gupton screaming. At the same time, the building's fire alarm went off.

Scene: Police and firefighters arrived at Battleground Inn (pictured) to find flames and black smoke pouring out of the pair's room. Inside, they discovered Mr White lying unconscious and critically injured on the floor . Although the motivation behind the alleged attack remains unclear, there is no indication that it was due to the sexuality of the victim, police spokesman, Susan Danielsen, said. 'We believe this was a consensual encounter between the two of them, and at some point Mr Gupton began acting incredibly irrational,' she said. Guilford County Assistant District Attorney, Howard Newman, said it appeared that Mr White had been struck with a telephone, television and another small piece of furniture during the assault. He added that he expected arson charges to be filed, as the fire was seemingly intentionally set.

'Attacker': The suspect (left and right) has been charged with aggravated assault with intent to kill in relation to the attack in Westover Terrace. He has not entered a plea and is being held in lieu of $250,000 bond . Speaking to the news agency, Mr Teal said he and Mr White had been dating since 2009 and still lived together, but had decided to 'take a break' this summer. On Saturday, they had reportedly agreed to give their relationship another go, starting the next day. 'So that night was his last night of freedom,' Mr Teal said. Robert Porter, a bartender at Chemistry, said Gupton had told him he had been experimenting with men since he was 19, and it had taken about a month and a half to work up the courage to enter the bar. On the night of the incident, Mr White and Gupton, who is reportedly a Crew Member for the city's Water Resources Department, left together in a cab around closing time, bartender Jim Olive said. 'I walked them towards the door and I asked Garry, I said, ""So, are you going to hang with my friend Steve tonight?""' Mr Olive said. 'And he said, ""Yes."" And I said, ""Well, I like Steve a lot. Be nice to him.""' Public Defender, Wayne Baucino, said he had met Gupton for the first time on Friday. He declined to comment on the case, except to say that he expected it to go to a grand jury. Posing: According to Mr Teal, Mr White spent several years with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Air Marshal Service following his Army service. Above, Gupton in another Facebook photo . 'These are hard cases to deal with,' he said. On Saturday, two local bars plan to hold fundraisers to help cover Mr White's treatment. According to Mr Teal, Mr White spent several years with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Air Marshal Service following his Army service. He then worked as a security contractor in Iraq in 2005, during which he suffered severe injuries in a blast, Mr Teal said. 'If you tell Stephen he cannot do something, he'll tell you he can,' he said. 'He has this mentality from the military. He goes for it. He goes to the wall... In every sense of the word, he's a fighter.'","Stephen White, 46, met Garry Gupton, 26, at nightclub on Saturday night .

"Plus size women are angry that Old Navy charges more for larger clothing, but one ESPN host has said they should focus their energy 'on a treadmill' instead. Colin Cowherd, who hosts daily radio show The Heard, was addressing a recent campaign started by New York-based merchandiser Renee Posey to persuade the brand to scrap its controversial size-based pricing policy. After Thursday's show, men and women took to Twitter to voice their disbelief, with one critic calling for his suspension. Sparking controversy: ESPN Radio host Colin Cowherd said that plus-size women protesting Old Navy's pricing policy should focus their anger 'on a treadmill' instead . Twitter user EliIsELITE remarked: 'Cowherd on those plus-size women complaining about Old Navy: ""Maybe these woman should focus their anger and energy on a treadmill instead.""' Sports writer/consultant Jesse Peel tweeted: 'So how long will Colin's suspension be after saying plus sized women should ""Get on a treadmill""?' Real estate professional Mary Ann Maiorana also had sharp words for the outspoken host: 'Most ridiculous argument ever for charging women more for plus sized clothing. Surprised at you Colin #sexist. ' Ohio resident Andy Huffman tweeted: 'I really hope the feminists get a hold of what Colin Cowherd is saying right now. I'd love for him to be off the air.' The smaller the size, the smaller the price: Old Navy's popular Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans are $34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20 . Mr Cowherd, who has two children from a previous marriage, including a ten-year-old daughter, is known for his outspoken views on the ESPN show, which he's hosted for more than a decade. Earlier this week, Old Navy tried to claim that 'unique fabrics and design elements' were to blame for the controversial size-based pricing policy, which has left women particularly frustrated given that menswear items remain the same price regardless of size. According to Ms Posey, who is calling for the brand to scrap its 'discriminatory' plus-size up-charges, the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than 'straight up fat shaming'. 'Plus size women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second-class citizens by retailers,' the 34-year-old told Today.com. 'I think it's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change.' Unfair increase: Any women who buy a pair of the Rockstar Super Skinny Jeans in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $10, bringing the total price up to $44.94 . After Ms Posey started a petition on Change.org, calling for the brand to change their gender-biased price policies, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc, Old Navy's parent company, released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus-size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes . 'For women, styles are not just larger sizes of other women’s items, they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on-trend plus styles, which includes curve-enhancing and curve-flattering elements such as four-way stretch materials and contoured waistbands, which most men's garments do not include,' spokeswoman Debbie Felix explained. 'This higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements.' But Ms Posey insists that the statement does not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs, particularly as they also require the use of additional materials. 'Every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans: a pair that is the right fit at the right price,' she wrote on the petition. 'That’s why I was shocked when, during a recent visit to Old Navy’s website, I noticed that they were charging $12-$15 more for plus-sized women's jeans - but not up-charging jeans for “big” men. 'If they are charging plus-sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used, then why aren’t they doing the same for men? Fed up: Renee Posey (pictured) wants Old Navy to scrap its 'discriminatory' prices . Fighting for change: Ms Posey's petition has been signed by more than 33,000 people . 'I was fine paying the extra money as a plus-sized woman, because, you know, more fabric equals higher cost of manufacture. However, selling jeans to larger-sized men at the same cost as they sell to smaller men not only negates the cost of manufacture argument, but indicates that Old Navy is participating in both sexism and sizeism, directed only at women.' And it seems that Ms Posey is not alone in her opinion; thus far her petition has gained the support of more than 33,000 people, with many agreeing that Old Navy's 'unfair' prices should be scrapped once and for all. 'I wear a plus size, and have noticed that other stores these sizes may be a bit higher in price, but not to the extent that old navy charges,' supporter Dorei Sparrowhawk commented on the petition. Plus size discrimination: Old Navy offers a variety of plus size designs but . 'And in other stores, men are also charged higher for plus sizes. Why does old navy penalizes us because we are women? This discrimination needs to stop.' While many brands charge more for their plus size collections, blaming the additional fabric for the increased costs, the majority implement the same - or similar - price adjustments for both men and women. 'When you’re talking about needing more yardage, it’s going to be more expensive - but that’s true for men as well,' Christine Hunsicker, chief executive of Gwynnie Bee, a monthly subscription service for plus-size clothing told Today.com. 'It doesn’t actually make sense to me why men’s is not priced differently.'","Earlier this week, plus size campaigner Renee Posey slammed the brand's 'discriminatory' prices which see only women charged more for larger clothing .

"Back from the dead: Janina Kolkiewicz was declared dead after an examination by the family doctor in the eastern Polish town of Ostrow Lubelski . A 91-year-old woman has woken up in a body bag after being declared dead and kept in a morgue's cold storage room for 11 hours. Janina Kolkiewicz was declared dead after an examination by the family doctor in the eastern Polish town of Ostrow Lubelski, and sent to a mortuary while her family planned her funeral. But when the funeral home's staff opened the refrigerator to check on her body, they were shocked to find it moving inside the body bag. They zipped it open to find Ms Kolkiewicz awake, complaining of feeling cold. She has now returned to her family where she ate two pancakes and a bowl of hot soup to warm up, reported Polish newspaper Dziennik Wschodni. Her ordeal began when her niece, Bogumila Kolkiewicz, called the family doctor, Dr Wieslawa Czyz, after noticing she was not breathing. Upon finding no pulse, Dr Czyz declared her dead and wrote out her death certificate. Her niece even began planning her funeral, which was set for two days later. Dr Czyz told the television channel TVP of his surprise at learning his patient was indeed alive. 'I was sure she was dead,' he said. 'I'm stunned, I don't understand what happened.' 'Her heart had stopped beating,' he added. 'She was no longer breathing.' Ms Kolkiewicz said she was feeling 'normal' and 'fine', though her niece said she had no idea quite how close to death she came. My aunt has no inkling of what happened since she has late-stage dementia,' Bogumila told local media. Police authorities have started an investigation into the ‘resurrection’ case.

"After driving a tractor the length of Africa, Dutch adventurer Manon ‘Tractor Girl’ Ossevoort is setting out for the South Pole. She hopes to fulfil her decade-long dream of travelling the 2,796 miles from Russia’s Novo base to Antarctica and back. When asked whether people think she’s crazy for attempting such a bizzare stunt, the 38-year-old actress replies with a wide smile: ‘Only if they haven’t met me.’ After driving a tractor the length of Africa, Manon Ossevoort is heading for the South Pole . Ossevoort originally began her African journey in 2005, taking four years to drive from her home village in Holland to Cape Town at the southern tip of the continent. She was meant to head to Antarctica to complete the final leg of her trek, but was delayed and ultimately missed the boat that was set to take her there. Frustrated, the former actress spent the following four years back in Holland where she wrote a book and worked as a motivational speaker, while dreaming of the day that she would be able to get back on her tractor. It seems like that day has finally arrived. Ossevoort will battle the elements in her tractor during the 4,500-kilometre trek from Russia to Antarctica . In the video, the new mum of a 10-month-old daughter Hannah, perches on the seat of the tractor in a mini-dress and chats about her epic plans. Mechanics are visible in the background putting the finishing touches on her beloved mode of transport, named the Antarctica 2, in honour of legendary explorer Sir Edmund Hillary, who travelled to the South Pole on a tractor in 1958. Ossevoot plans to spend about 12 hours per day in the tractor seat, bundled up in Arctic gear – as she heads for what she likes to call ‘the end of the world.’ She will make a 2,800-mile round trip across the largest mass of ice on earth – from Russia’s Novo base to the South Pole and back. ‘Ten kilometres an hour would be good,’ she says. ’15 would be nice, 20 lovely.’ The new mum of baby Hannah will miss her daughter's first Christmas, as she will be on the tractor . Ossevoort will also bring with her the 'dreams' - scrawled on scraps of paper and emails - that she has collected from people around the world . She will also bring with her the ‘dreams’ – scrawled on scraps of paper and emails – that she has collected from people in Africa and around the world. They have been converted into digital form and will be placed in the belly of the big snowman that she plans to build at the Pole – to be opened in 80 years time. ‘I want to turn them into a beautiful time capsule of the dreams of the world, so that in the future, children and people can read something about our dreams and not only about politics or war. ‘The tractor, for me, symbolises this very down to Earth fact that if you want to do something, maybe you will not be so fast, but if you keep going and keep your sense of humour, you will get there.’ She will place said 'dreams' in the snowman she plans to build - and ask that it be opened in 80 years time . Though Ossevoort travelled alone during her African expedition, in Antarctica the tractor will need to creep forward both day and night, so French mechanic Nicolas Bachelet will share the driving. They hope to cover 60 to 120 miles each day and complete the trip in four to six weeks. ‘I think I’ll love the experience, travelling the last leg in relative silence over this vast and white continent,’ she says. ‘It’s a beautiful last phase in a long pilgrimage.’ A team of seven will accompany her, including a film crew who will record the journey for a documentary. Her progress can be tracked on the website, antarcticatwo.com.","Adventurer Manon 'Tractor Girl' Ossevoort is setting out for the South Pole .

"It was the hobby he turned into a sport that has now changed is life forever. Teenager Campbell Dawson was left paralysed from the chest down after he broke his neck on a trampoline. As a child, Campbell's parents, Donna and Jared Dawson, say their son was always on the move, climbing on his hands or hanging upside down and found his calling when he discovered gymnastics and trampolining. Scroll down for video . Plucky: Gymnast Campbell demonstrates the moves that have seen him compete at national level . He competed in New Zealand and Australia at national level and was trying to put a new routine together for the National Championships when tragedy struck in March. The accident on the double mini trampoline left Campbell, who moved from New Zealand to Brisbane in 2012, with a broken neck at C6, C7 and C1 and no feeling from the mid-chest down. He spent a total of 231 days in hospital - five weeks in ICU at Brisbane's Prince of Alexandria hospital and was then transferred to Brisbane's Royal Children's Hospital. Campbell Dawson, 16, spent five weeks in ICU at Brisbane's Prince of Alexandria hospital . Campbell finally got of out hospital two weeks ago but now faces months of rehabilitation and a lifetime of help and therapy due to the severity of his injuries. Mum Donna, 41, has given up her job as an educator at the Brisbane School of Hairdressing to help care for her son. 'Every day is hard, a challenge and we're just living one day a time at the moment,' she says. Campbell currently needs assistance bathing and dressing, moving in and around his bed and transferring in and out of his wheelchair, as well as crucial equipment such as hoists and a shower seat. But because his family are not Australian citizens, they don't qualify for many of the benefits available in Australia, such as carer's allowance and money needed for vital equipment. As a result Variety Queensland and the MASKS Foundation have stepped in and have so far managed to provide Campbell with approximately $50,000 worth of equipment such as an $8,000 wheelchair, $12,000 power-assist wheels and a special $20,000 clip that changes the chair from manual to electric. Campbell's father, Jared, 45, the CFO at Brisbane Girls Grammar School, told the Daily Mail Australia: 'It's overwhelming how much support we've had from Variety and the MASKS foundation. 'Being New Zealand citizens we don't qualify for some of the funding and support, like carer's allowance, whereas an Australian citizen would. 'The funding from Variety and the MASK Foundation has enabled Campbell to have a wheelchair and we're getting some power-assist wheels, which means that when he pushes them they move a bit further and a clip that turns his wheelchair into an electric one. The Dawsons before the accident: Campbell, right, poses with his brother, Jayden, mum Donna and dad Jared . 'It's still early days and obviously his needs are constantly changing but at the moment they're helping with equipment and what comes next with physio and rehabilitation. The family, who moved to Australia in 2012 for Jared's work, hope to buy a house in the near future, but will need help with funding to modify it to Campbell's requirements, possibly even requiring a lift. 'We're still in the process of confirming exactly what equipment Campbell needs as the accident is so recent,' say Variety Queensland spokeswoman Penny Cameron. 'We're working closely with his therapists who have explained that his equipment requirements change very frequently.' From L-R: Today show host Darren Curtis, right, presents the Dawsons with a Dodge Journey SXT car . Donna says the youngster has an amazing spirit and is tackling his difficulties with the same strength he took on the trampoline. 'Most days he's really good and happy and positive,' she says, 'but he has his moments and we have some down days but they don't generally very last long. He's more upbeat than us sometimes. 'His schedule isn't really established yet,' she continues, 'but in rehabilitation they're working on the functions he does have and anything he gets back is a bonus - in April the doctor said he didn't think he'd ever be able to use a manual wheelchair but now he can.' Donna says  the main source of comfort to the teenager has been his 18-year-old brother, Jayden, who recently presented him with a journal documenting their days since the accident. 'We've not seen it,' adds Donna, 'as it's very private and between them but Jayden gave it to him the other night when he was having a down moment and it completely blew him away. 'It was so thoughtful. They are best friends and he's been an incredibly amazing big brother and sometimes when Campbell has his down days he only wants his brother.' The family appeared on Channel Nine's Today show Friday morning where Campbell was presented with Dodge Journey SXT by reporter Darren Wick courtesy of Dodge Chrysler. Puppy love: Campbell gets some snuggles from one of his dogs, Kyra, a Bichon/Maltese cross . Campbell told the Daily Mail Australia, 'I'm just overwhelmed, speechless,' he says, adding that their first journey in it will be to a follow-up hospital appointment on the Gold Coast next week. 'We're so grateful to our supporters for enabling us to help Campbell and his family and are also incredibly grateful to Channel Nine, The Today Show and the Jeep and Dodge team for making this wonderful surprise happen,' adds Ms Cameron. 'Variety – the Children's Charity of Queensland, thanks to the generosity of our supporters, has been able to and will continue to assist Campbell with equipment he needs to live the most active and independent life possible – equipment such as an automatic bed and a new wheelchair are some of the items Campbell has and will require.'

"Using a furniture business as a front and freight trains for shipping, two brothers built a major Chicago drug ring that imported two tons of cocaine a month, newly unsealed documents reveal. Pablo and Margarito Flores vanished into a witness protection program after giving testimony about their illicit enterprise, including their connection to the Sinaloa cartel and its leader Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. The testimony that produced indictments against more than a dozen drug traffickers, including 'El Chapo,' was only revealed recently, shedding light on how the brothers invented numerous schemes to import drugs and smuggle cash back into Mexico. Scroll down for video . Brothers: Margarito (left) and Pedro Flores (right) coordinated the distribution of cocaine out of Chicago, aided by a top lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel . 'My name is Pedro Flores,' one brother began his testimony to a federal grand jury, which the Chicago Sun-Times reports was done in the presence of heavy security in June 2009. 'From 2006 through 2008, we were coordinating, at its peak, the distribution in Chicago to our customer base of 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms of cocaine per month.' That dizzying amount of important narcotics brought in $60million per month and was coordinated with the help of Alfredo Vasquez-Hernandez, who prosecutors allege was logistics chief for El Chapo's cartel. According to testimony, Vasquez-Hernandez facilitated transportation of cocaine into Mexico with trucks, planes and 'narco subs,' semi-submersible, often high-tech watercraft that could bring narcotics shipments from Colombia. 747s with the seats removed could ferry up to 13 tons of contraband into Mexico as well, using the cover of a 'humanitarian aid mission' providing clothing in Central and South America. The brothers also testified they gave Vasquez-Hernandez $600,000 to set up a importing and logistics business that shipped furniture into Mexico via freight trains. El Chapo: The Flores brothers' testimony helped bring indictments against the presumed leader of the Sinaloa cartel, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman . Flying high: El Chapo used 747s like the one pictured in this file photo to transport cocaine from labs in Colombia to Mexico, where it made its way north . Submersible: Cartels also use homemade 'narco subs,' which can evade detection as they transport drugs to Mexico from Colombia . Once the trains were in Mexico, however, what came back across the border were tons of cocaine - literal tons - with cash heading back. With the help of a 'crew' based in Chicago, the Flores brothers said they distributed the cocaine throughout the United States, even reaching over the border into Canada. 'Pedro and I maintained approximately 30 large customers for cocaine and heroin,' Margarito's testimony reads, with buyers in Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Columbus, Detroit, Los Angeles and Vancouver. In the transcript of an audio recording also released, Vasquez-Hernandez appears to speak about trying out a Lamborghini belonging to El Chapo's son. 'I drive it during the day, so it can be seen. Otherwise, what the f— is it for then?' Vasquez-Hernandez pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, and though he claims he's never met El Chapo, prosecutors allege he's known the kingpin since childhood and is one of his closest lieutenants. Though he was arrested by the Guatemalan Army in 1993 and extradited to Mexico, El Chapo escaped custody in 2001 by hiding in the laundry cart and being wheeled to freedom. Over more than a decade, he eluded law enforcement, reportedly spending most of his time in the mountainous regions around Sinaloa, reported New Yorker. With the aid of a few trusted lieutenants, El Chapo continued to run his lucrative narcotics business, with the city of Chicago announcing him to be Public Enemy Number One in 2013. Finally, in 2014, he was brought down by the Mexican Navy's special forces in a joint operation with US officials, though it still remains to be seen whether he will be extradited to the US to face charges. The Flores brothers have gone into protective custody, with their extended family moved from Mexico to protect them from retribution. 'I know that once the people I have talked about today found out I was cooperating,' Margarito says in his testimony, 'they would try to kill me and my family.'","Pablo and Margarito Flores distributed narcotics shipped from the Sinaloa cartel throughout North America .

Dorner is known to have tailed Monica Quan, the daughter of an ex-LAPD captain, before shooting her dead, and he had also shadowed the family of LAPD Captain Phil Tingirides, who was on the disciplinary board that dismissed him. In the manifesto he posted online as the rampage began, Dorner wrote about targeting the Tingirides family: 'I know your route to and from your home, and your division. I know your significant other's routine, your children's best friends and recess.' 'All of us who put on the uniform … we know that we are at risk,' Chief Beck said. 'But all of us expect our families to be to be safe. One of the reasons we do this is to keep our families safe. I think that was the horror of what Dorner was capable of.' The killings sparked a nine-day manhunt, before Dorner was cornered and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his mountain hideout . Dorner's alleged victimes from top row left: NCCA college basketball coach Monica Quan, USC public safety officer Keith Lawrence, San Bernardino Sheriff's Deputy Jeremiah MacKay and Riverside policeman Michael Crain (bottom right) Ms Quan, 28, and her fiance Keith Lawrence, 27, were found dead in their car outside their condo, and an LAPD officer had also been shot in cold blood. The killings sparked a nine-day manhunt, before Dorner was cornered and  died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his mountain hideout. Three further police personnel were shot and wounded while he was on the loose, and another died in the final siege at the ski resort of Big Bear. In a rambling 6,000-word manifesto he posted online, Dorner vented his rage about the decision made to dismiss him, and made accusations that racism remained rife in the police force . During the manhunt, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa coordinated a $1 million reward from more than 30 agencies or corporations, including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Los Angeles Dodgers, AEG and the University of Southern California. It is believed Dorner carried out the attack as revenge after he was dismissed from the LAPD on a charge of making false statements in 2008. In the rambling 6,000-word manifesto he posted online, he vented his rage about the decision made  to dismiss him, and made accusations that racism remained rife in the police force. In it he promises to wage 'unconventional and asymmetrical warfare' against police as revenge for his 'unjust' treatment by the 'corrupt' department.

"Alex Salmond has stepped down as SNP leader with a prediction that his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, will 'make history' and secure independence for Scotland. The outgoing First Minister made the forecast as he addressed the SNP annual conference in Perth shortly after Ms Sturgeon took over the reins as head of the party. Ms Sturgeon will use her keynote speech today to suggest that her party will prop up a Labour government after the next General Election. And she will pledge that her party will not do a deal with the Conservatives if David Cameron fails to win an overall majority at Westminster next year. Alex Salmond (right) has stepped down as SNP leader with a prediction that his successor, Nicola Sturgeon (left), will 'make history' and secure independence for Scotland . With a hung parliament being one possible outcome in May's general election, Ms Sturgeon said the nationalists - who have seen their support rise since the independence referendum - could hold the balance of power in the UK parliament. As she makes her first speech as party leader at the SNP annual conference in Perth, she will say: 'The SNP will never put the Tories into government.' In the general election, Labour will 'fall back on the same desperate mantras as before' and tell voters north of the border the only way to keep the Conservatives out of Downing Street is to back Ed Miliband's party. But she will claim that is 'the biggest con trick in Scottish politics' and say voters must 'not fall for it again'. Ms Sturgeon will recall: 'Scotland did vote Labour at the last general election, but we still ended up with the Tories. 'And if the people of England vote Tory next May, it won't matter how we vote, a Tory government is what we'll get. Or worse a Tory/Ukip government.' If that happens, she will say Scotland will need 'strong SNP MPs who will stand up to the Tories, challenge the despicable politics of Nigel Farage and fight Scotland's corner'. She will add: 'Perhaps this time Scotland's votes will count. Scotland could well hold the balance of power in a Westminster parliament with no overall majority.' Ms Sturgeon will vow: 'If that happens, I promise you this - you won't need to have voted Labour to keep the Tories out, because that's what we'll do. The outgoing First Minister made the forecast as he addressed the SNP annual conference in Perth shortly after Ms Sturgeon took over the reins as head of the party . 'My pledge to Scotland today is this - the SNP will never put the Tories into government.' Mr Salmond announced that he would be resigning as both SNP leader and First Minister within hours of the referendum defeat in September. Scotland has now 'changed utterly' as a result of that vote, he said. He hailed Ms Sturgeon - who will be Scotland's first female First Minister - as a 'woman of extraordinary talent'. Her mother, Joan Sturgeon, could be seen wiping away tears as she sat in the audience. Mr Salmond told his successor: 'Nicola, your contribution to where this party now stands has already been immense. 'Your future contribution - I have no doubt - will be to make history.' He told the conference the 'dream' of independence was 'alive and well and will succeed'. Mr Salmond said that in the referendum - in which the Yes campaign secured 45% of the vote - Scotland had risen to 'the challenge of change'. He said: 'The people will not disappear back into the political shadows and the nation will not fade into the dark. This country has changed and changed utterly. 'That is the change which will carry us forward - forward to independence.' Joan Sturgeon, Nicola Sturgeon's mother, could be seen wiping away tears as she sat in the audience . While a majority of voters did not back independence in the referendum, Mr Salmond said he knew 'with a greater certainty than ever before' that the country would one day leave the UK. 'At various times in our national story, Scotland has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,' he said. 'This time, out of defeat will come future success.' He insisted that September 18 would in future 'come to be seen as the day Scotland started to take control of our own destiny'. He said that many No voters had been won over by the vow of substantial new powers made by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg in their 'last-minute promise of radical constitutional reform within the union'. Mr Salmond told SNP activists: 'Be in no doubt - without that last-gasp concession, the No campaign would have had its just deserts.' He went on to warn the leaders of the UK parties: 'If the Westminster gang reneges on that promise made in the campaign, they will discover that hell hath no fury like this nation scorned.' Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown promised 'home rule' for Scotland when he made a 'brief cameo appearance as leader of Better Together' - the cross-party campaign for the union. Ms Sturgeon will formally replace Alex Salmond as First Minister next week after a vote in Holyrood . While Mr Salmond said both the Conservatives and Labour would try to renege on the commitment, he stressed that 'Scotland expects the vow to be redeemed'. Despite the referendum result, he said the SNP was 'invigorated as never before' as he set his party the challenge of winning a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster for the first time in next May's general election, and amassing 100,000 members by then. 'We have never been an ordinary political party,' Mr Salmond said. 'Now we are an extraordinary political party with a great task to be completed.' While the SNP had 25,000 members at the time of the referendum, that membership has now swelled to more than 85,000. Setting the target of increasing that further, Mr Salmond said: 'Let us ensure that by next May's election the SNP reaches a level which has never been seen before in any political party in the history of Scottish politics - 100,000 members to argue for the national cause.' He also said the nationalists should set out to win 'our first UK general election in Scotland' in less than six months' time. To help achieve that, he said the party should be 'open and generous', and allow 'some shining stars of the Yes movement to stand under the SNP banner'.","Alex Salmond made forecast as he addressed SNP conference in Perth .

The male victim is being remembered as 'a good man and deadly father'. 'U was like my big brother, U was a good man n deadly father,' his cousin wrote on Facebook. 'U will b missed by so many brus, Rest in the dream time. Love n miss u xo (sic)' Police have cordoned the street off after the double murder of a man and woman on the side of the road in NSW border town Moama . The man was found dead inside of a white sedan, whilst the woman was positioned halfway out of the vehicle. Each had been shot multiple times. The bodies were discovered by a local resident on a bush track four kilometres outside of the Moama township. NSW Police media confirmed that the deaths are being treated as suspicious and urged members of the public to come forward with any information. 'This crime has occurred in your community and we are sure that people have knowledge of what happened and why,' said Superintendent Paul Condon of Deniliquin Local Area Command. The Mayor of the town, Thomas Weyrich told Daily Mail Australia that he is greatly concerned about the safety of the residents in Moama. 'My greatest concern is that we have somebody walking around who is armed and is capable of multiple homicides,' said Mr Weyrich. 'I am extremely concerned, the people of Moama need to be very, very careful who they talk to and communicate with. Mr Weyrich told Daily Mail Australia that rumours are flying around town speculating as to why the shootings took place, as people desperately search for answers. 'There is speculation that the killings might be drug-related. But the town is awash with rumours,' said Mr Weyrich. 'I don't think anybody knows. I don't know anything more than the public.' 'Police are heavily involved and treating the case with the greatest urgency. The sooner the perpetrator or perpetrators are brought into custody the better.' Councillor Weyrich said that he and the community are shocked, as nothing like this has ever happened before. 'We are a quiet little New South Wales town. This is a very safe place and we don't by and large have any criminal activity. 'This has come out of left field. A man and a woman have been found dead in the NSW town of Moama . The mayor did confirm that there is a bikie presence in the town. 'We do have a Bandidos clubhouse across the river and a member that lives close by, but I am not saying that they are involved.' Resident Kylie Spencer said she was driving into town about 9.20am on Wednesday and noticed a white car pulled off the road. 'I didn't know there were bodies,' Ms Spencer, who lives on the road, told AAP. 'I drove past thinking they had a punctured tyre. You do 100km/h down that road. 'It was just pulled over on the road, nothing suspicious at all.' Ms Spencer said there was another car pulled over next to the white vehicle. She assumed the motorist was helping out. Emergency services, including police and paramedics, were called to the scene at Old Deniliquin Road on Tuesday morning. 'At 9.26am paramedics were initially called out to what we were told was a car accident,' a Victoria Rural Ambulance Service spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'When the paramedics arrived they confirmed two people were deceased. 'Police have now established a crime scene.' Shots were reportedly heard before the bodies were found. Residents of Old Deniliquin Road are not able to return to their homes after police cordoned off the street to establish a crime scene. The Riverine Herald also reports that an abandoned car was seen by residents. Police from Deniliquin Local Area Command, with the assistance of detectives from State Crime Commands Homicide Squad are investigating the deaths. The town is in the Riverina region, 220 kilometres north of Melbourne and west of Albury.

"A Sydney woman who racked up credit card debt of nearly $200,000, but was still able to turn her life around, has given her advice on how to bounce back from financial ruin. Originally from Canada, Alice Crawley racked up $100,000 on credit cards in her homeland before coming to Australia 15 years ago and adding $85,000 of debt to that. ‘I was only earning $50,000 per year, but was completely out of control with money and was a chronic over-spender on credit cards,’ she explained. Scroll down for video . After racking up a credit card debt of nearly $200,000 Alice Crawley was at her wit's end . ‘So I just continued to get credit cards, and even got bank loans out to cover the credit card debt, only to max them out as well. It was a drastic situation. ‘I was doing office work and administrative roles which were really beneath my capabilities, but this was my basic problem – I totally undervalued myself despite having a university education. I’d absolutely no sense of self-worth.’ Scaling down her spending and being more realistic put Alice back on the road to redemption . Because of her self-esteem issues and the stress the debt was putting her under; Alice would spend to make herself feel better. Of course, this just worsened the situation and sent her life flying into a downward spiral. Nothing was too much. She’d splash out on luxury holidays to the likes of Hawaii and Fiji, while if she stayed in Australia she would holiday in the likes of Byron Bay and book into the plushest hotel there. There were expensive spa treatments, extravagant nights out in trendy restaurants, lavish gifts for herself and her friends – the spending was never-ending. But none of it made her feel better. Because of the shame she felt over her continuing debt she put on a front of being successful and wealthy when she was anything but that. ‘I was filled with so much fear and self-loathing. I’d spend all this money to compensate for my lack of self-worth,’ Alice said. ‘I was feeling desperate and out of control. I was totally overwhelmed. But after unburdening myself to a friend and admitting I had a problem, I vowed to turn my life around.’ Because of the shame she felt over her continuing debt Alice put on a front of being successful and wealthy . Alice sat down and made up a plan. After educating herself on financial strategies and techniques to change her mindset with money, she more than tripled her income in the space of a year by working in better jobs. It then took a few years to get her credit rating back to normal. She did this by using only cash and direct debit . Because of all she’d experienced, Alice went into financial coaching to help other women who were suffering with money problems. After being told she’d have to declare bankruptcy, in four years, she paid off all the debt. She now helps women redefine their relationship with money, which is the most common roadblock to long-term financial freedom. Alice believes we live in a society where we're all encouraged to overspend and live the highlife . ‘I have five basic tips about how to turn around your money problems,” Alice said. ‘Firstly, pre-plan when you're going to do your shopping and stick to that schedule. Avoid the shops when you're stressed, overtired or hungry. ‘Apply the three D strategy: DECIDE, DISTRACT, DELAY - decide to walk away, distract yourself with another activity or delay the urge -give it 24 hours and sleep on it. ‘Set a spending plan and shopping list and stick to it. ‘Use cash and direct debit rather than credit. When buying gifts carry cash in an envelope with the person's name on it and only spend what's in the envelope for that person. ‘Finally, be mindful of what you are spending money on over the holidays, tally up your spending at the end of each week so that you are aware of where your money is going. Put stop gaps in place where necessary.’ She believed the tips were even more essential now as we come up to Christmas and the holiday period, especially for women. Alice always had lavish holidays to Hawaii and Fiji despite her secret financial woes . ‘It’s so loaded with expectation. There’s so much pressure to go out and spend a lot of money around the holidays,’ Alice said. The annual Stress and Wellbeing in Australia Survey 2014 conducted by the Australian Psychological Society (APS) released on Tuesday has found 53% of Australian women say personal finances are a major source of stress. ‘A lot of women are dealing with low wages and overspending. It is a vicious circle because you get so down about the debt you’re in; you spend to make yourself feel better. You have to take responsibility for your situation and plan ahead,’ she said. Alice also believed banks and retailers were also a big part of the problem. ‘We live in a society where you are encouraged to overspend. Despite the fact I was only earning $50,000 per year, these banks still gave me a $10,000 credit limit, which was an exorbitant amount. It was one fifth of my salary. Yet they continued to extend my credit willingly,’ she said. Eventually Alice got her credit rating back to normal by using only cash and direct debit . Alice has already launched www.alicecrawley.com and has a rapidly growing community presence and following across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. She has released 12 free episodes of Alice TV, inspiring women to find their own way out of the rabbit hole of debt. While in February 2015, she will be launching her first online program ‘Rich, Happy and Free’.","Alice Crawley had debts of $100,000 in Canada and $85,000 in Australia .

"A Las Vegas man testified before the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, telling the heartbreaking story about how his mother suffered a slow and painful death from E. coli complications after eating a few spoonfuls of tainted cookie dough. Linda Rivera died at the age of 61 in July 2013,  four years after she ate some cookie dough that was later recalled for traces of the dangerous bacteria. Her son Richard Simpson said Thursday that stricter regulations could prevent further needless loss of life, like that of his mother. However, experts say the cookie dough wasn't ultimately what killed the woman. Linda Rivera died in July 2013, and her son believes the cause of her death is a few bites of raw cookie dough she ate four years prior which gave her a deadly strain of E. coli . Nestle recalled their Toll House Cookie Dough in 2009 amid reports of E. coli. They also closed down their facilities which were thoroughly cleaned before opening up for production again, using new ingredients . Rivera is pictured above in a video recorded in 2010. Her health never recovered after her kidneys initially failed in May 2009 . The former high school teacher aide's health problems trace back to  May 2009, when she took a package of Nestle cookie dough to the living room couch to indulge. 'You watch a commercial, you go into a store and you just assume it's okay to eat,' her husband Richard Rivera told the Washington Post in 2009. 'I assume if it's on a shelf, it's safe. But this whole thing has changed the way I look at food.' Just seven days later, Rivera's kidneys stopped functioning, sending her into septic shock. When Nestle found out that several people had been experiencing symptoms of E. coli they shut down the Danville, Virginia, plant that makes their prepackaged Toll House cookie dough and recalled 3.6million packages of their product - costing $30 to $50 million. They cleaned the plant thoroughly, but then opened up a month later using new ingredients and adding an extra warning to not eat raw dough on their packaging. Rivera settled with the company before her death, for an undisclosed amount. Rivera appears to be the victim who was most injured in the outbreak., unusual for a middle aged woman since E. coli usually affects the very old and very young the most. For the next few years she kept getting sicker and sicker and eventually passed away in July 2013, from medical complications her son believes started with the cookie dough. 'There were moments of hope - and of despair,' 22-year-old Mr Simpson said on Thursday, according to ABC News. 'She fought very hard. We knew she didn't want to give up.' Mr Simpson is now fighting to make changes to the FDA's Food Safety Modernization Act which would include updates that would more effectively stop the spread of E. coli bacteria. Experts point out, however, that Rivera's batter with E. coli is not what ended up killing her in the end. 'She never really recovered completely from her initial illness, and then developed a series of medical complications,' Dr William Schaffner, a professor at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, told ABC News. Linda pictured above in her hospital room with husband Richard Rivera. Her son Richard Simpson is now fighting for changes in food production regulations which would prevent other deaths like his mother's . Nestle has issued a statement on Rivera's battle. 'The fact that our product was implicated in Linda Rivera’s 2009 illness and tragic passing was obviously of grave concern to all of us at Nestle. 'Since then, we have implemented more stringent testing and inspection of raw materials and finished product to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. 'In addition, we have switched to using heat-treated flour to further enhance safety. We continue to emphasize that the cookie dough should be consumed only after baking and not eaten raw.'","Linda Rivera died in July 2013, four years after eating a few bites of cookie dough that was later recalled for E. coli .

"Security experts have warned for months that smart cars are vulnerable to hackers, and now a pair of researchers has revealed the specific vehicles that are at the greatest risk. Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller studied the schematics for a range of cars from the 2006 Range Rover Sport to this year's BMW 3 Series. The 2014 Jeep Cherokee and 2015 Cadillac Escalade were the most vulnerable of the cars studied, while the 2006 Ford Fusion and 2010 Range Rover Sport were listed as two of the most secure. Scroll down for video . Security experts have been warning for months that cars are vulnerable to attack from hackers, and now a pair of researchers has revealed which vehicles are the most at risk. According to the report, the 2014 Jeep Cherokee (pictured) and 2015 Cadillac Escalade were the most vulnerable of the cars studied . Mr Miller is a security engineer at Twitter, and Mr Valasek is director of Security Intelligence at IOActive. Other cars that performed poorly in their tests were the 2010 and 2014 Toyota Prius, as well as the 2014 Infiniti Q50. The report has been shared with the Department of Transportation and industry group, the Society of Automobile Engineers. Each car was rated under three categories – attack surface, network architecture and cyber physical. A car’s wireless ‘attack surface’ includes the range of features that can be hacked, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, mobile network connections, key fobs, and tyre pressure monitoring systems. The network architecture includes how much access these features give to a vehicle’s critical systems, such as the horn, the steering and brakes. Cyber physical relates to capabilities such as automated braking and parking sensors that can be controlled using wireless commands. ‘Automotive security concerns have gone from the fringe to the mainstream with security researchers showing the susceptibility of the modern vehicle to local and remote attacks,’ said Mr Valasek and Mr Miller. The 2006 Ford Fusion (pictured) and the 2006 and 2010 Range Rover Sport were listed as two of the most secure vehicles studied . ‘A malicious attacker leveraging a remote vulnerability could do anything from enabling a microphone for eavesdropping to turning the steering wheel to disabling the brakes. ‘Unfortunately, research has only been presented on three or four particular vehicles. ‘Each manufacturer designs their fleets differently; therefore analysis of remote threats must avoid generalities. ‘[Our research] takes a step back and examines the automotive network of a large number of different manufacturers from a security perspective. The results were published in a 92-page report presented at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. Mr Miller and Mr Valasek were the same researchers who demonstrated hacking a Toyota Prius and a Ford Escape last year. Each car was rated for attack surface, network architecture and cyber physical.

The 2015 Cadillac Escalade is pictured . Using a laptop wirelessly connected to the car's electronics, they were able to remotely control the brakes, the accelerator, change the speedometer, switch the headlights on and off, tighten the seatbelts and even blast the horn. The project was funded by a grant from the U.S Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to highlight the security risks affecting modern-day cars. Infinity told Wired that the researchers didn’t physically hack the car, but said it is looking into the claims. This was also true for Chrysler. MailOnline has contacted the other manufacturers mentioned for their view on the findings.","Experts Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller studied 20 car makes and models .

"The art of foraging for your food is no longer confined to the countryside, according to one top chef. Caroline Davey, professional forager and chef is inspiring the nation to explore the UK's best autumn ingredients that can be easily discovered by buildings and built up spaces or picked on country walks. City dwellers can go sloe picking in Manchester's parks, discover Peckham's pavement crop of citrus pineapple weeds or head to Likey Hills in Birmingham where bilberries grow plentiful in plain sight. Explore the UK's best ingredients which can be easily discovered by buildings or picked on country walks . Outside of cities, intrepid cooks across the countryside are sourcing a variety of ingredients to impress friends and family. From cobnuts found in Kentish hedgerows to juicy rosehips hiding along the public foot paths of the Isle of Man and more than 600 varieties of seaweed found along the shores of the UK's coastal towns, the country is brimming with wild foods. The fruits of foraging: Fresh sloe berries being prepared for homemade sloe gin . Wild mushrooms: Britain in home to the scarlet hood mushrooms (left) and the Amethyst Deceiver (right) Ms Davey said: 'There are so many ingredients that bloom in autumn and picking a few new flavours can transform a home cooked meal. 'Find your own horseradish as this will spice up any sauce you make to go with beef and look out for wood blewit mushrooms, as these will have a superior flavour to any cultivated mushrooms you can buy.' With more choice on offer in the wild, it's not hard to see why Brits are foraging for flavour. The UK is home to more than 50 varieties of edible mushrooms compared to just nine on average in the aisles of the weekly shop - but be careful to pick the right ones.

Owner Eduardo Landin, 35, who lives in the Brete neighbourhood of the city of Banda in the Argentinian province of Santiago del Estero said he was shocked when he noticed that one of his new puppies appeared to have a trunk instead of a nose. He said: 'It was kind of similar but also shockingly different to the other puppies, so I realised it was in some way deformed and at first I thought it was dead. But then I saw it moving and trying to feed, so I helped it over to the mother and it managed to drink something but it's nose kept getting in the way.' Scroll down for video . Bizarre: A puppy has been born in Argentina that resembles Dobby from the Harry Potter films . Stumped: Vets are baffled by the puppy's deformity . He said that the deformed puppy was one of a litter of 11 and was the only one that was not normal. He added: 'I was amazed at how quickly word spread and loads of people are coming round to look at the tiny puppy, and take pictures and videos. One of the children that came round said it looked like a character from the Harry Potter movie and that's what everyone is calling it in the local media here.' He said he had taken it to the local Animal Health Centre where the reason for the deformity puzzled vets, who added that they suspected the tiny puppy would not live much longer but told him to come back in 15 days if it was still alive. Local media said that the deformation was due to the use of pesticides on farmland in the region . The owners said that some people have told them the dog is evil . Two local woman, Andrea Rico, 43, and Marcela Davila, 40, who are friends of the family are currently looking after the puppy and trying to keep it alive. Andrea said: 'The mother has not rejected the puppy but he does have difficulty sucking, as his trunk gets in the way and it's like he's drowning.' Local media said that the deformation was due to the use of pesticides on farmland in the region, although they admitted they had never seen anything similar before. Eduardo said: 'We have had a few calls from people telling us it's evil and we need to kill it and burn the body. But that's just superstition talking, it is a mutation but it isn't evil.'","A dog in Argentina has been born with a trunk instead of a nose .

"We have evolved to feel calmer sitting by a campfire (stock image), according to an anthropologist . Sitting by an open fire when it's cold and wet outside is many people's idea of a perfect winter evening. Now an anthropologist claims that this love for the hearth is deeply ingrained and borne out of evolution. His study has shown that sitting next to a logfire causes our blood pressure to drop and leaves us feeling more at ease. The reason for the relaxing effect harks back to prehistoric times when Stone Age man socialised around camp fires and felt safe and warm while bonding with friends, he claims. In a study published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, Christopher Lynn, of the University of Alabama, said that modern day humans’ relaxing response to fire is evolutionary. In the experiment, 226 adults spent time watching a video of a fire, complete with sound effects. Their blood pressure was taken before and after viewing the fire for various periods of time. Dr Lynn discovered ‘consistent blood pressure decreases’ across the participants and that the longer people watched the fire, the more relaxed they became. He also said that the experience seemed to make participants become more sociable. The study says: ‘Findings confirm that hearth and campfires induce relaxation as part of a multisensory, absorptive and social experience.’ Modern day humans’ relaxing response to fire is evolutionary. One anthropologist claims stone age man likely relaxed around campfires to ‘benefit in the social milieu via fireside interactions,’ meaning that they made friends around the fire and this made them feel safer – perhaps even giving them a survival advantage . A total of 226 adults spent time watching a video of a fire, complete with sound effects. Their blood pressure was taken before and after viewing the fire for various periods of time. It decreased after watching the fire and people became more relaxed, the longer they focused on the flames. Watching the fire also seemed to make people more sociable. He believes this is because stone age man likely relaxed around campfires to ‘benefit in the social milieu via fireside interactions,’ meaning that they made friends around the fire and this made them feel safer – perhaps even giving them a survival advantage. Early humans would have associated the flickering light, crackling sounds, warmth and distinctive smells of campfires with relaxation and friendship. ‘For early humans, fire likely extended the day, provided heat, helped with hunting, warded off predators and insects, illuminated dark places, and facilitated cooking,’ the study explains. ‘Campfires also may have provided social nexus and relaxation effects that could have enhanced prosocial behaviour.’ In an experiment, participants' blood pressure decreased when watching a fire and the longer people watched it, the more relaxed they became. The study also showed that  the experience seemed to make participants become more sociable (illustrated with a stock picture)","Anthropologist from the University of Alabama believes that modern day humans’ relaxing response to fire is evolutionary .

"Surrounded by grinning, bikini-clad girls, Richard Stabler looks as though he is having the time of his life as an expatriate in Dubai. But the high-flying British executive is about to be forced to swap the yacht for a prison cell – after falling foul of the country’s strict Islamic laws. Company director Stabler, 33, has been sentenced to seven months in a Dubai jail and deportation thanks to an alcohol-fuelled argument that saw him streak naked through his apartment block.

Stabler started arguing with his friends, in a row that continued when the group got back to his upmarket beachside apartment on the Palm Jumeirah, the manmade island shaped like a palm tree . The . businessman had polished off eight glasses of rum during a . pre-Christmas knees-up at the five-star Le Meridien Mina Seyahi hotel . when he started to fight with some of his friends. The . row continued when the group got back to his upmarket beachside . apartment on the Palm Jumeirah – a manmade island shaped like a palm . tree – and Stabler stripped off in what a court was later told was a . ‘naked protest’. A security . guard from his building, who gave evidence at Dubai’s Court of . Misdemeanours, said: ‘He was making noise and arguing with the other . security guards when I came. ‘I . called our control room to contact police and then followed him to the . second floor where I found that he had taken off his underwear and stood . there in the brightly lit corridor, completely naked.’ The . guard claimed that Stabler – nicknamed ‘The Stabiliser’  by his friends . – went on to  walk through the apartment’s reception area wearing only . his underwear. When the . guard tried to calm him down, Stabler pushed him to one side and ran up . the stairs, where he proceeded to ‘cause chaos’, according to witnesses. Stabler – who has been running a recruitment agency for four years – was then said to have . tried to hide behind a gate. The 33-year-old British man has been jailed for running naked through the corridors of a building on the Palm Jumeirah (file picture) The tourist was drinking at Le Meridien Mina Sey hotel (pictured) before returning to his accommodation on the Palm Jumeirah .

I can’t remember if I stood naked or not.’ But he denied running through the corridor naked at his court hearing last week. His . lawyer Salha Khalifa said: ‘He was inside his apartment when police . knocked on the door and was wearing white shorts.’ Stabler pleaded . guilty to drinking alcohol without a licence but denied committing an . indecent act in public.

"The break off of Sandy Beach in Oahu is notoriously dangerous and tricky to surf. But an effortlessly cool seal put its fellow surfers to shame, hanging ten with ease on the Hawaiian beach. The marine mammal was caught on camera catching waves and swimming amongst the crowd while it waited for the next swell during a busy day at the beach in August. Captured by New York photographer, David Amann, 52, the agile creature is seen diving beneath the water, allowing the tide to carry it towards the shoreline. Scroll down for video .

Coming through: The marine mammal was pictured enjoying the swell amongst other swimmers in August . Surf's up: Beachgoers stopped to stare as the monk seal caught a wave to the shore . The Hawaiian monk seals only visit the beach a few times a year, and David managed to grab the camera from his bag and snap the seal as it enjoyed the surf. David said: 'This is a very unusual occurrence, seals do visit Sandy Beach a couple of times a year but I have never seen one come in on the breaking side of the beach. 'It certainly does look like it is catching a ride onto the beach, I have never seen this done by a monk seal before but they are experts in the water and I am sure it knows what it is doing. Happy to mingle: The friendly seal waited for the swell with the other surfers . I'll catch the next one: The break off Sandy Beach is known to be difficult, and is preferred by expert surfers . 'The seal did make it to the beach for a relaxing rest on this sunny day. 'As soon as the people realised the seal was approaching the beach, everyone ran in that direction. 'I had my camera handy in my bag, but it was my wife, Elizabeth, that first spotted the seal. 'It is always a treat to get a visit from our ocean living brothers and sister so we were very excited, especially to see the seal catching some waves.' The Hawaiian monk seal is an endangered species of seal native to the Hawaiian islands. There are just over 1,000 remaining. Taking a break: The images were taken by New Yorker David Amann, pictured mimicking the seal sunbathing . Sandy Beach, on the South Shore, is well known for its strong rip tides and shore break very close to the shoreline. The latter is the cause of many swimmer injuries, and has earned it the nickname 'break-neck beach'.

"On Veterans Day, Justus Belfield donned his Army uniform one more time, even though he was too weak to leave his bed at an upstate New York nursing home. The 98-year-old World War II veteran died the next day. The Daily Gazette of Schenectady reports that Belfield had worn his uniform every Veterans Day since he and his wife moved into Baptist Health Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Glenville, outside Albany, several years ago.

He also served during the Korean War when he worked as a recruiter in Syracuse. Belfield told the newspaper last year that he never regretted serving in the military. 'It was a good thing to do,' he said in the interview on Veterans Day last year. 'I loved it because it was my country. It's still my country.' Ailing health prevented Belfield from participating in October's Honor Flight to Washington, D.C., to see the war memorials. Belfield was buried Friday with military honors at Gerald B.H.

"Commentary on social media about films and TV shows can generate millions of pounds in free advertising for the locations featured on screen, new research has found. According to a study by EuroScreen, 'chatter' on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms about the locations seen on the big screen can lead to a tourism boom. Tweeting about London after watching an episode of Sherlock, or sharing a beautiful picture of Malta seen in Game of Thrones has a direct impact on tourism to those destinations, the research claims. Free marketing: 1999 rom-com Notting Hill generated the equivalent of £19.5million in ad spend for London . Likewise, fans tweeting about Harry Potter and its filming locations resulted in a tourism boost for the UK . Richard Curtis' 1999 rom-com Notting Hill, starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, generated the equivalent of £19.5million in online ad spend for London, while Harry Potter generated  £10.4million. Mentions of Game of Thrones led to the equivalent of £1million in advertising for Malta, where the HBO series filmed the Dothraki scenes for season one. Hit series Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, garnered £10.8million worth of advertising spend on social media, while Wallander yielded £17.9m for Ystad in Sweden. Landmarks: Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, garnered £10.8m worth of ad spend . Spectacular scenes: Malta got a tourism boost worth £1m in advertising thanks to Game of Thrones . Almost 35 million comments and interactions on social media relating to four European locations (London, Malta, Ystad in Sweden and Apulia in Italy) were analysed. The new insight into the links between film and television productions and tourism was revealed at an international screen tourism conference today by Film London, the lead partner for major European project EuroScreen. Adrian Wootton, CEO of Film London and British Film Commission, said: 'This research shows that productions don't just sell cinema tickets and box sets, they also sell the places where they're made. Quite simply, this is free advertising, and emphasises the power of screen productions as a tourism driver.'

The research was conducted by social media intelligence agency Human Digital, who processed  comments and interactions across sites including Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Pinterest. Their research examined activity relating to the four European locations along with a range of films and television shows linked to these places. Their analysis found a clear correlation between place and screen, with the resulting 'chatter' - likes, mentions, retweets - equivalent to paid-for advertising ranging from tens of thousands to millions of pounds. It is believed to be the first time such methodology has been applied to the tourist industry. The research was announced at the Seen on Screen: Capitalising on Screen Tourism conference in London.

"Downton Abbey star Lesley Nicol today called for a new campaign against cruel Chinese bear bile farms after the death of a charismatic and inspiration moon bear who became a symbol of the fight. Oliver survived 30 years of captivity on a bile farm but died yesterday after beating overwhelming odds to live out the final years of his life in freedom - and was hailed yesteday as 'the bravest bear'. He won a host of celebrity admirers including Born Free star Virginia McKenna after being rescued with a group of other bears from appallingly cramped cages in a bear farm in Shandong. Lesley Nicol, who plays chef Mrs Patmore in the drama, told MailOnline: 'I feel devastated that amazing Oliver is no longer with us. His horrendous incarceration in a crush cage for 30 years is quite difficult to comprehend. 'How could any living creature cope under those conditions for that long ? So it makes him all the more special.' Oliver confounded expectations when he survived emergency roadside surgery during his dramatic rescue in 2010 to live his remaining four years in a bear sanctuary in Chengdu, western China, run by the British charity Animals Asia. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Downton Abbey star Lesley Nicol was moved to tears by the sight of him shuffling around his enclosure when she visited the Animals Asia sanctuary in Chengdu in Chengdu sanctuary in June . Tearful: Stream of employees who rescued and then cared for Oliver said their goodbyes by holding his paws on Wednesday when he was euthanised because of his worsening condition . Charming bruiser: Oliver beat the odds to survive his terrible ordeal and then enjoy his freedom at a sanctuary run by British charity Animals Asia . Ms Nichol added: 'Thank goodness he finally experienced love, and care and the respect he deserved. And bless the wonderful Animals Asia for fighting to save his life - and then caring for him so magnificently. In his memory we have to strengthen the fight to end this disgusting, inhumane practice and support the Chinese people in doing so.' A charming bruiser who seemed to shrug off the shocking infirmities wrought by years of abuse, Oliver came to epitomise the growing animal rights movement in Asia and starred in a film called Cages of Shame that helped turn public opinion against bear bile farming. Moon bears rarely live beyond 30, however, and Downton Abbey star Lesley Nicol was moved to tears by the sight of him shuffling around his enclosure when she visited the Animals Asia sanctuary in Chengdu in Chengdu sanctuary in June. But on Wednesday, as his condition worsened, vets took the decision to euthanise him and a stream of employees who helped rescue him and then cared for him at the sanctuary in his peaceful last years held his paw to say a tearful final goodbye. Animals Asia founder and CEO Jill Robinson MBE said she was heartbroken at Oliver's death but said he had won the most important battle of his life when he survived his rescue from the Shandong bear farm in 2010. 'Oliver was a broken bear when we found him,' she recalled. 'His body and legs were misshapen by years of being crushed in a cage and we feared he would not survive the 1,500 mile journey home. 'On that day, when Oliver's condition began to deteriorate – panting heavily and refusing to eat – our vets decided that only an emergency operation would save his life. Fight for life: Oliver had to undergo four hours of surgery by the roadside when he was rescued. Oliver's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen . Suffering: More than 10,000 endangered Asiatic black bears – known as moon bears - are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across China and southeast Asian countries. Oliver pictured above in his cage . Harvested: Catheters are jabbed into the bears' abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders. Bear bile sells for around £10-a-millilitre and is used in traditional Chinese medicines to treat a range of illnesses . 'He was an old bear who had suffered more than anyone can imagine but it just didn't seem right that he could be so close to freedom and not make it.' With a local police escort, the trucks carrying Oliver and the other bears rescued from the farm went to a local hospital and borrowed a bottle of oxygen needed for anaesthetic. After four hours of roadside surgery watched by a huge crowd of onlookers, Oliver's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a crude and painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen to fasten the gall bladder to his abdominal wall. Robinson said: 'Oliver brought so many people together that day – from Shandong to Chengdu and across the country – and he's continued to do so ever since. As an old bear who refused to give up, his fight inspired ours. 'His story has continued to be told across the world and has raised increasing awareness of the horrors of bear bile farming. Our broken bear turned teacher and his stoic, gentle nature will continue to inspire the rescue of so many more.' More than 10,000 endangered Asiatic black bears – known as moon bears for the cream-coloured crescents on their chests – are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across China and southeast Asian countries. Crude catheters are jabbed into the bears' abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders. Bear bile sells for around £10-a-millilitre and is used in traditional Chinese medicines to treat a range of illnesses from haemorrhoids and sore throats to hangovers. Campaign: Animals Asia founder Jill Robinson MBE with Lesley during the visit. Other celebrity backers include Olivia Newton-John, Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench . Many bears rescued from the farms are left blind or have had their teeth and claws hacked out by farmers. Many are psychologically scarred by their captivity. In a campaign backed by celebrities including Olivia Newton-John, Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench, Animals Asia is working with the Chinese government to phase out bear bile farming and persuade people to use herbal alternatives. Animals Asia Vet Team Director Nic Field said: 'The entire team is devastated at Oliver's passing. Despite everything he went through, his forgiving and spirited nature touched everyone who met him. 'Oliver's story is so powerful and he has become a focal point of the growing support of our work in China. He represents the suffering of the thousands of bears still languishing on China's bear farms. 'More importantly he has been a symbol of hope. Every visitor to the sanctuary and every supporter around the world knows Oliver's story. His legacy will live on.'","Oliver survived 30 years in captivity on a bile farm in China and beat the odds to live four more years of freedom after being rescued .

"Saeed Ajmal, comfortably the best spinner in the world before he was banned for chucking, could complete a remarkable comeback with a World Cup call-up. Ajmal was cleared by the International Cricket Council on Saturday after remedial work on his suspect bowling action and could now be fast-tracked into the Pakistan squad if they need to replace an injured player. Mohammad Hafeez, himself banned from bowling in the ICC purge on illegal actions, has a foot problem has been ruled out so Pakistan will consider a return for a controversial cricketer who would find himself under the microscope here. Saeed Ajmal, seen here at the Pakistan National Cricket Academy in Lahore, could be called up for the World Cup after the ICC was satisfied he has remodelled his suspect bowling action . Ajmal was banned by the International Cricket Council last year for his illegal bowling action . ‘There are a lot of ifs and buts because he hasn’t played any cricket but let’s see how things go in the next week,’ said Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq. ‘He’s been bowling a lot of deliveries in the nets every day but we haven’t sat down and talked about it yet. Let’s see what he has to do.’ It remains to be seen whether Saeed, at 37, can be as effective with a remodelled action and being under constant scrutiny from umpires who would be allowed to call or report him if they felt he transgressed again. But the possibility of his call-up is intriguing. Without Ajmal and Hafeez they are short of quality spin and there is no doubt that he would strengthen a side looking to repeat their World Cup win in Australia 23 years ago. Ajmal (pictured) could be called up into the Pakistan squad as Mohammad Hafeez is ruled out through injury . Hafeez, seen here in action against New Zealand last week, has been ruled out with a foot injury . ‘The major concern for us and him is his lack of competitive cricket for the last five or six months,’ said Misbah here in Sydney ahead of this week’s World Cup warm-up games. ‘It’s a tough decision.’ For now the familiar figure of Shahid Afridi, better known for his explosive hitting, will have to step up as Pakistan’s main spinner in his fifth World Cup, a challenge he is relishing. ‘For the last few years myself, Saeed and Ajmal have done well as a bowling unit and the pressure will be on me now because the other two are not with me,’ said Afridi, who will face England at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. ‘But I’m enjoying my bowling. I have played a lot of cricket for Pakistan but I have a big responsibility in this tournament as a senior player. This is not the time to give up. This is the time to give something to my country.’","Ajmal could complete a remarkable comeback with World Cup call-up .

"Visiting different heritage sites is good for your happiness and wellbeing, a new study has found. A new report found that visits to heritage sites ranging from historic towns to archaeological remains improve wellbeing to the tune of £1,646 a year for the average visitor. The figure represents the amount of money which provides the same impact on wellbeing as visiting heritage does, and is higher than the value of taking part in sports, which is calculated as being £993, the report from English Heritage said. Heritage Counts 2014 reveals visiting historic towns and cities, like Berwick-Upon-Tweed in Northumberland, has the most positive impact on our wellbeing . The positive effect of visiting heritage sites is found to be the same or more than doing other activities, like viewing art or playing sport. Pictured: Stonehenge . The annual Heritage Counts report illustrates the vital role heritage plays in our national life by measuring its value and impact on individuals and communities. Of those surveyed, 73 per cent of adults and 69 per cent of five to 15-year-olds said they had visited an historic site in 2013. The study looked at eight different types of heritage over the past year and also investigated the monetary value of this positive impact on general wellbeing, estimated at £1,646 per person per year for the average visitor. As one of the key drivers of British tourism, heritage also offers a huge economic benefit to the local areas. In 2011, heritage sites and historical monuments provided 134,000 jobs and an output of over £5 billion. Heritage Counts 2014 examined value of both emotional and economic benefits. Pictured: Hadrian's Wall . Heritage is also one of the key drivers of British tourism. Pictured: Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, England . In 2013, 73 per cent of adults surveyed said they had visited historic sites. Pictured: Dover Castle in Kent . 1. Stonehenge, Wiltshire . 2. 1066 Battle Abbey . 3. Dover Castle, Kent . 4.

Wellington Arch & Apsley House, London . Source: English Heritage, 2011 . English Heritage also looked at how such a positive impact can translate into potential community benefit. Participating in heritage projects helps people to learn about their local history, make connections, form friendships, and develop a sense of civic pride. A survey of residents in areas where heritage projects had been completed found that 92 per cent believed that the site 'raised pride in the local area.' For those who volunteer at the site, the impact is even greater. One in three volunteers describes a notable increase in self-esteem, as well as a stronger sense of belonging in their communities. In need of a pick-me-up? Head to an historic place of worship - like Wells Cathedral in Somerset . 92 per cent of residents in a heritage area believed that the site 'raised local pride.' Pictured: Osborne House . Sir Laurie Magnus, the Chairman of English Heritage, said: 'England's historical environment is a great force for good. It enhances the quality of our surroundings, provides employment, helps underpin our national identity and generally lifts our spirits. 'This year's Heritage Counts provides critical evidence to show the contribution that the historical environment makes towards turning the government's objective of improving the nation's wellbeing into reality.' John Sell, Chair of the Historic Environment Forum, added: 'It is no surprise that heritage significantly contributes to tourism, but it is fascinating to be able to demonstrates that it also improves our well-being.'","Heritage Counts 2014 measured positive effects of taking part in heritage .

"Chilling CCTV footage of the moment a six-year-old girl was led away by the hand to be raped and violently murdered has been released in Thailand. The grainy clip, which echoes that of British toddler James Bulger being walked to his death in 1993, shows the girl, nicknamed 'Nong Cartoon', strolling with a stranger through the lobby of Bearing skytrain station in Bangkok ten days ago. Her disappearance sparked a massive police hunt that ended yesterday with the discovery of her strangled and decomposing body in a deserted area near the city's Suklhumvit Soi 501 motorway in a case that has shaken the nation. Within hours of the grim find, detectives arrested a 32-year-old music roadie, named only as 'Nui', 400 miles away in the northern city of Nong Khai, following a tip-off from a member of public. Scroll down to see CCTV . Nui, who is pictured here leading 'Cartoon' to her death, has apparently confessed to ten other child murders following his arrest for raping and killing her . Tragic: 'Cartoon' (left) vanished from her father's pick-up truck where she had been sleeping while he watched the end of a folk music concert in Thailand's capital on November 6. Hours after her body was found yesterday, a music roadie called Nui (right) was arrested 400 miles away . 'Cartoon' vanished from her father's pick-up truck where she had been sleeping while he watched the end of a folk music concert in Thailand's capital on November 6. Her father, Sayan Petchdon, had taken her to the show, which starred the popular band 'Mai Thai Hui Jai Silp', with seven friends but, when she grew sleepy, he took her to nap in the vehicle outside the venue at around 10.20pm. After staying with her for ten minutes, he returned to watch the end of the concert which finished at 11. When he came back to the truck less than 40 minutes later she was gone. Sayan wept uncontrollably when he was shown the girl's white floral pants which police found near her body, according to reports. A child's skull, believed to be hers, was also found nearby. Hand in hand: Cartoon's disappearance sparked a massive police hunt that ended at the weekend with the discovery of her strangled and decomposing body . Arrested: Within hours off finding her body, detectives arrested a 32-year-old music roadie, named only as 'Nui', in the northern city of Nong Khai following a tip-off from a member of public . Infamous: The grainy clip echoes the one of British toddler James Bulger being led to his death at The New Strand shopping centre in Merseyside in 1993 . 'Nui' had only last August been released from jail after serving three years and eight months for the abduction of a child under 15-years-old. Just as the James Bulger case rocked Britain more than 20 years ago, Nong Cartoon's abduction has left Thailand reeling from this horror story. Bulger, aged 2 years 10 months, was caught on CCTV being led away by 10-year-old Jon Venables from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bottle, Merseyside, on February 12 1993. Venables and Robert Thompson were later tried for his abduction, torture and murder.","'Nong Cartoon' was abducted from father's truck in Bangkok on November 6 .

"David Cameron likened Russia’s actions in Ukraine to those of Nazi Germany yesterday, as he prepared for a tense showdown with Vladimir Putin. The Prime Minister will use talks with the Russian president in Australia today to warn him he faces more sanctions and isolation from the West unless he stops trying to destabilise Ukraine. Speaking at a joint press conference with Australian prime minister Tony Abbott in Canberra yesterday, Mr Cameron drew a direct comparison between Russia’s actions and the Nazi aggression that sparked the Second World War. Prime Minister David Cameron, left, accused Vladimir Putin of acting like Nazi Germany over its aggression in Ukraine in a joint press conference in Canberra with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, right . ‘Russia’s action in Ukraine is unacceptable,’ he said. ‘We have to be clear what we are dealing with. It is a large state bullying a smaller state in Europe. ‘We have seen the consequences in the past and we should learn the lessons.’ Mr Cameron said there was no ‘military solution’ to the Ukraine conflict. But he said Western sanctions were beginning to bite on Russia’s crippled economy – and warned they would be stepped up unless Mr Putin backed down. He added: ‘I would still hope that Russia will see sense and allow Ukraine to develop as a free country. ‘If they do not then the relationship that Britain and the EU have with Russia will be very different. Russia needs to know that this can’t be like what happened in the past with other frozen conflicts where the world moved on. I don’t think the world can move on from what’s happened in Ukraine.’ Mr Cameron, pictured, said he hoped that Russia was prepared to allow Ukraine develop as a 'free country' Vladimir Putin, left, arriving at the G20 conference in Brisbane, where he is under intense diplomatic pressure . His comments echo those made by Prince Charles on his tour of Canada this year. Mr Cameron also mocked Mr Putin for sending warships to Australia where world leaders are at the G20 summit. It has caused consternation in Australia, with the Navy sending three warships of its own to the region in response. But Mr Cameron told reporters: ‘I didn’t feel it necessary to bring a warship myself to keep myself safe at this G20, and I’m sure that Putin won’t be in any danger.’","David Cameron held a joint press conference with Australia's Tony Abbott .

"Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger was on thge receiving end of an offensive tweet from a right-wing loner . A 21-year-old Nazi sympathiser has been jailed for sending a 'grossly offensive' anti-Semitic tweet to Liverpool Labour MP Luciana Berger. Garron Helm send a tweet showing a Holocaust-era yellow star superimposed on the MP's forehead with the hashtag 'Hitler was right'. When police searched Helm's home they found Nazi memorabilia including a flag bearing the SS symbol and material from British extreme right-wing group National Action. Helm referred to himself online as The Noble Wolf and used a Twitter account called Aethelwulf, which translates from Old English as Noble Wolf. But in reality Helm was an immature loner who found friends online in extremist groups. He pleaded guilty to sending an offensive, indecent or obscene message and was sentenced to four weeks in jail – though he is expected to serve half of this. Liverpool Magistrates Court heard that Helm sent the tweet in a state of 'anger and political frustration' in the early hours of August 7. The message showed Miss Berger with the Star of David on her head. The tweet called the MP a 'communist Jewess' and read: 'You can always trust a Jew to show their true colours eventually.' Miss Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree, was described in court as being 'deeply shocked by the entire incident and the link to National Action, which she knows to be an extremist group'. District Judge Andrew Shaw described Helm's actions as calculated and 'extremely abusive and upsetting'. He added that the Nazi paraphernalia found in his house showed his true motivation for sending the tweet. Helm referred to himself on-line as The Noble Wolf and used a Twitter account called Aethelwulf, which translates from Old English as Noble Wolf . Mark Ellis, defending, described Helm, of Merseyside, as a loner with a troubled past. The court heard that Helm was one of 11 children but the family had broken apart after his father died in a work accident and his mother had a mental breakdown, leaving him with no one to turn to except extremist 'friends' online. Helm, who was expelled from college in Southport earlier this year, accepted the message was fundamentally wrong. He also sent a handwritten letter of apology to the MP. As well as the jail sentence, Helm was ordered to pay an £80 victim surcharge to Miss Berger after the judge upgraded the offence to one considered racially motivated.","Loner Garron Helm, 21, sent tweet to Jewish politician Luciana Berger .

"Urgent reforms are being demanded to stop thousands of cancer patients losing access to vital medicines. UK drug companies claim in an open letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that the country faces going back to ‘clear rationing’ within weeks. The UK still lags behind Germany, France and Italy in prescribing potentially lifesaving medicines to cancer patients and the situation will get worse, it is claimed. New plans are set to axe up to 25 drugs deemed too expensive for the NHS by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which was originally set up to improve access to vital medicines in England. They include all six breast cancer drugs that have been prescribed for thousands of women in the last three years. UK drug companies have written to health secretary Jeremy Hunt warning the country faces going back to 'clear rationing' of cancer drugs within weeks if drastic reforms are not made . Campaigners fear a change to the rules that take cost into account for the first time will lead to them being taken off the approved list in a controversial two day ‘re-evaluation’ process next month. Other drugs that may not survive the financial cull include Jevtana, used in prostate cancer, six drugs for bowel cancer, including Avastin, and Abraxane for pancreatic cancer. The £200million a year Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) which began in April 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in England getting drugs banned on the NHS by Nice, the rationing body. The Government's aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. It was a temporary stopgap until 2016 and NHS England, which took over its administration a year ago, now proposes to re-evaluate a host of drugs on the basis of cost for the first time. The plan has sparked protest from top cancer charities and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) which has sent an open letter to Mr Hunt. It says the blame lies with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), which must be reformed and look at cancer medicines with ‘greater flexibility’. The letter says NHS England’s plans ‘threaten to take the UK back to a time of clear rationing of cancer medicines’. Instead Nice should adapt its end of life criteria in considering whether the NHS can afford ‘life extending medicines to be available to those patients confronting the most difficult battle of all – the battle for life’ says the letter signed by ABPI chief executive Stephen Whitehead. New plans are set to axe up to 25 drugs, including Avastin used to treat bowel cancer, deemed too expensive for the NHS by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which was originally set up to improve access to vital medicines . In response to calls for drug companies to cut their prices beyond discounts already given to the NHS, Mr Whitehead says the industry does not ask for ‘unfair returns and in the UK profits are capped’. The National CDF panel will meet on December 15 and 16 to decide which drugs should be removed because they offer ‘insufficient value for money’, with its decisions announced ‘early in the New Year'. Some of the 25 drugs are being re-evaluated for different cancers so a total of 42 treatments will be considered in total. It is thought one in six patients being treated through the fund has advanced breast cancer, who can access drugs rejected by Nice. Although existing patients would continue to be treated, new patients would have to make exceptional appeals to get drugs that are currently approved. Caitlin Palframan, senior policy manager at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said the charity was deeply concerned that several very effective breast cancer drugs could be axed due to their high price. She said: ‘The Fund is the only way women in England can routinely access these drugs that can offer them months, or even years, of additional good quality life. Caitlin Palframan, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said the charity is deeply concerned about the implications for an estimated 16,000 breast cancer patients getting help from the Cancer Drugs Fund each year. Picture shows breast cancer cells under the microscope . ‘The Cancer Drugs Fund was only ever intended to be a temporary solution, acting as a safety net for patients, but we are now facing a situation in which it may fail to perform that function for some people and more and more life-extending drugs could be snatched away from those that need them.’ It is estimated that ending the Cancer Drugs Fund will deny more than 16,000 patients annually from getting potentially life extending drugs. The budget for the fund has been overspent by £30million since NHS England took over its running in April last year. The bill was met from underspends in other parts of its budget. Owen Sharp, Chief Executive of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘Whilst we welcome the clarity provided by these proposed reforms, the huge deficit that has brought the Cancer Drugs Fund to the brink is the result of a failed drug appraisal system that continues to deny thousands of cancer patients access to effective drugs that they clearly need. ‘A long-term solution is urgently needed that delivers an overhaul of the way new cancer drugs are appraised.’","25 drugs, deemed too expensive for the NHS but available through the Cancer Drugs Fund, could be axed under new plans .

"A Fijian man has been arrested over the death of an Australian woman whose body was found on the side of a road in Fiji this week. The badly beaten and decomposed body of Tracey Ann O'Brien Maw was found in bushes by a passing farmer on Tuesday evening near the village of Vunavutu on Fiji's Vita Levu Island. Police spokeswoman Ana Naisoro confirmed on Friday that a local man has been taken into custody in relation to Maw's death. 'At this moment we cannot reveal the identity of the person because we have not charged him yet. But I can say that we have a strong lead,' Ms Naisoro told the Australian Federal Police. Ms Maw, from Shepparton in Victoria's north-east, had been bashed to death in an 'alleged murder' according to Nine News. Scroll down for video . Tracey Ann O'Brien Maw, from Shepparton in Victoria's north-east, was found dead on Tuesday . A police spokesperson from Sigatoka in the south-west of Fiji's Vita Levu Island, where Ms Maw was found, told Daily Mail Australia that she had to be identified by her tattoos after the severe bashing. 'She was formally identified by the brother, and some of the tattoo marks that were on her leg, as the woman who was missing,' the spokesman said. Nine News reported that her brother, Rodney Maw, had travelled to Fiji to look for his sister who is understood to have been missing for some time. The spokesperson said that she was found in the area 'where she was staying with her boyfriend', a local Fijian man. Ms Maw is believed to have been in the country in an attempt to re-establish a relationship with the man. Police Commissioner Ben Groenewald said Maw had gone to Vunavutu village with a friend. Her body has already been cremated 'due to the extreme stage of putrefaction of the victim's body,' BJJ Groenewald said. Her body, which had been brutally bashed, was found in some bushes by a passing Fijian farmer . However some of Ms Maw's relatives are concerned the speed of the cremation will have failed to allow a precise investigation into how she was killed.

"Drug dealers operating a pizza delivery style heroin and crack cocaine network have been jailed for almost 100 years. The 33 dealers were operating in Birmingham when they were arrested following a major operation by West Midlands Police in February. Officers arranged a series of dawn raids across the north of the city and broke up the major drugs network. Scroll down for video . West Midlands police released a rogues' gallery of the drug dealers who appeared in court during the week . More than 100 officers conducted a series of dawn raids over four days, arresting dozens of suspects. They recovered class A and Class B drugs worth more than £20,000 along with almost £35,000 in cash and a firearm. A total of 33 drug dealers appeared in Birmingham Crown Court during the week where they were received jail terms ranging from nine years and six months down to a suspended sentence. The operation targeted street-level dealers as well as those further up the criminal hierarchy. The court heard that crack cocaine and heroin was delivered door-to-door 'like a pizza delivery service'. Police gathered intelligence on the gang by monitoring phone numbers associated with the suspects. At Birmingham Crown Court last week 28 men and one woman were jailed for a total of 98 years and four men handed suspended sentences for supplying drugs.

"Twelve years ago, Jason Padgett was a college drop-out working at his dad's furniture store when a mugging at a Tacoma, Washington karaoke bar changed his life forever. Back then, the 31-year-old sported a mullet, drove a red Camaro and was the 'life of the party'. But after suffering a profound brain injury, Padgett started to see the world in a whole new light - literally - and became obsessed with math and physics. He has since been diagnosed as one of only 40 with acquired savant syndrome, in which once-normal people become skilled in math, art or music after a brain injury. Then and now: Jason Padgett was the 'life of the party' before an attack at a karaoke bar in September 2002 turned him into a math genius (pictured in 1988 on the left, and more recently on the right) Life in technicolor: After being knocked unconscious at a local bar, Padgett woke up the next morning to find he noticed life in more detail than before. Now he draws what he sees and sells his pictures as art . Padgett writes about the life-altering experience in his new memoir out Tuesday, 'Struck by Genius: How a Brain Injury Made Me a Mathematical Marvel'. It all started the night of September 13, 2002 when Padgett went out to a karaoke bar near his home and was mugged. A beautiful mind: Padgett writes about the life-altering experience of becoming a savant in his memoir 'Struck by Genius', which hits book stores Tuesday . Two men attacked him from behind and punched him in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, he was treated for a bruised kidney but released the same night. The next morning, Padgett woke up and found that his vision had changed to include details he never noticed before. He started the tap in his bathroom and noticed 'lines emanating  out perpendicularly from the flow.' 'At first, I was startled and worried for myself, but it was so beautiful that I just stood in my slippers and stared,' Padgett told the New York Post. Padgett stopped going to work and spent all of his time studying math and physics, focusing on fractals, which are repeated geometric patterns. Even though he showed no talent for art before, he started drawing fractals in extreme detail - sometimes taking weeks to finish the work. But there was also a downside to his new talents. While he was once outgoing, Padgett turned introverted and started to spend all of his time at home, covering up his windows with blankets and refusing visitors. He became obsessed with germs and would wash his hands until they were red, and wouldn't even hug his own daughter until she washed her hands as well. Padgett thought he was going crazy, but hope came after watching a BBC documentary on Daniel Tammet, an autistic savant. 'That’s it! That’s what’s going on with me. Oh, my God! Someone else can see what I see!' Padgett remembers thinking. After watching the film he decided to reach out to Dr Darold Treffert, the leading expert on savantism, who diagnosed him with 'acquired savant syndrome'. Back to school: Padgett re-enrolled in college after the brain injury. Pictured above with his wife . There are currently just 40 people in the world who have been diagnosed with the syndrome, becoming seemingly smarter after a brain injury. Padgett began to understand his situation more when he traveled to Finland to be studied by Dr Berit Brogaard. Dr Brogaard used fMRI machines to survey Padgett's brain and found that the left side was more activated, especially in the left parietal love where 'math lives'. It seems that after the injury, neurotransmitters flooded the left side of Padgett's brain and ultimately changed the structure making him hyper-specialized. After his diagnosis, Padgett decided to apply his new-found mental capacity by enrolling in community college. Now 43, Padgett believes he is an example that everyone has untapped genius potential.. 'I believe I am living proof that these powers lie dormant in all of us,' Padgett writes in his memoir. 'If it could happen to me, it could happen to anyone.'","After suffering a brain injury in 2002, Jason Padgett became obsessed with math and physics .

"A tone-deaf teenager who suffered a concussion has astonished his family by suddenly being able to play music effortlessly. Lachlan Connors, a high school junior from Denver, Colorado, now plays 13 instruments - even though he has never learned to read music. But he didn't always have such a talent; as a younger student he loved sport, dreamed on a career playing lacrosse - and had no passion for music. 'He really had no talent,' his mother . Elsie Hamilton told CBS Denver. 'I would say, ""Can't you hear what's next?"" with . something like ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" or ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little . Star"" and he’d say ""No"".' Scroll down for video . Bizarre: Teenager Lachlan Connors suffered a concussion and could suddenly play music effortlessly . When he was in the sixth grade, he was playing lacrosse with his local team when he fell backwards and smacked the back of his head against the ground, suffering a concussion. 'I remember getting up and feeling . really dazed,' he told CBS. 'I didn't really understand something bad had happened.' The doctors told him he could return to the field, but he went on to suffer another couple of hard hits to the head, which sent him to hospital and caused him to suffer epileptic seizures. As his condition worsened, he started to hallucinate and doctors told him he should not play contact sports anymore - but there was one bizarre good side effect: his new-found musical talent. In hospital: He remained in hospital for weeks after taking knocks to the head during sports games . Lachlan could be one of a handful of people around the world who have suffered a brain injury or head trauma and later woke up with amazing musical, artistic or mathematical abilities, known as acquired savant syndrome. While research into the cause is ongoing, there is no single theory explaining all savants. Many researchers believe the underlying cause of savant syndrome occurs when the right brain compensates for an injury on the left brain. It is extremely rare for a savant to lose their skills after they have acquired them. He said he can now play as many as 13 instruments, including piano, guitar, mandolin, ukelele, harmonica, karimba and bagpipes - both Scottish and Irish ones. 'Music is the thing that gets me up in the morning,' he said. His mother called his playing 'absolutely beautiful'. His doctor, Dr. Spyridon Papadopoulos, said the theory is that the concussions switched on part of Lachlan's brain that had previously been dormant. 'The thought is just a theory - that this was a talent laying latent in his brain and somehow was uncovered by his brain rewiring after the injury,' he said. 'Clearly something happened in his . brain and his brain had to recover from injury and change happened. And . change may have uncovered this ability no one knew he had.' Talent: Before the accidents, he never understood music but now he plays 13 instruments with ease . Multi-talented: He shows the CBS reporter how to play the accordion, just one of his many instruments . Collection: He can also play the karimba, an African instrument which is known as the thumb piano . Theory: Doctors said that the bumps to the head may have rewired his brain, unleashing the talent . Lachlan no longer suffers seizures but told CBS that he found it comforting to know composer Frédéric Chopin had suffered from exactly the same type. The condition of suddenly developing a talent - musical, artistic or mathematical - is called acquired savant syndrome and is believed to occur when the right brain compensates for an injury on the left brain. Last year, another Denver man, Derek Amato, said that following a concussion after divig into a shallow pool, he could play eight instruments even though he'd never had a lesson in his life.","Lachlan Connors, from Denver, Colorado, never understood music until he suffered a concussion during a game in the 6th grade .

"Footage has surfaced purporting to show a big cat wandering through a Paris carpark as French authorities continue their hunt for an elusive 'large feline' prowling the outskirts of the capital. The hunt for the 'escaped tiger' has been downgraded to 'large cat' search as police admit they do not know exactly what they're looking for, although they have ruled out the possibility it is a tiger. But security camera footage has now surfaced showing what almost certainly is a large cat wandering past a supermarket in Montevrain, near Paris. Scroll down for video . The video footage shows the cat stalking through a carpark in Montevrain, on the outskirts of Paris . The grainy CCTV footage shows it first emerging from underneath a parked car to the right . It then wanders at a leisurely pace past more vehicles in direct line of sight of the camera . The cat disappears from view only seconds later, but the footage appears to confirm police claims the cat is not a large tiger as was first feared . Tests on footprints carried out by France's National Wildlife and Hunting Board have 'ruled out the presence of a tiger'. But a statement issued by the local prefecture said a 'feline' was still being looked for, and it was likely to be a 'large one', said a spokesman. 'After an investigation carried out by the National Hunting and Wildlife Office in conjunction with the Parc des Felins (a nearby wildlife park),' the statement read, 'we can exclude the presence of an animal from the tiger species. The feline... is still being hunted.' Yesterday heavily armed police stood guard at schools in a Paris suburb as the hunt for an escaped tiger resumed at daybreak. Worried parents ushered their children through school gates across Seine-et-Marne, to the east of the capital, 24 hours after the beast was spotted prowling the built-up area five miles from Disneyland Paris. It remains unclear where the animal escaped from but fears are growing that, the longer is remains on the loose, the hungrier and more aggressive it will become. Downgraded: The hunt for an 'escaped tiger' around Paris has been downgraded to a 'large cat' search, as French police admit they now don't know what animal they are looking for . Ruled out: Tests on footprints carried out by France's National Wildlife and Hunting Board have 'ruled out the presence of a tiger' Still hunting: French gendarmes take part in the ongoing search for what was first described as a tiger on the loose, in the woods of Ferrieres-en-Brie, on the outskirts of Paris . What is it, then? The beast was first spotted near the village of Montevrain, where this grainy picture of a cat-like animal was taken . Specially-trained sharpshooters shifted their focus to an area around a Total petrol station on the A4 motoway towards Paris after a resident spotted a 'large animal' in the vicinity at around 6.45am leading trackers to find paw prints in the mud. It would suggest that the animal is very mobile, and in fact heading in the direction of the French capital. The latest sighting has ramped up the urgency of the hunt amid concerns it could be heading towards an area of dense woodland to the south of the busy commuter highway near Jossigny where it would become far more difficult to locate. Worried: Parents usher their children through school gates in Montevrain, to the east of the capital, 24 hours after the beast was spotted prowling the built-up area five miles from Disneyland Paris . Fears: It remains unclear where the animal escaped from but fears are growing that, the longer is remains on the loose, the hungrier and more aggressive it will become . Paris-bound? The animal appears to be very mobile, and may be heading in the direction of the French capital . 'All precautions are being taken to make sure everybody is safe,' said a local council spokesman. 'Police patrols are being placed around local schools, and people are being encouraged to stay at home with their doors and windows locked. 'The fear is that the animal will be looking for food, and will grow more aggressive and adventurous.' After staring directly into the camera, the cat calmly turns away and wanders off into nearby farmland . Elite marksmen armed with tranquilizers supported by a helicopter with thermal imagery have been scouring the area since residents said they saw the animal in France's Seine-et-Marne department, to the east of the capital. 'The alleged tiger is being tracked, but we are trying to intercept it,' a local police spokesman said. He added that special officers trained in using tranquilizers were involved, and that the aim was to capture the beast alive. One wildlife expert said: 'We're going to try and sedate it, but if it becomes dangerous or aggressive, we'll give the order to kill it.'

Search: Members of the police animal brigade check an area surrounding the supermarket carpark where the animal was spotted . The local council has urged residents in the area to stay indoors while they search for the 'giant cat' Meanwhile a local council spokesman in Montevrain said: 'We urge caution and please do not walk around the area behind the tennis courts and football pitches, which have been cordoned off since this morning. 'We will keep you updated of all events. We repeat - do not walk around, and take your car instead'. It was first spotted near the village of Montevrain, where a grainy picture of a cat-like animal was taken. Police say the aim of the search operation is to capture the tiger alive, with officers used in the hunt specialised in using tranquillizers . Hunt: Police marksmen supported by a helicopter were scrambled after residents said they saw the animal in France's Seine-et-Marne department, to the east of the capital . Members of the police animal brigade walk through the streets of Montevrain looking for the cat . Jean-Baptiste Berdeaux, who manages the Intermarche supermarket told reporters: 'My wife saw it this morning. She didn't get out of the car and called me to say 'I think I saw a lynx'.' There was a circus in the village earlier this month, but all its animals, including tigers, are now accounted for. 'There is no question of a tiger having escaped from this circus, which was very well regulated,' said a town council spokesman. Threat: French authorities told residents to remain indoors as emergency services search for the cat in an area approximately five miles from the popular Disneyland Paris theme park (pictured) A spokesman for EuroDisney said the animal was nothing to do with them, as they do not keep live tigers. Others have pointed out the Parc des Félins big cat park in Lumigny Nesle-Ormeaux – 18 miles away from Montévrain – as a more likely source. The tiger is the largest species of cat and – beyond zoos and circuses – there are no known communities in Europe.","Footage released purporting to show big cat stalking supermarket carpark .

"A woman has discovered a new-found talent as an artist after hitting her head falling down the stairs - despite having no artistic flair before. Pip Taylor, 49, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, always enjoyed art at school, but was advised against it as a profession because teachers said she didn’t have the ability. But after suffering a serious concussion from falling down a flight of stairs, she has now suddenly gained the ability to draw beautiful works of art. Before and after: Pippa Taylor struggled to draw even simple images before the accident (left), but is now being commissioned to produce portraits and drawings (right) Miss Taylor discovered a new-found artistic ability after hitting her head when she fell down some stairs . She now draws up to four pictures a day and, after seeing her work, strangers have even commissioned her to produce pieces for them. Miss Taylor said: 'It is just extraordinary and quite strange really. I have always loved drawing and had hopes of becoming an artist as a teenager but I was never any good. 'I used to draw cartoons and the only thing I could really manage was Snoopy. 'I studied art at school and wanted to take it as an O Level, but my teacher advised me not to as I really wasn’t very good. 'I dug out my old notepad from when I was 16 and cringed at my attempts of drawing people and faces. They were just terrible.' Miss Taylor can now copy almost any image and specialises in portaits, such as this one of actor Idris Elba . While she struggles to produce pictures from her imagination, she can copy any image almost perfectly . She noticed the new talent when she picked up a pencil to do a doodle while recovering from her head injuries . Miss Taylor suffered serious bruising to her brain after she tripped and fell down a flight of steps as she visited the racecourse in Chester with a friend in May 2012. She said: 'I fell at the top of a flight of stone steps and hit the right-hand side of my head. 'I was rushed to hospital by ambulance and came to a couple of hours later, unsure of where I was.' Miss Taylor is now compelled to draw every day and worries if she doesn’t draw she will lose her new talent over night- as quickly as she discovered it. She added: 'I have always loved being artistic- even though it didn’t come naturally to me. 'When I was recovering and resting at home I decided to pick up a pencil and start sketching. 'I started doodling but something felt different. It was more natural and I was amazed at the images I could draw. 'It is a talent I developed over night. My sister jokes that she wants a bang on the head so she can wake up with a talent.' Miss Taylor was left with bad bruising and suffered concussion and she was told it would take her six months to recover. Since her fall, Miss Taylor has developed a skill for animal portraits, and can produced detailed sketches of dogs and pets . Miss Taylor suffered serious bruising to her brain after she tripped and fell down a flight of steps at Chester racecourse . Her biggest fear is that she will suddenly lose her new talent as quickly as she discovered it . She said: 'I found myself sat at home recovering and I was bored. I hadn’t drawn for years but I bought a 2b pencil and a sketch pad and tried drawing. 'It felt really natural in a way it hadn’t before and I saw things in a different light. I began to realise I had a real skill in being able to copy things accurately.' Miss Taylor’s brain doesn’t allow her to create her own images in her imagination, but she can copy objects, people and photographs perfectly. She said: 'Although I’d been told there was no lasting damage, to me something had changed. 'In my mind, I’m simply copying the images and my drawings are identical to the originals. Miss Taylor is one a handful of people around the world who have suffered a brain injury or head trauma and later woke up with amazing musical, artistic or mathematical abilities, known as Acquired Savant Syndrome. While research into the cause is ongoing, there is no single theory explaining all savants. Many researchers believe the underlying cause occurs when one side of the brain compensates for an injury to the other. US psychiatrist Darold Treffert thinks certain injuries cause the brain to 'rewire' itself, unlocking new abilities. In a study into the condition, he said: 'What happens is that there is injury, then there is the recruitment of other still-intact tissue. 'There is rewiring [of brain signals] through that intact tissue, and then there is the release of dormant potential within that brain area.' Other cases include Lachlan Connors (pictured), a teenager from Denver, Colorado in the US, who became a musical genius after hitting his head playing lacrosse. Despite being tone deaf before the accident and being unable to read music, he later taught himself how to play 13 different instruments. Another American youngster, 10-year-old Orlando Serrell found he could perfectly remember each day's weather after being hit on the head with a baseball. And Derek Amato, also from the US, became a master pianist at the age of 40 after injuring himself diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool. Despite Miss Taylor's fears she'll lose her new talent, doctors say it is extremely rare for a savant to lose their skills after they have acquired them. Miss Taylor mainly draws animals and pet portraits and her favourite part to draw are the eyes. She . added: 'I get such a pleasure from my art. My brain injury changed my . life and I am just so glad that I have this positive talent from it. 'I don’t want to over-analyse how this has happened and I am terrified of losing my skill and I am living my dream. 'I draw as much as I can and I am truly grateful for this side effect of my brain injury.' Luke Griggs, spokesman for brain injury association Headway, said: 'Our brains are capable of incredible things and while today we know so much more than we used to, there is still much to learn about the brain. 'The effects of brain injury can be devastating, but we know that with the right help, at the right time, there can be life after brain injury. 'At Headway, we encourage people to try arts and crafts, gardening, music and other activities that they may not have tried before their brain injuries. 'Activities like these can have multiple benefits including increasing confidence and improving hand-to-eye co-ordination. 'While different parts of our brain are responsible for different things, all parts of the brain are interconnected. 'Inhibition in one part of the brain following injury can lead to increased activity in other parts of the brain, which can sometimes result in surprising and unexpected effects. 'It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons behind Pip's fabulous new-found artistic ability but we are delighted she is enjoying her new hobby.'","Pip Taylor, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, was poor at art at school .

"More than 260 firefighters are in the Blue Mountains battling an uncontained blaze which has burnt at least 90 hectares so far. An emergency warning has been issued to residents in Warrimoo and Valley Heights, west of Sydney, as fire crews try to control the blaze on the ground and in the air. Although a NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman previously told Daily Mail Australia the fire is burning in unreachable bushland and doesn't pose a threat to residential areas, locals have been warned to seek immediate shelter after a change in wind direction caused it to flare up. The fire, which appeared to be heading towards Baden Place in Blaxland, flared up on Friday night after a southerly change moved through - putting more homes and residents at risk. As of 10.40pm on Friday night conditions have eased at Warrimoo and Valley Heights but emergency warnings remain in place, according to a tweet from NSW RFS Service. Fire crew urge residents to remain alert for smoke and burning embers as they hope to undertake backburning overnight if conditions permit. Scroll down for video . About 200 firefighters are in the Blue Mountains battling an uncontained blaze which has burnt about 90 hectares so far . A NSW Rural Fire Service spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the fire is burning in inaccessible bushland . Firefighters in the Blue Mountains are expected to continue fighting the uncontained blaze into the night . The NSW RFS spokesman said the fire is moving in a south-easterly direction and no properties have been damaged . Across NSW, there are 53 bush and grass fires - 11 of which are uncontained . 'The advice is to seek immediate shelter,' a spokesman for NSW Rural Fire Rescue said. 'We are not advising people to leave. Firefighters will be working through the night doing what they can to protect property.' Although the cause of the fire is unknown, soaring temperatures are believed to have triggered bushfires to break out in the Blue Mountains area. Due to the blaze, one school was in lockdown and another has been evacuated. Warrimoo, east of Katoomba, is under threat from the fast-moving blaze which is sweeping through the district. The NSW RFS spokesman told Daily Mail Australia about about 5.30pm on Friday the fire is moving in a south-easterly direction and no properties have been damaged. 'The fire is in inaccessible bushland so it's not directly impacting residential areas at this time,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're unsure of the cause but at the moment we're focused on containing the fire.' Fire crew were alerted of the blaze at about 1.20pm on Friday and expect to continue fighting it throughout the night. 'Although conditions may ease up tomorrow with the forecast, we still have a lot to do,' the spokesman said.

"The juice from uncooked chicken gives the germs responsible for food poisoning the perfect environment in which to multiply, scientists say. Research by the Institute of Food Research showed that the persistence of campylobacter - a group of bacteria that commonly cause food poisoning - is boosted by 'chicken juice'. Organic matter exuding from chicken carcasses provides the bacteria with the perfect environment to flourish in the food chain. The findings, the researchers said, highlight the importance of cleaning surfaces during food preparation. New research has found the juices from a defrosted chicken give the germs responsible for food poisoning the perfect environment in which to multiply . And they hope it will pave the way for new, more effective ways of cleaning that can reduce the incidence of campylobacter. The researchers collected the liquids produced from defrosting chickens. They found it helped campylobacter attach to surfaces and subsequently form biofilms. Biofilms are specialised structures some bacteria form on surfaces, which protect them from threats to their environment. Helen Brown, who led the study, said: 'We have discovered that this increase in biofilm formation was due to chicken juice coating the surfaces we used with a protein-rich film. 'This film then makes it much easier for the campylobacter bacteria to attach to the surface, and it provides them with an additional rich food source.' Campylobacter are not a particularly hardy species of bacteria, prompting researchers to understand exactly how they manage to survive outside of their usual habitat, the intestinal tract of poultry. They are sensitive to oxygen, but during biofilm formation the bacteria protect themselves with a layer of slime. This also makes them more resistant to antimicrobials and disinfection treatments. Campylobacter, pictured under the microscope, is the group of bacteria commonly associated with causing food poisoning. They are not very hardy and are usually found in the intestinal tract of poultry . Understanding this and how campylobacter persists in the food production process will help efforts to reduce the high percentage of chickens that reach consumers contaminated with the bacteria. Although thorough cooking kills off the bacteria, around 500,000 people suffer from campylobacter food poisoning each year in the UK. Reducing this number, and the amount of infected chicken on supermarket shelves, is now the number one priority of the Food Standards Agency. Ms Brown, said: 'This study highlights the importance of thorough cleaning of food preparation surfaces to limit the potential of bacteria to form biofilms.' The study was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.","Juice from defrosted chickens gives germs the perfect environment in which to multiply, new study has found .

"Conde Nast has agreed to pay out $5.8million to its former interns who claimed they were underpaid while working for the publisher's magazines. The class-action suit, which was filed in June 2013 in New York, alleged that the media company paid its interns as little as $1 per hour. Approximately 7,500 former interns who worked at the company as early as 2007 will now be paid anywhere from $700 to $1,900 for their work, according to Reuters. Going to the bank! The two lead plaintiffs in the case, Lauren Ballinger (left) and Matt Leib (right) brought about the class-action lawsuit, saying the company paid their interns as little as $1 per day . Conde Nast, which publishes high-end magazines like Vogue, GQ, Glamour and Vanity Fair, has since canceled its formerly prestigious internship program. As of now, the company has not announced plans to re-institute it. The two lead plaintiffs in the case were Lauren Ballinger, who worked at W magazine in 2009, and Matthew Leib, who interned at The New Yorker in 2009 and 2010. Ms Ballinger, who assisted in the fashion closet at the women's magazine, told the New York Times that she worked 10 to 14 hours per day during her internship and usually made $12 per day. She likened her job to Anne Hathaway's role in The Devil Wears Prada - but worse 'because we don't get any makeover in the end.' Mr Leib worked three days a week, from 10 am until 5:30 pm, at The New Yorker, where he helped review submissions, edit articles and maintain the cartoon database. He was paid $300 to $500 for each summer he was working. One of the interns' attorneys, Rachel Bien, called the settlement 'favorable.' Site of the payout! A view of Conde Nast's reception area in their new offices at the resurrected World Trade Center . Shining! Conde Nast was one of the first companies that decided to move their business to the World Trade Center, which just opened its doors for the first time last week . After the settlement was agreed upon, Conde Nast Chief Executive Officer Chuck Townsend sent out an internal email to notify employees of the news. 'You may be hearing today about settlement papers that were filed in the lawsuit brought by two former interns (Ballinger v. Advance Magazine Publishers, Inc.),' he wrote. 'While we continue to believe the internships that were offered at Conde Nast provided experiences that were among the best in the media business, we determined that settling the lawsuit is the right business decision for Conde Nast, as it allows us to focus our time and resources on developing meaningful, new opportunities to support future up-and-coming talent.' The settlement comes after a string of similar suits alleging underpayment of interns. Two days before the class-action lawsuit against Conde Nast was filed, a judge in New York ruled that Fox Searchlight Pictures violated labor laws when it didn't pay its interns on the set of Black Swan in 2009 and 2010. Not even a month later, Charlie Rose's production company paid back wages to almost 200 former interns who weren't paid for their work. The interns received checks for roughly $110 for every week they worked (up to ten weeks), said Reuters.","Around 7,500 former interns will be paid $700 to $1,900 from the settlement .

"The man suspected of abducting University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and abduction in connection with an unrelated case. Jesse Matthew, 32, made his first in-person court appearance in Fairfax County, Virginia, on Friday morning following the alleged attack on a 26-year-old woman in September 2005. The victim had  been walking home from a grocery store when she was reportedly dragged into a wooden area and sexually assaulted. Her attacker ran away after being startled by a passerby. Donning a green jail jumpsuit and with his dreadlocks tied back, Matthew bowed his head as he entered a not guilty plea in the nine-year-old case. The judge set a trial date for March 9, 2015. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Denial: Jesse Matthew, 32, is accused of abducting University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. Above, the suspect is seen during his court appearance in Fairfax County on Friday in relation to an unconnected case . In court: Matthew, from Virginia, was arrested and charged two months ago with abducting Miss Graham . Case: Miss Graham (left), went missing in Charlottesville after leaving a bar at around 2am on September 13. Prosecutors claim the sophomore was unaware that Matthew (right, in his mugshot) was following her . Matthew, from Virginia, was arrested and charged two months ago with abducting 18-year-old Miss Graham, who went missing in Charlottesville after leaving a bar at around 2am on September 13. The remains of the sophomore, who prosecutors say was unaware that Matthew was following her,  were found near the city in mid-October following a month-long search, according to NBC 4. Authorities claim DNA evidence links Matthew to the 2005 assault in Fairfax, as well as the 2009 disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington. Following Friday's 10-minute hearing, Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Ray Morrogh said the victim in the 2005 attack now lives in India, but will come back to the U.S. to testify at Matthew's trial. 'It's fair to say she looks forward to a final resolution,' Mr Morrogh said. 'I am grateful to her for her continued cooperation.' Circuit Court Judge David Schell will preside over the trial. As news of Miss Graham's disappearance hit the headlines earlier this year, reports emerged that the suspect had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. Entering a plea: Matthew made his first in-person court appearance on Friday morning following his alleged attack on a 26-year-old woman in September 2005. Above, the defendant glances at in-court photographers . Speaking with an attorney: The victim had been walking home from a grocery store when she was reportedly dragged into woodland and sexually assaulted. Her attacker ran away after being startled by a passerby . Entering the courtroom: Donning a green jailhouse outfit and with his dreadlocks tied back, Matthew stood up as he entered a not guilty plea in the nine-year-old case. The judge set a trial date for March 9, 2015 . He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus. The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped. His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported. Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University, where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003. Tragic losses: Authorities claim Matthew is linked to both the abduction of Miss Graham (left) as well as the disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington (right) in October 2009 . Discovery: Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave in this abandoned property in mid-October . Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved. Last month, Matthew made his first court appearance in the 2005 case via videolink in Charlottesville. Earlier this week, he was transferred to Fairfax Jail ahead of his in-person appearance. He will now be returned to Charlottesville for a preliminary hearing on December 5 in relation to the alleged abduction of Miss Graham with the intent to defile. He is not yet facing murder charges. On Friday, Albemarle County Sheriff Chip Harding said Miss Graham's death could have been avoided if Virginia would collect DNA for misdemeanor convictions as well as felonies. Search: These railroad tracks in downtown Charlottesville were part of the search area for Miss Graham . Video appearance: At the end of last month, Matthew (right) appeared in court via videolink in the 2005 case . Mr Harding said that had authorities collected DNA from Matthew following a 2010 misdemeanor trespassing conviction, it would have generated a hit that would have linked him to the Fairfax case and the Harrington case years before Graham was killed. On Friday, Mr Morrogh said he agreed about the benefits of expanding DNA collection, describing DNA as 'no different than a fingerprint' and saying: 'We're talking about saving lives here. Lat month, Matthew's attorney, James Camblos, said he had reason to question his client's sanity and requested a psychiatric evaluation. A judge is yet to reject or permit his request. The sexual assault and abduction cases are ongoing.","Jesse Matthew made first in-person court appearance on Friday morning .

"Same-sex couples seeking the right to marry are asking the Supreme Court to settle the issue of gay marriage nationwide. Appeals filed Friday urge the justices to review last week's lower court ruling that upheld laws aligned against gay marriage in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. The first petition – called a writ of certiorari – came in response to Ohio rulings that upheld statewide bans on recognizing out-of-state gay marriages, and also denied an out-ofstate adoption ruling issued in favor of a same-sex couple. The Supreme Court receives about 10,000 such writs every year and only a tiny fraction are acknowledged or acted on. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE SUPREME COURT PETITION . Supporters of same-sex marriage have gained legal traction in recent years and now hope a Supreme Court ruling will bring about a final decision on the thorny question of whether gays and lesbians can expect to have marriages legally recognized alongside those of traditional opposite-sex couples . Religious groups oppose gay marriage and hold an annual march in Washington – this year on June 19 – to show their political clout; they believe marriage between one man and one woman is critical for society because children deserve the love and care of both a mother and a father . The Lambda Legal Foundation, a gay rights advocacy group, teamed with the American Civil Liberties Union to file the appeal. The decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Cincinnati, was the first appellate to side with states seeking to preserve gay marriage bans since the Supreme Court struck down part of a federal anti-gay marriage law last year. Last month, the justices rejected appeals from five states of rulings favoring same-sex couples, but that was before the recent ruling created a division among lower courts. Same-sex couples can marry in 32 states, parts of Kansas and Missouri, and the District of Columbia. The Kentucky and Michigan cases involve the right of sex-same couples to marry. The Ohio appeal focuses on the state's refusal to recognize out-of-state gay marriages because of its own ban, while the Tennessee case is narrowly focused on the rights of three same-sex couples. In asking the Supreme Court to reverse the 6th circuit, the plaintiffs in Ohio pressed the argument that states should be forced to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. The 6th circuit ruling ""robs married same-sex spouses and their children of dignity and legal respect from cradle to grave,"" Cincinnati attorney Al Gerhardstein wrote. Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, said lawyers for the state would review the appeal. ""The Ohio Attorney General's Office had previously stated that it did not anticipate opposing a Supreme Court review of the same-sex marriage issue,"" Tierney said. EQUAL RIGHTS: Angela Schaefer (left) and Jennifer Schaefer (right) held an application for a marriage license at the clerk's office at the Johnson County Courthouse in Olathe, Kansas on Oct. 8 . The speed with which the appeals are being filed – eight days after the ruling – indicates the court could take up and decide the issue this term, by the end of June. That's if it takes the cases at all. The states have a month to respond. If they don't seek extra time, the gay marriages cases should be before the justices for their first private conference in 2015, on January 9. If the court decides then to hear the cases, there should be time to schedule arguments in late April. The justices would have two months to write their opinions.

"A man wearing a military uniform and pretended to be a decorated Canadian soldier at a Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa is now the subject of a police investigation. When interviewed by reporters at the ceremony, Franck Gervais spoke of honouring those who had fought for the country's freedom while wearing a beret, military uniform and medals. But when an eagle-eyed Warrant Officer viewed the footage, he realised something was not right. Scroll down for video . Franck Gervais, pictured during the Ottawa Remembrance Day ceremony dressed as soldier . Crowds gather on Parliament Hill in Ottawa to watch the Remembrance Day ceremony . Michael Womack, a Warrant Officer based in Wainwright, Alberta, told the National Post: 'I saw the interview and I was like, ""Wait a second, I should know him because that's an RCP cap badge and a maroon beret."" 'I didn't know him, so I said to my wife: ""Something's not right here"".' And his suspicions have now lead to The Department of National Defence confirming that Mr Gervais is not a member of the Canadian Forces. Mr Womack revealed there were a number of small but significant details which gave away his ruse. Mr Gervais should not have been wearing a paratrooper's pathfinders badge, nor the exclusive advanced reconnaissance award. Among other inconsistencies were that his beret was too small for his head and he should have been wearing a red sash. The revelation he was posing as a soldier on a day meant to honour those who fought and died for their country sparked outrage across Canada. It has now led to a police investigation, announced yesterday, that will focus on whether he falsely impersonated a member of the Canadian Forces. Yesterday CBC News spoke to Mr Gervais' wife, who said she and her husband felt trapped. She told the broadcaster the couple had been receiving death threats and said she couldn't comment on why he was wearing the uniform at the ceremony. He was filmed wearing medals and beret, but the Canadian Department of National Defence has said he is not a member of the Canadian Forces . Franck Gervais was pictured at the ceremony wearing an army dress uniform with sergeant's chevrons and the cap badge of the Royal Canadian Regiment. To the everyday viewer, there was no indication that anything was amiss. However, a number of details in his presentation - mostly undetectable to civilians - gave away the charade. 1. Mr Gervais was wearing an airborne pathfinders torch and advanced reconnaissance award. These are given to members of an exclusive unit that secure drop zones, gather intelligence and carry out dangerous ambushes and reconnaissance behind enemy lines. The course to gain entry is extremely difficult to pass. 2. A real soldier would not be wearing a beret as tight fitting as Mr Gervais' was. He should also have been wearing a red sash, as all infantry senior NCOs are required to during official occasions. 3. Mr Gervais was wearing the Medal of Bravery. This is an extremely rare award handed out for heroic acts, with most recipients usually well known and celebrated publicly as having earned it. 4. Finally, as a general rule the Canadian Forces does not permit its members to grow beards during active service - let alone maintain and groom a Van Dyke. An estimated 50,000 people lined the streets for the public ceremony where a man named Franck Gervais was later found to be impersonating a soldier . Members of the public lay poppies on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial . Thousands gathered for Remembrance Day ceremonies at Canada's war memorial on Tuesday, the same site where a soldier was shot dead three weeks ago in an attack on parliament. The annual November 11 Remembrance Day honoring Canada's war dead took on increased significance this year after two soldiers were killed in separate attacks in October that police said were carried out by radical recent converts to Islam. The crowd, an estimated 50,000, was bigger than usual at Ottawa's cenotaph and security was tight at the event attended by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Princess Anne and her husband Sir Tim Laurence, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, his wife Laureen, and Veteran Affairs Minister Julian Fantino watch the ceremony together in silence . The prime minister cut short a trip to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) bloc summit in China to participate in the ceremony. In a statement, Harper said the recent attacks on the two soldiers 'who were targeted simply because they proudly wore this uniform, only strengthens Canada's resolve to keep fighting against those who would deny our liberties and freedoms.' On October 22, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, was standing an unarmed, ceremonial watch at the war memorial when he was shot by a man who then ran into the Parliament building, exchanging fire with security officers before he was killed.","Man posed as a soldier in uniform during Remembrance Day ceremony .

"A man who lost his late father's treasured First World War medal on a beach when he was a child has been reunited with it - 76 years later. Ben Eggleston was a five-year-old boy when he lost the 1914 Star, known as the Mons Star, while on a day trip to Brighton in August 1938. He carried the medal in memory of his father who had died that year from lung cancer - a condition he developed after being gassed in the trenches. Heartbroken: Ben Eggleston, pictured left aged five, lost the 1914 Star, awarded to his father (right) while on a day trip to Brighton in 1938. He carried the medal in memory to his father, who had died from cancer that year . He spent decades visiting archives, antique fairs and private collections trying to find the medal, which was awarded for bravery in the Battle of the Somme. This month, Mr Eggleston, now 82, spotted the medal, inscribed with his father's name, Sergeant Stephen Eggleston, on an eBay auction. It is now at his home in Norfolk. The former engineer said it was 'incredibly poignant' that he should find it in the centenary of the start of the war. The great-grandfather said: 'After all these years of wondering what had happened to it, we just sat there in amazement looking at the screen, hardly daring to believe what we were seeing.' He added: 'I am delighted it is now back with our family. 'It serves as an emblem of my father's heroism, and of the many hundreds of thousands of men who lost their lives or were injured in this terrible conflict.' What happened to the medal, known as the Mons Star, after 1939 remains a mystery, though it was in the possession of its most recent owner for more than 30 years. Precious: Mr Eggleston spent decades visiting archives, antique fairs and private collections trying to find the medal, inscribed with his father's name (right), which was awarded for bravery in the Battle of the Somme . It will now join Sgt Eggleston's Meritorious Service Medal and his Military Medal, which were both awarded for bravery during the first day of the Battle of the Somme. He had been a private in the 4th Battalion Middlesex Regiment. Mr Eggleston, who visited the battlefields of France and Belgium researching his father’s military history, visited numerous archives, antique fairs, and medal collections in search of the medal. More recently, Ben spent hundreds of hours on the internet almost daily in an attempt to find the lost medal. And every time his family visited Brighton they looked on the beach in the faint hope the medal had washed up. His daughter Jane Bulmer, 55, said: 'Last week, he couldn’t believe his eyes when an eBay lot suddenly popped up on screen showing a Mons Star inscribed with his father’s name, regiment, and service number. 'It was part of a five-day auction by a Lincolnshire collector, who had owned the Mons Star for more than 30 years and had now decided to sell it. 'The seller had bought it himself from another collector, whose name was long forgotten, and there was no record of what had happened to the medal in the intervening 40 years before he had acquired it. 'This didn’t matter to my father as the important thing was that the Star had not been lost.'","Ben Eggleston was five years old when he lost the 1914 star in Brighton .

"The modern-day woman prefers sleep and technology to sex. A new global study has revealed that as the world gets more complex, females are turning to simpler life choices that make their lives easier. More than 4,300 women were questioned from the UK, Brazil, China and the US on a range of issues including sex, sleep, money, technology and family concerns. In the survey, 68 per cent of British women revealed they would prefer a good night's sleep to sex, compared to 60 per cent in the US and 70 per cent in China. A study questioned 4,300 British, American, Chinese and Brazilian women. 68 per cent of those answering in the UK revealed they would prefer a good night's sleep to sex, compared to 60 per cent in the US, 70 per cent in China and 38 per cent in Brazil . Brazilian women were the least worried about a good night's kip, with only 38 per cent preferring sleep to making love. In America and Britain, sex didn't even out-perform technology - given the choice to go three months without sex or technology, the majority would prefer to go without sex. It didn't any better in a battle against money either. When asked if they would prefer more money, sex or power, 80 percent prefer money. Money secures the family's future, which women prioritize over their own needs. On average, women in the UK, U.S. and Brazil believe that 'old age' starts at age 70, whereas in China, where old age is revered, it is seen as coming earlier – 50 for women, and 60 for men . But money didn't necessarily mean being rich - just being financially stable: when asked to define success, women most frequently cited financial security, family and happiness, while deprioritising wealth and luxury. The study, which was commissioned by FleishmanHillard and Hearst Magazine, also showed a huge gap between what is perceived as 'old' in the different countries. On average, women in the UK, U.S. and Brazil believe that 'old age' starts at age 70. When asked to define success, women most frequently cited financial security over wealth . That age is a moving target though -  millennials (aged between 18-29) think old age starts at 60, while baby boomers (aged between 50-69) think it starts at 80. In China, where old age is revered, it is seen as coming earlier – 50 for women, and 60 for men. The attitudes in the different countries were also very different about how women felt towards consumer brands. While value was the key reason for ladies using a particular brand, there were many issues that would convince them to drop a product. In the UK and the US, the biggest deal-breaker is learning that a company discriminates against women. Inn China, women are most likely to discontinue brand use if the company is on the brink of bankruptcy. While in Brazil, a company that has been hacked and had credit card information compromised is most likely to lose customers.","A study questioned 4,300 British, American, Chinese and Brazilian women .

"Strippers have been awarded $10.9 million by a federal judge who found they had been denied tips and forced to pay for the privilege of working. Rick's Cabaret in New York City's Midtown collected $2 of every $20 the girls earned in tips, a federal court heard. And bosses demanded $60 from each girl every shift in exchange for letting them take to the pole. Payout: A federal judge has awarded dancers from Rick's Cabaret in New York's Midtown $10.9 million . On Friday, Manhattan Federal Court Judge Paul Engelmayer published a 51-page ruling, slamming the club for misleading customers and depriving employees of their due salaries. The action was brought on behalf of some 2,000 dancers employed at the club - owned by Peregrine Enterprises Inc, a unit of RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc - going back to 2005. The award is short of the $18.8 million in damages the dancers sought, and the judge left the balance to be decided at a trial. The date will be set shortly, the court order said. In a September 2013 ruling, Engelmayer sided with the plaintiffs, saying Rick's Cabaret exercised so much control over the dancers that they were actually employees subject to the club's rules and could not make independent decisions about their work. The only payment the dancers received was in the form of tips for dances, which normally amounted to around $20. 'Unfair': 2,000 strippers filed the case which said they were forced to hand over tips and pay to dance . Defending, the club said the strippers were obliged to pay 'performance fees'. This included $20 per dance or semi-private performance, where they charge a minimum of $100 for 15 minutes and up to $400 for an hour. However, Engelmayer slammed the defense, saying a 'reasonable customer would have understood the performance fees which customers paid dancers as gratuities belonging to particular dancers, not as service charges belonging to the club.' RCI Hospitality, Rick's Cabaret's parent company, dismissed the ruling as 'flawed'.","Rick's Cabaret in New York's Midtown demanded $2 of every $20 tip .

"A kitten found in sub-zero weather in Denver is perky and purring after workers at an animal shelter used heating pads, blankets and hair dryers to save its life. The approximately 3-month-old 1.2 pound kitten was found tangled in some electric wires on a porch Thursday and brought to the Denver Dumb Friends League.

Not frozen: Elsa the cat survived being out in the cold thanks to the warmhearted animal care workers who nursed her back to health and named her after a character in Frozen . Melting hearts: Elsa impressed the team of animal workers with her brave spirit despite nearly being frozen . 'You could sort of feel the cold coming off her,' said the veterinarian, Dr. Kasey Carter, who treated the kitten. Workers also used hot water bottles, booties and a blanket that fluffs up with warm air to heat up the cat. After an hour and a half, she began to perk up and start eating. The staff named her Elsa after the character in the Disney movie Frozen. She'll be put up for adoption if no one claims her. 'When she came into the shelter, we weren't even sure if she was alive,' said Megan Rees, a spokeswoman for the shelter told ABC. Rees said the kitten had been suffering in temperatures below 10 degrees Fahrenheit for a few hours and it's a miracle she;s alive. Elsa is in stable condition and will either be claimed by her owner or put up for adoption. Rees said that the likelihood of small kittens like Elsa surviving in such harsh conditions is low and that Elsa was very brave during her recovery. 'They're so small and fragile to begin with,' said Rees. 'It's hard to imagine a kitten surviving in such severely cold weather for an extended period of time. ... It's just really a miracle that she was able to pull through.' New home: Elsa will be put up for adoption if her owner doesn't claim her from the animal shelter .

"A maths teacher at one of Britain's top private schools, which was attended by comedian Alan Davies and Towie star Jess Wright, has been jailed for having sex with a 15-year-old pupil. Dr John Wunderle, 35, was a teacher at £15,000 a year Bancroft's School in Woodford, Essex. But concern was raised with the girl's parents. Dr John Wunderle was a teacher at Bancroft's School in Essex . When the girl's mother caught him getting dressed in the teenager's bedroom he insisted there was an innocent reason he was half-naked in their home and said: 'It's all a misunderstanding' Her parents were terrified the couple would flee the country as teacher Jeremy Forrest did with a 15-year-old pupil in 2012. Nicholas Bleaney, prosecuting, told Snaresbrook Crown Court that the victim's parents had taken away her phone and computer to stop further contact. But he added that when they grew suspicious that they were still in contact they hired a private detective and gave the girl a phone with a tracking device. The couple were caught and the teenager discovered under a blanket on the back seat of Mr Wunderle's car after he had been bailed by the police. The girl told police that he touched her breasts and bottom over her clothes while they were in the kitchen. 'On 5 June the neighbours alerted her parents to the fact that he was attending their address in the middle of the day, the girl's mother returned home and found the defendant dressing himself in her bedroom,' Mr Bleaney said. 'He said: ""It's all a misunderstanding"" and the girl was saying that she loved him. 'The school was notified and her parents took away her phone and her computer in an effort to stop them having contact with each other.' Wunderle admitted the charges at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) and was sentenced to four years in jail . Wunderle at first accept that he had kissed and touched the girl, but later gave a no comment interview to police. He was bailed on the condition that he have no contact with the teenager, but her parents were suspicious that the pair were managing to maintain contact. They hired a private investigator who told them to give their daughter a mobile phone fitted with a GPS device so he could track her movements. Analysis of her phone showed she had searched the internet for the name of the 15-year-old who had run off with Forrest to France in 2012. Mr Bleaney said: 'On 31 July the private detective intercepted them meeting in his car near Woodford High road.' The girl told police he had contacted her on Facebook using an alias and they had also been speaking via Twitter. 'After her GCSE results they were planning on running away together, the defendant had mentioned Amsterdam and going on the ferry to Holland but it seems they were short of funds. 'In her victim impact statement she said she now feels she was stupid and that she had been manipulated by the defendant. He said: 'She felt at the time that she loved him and what was going on was consensual but looking back on it she feels that what she was told by him were lies or at the very least adaptations of the truth and she no feels stupid and deceived.' The maths teacher earned £40,000-per-year at the school, which counts the likes of comedian Alan Davies, tennis player Samantha Smith and Jess Wright from hit TV show The Only Way is Essex as part of its alumni. The school Wunderle taught at Bancroft's School in Woodford, Essex, which was also attended by comedian Alan Davies (left) and reality TV star Jess Wright from The Only Way Is Essex (right) Jailing him for four years Judge Nigel Peters said: 'These offences are prevalent and this offence occurred in recent times. 'Courts up and down the country have been dealing with offences of this type, many of which are historic, so you would have known that there remains a high public concern about sexual offences involving children and older men, and especially of school teachers who abuse positions of trust.' He added: 'You've no previous convictions, that goes without saying, you're an extremely intelligent man, you've done extremely well academically and you were teaching at one of the top schools in the country. 'You would have known the prevalence of this offence and the view the courts take of those who get involved with children.' The girl's younger siblings have since been forced to move schools and the family are planning on relocating to another part of the county for a fresh start while the girl studies for her A-levels. Wunderle pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of penetrative sexual activity with a child between March and August this year at a pleas and case management hearing in October. He also pleaded guilty to a further count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust and one count of inciting sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Nan Mousley, for Wunderle, told the court her client was very bright and held a PhD in maths, but described him as 'emotionally immature'. She said: 'His position is that he was in love with this girl, he felt it was a good relationship and whilst looking back now he should have turned his back on it, it remains for him an exceptional relationship and one that's never likely to be repeated.' She added: 'A colleague said that despite being highly intelligent there's a lack of emotional intelligence that can lead to problems.' 'At the time it was a consensual relationship, it might have been unwise, it might have been wrong and I don't seek to minimise it but it was consensual.' Wunderle, of Waltham Abbey,  sat with his head in his hands throughout the hearing and as he was handed the four year sentence.","Dr John Wunderle, 35, was a teacher at Bancroft's School in Essex .

"A seal with a fondness for New Jersey beaches — and the food-sharing fishermen and beachgoers that come with them — is headed for Detroit Zoo after becoming a little too friendly with the locals. Since March, the 100-pound female gray seal had stopped on Long Island, New York, and New Jersey beaches at Sandy Hook, Island Beach State Park, Sea Isle City and Longport. Each time, animal rescue groups shooed it back into the water or treated it for illness or injury. But the seal kept coming back. The female grey seal pictured swimming in a holding tank at the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, New Jersey . When people started petting it on a beach in Longport on Sept. 5, the Marine Mammal Stranding Center removed it from the ocean permanently because it had become too acclimated to humans. 'We would see it in Sea isle City, swimming among the bathers, not bothering anybody, but clearly too used to humans being around,' said Bob Schoelkopf, director of the stranding center. 'In Longport, it came ashore and kids went up and started petting it. That's what sealed its fate.' The animal's odyssey began on March 9 when Long Island's Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research responded to a report of a young seal with a swollen flipper. The animal was rehabilitated at the center for just over three months and released on June 14. The land-loving seal, which has come ashore repeatedly in New York and New Jersey since march, is being sent to a zoo in Detroit . The seal splashes as it climbs out of a holding tank at the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in New Jersey . On July 10, New Jersey's Marine Mammal Stranding Center received a call about a seal on the beach with a fishing hook lodged in its mouth. A technician from the center removed the hook. Because the animal had no other obvious injuries or illnesses, it was released and went back into the water. But two days later, the seal was back ashore again, this time in Sea Isle City, where a large crowd gathered, causing the animal to become anxious and stressed. The stranding center picked it up and brought it to its Brigantine facility, where personnel noticed the animal had a cough, and put it on antibiotics. When the cough disappeared and blood tests showed the seal had no illness, it was released at Sandy Hook on Aug. 18, having gained 21 pounds at the rescue center. 'Throughout the next few weeks, there were dozens of reports of our seal swimming in close proximity to bathers in the surf,' Schoelkopf said. 'We got calls from people saying they had fed it.' After deciding the seal was too used to humans to ever return to the ocean, the stranding center notified federal wildlife officials, who found a home for it at the Detroit Zoo. The seal leaves on Sunday for the zoo, which will have a contest to name it. The seal is being sent to a zoo in Detroit because it has become too accustomed to humans .","The wild seal kept coming ashore to play with humans and get food .

"Two radical Muslim preachers from the  suburbs who have previously expressed their support for the Islamic State have launched a national tour to help 'exorcise' demons or 'genies' affecting people in Australian capital cities. West Australian Aboriginal Muslim convert, Mohammed Junaid Thorne and Sydney man, Abu Hamza, claim they can oust the evil 'jinn' or genies which are preying on the Australian public. Abu Hamza, a self-proclaimed 'jinn buster' claims the evil genies can possess an unwitting victim and 'there's a lot of them in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Adelaide, in Brisbane and in Perth'. Scroll down for video . Who ya gonna call? These two radical Islamic figures, Abu Hamza (above, left) and Mohammed Janaid Thorne (right) have announced their Australian 'Jinn-buster' tour. The men who hail from the Sydney and Perth suburbs plan lectures in which they will show people how to get rid of evil genies known as 'jinns' which occupy unclean or unholy people and wreck their marriages, health, happiness and cause depression . Abu Hamza says he has been a 'Jinn Buster' for ten years, helping people by driving out  genies and thereby solving marriage breakdowns,  children hating parents, depression, 'cure' gay or lesbianism, drug and alcohol problems and 'lack of appetite or too much appetite' - all by loud chanting in Arabic . Before embarking on the jinn buster tour, Junaid Thorne (pictured, left) was better known as one of two sons of a Muslim mother and Noongar people Aboriginal father who became radicalised, went to Saudi Arabia, and the returned to Australia where he has declared his support for the ISIS group . He says a person can be possessed by the evil jinn by not bathing or being holy enough. And he claims by driving out the genies, he can solve people's marriage breakdowns, their children hating them, depression, and help 'patients who are involved with ... gay/lesbian', drug and alcohol problems and 'lack of appetite or too much appetite' - all by loud chanting in Arabic. 'I want to warn all my brothers and sister in Islam a very important message,' he says in a pre-tour promotional video. Evil beings: Jinns or genies, as depicted (above) in this 16th century artwork 'Imam Ali Conquers Jinn' are supernatural beings from Islamic mythology made of 'smokeless and scorching fire' 'Any person that will ask you, when you go to see them, about your mother's name, or tells you to to give any part of your clothes or hair, you should know this guy is ... nothing but a magician. 'Be careful! Do not go to such people. They are nothing but evil and unfortunately there's a lot of them [in the Australian capital cities where Hamza and Thorne are about to embark on their lecture tour]. 'A lot of people don't actually look after themselves hygienically .. and of course that's an opportunity for a jinn to enter the body . 'Be aware of them and totally stay away from them.' Hamza then asks people to follow him on his Facebook page, to 'like my page insha'Allah' [which means  Allah or God willing]. His Facebook page includes a video of a 'jinn buster' at work chanting continuously in Arabic to exorcise the demon of a man sitting in a chair, in a process which is called 'ruqyah'. Hamza, a Lebanese Australian who says his real name is Mohammed and who founded the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, claims to be an expert on 'black magic' and 'jinns'. Jinns or genies are supernatural beings in Islamic mythology mentioned frequently in the Quran (Koran) and other Islamic texts, which describe them as creatures made of a 'smokeless and scorching fire' which can interfere physically with human beings. Abu Hamza claims to have been exorcising them from people for ten years. Junaid Thorne says on his Facebook page he had joined forces with Hamza to conduct 'a new series of lectures regarding the world of the Jinn, how to deal with them in the light of the Quran and the Sunnah, how to protect ourselves from possession, black magic, evil eye and the rest, and exciting but beneficial stories'. He said 'the new tour around Australia that me and brother Abu Hamza - Jinn Buster plan to do very soon insha'Allah, starting locally from NSW, Sydney, and ending with WA, Perth'. Thorne, a prominent WA cleric who has now relocated to Sydney, is one of two sons of a Malaysian Muslim mother and a Noongar people indigenous father, who became radicalised Muslims and went to live in Saudi Arabia. Controversial: Junaid Thorne (pictured) was deported from the Middle East last year and has provoked media attention after he said 18-year-old Numan Haider, the Melbourne man shot dead while stabbing two police officers, had attended some his lectures . Beware! Abu Hamza (above, left) says ahead of his national lecture tour about evil jinns (above, right)  that  'any person that will ask you, when you go to see them, about your mother's name, or tells you to to give any part of your clothes or hair, you should know this guy is ... nothing but a magician. Be careful! Do not go to such people. They are nothing but evil and unfortunately there's a lot of them [in Australia]' Junaid's brother, Shayden Thorne, was imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for 'terrorist offences' and has used his Twitter account to post Islamic State propaganda messages. Junaid was deported from the Middle East last year and has provoked media attention after he said 18-year-old Numan Haider, the Melbourne man shot dead while stabbing  two police officers, had attended  his controversial lectures. In a Facebook post on November 8, written in Arabic, Junaid Thorne said certain 'concepts ... must be corrected: the concept of security and stability ... adopted by the enemies of God as a pretext for the occupation of Muslim lands and the destruction and looting of its resources'. He also wrote about 'the enemies of God by crimes against Islam and Muslims' and signed it 'Sheikh Hatem'. Thorne promised the jinn-buster demon exorcism lecture tour, 'will be something interesting, beneficial, and exciting to all those who attend'. No dates or venues for the tour have yet been posted by either man.","Radical Islamic preachers Junaid Thorne and Abu Hamza are going on a national Australian tour .

"This is the poignant last official picture of movie legend James Dean taken on the day of his fatal car crash. Dean is pictured looking relaxed and happy in the driver's seat of his beloved Porsche 550 Spyder with mechanic Rolf Wutherich sitting alongside him on a sunny California morning. The photograph was taken on September 30, 1955, by Sanford Roth who was following Dean to do a photo feature on a race he was attending. The photograph will be auctioned by Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills this week. Poignant: This is the last official photograph of movie legend James Dean snapped on the morning of his fatal car crash on 30th Sept 1955. Dean is in the driving seat with mechanic Rolf Wutherich alongside him . Roth took the picture just before the party headed out of Los Angeles to the road races at Salinas. The 24-year-old star crashed his car on Route 466 near Pasa Robles later on the same day. Dean was killed in the crash and his friend Wutherich was seriously injured. Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien's Auctions, said: 'James Dean . is quite the icon today yet he was only in Hollywood for five years. Icon: Dean made just three films before he died in a head-on car crash at the age of just 24 . 'He made three movies and two of those came out after his death. It's amazing that in 2013 he is still such a memorable icon. 'This is a candid photo and was taken by the photographer from Dean's station wagon in front. Dean was on his way to a car race and it looks like they were all having fun. 'It is a forever powerful and compelling image, with Dean clasping his mechanic's hand in a gesture of anticipation and triumph. As it is one of the last photos ever taken of him, it is most poignant.' Photographer Roth first met Dean on the set of the 1956 film Giant and the pair became friends. Roth took some iconic pictures of Dean both on the set of that film and afterwards in Los Angeles. Dean was the first ever actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award . nomination for Best Actor, for his role in East Of Eden in 1955. He is also the only actor to receive two posthumous Academy Award . acting nominations, as he had a second one the following year for Giant. The photograph, which is being auctioned alongside other images of Dean . taken by Roth, is set to fetch £500 when it goes for sale on April . 5. James Dean is buried in Fairmount, Indiana, near his uncle's farm where he grew up. In 1977, a Dean memorial was erected in Cholame, California. The sculpture was made of stainless steel around a 'tree of heaven' growing in front of the former Cholame post office building. Image: Some claim this photo of Dean at a petrol station with his Porsche is the last one taken of him before his death . Debated: This image of the back of Dean's car as he was driving is also claimed by some to be the last picture taken of him before he died . Tragedy: The wreck of Dean's car is removed from the scene of the crash in which the star was killed .

"Steven Hayes, who is awaiting execution for his role in the shocking 2007 Petit family home invasion that left a mother and her two daughters brutally murdered says he is refusing to eat prison food that he believes is not kosher. In a shocking move, Hayes is suing the Connecticut Department of Correction, alleging it would not serve him a kosher diet. He says the system is forcing him to 'starve or go against God.' Hayes was sentenced to die in July 2007 along with another man for the murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters in Cheshire. Scroll down for video . Steven Hayes says the system is forcing him to 'starve or go against God' because the food is not kosher . In a handwritten amended complaint made public Wednesday, Hayes says he hasn't eaten any nonkosher food since August 24, and now weighs less than 120 pounds. State prison documents show the 5-foot-7 Hayes weighed 170 pounds in 2007. The department offers kosher food, but Hayes contends it isn't kosher because of cross-contamination. In March, Hayes was found in a stable condition in his cell after speaking many times of wanting to die because of his guilt over his horrifying crime. Horrific: Dr Petit (right) was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds only to be killed via smoke inhalation when their captors set alight their Connecticut home after raping and strangling their mother, Jennifer . In 2007, Petit and his family were held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by invaders Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky. Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds. After the 11-year-old was raped and her mother raped and strangled to death, the intruders set the home ablaze and left all but Petit dead. Hayes tried to commit suicide during his 2010 trial and upon hearing he would face the death penalty, told a New Haven court 'Death, to me, will be a welcome relief.' Hayes and Komisarjevsky, are both on death row following their convictions in the 2007 triple-murder of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley Petit, 17, and Michaela Petit, 11, and the beating of husband and father Dr. William Petit Jr. Horrifying: Dr. William Petit Jr.(left) with his daughters Michaela, (front), Hayley, (back left), and his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit. In June 2007. Petit was beaten and his wife and two daughters killed during a home invasion in Cheshire, Connecticut . Shocking: Hayes raped and strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, died of smoke inhalation after they were doused with gasoline and the house was set on fire . A photo from the crime scene shows the extent of the blaze set by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky, which killed Petit's family . The pair spotted Hawke-Petit at a supermarket and followed her to her home in Cheshire, Connecticut, where they tied up the family. Hayes raped and strangled Hawke-Petit and Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela. Both Michaela and her sister, Hayley, were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the men doused the home with gas and set it on fire.

On death row: Petit and his family were held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by invaders Steven Hayes (left) and Joshua Komisarjevsky (right) In testimony at the trial, Hayes said he had frequently attempted suicide, slashing his wrists, slamming his mother's car into a rock and tying a sock around his neck. He also told The Hartford Courant in a 2012 interview that he concocted a plan to end his own life by obtaining oysters, to which he is deathly allergic. He said he fabricated claims in letters that he killed 17 people in hopes that prison authorities would notify police and he could then trade information for food, including oysters. Joshua Komisarjevsky also was convicted and sentenced to death for the home invasion killings.","Steven Hayes claims the food is not genuinely kosher because of contamination .

"When Maria Brewer bought a battery powered koala bear for her daughter Willow she hoped it would make a perfect present for her first birthday. But the mother-of-two was shocked when her older three-year-old child noticed that as well as making 'koala gurgling noises' it also appeared to say 'motherf*****.' The cuddly grey toy, which costs £34.99 is meant to move its arms, make koala gurgling noises and move its ears. But Mrs Brewer, of Widley in Hampshire, has been forced to explain what the swearword means to her three-year-old Meghan after she started repeating what she had heard from the toy. Scroll down for video . Maria Brewer bought a koala toy for her daughter Willow's first birthday, but the care home manager from Fareham, was shocked when her three-year-old daughter told her it appeared to say 'motherf******' The care home manager said: 'I don't want my kids to be picking up on words like that. 'I don't know what a koala bear sounds like but I don't think a koala bear would sound like that. It's inappropriate. Mrs Brewer bought the teddy bear from toy store Smyths in Fareham.

The Emotion Pet Koala Bear  appears to say 'motherf*****' when it should make gurgling koala sounds . 'But it swears. We just left it and then it said it again. I was shocked because it was very clear. I looked online to see if anyone else had heard it. 'On the advert, it certainly did not swear - it's a cute cuddly koala bear.' Mrs Brewer said she is concerned other children might have similar toys and could end up getting told off for repeating the swearword. Mrs Brewer said she was shocked the koala appeared to swear and has returned it the the  store . Graham Moriarty, manager at Smyths, said: 'The koala does not actually speak, it does not say anything. 'It's a fine line of where I can go with this as the suppliers and buyers feel there's no issues because there's no other complaints. 'We are not the sort of company that is going to sell inappropriate products.' Michele Bates from Flair which makes the koala, said: 'This toy has been on sale for many months across Europe and it is the first complaint of its kind.

"The sister of a detective shot dead by Harry Roberts has hit out at the decision to release the killer, insisting he should have been given the death penalty. Grace Anstey, 84, says she can never forget the day she learnt her brother, Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, had been gunned down alongside two of his colleagues in 1966. She slammed the decision to release Roberts from Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, on Monday after 48 years behind bars, saying 'life should mean life' for the 78-year-old. Grace Anstey (left) has hit out at the decision to release Harry Roberts, who shot her brother, police officer Christopher Head (right), in the 1966 west London shooting known as the Braybrook Street Massacre . Harry Roberts, pictured, is being given a new identity and a flat in an OAP home following his release from jail . Mrs Anstey's younger brother was 30 years old and serving with the Metropolitan Police when he and two other officers were shot dead in Shepherds Bush in the shooting dubbed the 'Massacre of Braybrook Street'. The policeman, who had grown up in Dartmouth, Devon, died after Roberts shot him in the head with a Luger pistol. Great grandmother Mrs Anstey, who has since emigrated to Sydney, Australia with her husband Fred in 1955, said she learned of his 'shocking' release on Monday when a British relative rang her. She said: 'It's all just very difficult. I am just sad. I feel life should be life. 'I know Harry Roberts is an old man now, but so would my brother have been. They were the same age. 'It's so upsetting but what can you do? I hope he doesn't misbehave again. It's unfortunate that capital punishment was abolished just the year before.' Mrs Anstey says her brother (pictured, back row right, during his childhood) would now be roughly the same age as 78-year-old Roberts if he had not been murdered . Roberts - (left) as he was in 1966  when he was jailed for life and (right) now - is believed to have changed his name by deed poll . When Roberts was sentenced to life in prison, the judge, Mr Justice Glyn-Jones, recommended that he serve at least 30 years before becoming eligible for parole. He commented that the killings were 'the most heinous crime to have been committed in this country for a generation or more' but couldn't pass the death sentence because it had been abolished a year earlier. Roberts, who had two accomplices, John Duddy and John Witney, has expressed 'regret' and insists he is no longer a danger to the public. Amid great secrecy, he was taken from prison to a bail hostel in the south of England, where he will be assessed pending an expected move to warden-controlled accommodation. Reports suggest the killer has changed his name, possibly by deed poll, to avoid being identified by fellow residents. Witney was released in 1991 but died eight years later when he was beaten with a hammer and strangled in Bristol, while Duddy died in Parkhurst prison in 1981.

"White widow Samantha Lewthwaite is 'alive and well' and living in southern Somalia with her jihadist husband, a wanted al-Qaeda suspect who calls himself Marco Costa, Kenyan sources said today. In a forged Mozambican passport obtained by MailOnline his picture clearly identifies him as Fahmi Jamal Salim who has been on the run from Kenyan police since he shot and killed two police officers in Nairobi in 2011. Lewthwaite and Salim also appear in a 'selfie' taken at their home. Police are using these and pictures of their two children in a countrywide manhunt for the couple. Counter-terrorism sources in Kenya revealed their updated profile of Lewthwaite in response to claims from a Moscow news agency earlier this week that she had been killed by sniper fire while fighting with a Ukrainian volunteer battalion against pro-Russian rebels. Kenyan intelligence authorities are demanding to see Lewthwaite's body and say they refuse to believe she has been part of any militia outside East Africa. Scroll down for video . In love: Lewthwaite and Fahmi Jamal Salim appear in a 'selfie' taken at their home in Somalia . Major threat: Lewthwaite, left, and her new husband Salim are major operatives in al-Shabaab . A senior source said: 'We believe we currently have an accurate profile of Lewthwaite's life and location. She has been linked to other jihad suspects in the past but we now know that she is in a stable marriage with Salim and has two young children with him. 'They pose a major threat to security, working at a high level in the al-Shabaab terror group and planning bombing raids in Somalia and Kenya in retaliation for Kenya sending troops to Somalia to defeat al-Shabaab.' By marrying Salim Samantha Lewthwaite has joined a family steeped in Muslim extremism and the jihad. Salim's brother-in-law was notorious al-Qaeda recruiting officer Musa Dheere , shot dead at a roadblock in Mogadishu in 2011 alongside Fazul Mohamed, a terror suspect with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head. Dheere was wanted for the bombing of American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam in 1998 when several hundred were killed. A comprehensive file seen by MailOnine reveals that Lewthwaite, 30, married Salim in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2008 after meeting him through a Muslim hate cleric she regularly visited in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, following the death of her first husband Germaine Lindsay. Lindsay was part of a suicide bomb plot which killed 52 people on the London underground in July, 2005. Lewthwaite, pregnant with his second child, told police at the time that she was 'horrified' to hear of her husband's activities, but was soon visiting the cleric Abdullah al-Faisal in prison where he was held for four years. Al-Faisal has admitted that Lewthwaite asked him to find 'a young handsome devout Muslim ' to marry. Growing up in jihad: Samantha Lewthwaite is believed to have two children with her husband Fahmi Jamal Salim . On the run: Lewthwaite, pictured right on a false passport, has written of being a good mother and wife in a file seen by Kenyan police . She disappeared from British police radar and was next seen in December 2011 in the small town of Bakarani on Kenya's east coast where police had swooped on a slum area to arrest suspected terrorists. As police sent her DNA and fingerprints to Scotland Yard overnight, Lewthwaite fled. It was discovered later that when police confronted her she was staying at her in-laws' house. Salim's widowed sister Naseem and their mother lived there. It now emerges that Lewthwaite had met and married Salim, through the cleric al- Faisal, in Johannesburg in 2008. They had false South African identities and both worked in the city while planning their jihadist activities. Salim ran a medical supplies business while Lewthwaite was an accountant for a Halal pie-making factory. She gave birth to two children in a Johannesburg clinic, completing their family of four, including Lindsay's son and daughter. They are now believed to be living in the Lower Shebelle area of southern Somalia, an al-Shabaab stronghold , travelling by dhow – an Arab fishing boat – to reach their counterpart jihadists in Mombasa – or crossing the porous Kenyan border by vehicle at Kiungi town. Lewthwaite home-schools her four children and has written in her diaries of her hope they will become jihadists. The secretive local al-Shabaab community takes care of the children while their parents are away on visits to networks in Kenya. Lewthwaite is considered an important banker/logistician for al-Shabaab. Until recently she was a devoted follower of Ahmed Abdi Godane, the al-Shabaab founder and spiritual leader who announced alliance to al-Qaeda in June 2011. There had been a $7m ( £4.2m) reward for information leading to his arrest. Lewthwaite and her husband were part of his six-member terror cell. Godane was the mastermind behind the shocking armed raid on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in October 2013, describing his militia's 67 murders there as 'an epic battle written in blood by my fighters to change the course of history'. Lewthwaite later openly tweeted her support and admiration for Godane. He was killed two months ago in an American air strike on a convoy in southern Somalia, and counter-terrorism police now fear that Lewthwaite and her cohorts could be planning revenge strikes. A source told MailOnline: 'We have been tracking Lewthwaite and Salim for four years now and we know a great deal about them. But they are living within the protection of an extremely dangerous al-Shabaab community and all we can do is wait for them to make a fatal mistake. 'If we are able to arrest them we will be proud to produce a show trial exposing their trail of murder and destruction throughout Kenya and Somalia'.","Samantha Lewthwaite shares home with a jihadi nicknamed 'Marco Costa'

"Boris Johnson posed as a cocaine dealer in an attempt to sting 'Fake Sheikh' News of the World reporter Mazher Mahmood, it has been claimed. The now-defunct Sunday paper is said to have offered Spectator writer Lloyd Evans £5,000 to destroy the career of Mr Johnson, then editor of that magazine. But the whole scheme was a ruse dreamt up by Mr Johnson to tempt the paper with 'scandalous gossip' and thus disprove its claim to only act in the public interest. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson, pictured in 2003 when he was editor of The Spectator magazine: He and a Spectator writer tried to fool reporters from the News Of The World into believing drugs were sold from the magazine's office . The 1999 plot was revealed in a post to The Spectator's Coffee House blog by Mr Evans, the magazine's sketch writer and former theatre critic. He described how he and Mr Johnson, now mayor of London, came up with a series of 'implausible fables' to tempt the News of the World's reporters and expose how it deals with 'punters who approach it with bits and pieces of dirt'. Mr Evans described how after calling the red-top with his claims that Mr Johnson was a high-class cocaine dealer, he was met in a pub by a reporter called Nadia and asked to sign a contract offering him £5,000 for the story. Mr Evans recounted: 'Nadia wired me up and I phoned Boris, using my codename ""David"". As an opener I mentioned some poems I’d sent him (in real life I’m a poet). Did he want to publish them? He sounded lukewarm, as we’d agreed he should. 'Then I mentioned ""Prince Charles"" and asked if he could give me a small package from ""Charlie"". Fine, said Boris. Nadia liked this touch. ""Prince Charlie,"" she said, ""must be real Oxford talk?"" Yeah,’ I said. Boris, meanwhile, was preparing his end of the sting at The Spectator's offices. Mr Evans wrote: 'He had a plastic bag of baking soda and was stuffing it underneath a statuette that graces the mantelpiece of his office. The inscription on the fine silver figurine reads: ""To The Spectator. From The Townsfolk Of Aberdare. 1929."" The drugs would be produced with a flourish from beneath this official heirloom.' The Fake Sheikh: NotW reporter Mazher Mahmood was brought into the story, but before the double-cross was executed the paper realised they had already been offered another spurious story about Mr Johnson . Convinced it had taped evidence of Boris dealing Class A drugs, the News of the World mobilised its troops. A blacked-out van full of photographers was sent to The Spectator and a video camera was hidden in the handbag of a Nadia, who was posing as Mr Evans' girlfriend. They then dispatched Mr Mahmood, their chief investigator, who now faces inquiries by Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service, to meet him and double-check the story. But before Mr Evans' double-cross sting worked out, the paper realised he had earlier failed to provoke its reporters' interests in a different spurious story about Mr Johnson. 'I was rumbled,' wrote Mr Evans. When he finally came face to face with Mr Mahmood, the reporter had a clear message for him. '""This isn’t the way we work,"" he told me,' Mr Evans wrote. '""Boris isn’t a drug dealer — in the normal sense. He doesn’t do it for a living; he doesn’t corrupt children. 'OK, dealers like that, yeah, we go after them — but not in this case. That’s entrapment. And entrapment is not the way we work.""

"The wife of a convicted sex offender has pleaded guilty to running an unregistered daycare centre as the front for a child porn production operation at a North Carolina home. Elizabeth Holland Mills, 35,  faces up to 30 years in jail after pleading guilty to one count of manufacturing child porn following her arrest alongside four others in January. In August, her husband Bailey Joe Mills, 34, pleaded guilty to the same charge after police discovered Facebook messages sent between him and a 12-year-old girl regarding payments for sex. Elizabeth Holland Mills, 35, and Bailey Joe Mills, 34, both pleaded guilty to running an unregistered daycare centre as the front for a child porn production operation at a North Carolina home . According to the New York Daily News, authorities said his arrest led to the recovery of videos and photos showing victims between the ages of one and 14 being sexually assaulted by adults at the property. They also revealed that Mr Mills had billed himself as a baby-sitter, tutor and mentor at the rented private residence in Harnett County. Speaking to the News Observer earlier this year, the couples' landlord Siegrun Collins said the Mills' had been renting the three-bedroom house for about 18 months at the time of their arrests.

"A spurned boyfriend who posted naked pictures of his ex-girlfriend on the internet is thought to be the first person jailed for ‘revenge porn’, it emerged yesterday. Liam King, 21, was sent intimate pictures by the woman during their three-year on-off relationship. But she went to police after he posted several of the images on social media sites, together with offensive comments, following the breakdown of their affair. Jailed: Luke King was sent a number of intimate photographs by the victim during an on-off relationship that lasted three years. He uploaded one of them to online messaging service WhatsApp in August . The case comes just weeks after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to clamp down on revenge porn. He announced it would become a criminal offence, with a maximum jail term of two years. Jailing King for 12 weeks, District Judge Andrew Davison said his actions were ‘pernicious’ and designed to cause ‘maximum humiliation’ to the victim, whose identity was protected by the court. ‘You should be thoroughly ashamed of this offence,’ the judge said. ‘I regard this as despicable and a significant breach of trust.’ Tough stance: The sentencing comes just weeks after the Government promised to clamp down on 'revenge porn'. Above, Luke King . On August 8 this year, King replaced his profile picture on the internet messaging service WhatsApp with an explicit image of his ex, Southern Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court was told. The victim, who lives in Derby, told police: ‘It disgusted and really upset me.’ She had already contacted police over her ex-boyfriend’s abusive behaviour. King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images. He pleaded guilty to harassment and another charge of failing to answer police bail. Alison Wright, prosecuting, said: ‘She (the victim) called police to report that he had threatened to put explicit photographs of her on the internet. She accepted she sent them initially to him but they were for his eyes only.’ James Close, defending, said King agreed his behaviour was ‘unacceptable’. Last month the Government announced that the distribution of ‘revenge porn’ was to become a criminal offence as part of an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. At the time, Mr Grayling said: ‘We want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side and will do everything we can to bring offenders to justice.’ East Midlands district crown prosecutor Peter Shergill said: ‘Prosecutors are now following guidance … that clarifies how we can use existing legislation to prosecute perpetrators of these intrusive offences.’ Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws. It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught. Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet. Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images. The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions. However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages.","Luke King was sent naked photos by victim during three-year relationship .

"Mexico has sent severely burnt fragments of teeth and bone to Austria for DNA analysis as it attempts to identify human remains suspected to belong to the 43 missing students. The human remains, found in Guerrero, Mexico, are so badly burned they turn to dust when touched and must be examined using highly specialized technology not available in Mexico. It comes as Mexico Attorney General Jesus Murillo has described the ruthlessly efficient body disposal method used by the gang which left the remains so difficult to identify. Scroll down for video . Mexican federal police officers are continuing searches for the missing students while authorities work to identify remains already discovered . Several mass graves have been discovered during the search (pictured) for the missing 43 students, who were killed by a drug gang after being handed over by corrupt police and government officials . A police helicopter flies overhead in the search for more mass graves created by local drug gangs . An armed federal police officer stands guard at the site of mass graves found in rural Mexico . Murillo, who is leading the investigation into the missing students, said: 'Forensic teams have recommended that studies be conducted in the most highly specialized laboratories in the world,' Bloomberg reported. 'The teeth that were found are in such a charred state that touching them almost turns them to dust.' Apprehended suspects of the gang responsible for the students' execution have now provided authorities with a blow-by-blow account of how they killed them and then disposed of the bodies. The New Yorker reported the students were piled into the back of trucks and driven to a remote rubbish dump in Cocula, southwest Mexico. Those that were still alive were bound and thrown into a pit atop rubber tires and wood. They were then interrogated, executed, doused in petrol and set on fire. Once the 14-hour fire finished burning, the killers sifted through the human remains, breaking their bones into pieces before bagging them and tossing them into a river.

The former mayor of Iguala Jose Luis Abarca, along with his wife Maria de los Angeles, have both been apprehended after it was claimed they masterminded the massacre. After weeks in hiding, the two were caught in Mexico City early last week. Prosecutors claim Abarca demanded the students, who were protesting at the time of their apprehension by local police, be 'taught a lesson' so they didn't interrupt a speech by his wife. After being arrested on his orders, the student teachers were then handed over to the gang who executed them, it is alleged. Meanwhile, demonstrators set fire to the local legislature building on Wednesday in the capital of the southwestern state of Guerrero in protests over the massacre of the students by corrupt police and thugs from drug gangs.

In Guerrero's capital of Chilpancingo, members of a teachers union set fire to the session hall in the state assembly building while also torching several cars outside. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and no injuries were reported. Protesters also set a fire at administrative offices of the state's education department. The protests have led to mass cancellations this week in the hotels of Acapulco, the famous beach resort, ahead of a long holiday weekend. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters scuffled with riot police and burned PRI offices in Chilpancingo. 'God willing, this type of vandalism does not repeat itself, this is not the way,' said resident Constantino Garcia. 'I think that this is not what society hopes for when demanding justice.' A plume of smoke arises from the Guerrero state congress building after protesting teachers torched several vehicles . Furniture burns outside the office of the Secretary for the Department of Education in Chilpancingo . Tens of thousands of Mexicans have taken to the streets in recent weeks in peaceful protests over the government's handling of the case of the missing students, which has become the biggest challenge yet to President Pena Nieto. The president is on a trip to China this week, which infuriated protesters and relatives of the students. They believe he cares more about Mexico's business interests than trying to deal with the gang violence that has ravaged much of the country for years. In neighboring Michoacan state, which has also been a focal point of drug gang violence, students blocked the main entrance to the state capital's airport. Another group of demonstrators broke windows, furniture and computers at local PRI offices in the capital of Morelia.","Badly damaged bone and teeth fragments sent to Austria for DNA analysis .

"John Capra has received a $700 bill for ambulance transportation services from Delray Beach, Florida, which came as a shock to him because at the time of the medical emergency he was nearly 1,250 miles away. According to police, the hefty fee stemmed from a November 6 incident in which a man, who gave his name to paramedics as John Capra, possibly overdosed on heroin in the 2200 block of Bloods Grove Circle at around 3am and had to be taken to a hospital. The patient also gave John Capra's date of birth and address in New Jersey. Will the real John Capra please stand up: John Runnells, 23 (left), allegedly gave his name to paramedics in Florida as John Capra, using the identity of his unsuspecting former friend from New Jersey (right) Emergency: Runnells had to be taken to the hospital after possibly overdosing on heroin in Delray Beach, Florida. The $700 bill for the service was later sent to John Capra . The only problem was, the real John Capra was at home in Morristown at the time, completely unaware of the drama playing out in Delray Beach located just over 1,240 miles away. It was not until Tuesday, when the real John Capra got the bill from the Delray Beach Fire Department at his home in New Jersey, that he realized his identity had been stolen, reported the Sun-Sentinel. In addition to the ambulance bill, police also filed drug possession charges against John Capra. Police later determined that the real name of the culprit was 23-year-old John Rannells. Speaking to the Sentinel Thursday, John Capra described Rannells as someone he used to 'associate with' in the past. And according to the Morristown man, it was not the first time that his former friend has misused his identity. Back in August, Rannells gave his name as John Capra to the Branchburg Police Department in New Jersey during an arrest. Repeat offender: Runnells (pictured left and right) allegedly also stole Capra's identity in August during an arrest in Brancburg, New Jersey . Fortunately for the real Mr Capra, the Delray Beach Fire Department has proven very helpful in clearing his name, and he also will not be forced to pay the ambulance bill. But as of Friday afternoon, the name John M. Capra still appeared on the site Mugshots.com next to John Rannells’ booking photo in connection to the November 6 arrest. According to the rules of the site, a person wishing to have his or her arrest record removed from the database will have to fill an unpublishing application and pay a minimum of $399. Laundry list of charges: The 23-year-old, who also has an arrest record in New Jersey, has been hit with a slew of drug and identity theft counts in Florida . Meanwhile, Rannells has been charged with drug possession; giving false identification to a law enforcement officer; using false identification that adversely affects another and using a person's identification without consent. He is being held in the Palm Beach County jail on $8,000 bail. According to online records, the 23-year-old was arrested in Essex County, New Jersey, in February on a slew of drug charges, including manufacturing and selling controlled dangerous substances near a school.","John Capra, from Morristown, New Jersey, received a bill for ambulance service in Delray Beach, Florida, nearly 1,250 miles away from home .

"The duty manager at The Blue Lounge called it the 'calm before the storm' on Friday afternoon, as her girls waited for the expected influx of clients over the weekend. Business appears to be mixing with pleasure in the Queensland capital of Brisbane, with booming trade for Brisbane brothels on the cards, with more than 7000 delegates and observers on hand for the official proceedings.

"A Washington man has been charged with second-degree murder for beating his infant daughter to death with an X-Box controller, police say. Authorities say Ahmed Ibrahim, 26, of Burien, smashed his 8-month-old daughter's skull on Monday and then tried to convince police that his two-year-old daughter was the one who killed the infant. King County sheriff's deputies responded to the home Monday morning after receiving a call from the child's mother saying her baby wasn't breathing, KOMO News reports. Charged: Ahmed Ibrahim, 26, of Burien, has been charged with second-degree murder for beating his infant daughter to death with an X-Box controller . Deputies arrived to find the 8-month-old visibly battered with trauma to her head and her face distorted. The child was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy found the infant had multiple skull fractures and died from severe, blunt force trauma to her head and torso. The medical examiner's office said it is 'highly unlikely' that a two-year-old caused such damage, according to The Seattle Times. Seattle PI reports that Cecelia Gregson, senior deputy prosecutor, described the child's murder as 'brutal and sadistic' saying that Ibrahim 'viciously beat' the child. X-Box: Ibrahim allegedly smashed his 8-month-old daughter's skull and then tried to convince police that his two-year-old daughter was the one who killed the infant . The child's mother told authorities that she had left the infant and her two other children -- girls aged four and two -- in the care of her husband at 12.30am. She returned home from work at 10.30am and found Ibrahim lounging in a chair with the infant resting on his chest, Seattle PI reports. She changed her clothes then went to pick up her baby only to find the child's face distorted and her body cold to the touch. She then rushed to a nearby relative's home for help. After obtaining a search warrant, investigators arrested Ibrahim and described him as being 'on something' saying his speech was slurred and he repeatedly nodded off. Ibrahim described the infant as an 'aggressive child' and blamed the deceased 8-month-old for picking a fight with his two-year-old daughter who, he said, caused the infant's injuries by kicking and hitting her, KOMO News reports. Investigators believe that the infant died shortly after Ibrahim beat her with an X-Box controller. Ibrahim denied drinking alcohol to police, but bottles of liquor were found in the home, Seattle PI reports. Ibrahim also denied abusing his children. However, the child's mother confessed that Ibrahim has a history of beating both her and their three children, KOMO reports. He reportedly beat the children with cords and hangers often, and even forcefully squeezes their lips shut when they cry. Ibrahim was arrested Monday and charged Thursday with second-degree murder. He is being held at the Norm Maleng Regional Justice Center in Kent with bail set at $1 million.","Ahmed Ibrahim, 26, has been charged with murder for allegedly beating his 8-month-old daughter to death with an X-Box controller .

"Lost for words: Mr Justice Mostun, pictured, said the couple wasted money on a number of experts . A High Court judge has told a couple that their £920,000 divorce was a waste of time and money after they spent nearly a third of their multi-million pound fortune on legal fees. The businessman and his wife, known only as J and J, ran up the extortionate bills paying for lawyers and experts to advise them on the division of  nearly £3million in joint assets. It meant the 54-year-old man was left with a share of the estate that was worth  £841,500 - nearly £200,000 less than the amount spent on their lawyers. His wife, 44, received roughly £1,120,000. The 'eye-watering' sum prompted Mr Justice Mostyn, who analysed the case, to call for reforms that will set a 'costs cap' on what lawyers can charge their clients. The judge said the time had come for law-makers to 'do something' about excess litigation costs run up by couples arguing over who should get what. He called for change in a written ruling after analysing the businessman's case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in Manchester. He said: 'I must confess to have been almost lost for words when the scale of this madness was revealed to me.' The couple, who have two teenage children, started living together in the mid-1990s and separated in 2011 after being together for 18 years. The costs of the case started to rise when the couple spent £150,000 employing forensic accountants to value the man's market gardening business. The couple commissioned so many reports that they presented the court with a total of 12 files. Mr Justice Mostyn said the spending transformed a case that was 'surely so easily settleable' into one that was 'almost impossible to compromise'. He said he had presided over a seven-day trial where the 'principal focus' had been a 'bitter war of recrimination and denunciation about who was more at fault for this appalling state of affairs'. And he concluded that the woman should get assets worth just over £1 million and the man, who had spent £182,000 more on costs that his estranged wife, just under £900,000 worth of assets. He added: 'Such a result should not be allowed to happen again,' before calling for two measures to be introduced - a costs cap and a fixed pricing for cases. Reform: The judge said the time had come for law-makers to 'do something' about excess legal costs. Above, Manchester Civil Justice Centre, which houses the Family Division of the High Court in Manchester . He said: 'Law-makers must stop saying something must be done and actually do something.' He said that the court should be able to impose a 'costs cap' at the 'very beginning of the case' on 'what may be charged by the lawyers to their client. He said a cap could be varied if there was a 'big change' in circumstances. He added that under current rules the power of the court to controlled such fees is 'very limited'. Mr Justice Mostyn also supported legislation that would allow a client to demand a fixed price for a case. This would mark a change in the payment structure as clients are currently charged per hour. He said he hoped that it might help bring down the number of people who appeared in court representing themselves. He said: 'If a litigant on the cusp of self-representation knew at the start of the case how much it was going to cost for each phase then he may well opt for representation.' He concluded: ''In my opinion only if these two steps are taken will the grotesque leaching of costs, such as has occurred in this case, be arrested.'","Couple paid for lawyers and experts to advise on division of £3.2million .

"A passenger and his family were thrown off a commercial airliner in Nepal’s capital after he allegedly slapped a cabin crew member during a row. The scuffle occurred just before the SpiceJet plane was scheduled to fly frustrated passengers from Kathmandu to New Delhi, India following a five-hour flight delay. Both sides are denying blame as the 67-year-old man, identified as PK Maheshwari, claims the cabin crew member struck his foot, while the Indian low-cost airline alleges he assaulted the woman. SpiceJet claims a passenger slapped a cabin crew member following a lengthy delay in Kathmandu . As the situation escalated the pilot intervened and ordered the man, his 62-year-old wife and a nine-year-old family member to leave the Boeing 737. According to the Times of India, Mr Maheshwari, from the New Delhi suburb of Greater Kailash, filed a complaint that claims he fell asleep and was suddenly jolted awake by a flight attendant. He wrote: ‘The stewardess had hit my foot with considerable force, though the aisle of the aircraft was clear. ‘(She) started shouting at me that my foot was in the aisle.’ The man denies slapping the woman and claims she struck his foot while he was asleep . He denies slapping the woman but admits that he was involved in a ‘sharp exchange of words’ which led to his wife apologising on his behalf. Mr Maheshwari, who is seeking compensation and an apology, said the airline threatened to call the police if the family did not disembark. A SpiceJet spokesman told the Times of India that a passenger slapped the employee in front of other travellers. The spokesman added: ‘There is zero tolerance of this kind of physical abuse of crew anywhere in the world, including India and therefore the captain made the decision he did, which is fully within his authority, is backed by relevant regulations and is fully supported by management.’ After leaving the plane, Mr Maheshwari said he could not afford to buy new plane tickets, so he and his wife and the child made the long journey home on a 30-hour bus ride.","SpiceJet says the incident occurred before the plane was due to depart .

"Lying in the shadow of Westminster, the exclusive Dolphin Square estate has been home to politicians, foreign dignitaries, spies and escorts. Now detectives are probing claims that the prestigious Pimlico block was also the site of sordid 'sex parties' involving the horrific, violent abuse of young children. Hosted by MPs, spy chiefs and senior figures in the military and law enforcement, the parties allegedly saw youths – mainly boys – 'shared' among paedophiles. Detectives are probing claims that the Dolphin Square estate in Westminster was also the site of sordid 'sex parties' One victim, who alleges two well-known Tory politicians raped and physically beat him, recalls being taken to the famous square around ten times from the age of 11. He says he was raped while his head was held underwater in a bath by a 'sadistic' former Cabinet minister, while a second former MP cut boys with a knife. Another of the abusers, known as the Doctor, is said to have treated any injuries. The victim, known only as Nick, described how chauffeur-driven cars would pick up boys from school and drop them off at apartments, where they were plied with whiskey before being subjected to unspeakable acts. 'Some of [the abusers] were quite open about who they were,' he said. 'They had no fear at all of being caught, it didn't cross their mind.' Sir Peter Hayman was caught with paedophile literature in 1978 and fined for gross indecency in 1984, pictured with Lady Hayman . Earlier this month, Nick told investigative website Exaro that a shamed top diplomat and MI6 chief was among the group who raped him. Exaro said the victim had picked out a photo of Sir Peter Hayman as one of his abusers at Dolphin Square. Hayman was caught with paedophile literature in 1978 and fined for gross indecency in 1984. He was a key member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, a vile pressure group that advocated legalising sex between adults and children. The spy chief, who died in 1992 aged 78, had been a pillar of the Establishment. He held a number of top jobs at the Home Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and even Nato. A number of witnesses have claimed they were between 11 and 13 when they were first taken to parties at the riverside block . At one point, Dolphin Square was home to up to 70 MPs and around 10 lords, pictured is the spa . Nick, who is now in his 40s, said his ordeal suddenly came to an end when he went to a pre-arranged place to be picked up by a driver and no-one arrived. He has given the names of those he believes were involved in the abuse ring to the police and the BBC, in the hope of encouraging others to come forward. A number of witnesses have claimed they were between 11 and 13 when they were first taken to parties at the riverside block, which houses 1,250 flats and is just a short walk from the House of Commons. At one point, Dolphin Square was home to up to 70 MPs and around 10 lords. Former inhabitants include Harold Wilson, David Steel and William Hague – although none of them are suspected of any wrongdoing. Call girls Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, who earned infamy for their involvement in the Profumo affair, were both sub-tenants. The exclusive Westminster estate houses 1,250 flats and is just a short walk from the House of Commons . It boasts an award-winning spa, squash courts and a shopping mall within the luxury complex . Ian Fleming's spy chief 'M' was partially based on Maxwell Knight, a senior intelligence figure who was another long-term resident. Number 308 Hood House was reportedly used by an MI5 group aiming to infiltrate potentially subversive groups from 1924 to 1946. The square was also home to Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, who lived there with his wife, Mitford sister Diana, until he was jailed in 1940. 'Lord Haw-Haw' William Joyce, the Second World War German propagandist, also lived there before he was executed for treason. It is rumoured that agents from both sides of the Iron Curtain lived there too. In 1962 tenant John Vassall, an Admiralty clerk, was exposed as a Soviet spy.

"A couple have vowed to make their family homeless before Christmas in a bid to raise £160,000 to fund life-saving treatment for their daughter. Frankie-Rose Lea has been given just weeks to live, after doctors originally misdiagnosed an aggressive brain tumour as growing pains. The seven-year-old's tumour has tripled in size and spread to her spine since she started chemotherapy in August. Experts have told Michelle and Sam Lea their daughter's best chance of surviving is travelling to the US for proton beam therapy. Michelle and Sam Lea, pictured with their sons Alfie, right and Freddie, left, have vowed to make their family homeless in a bid to raise £160,000 to fund life-saving cancer treatment for their daughter Frankie-Rose, centre, after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour . The couple have put their terraced home in Erith, Kent, left, on the market and are desperate to sell it within the week, to fund proton beam therapy treatment in the US. Since having chemotherapy Frankie's brain tumour has tripled in size and spread to her spine, leaving doctors to predict she won't live until Christmas . Mr and Mrs Lea had planned to cancel their August wedding, after Frankie-Rose, was diagnosed the same month. But the seven-year-old told her parents she was desperate to be a bridesmaid . Applying for the treatment, sought by the family of Ashya King, on the NHS will take up to eight weeks - time Frankie-Rose does not have. Her tumour is growing so fast, doctors do not expect her to live to see Christmas Day. Mr and Mrs Lea, who also have two sons, Alfie, 11, and Freddie, five, have put their three-bedroom home in Erith, Kent, on the  market in a desperate bid to raise the £160,000 needed to fund the treatment. They said the terraced property is worth £220,000 but are marketing it at £170,000 to try and attract a cash buyer, to encourage a quick sale. The couple said they are prepared to make their family homeless if it saves their daughter's life. Dinner lady Mrs Lea, 36, said: 'We are desperate. Right now all we can think about is getting Frankie to America for the treatment she needs to survive. 'We will live in a box if we need to as long as we are together. 'We have worked hard, our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her. ‘Some people might criticise us for making the family homeless when we have two other children but I would rather do that than have to tell her brothers we let Frankie die. 'What choice do we have ? If we wait for NHS funding it will probably be too late.’ Frankie-Rose began complaining of pain in her legs in May this year. Mrs Lea said: ‘Frankie-Rose said her legs were aching, so I told her to rest. 'Like most kids her age she was always on the go but when it got worse I took her to the doctor who said it was just growing pain.’ Doctors have told the family Frankie-Rose may not live until Christmas. To apply for proton beam therapy on the NHS takes around eight weeks - time the youngster doesn't have . Mrs Lea said: 'We will live in a box if we need to, as long as we are together. We have worked hard, our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her.' Frankie-Rose is pictured, right with a children's entertainer dressed up as Elsa from Frozen, at her seventh birthday party in August . But in the weeks that followed, Mrs Lea noticed her daughter falling over and bruises appearing on her legs. She went back to the GP and said she was told this time that Frankie-Rose was flat footed which was causing her balance problems. But unconvinced Mrs Lea took her daughter back again and says she was advised to take her for an eye test and again told it was growing pain. When her daughter’s pain got worse she arranged further visits and said on the sixth occasion she was annoyed to have been booked to see a locum GP. ‘I felt he wouldn’t know my daughter and made that clear,' she said. Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. The radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy. Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body. It enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely. The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues. The treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours, including those found in the head and neck, eye, central nervous system, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal tract. The precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs, such as the eye, brain and spinal cord. Source: Mayo Clinic . 'But to my surprise he was the first to perform a basic neurological test by asking Frankie to follow his finger with her eyes. 'She couldn’t do it and he told me to get straight to hospital for an MRI scan.’ At Darent Valley Hospital in Kent, an MRI revealed a dangerous build up of fluid on the little girl’s brain and she was sent by ambulance to Kings College Hospital in London for urgent surgery the following morning. The operation on July 18 revealed a mass on her brain stem was causing the build up. Mrs Lea said: ‘I was shocked. You never think it will happen to you. 'But at the same time I had known all along it was something more serious than growing pains.' The following week a biopsy revealed the tumour was cancerous and on August 4 the devastated couple were told the rare nature of high grade Astrocytoma giloma’s in children made it hard to predict how she would respond to treatment. But the position on the brain stem made it impossible to operate on and medics hoped to stabilise it with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy when she was older and her brain more developed. Mr and Mrs Lea were due to marry later that month on August 23 and Mrs Lea originally wanted to call off the wedding they had booked back in January but Frankie was desperate to be a bridesmaid. ‘We’d been so busy in hospital that I hadn’t arranged the cars or wedding shoes, it was the last thing on my mind but doctors advised us to go ahead with the wedding because Frankie was well enough and she was looking forward to it,’ Mrs Lea said. But first Frankie turned seven on August 15 and the family hastily arranged a huge party, not knowing if it would be her last. Two weeks later the couple married surrounded by family and friends. Frankie revelling in her role as chief bridesmaid. Mrs Lea said: ‘It was all about her, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house because nobody knew what the future held. ‘She had lost some of her hair because of the surgery but she looked so beautiful.’ Doctors misdiagnosed Frankie'Rose's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer . The family have also set up a fundraising page to raise money for Frankie-Rose's treatment . Frankie-Rose started chemotherapy two days later but suffered terrible side effects, including nausea, weight loss and a bleed on the brain. And when medics scanned her last week the tumour was found to have tripled in size and spread to her spine. That is when Mr and Mrs Lea were told proton beam therapy offered the best chance of saving her life and there was no time to waste. The family set up a fundraising page and well wishers have already pledged more than £20,000 - but the family need to raise a further £140,00 for treatment and travel in the next week. They put their house on the market for £170,000 this week and say making themselves homeless will be a small price to save their daughter’s life. ‘It would be nice to have a home to come back to after America, but nothing is more important than saving Frankie,' Mrs Lea said. Donations have been flooding in, and a second page has been set up to help accept money from the public. To help Frankie-Rose visit the new fundraising page here.

"Britain's ageing House of Lords has just two peers under the age of 40, but 29 members who have turned 90, new analysis reveals. Amid fresh debate over whether peers should be axed in favour of an elected chamber, new figures show more than half of its members are over 70.

Scroll down for video . There are just two peers in their thirties, but 29 or are 90 years old or older, new analysis shows . Campaigners argue the need for reform has grown as political parties have packed it with more and more members. The average age for men in the UK is 38 and women 40, according to the 2011 Census. But the average age in the House of Lords is well over 70. It means that half the population is aged under 40, and not represented in the upper house of Parliament. Just 16 per cent of people in the UK is aged over 65, but more than half of the Lords are over 70. The figures were compiled by Lord Tyler, a former Lib Dem MP and supporter for Lords reform. Writing for MailOnline, he warned: 'The Lords gets bigger, staler and less legitimate with each passing day.' While some peers worked hard to improve the nation's law-making, 'there are also quite a lot of mediocre people picking up £300 a day (tax-free!) just for turning up and shuffling off,' he claimed. 'No amount of flummery about what 'noble' Lords they are makes up for it and for a century liberals have been attempting to stop the rot.' The oldest peer is former Labour Chancellor Lord Healey (97) and the youngest is David Cameron's Big Society tsar Lord Wei (37) Businesswoman and Apprentice star Karren Brady, aged 45,  joined the House of Lords as a Tory peer this month . Labour leader Ed Miliband this month unveiled his own plans to abolish the upper chamber and replace it with an elected senate. He said that he wants to ensure the new body properly represents all the towns, cities, regions and nations that make up the United Kingdom. But the plans drew an angry response from the Liberal Democrats who bitterly accused Labour of joining with Conservative MPs to wreck their plans to reform the Lords two years ago. The Lib Dems argue the coalition committed to Lords reform when it was formed in 2010, but the Tories failed to deliver. According to the figures, there are no peers in their twenties and just two in their thirties. The youngest peer is Conservative Lord Wei, 37, a former adviser to David Cameron who championed the Big Society. The oldest is Lord Healey, the former Labour Chancellor and deputy leader, who turned 97 in August. Labour leader Ed Miliband this month called for reform of the Lords, but is accused of blocking a previous attempt to replace it with an elected senate . The largest group are the peers in their seventies, numbering 290 in total, followed by the sixty-somethings (249) and those in their eighties (136). Labour has said that it would summon a constitutional convention early in the next parliament to consider how an elected senate would be established - including whether it could have specific regional representation functions. Each region of England, as well as the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, would hold meetings before the convention where people would be asked for views on the functions of the new body, as well as the most appropriate form of election. But Lord Tyler accused Mr Miliband of forgetting that 'it was he who played party games with right-wing Tory MPs to torpedo' plans for reform. 'Without his shameless, spineless partisanship in 2012, British citizens would be preparing to choose the first elected members of the Lords in just seven months' time,' Lord Tyler added. Lib Dem peer Lord Tyler warned that the Lords gets bigger, staler and less legitimate with each passing day . Statisticians have discovered one sliver of society in which octogenarians substantially outnumber those in their forties. It's one half of Parliament and London's best day centre for the elderly – the House of Lords. An appointment to the Lords is a job-for-life given disproportionately to those who live long and well. The result: the average age remains stubbornly over 70. Even with 183 new appointments since 2010, and a stonking 408 under Brown and Blair, there are only 32 members of the Lords under fifty, but still 165 over eighty. 29 of them are in their nineties while only two are a day under forty! Plenty of peers seriously decide whether or not to challenge the government in close votes based on whether doing so will affect their plans for dinner. Of course there are a lot good people working very hard: I know many of them. But there are also quite a lot of mediocre people picking up £300 a day (tax-free!) just for turning up and shuffling off. No amount of flummery about what 'noble' Lords they are makes up for it and for a century liberals have been attempting to stop the rot. Yet Ed Miliband burst out of his paper bag last week to discover the urgency of reform as though he stood at the very beginning of history, with nothing behind him. He wants the Lords to be 'truly a Senate of the Regions and Nations of our whole country.' What a good idea! The Coalition Cabinet proposed exactly that in a Government Bill just two years ago. Ed seems to have forgotten that it was HE who played party games with right-wing Tory MPs to torpedo it. No more able to lead his party than a rat could herd cats, he decided to take a cheap shot at Nick Clegg – the one thing Labour MPs all agree they like doing. Knowing he would sink the best chance of democracy for decades, Ed piously claimed to support reform 'in principle' but refused outright to back ANY timetable motion to get it through the Commons. Without his shameless, spineless partisanship in 2012, British citizens would be preparing to choose the first elected members of the Lords in just seven months' time. Why should anyone believe he is serious now? Labour promised democracy for the Lords again and again in their manifestos in 1997, 2001 and 2005. With big red Labour single-party majorities of 179, 167 and 66 – over thirteen long years – all they produced was bookshelves full of committee and commission reports. Miliband could list his manifold failings in the dust they all gathered. The record is clear. The Lords gets bigger, staler and less legitimate with each passing day. Yet when it comes to the crunch, Labour leaders always choose their right to plonk pensionable donors and trade unionists into Parliament over the right of the people to choose their legislators. Miliband has already shown that for him, as for his predecessors, patronage trumps principle. Given half a chance, he will again.

Running wild: A lioness at Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio has her work cut out after giving birth to three cubs . Exhausting work: First-time mother Imani, who had been on 24-hour baby watch since Saturday, finally welcomed her litter late Thursday . Happy family: The first cub emerged at 3:33pm and its siblings arrived around two hours later . Video footage of the new cat family shows Imani cleaning her cubs as they crawl all over her in an off-exhibit den area. A keeper from Cincinnati Zoo says that the new mother appears to be 'doing all the right things.' 'The cubs are active and alert and everything is moving in a positive direction,' they added. In the wild, a lion mother would keep her cubs secluded in a sheltered location. Similarly, Imani will stay with her cubs in a private den area until next spring. Proud parents: Three-year-old Imani was introduced to the zoo’s male lion, four-year-old John, earlier this year and they made for 'excellent companions' Babies on the way: Imani showed signs of being pregnant in the weeks prior to giving birth and hormone tests indicated a pregnancy . Imani showed signs of being pregnant in the weeks prior to giving birth and hormone tests confirmed suspicions. Keepers and scientists at the zoo celebrated the delivery, as it has been almost 15 years since the last set of African lion cubs were born at the center. The gestation period for lions averages three to four months, and litter size is usually two to six. Three-year-old Imani was born at the St. Louis Zoo in Missouri and was transferred to the Cincinnati Zoo as the result of a breeding recommendation. She was introduced to the zoo’s male lion, four-year-old John, earlier this year and they made for 'excellent companions.' Keepers will monitor the behavior of the inexperienced parents to determine when they will be reunited.","First-time mother Imani welcomed her litter late Thursday .

"Special materials are going into the most colorful New York real estate development: 3,550 pounds of royal icing, 700 pounds of candy and 600 pounds of dough. That's what Manhattan chef Jon Lovitch needs to build a gingerbread village complete with houses, trees, a skating rink, a hotel and even an underground subway station. Lovitch holds the Guinness record for the world's largest collection of gingerbread houses. And he's now going for another record - competing against himself by assembling 1,020 new ones before Thanksgiving. Scroll down for video . Gut-busting: Some of the gingerbread house creations by chef Jon Lovitch are displayed at the New York Hall of Science - 3,550 pounds of  icing, 700 pounds of candy and 600 pounds of dough was used in the process . He's been busy building since January at his Bronx home, where 'the kitchen and dining room look like Betty Crocker came in and went psychedelic,' he said, laughing. 'It's pretty insane.' On Thursday, he was at the New York Hall of Science in the Queens section of the city expanding the 2.5-ton, 480-square-foot village he designed, baked and built. 'I'm challenging myself, but I'd welcome other challenges if someone else in the world is doing this!' the chef said as he carried an armful of houses to add to the saccharine property he calls Gingerbread Lane. He transports the fragile items in his car trunk, on their sides and cushioned on a blanket. Sweet tooth: Lovitch, a Manhattan chef, holds the Guinness record for creating the world's largest collection of gingerbread houses . One step further: He is now going for another record, competing against himself by assembling more than 1,000 new ones - Independent inspectors are to evaluate it and report to Guinness . Lovitch was recognized by the 2014 Guinness World Records for last year's production - 157 houses. So far this year, he's made 900. The public will get a first look at the village on Friday, displayed on a circular platform under a skylight that brings sunny weather to the uninhabited community. 'My village is designed to look like ""the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse,""' he recited, quoting Clement Clarke Moore's famed children's poem, A Visit from St. Nicholas. A plexiglass barrier will keep children's fingers away from the enticing clusters of gingerbread architecture. Independent inspectors are to evaluate it and report to Guinness. In transit: Lovitch transports the fragile items in his car trunk, on their sides and cushioned on a blanket . Living the dream: He's not paid for his 'passion' - he made his first house when he was  a sweet 16 . To be eligible, every ingredient must be edible. But the zany lineup doesn't come with a nutrition label because it's not meant to be eaten. The nearly 5,000 pounds of self-funded ingredients could fill a truck. Lovitch buys them wherever they're cheapest. At $1.19 a pound, sugar in Pennsylvania beats the $2.29 he encountered in New York. He's not paid for what he calls his 'passion.' Now 38, he made his first house when he was - well, a sweet 16. Lovitch earns his living as executive chef at Manhattan's famed Algonquin Hotel where Dorothy Parker once ruled over her literary Round Table. Lovitch is planning the hotel's Thanksgiving menu, with 60 of his gingerbread houses for decoration.

"Americans are quitting their jobs at the fastest rate since before the economic crash. And analysts are overjoyed. The sharp spike in the 'quits rate' means workers feel more optimistic about finding a new job on the market. Other data on Thursday showed the number of new jobless claims rose last week but remained near a 14-year low, and the two readings suggested the U.S. labor market was moving toward full health. Good sign: Analysts say workers were afraid to leave their jobs but the recent spike will force employers to offer competitive wages to retain talent. Around 2.8 million workers left their jobs in September . Two percent of U.S. job-holders, or about 2.8 million workers, left their jobs under their own volition in September, the Labor Department said - a dramatic rise in comparison with recent months and years, as detailed in a graph by Vox. It means employers, who have not had to raise wages to retain talent, may be forced to boost salaries. Secondly, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has signaled the quits rate as an indicator she is following on her 'dashboard' for assessing progress in the labor market's recovery. The report follows figures last week that showed employers added 214,000 jobs in October after a 256,000 advance the prior month that was larger than first estimated. The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, the lowest level since July 2008, from 5.9 percent the prior month. The October data lifted the monthly average employment gain so far in 2014 to 228,500, which would mark the strongest year since employers added an average 264,750 per month in 1999. Across the entire year, 5.03 million employees were added to staff, boosting the hiring rate to 3.6 percent and matching July's reading as the strongest since December 2007, the Labor Department reported today. 'The good news in this report is really the fact that there's more fluidity in the labor market, more activity there,' said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. Optimism: Workers feel optimistic that they can leave their job and find another, the Labor Department says . 'People are ready to take more risks and seek jobs elsewhere.' In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to 290,000 for the week ended Nov. 8. That was a bigger increase than expected, but claims have now been below 300,000 for nine straight weeks, suggesting firms are well past a cycle of elevated layoffs that began in the recession. 'This increase is nothing to worry about,' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 'Claims can remain close to their current trend for an extended period.' Yields on U.S. government debt were little changed following the publication of the two Labor Department reports.","2.8 million (2%) U.S. workers left their jobs voluntarily in September .

"A masked gunman broke into the home of multi-millionaire businessman Robert Stiff and attacked his wife and daughters . A masked gunman who broke into the home of a multi-millionaire entrepreneur and forced his wife and daughter to hand over their jewels, was at the centre of a manhunt. Robert Stiff's wife, Catherine, and one of his two daughters, aged in her 20s, were left needing hospital treatment after their £5 million home was targeted by the 'dangerous and violent' robber. The intruder, who was armed with a sawn off shotgun, punched Mrs Stiff, aged in her 50s, in the face. Mr Stiff's other daughter, also aged in her 20s, who was also in the property at the time, was left shaken, but uninjured. As well the expensive gems  the robber escaped with the contents of the family safe. Police think the raider smashed his way in through the back of the six bedroom property in Epsom, Surrey. They believe he staked out the gated mansion, that backs onto Kingswood Golf and Country Club, for a number of days before caring out the raid. Detective Inspector Paul Gordon, leading the hunt, said: 'The offender is clearly a dangerous and violent individual who will go to great lengths to get what he wants. 'Although the investigation is still in the early stages, it is believed this was a targeted offence and it may be possible that the offender had carried out visits to the area prior to the burglary.' African-born Mr Stiff is best known as the founder and former managing director of the leading healthcare recruitment company Team24. He sold the company for in excess of £25 million three years ago to The Capita Group. The entrepreneur is a patron of the Prince's Trust and now spends a lot of time mentoring people and businesses throughout the UK. Neighbours on the upmarket estate said the raid on the 'lovely family' had left everyone terrified. 'The family are in a terrible state after this terrible shocking incident,' said one, who declined to be named. 'It was really violent and they are in trauma.' Another added: 'Everyone is terrified until this man is caught.' The Stiff family told police that the raider was a white man, about 6ft 4in and of stocky build. He was wearing a balaclava, black jacket and black leather gloves, and spoke with a London accent. Anyone with information about the robbery on Wednesday, November 12, at 5.45pm was asked to call Surrey Police on 101. The businessman's mansion was said to back onto Kingswood Golf and Country Club which is pictured in this aerial image .","Home of businessman Robert Stiff targeted by masked gunman .

"After two years of popping . up at high-profile events sporting  Google Glass, the gadget . that transforms eyeglasses into spy-movie worthy technology, . Google co-founder Sergey Brin sauntered bare-faced into a . Silicon Valley red-carpet event on Sunday. He'd left his pair in the car, Brin told a reporter. However, it has emerged that the consumer version, which Google promised would go on sale this year, has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future. Scroll down for video . Where's the Glass? Sergey Brin was spotted without Google's specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event on Sunday. Since they were unveiled, he has rarely been seen without them. The . Googler, who heads up the top-secret lab which developed Glass, . has hardly given up on the product - he recently wore his pair . to the beach. But Brin's timing is not propitious, coming as many . developers and early Glass users are losing interest in the . much-hyped, $1,500 test version of the product: a camera, . processor and stamp-sized computer screen mounted to the edge of . eyeglass frames. Google itself has pushed back the . Glass roll out to the mass market. While Glass may find some specialized, even lucrative, uses . in the workplace, its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in . the near future are slim, many developers say. Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that . they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, . mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the . device. Three more have switched to developing for business, . leaving behind consumer projects. However, plenty of larger developers remain with Glass. The nearly . 100 apps on the official web site include Facebook and . OpenTable, although one major player recently defected: Twitter. Google founder Sergey Brin (L) and designer Diane von Furstenberg sit and watch the rehearsal for her Spring/Summer 2013 collection show during New York Fashion Week, where  new Google Glass frameswere launched in a bid to make them more appealing. Glass was the first project to emerge from Google's X division, the secretive group tasked with developing 'moonshot'products such as self-driving cars. Glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology, as smartphones once were,that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clickswith consumers. 'If there was 200 million Google Glasses sold, it would be a . different perspective,' said Tom Frencel, the Chief Executive of Little Guy Games, which put development of a Glass game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms, including the Facebook Inc-owned virtual-reality goggles Oculus Rift. 'There's no market at this point,' Several key Google employees instrumental to developing . Glass have left the company in the last six months, including . lead developer Babak Parviz, electrical engineering chief Adrian . Wong, and Ossama Alami, director of developer relations. And a Glass funding consortium created by Google Ventures . and two of Silicon Valley's biggest venture capitalists, Kleiner . Perkins Caufield & Byers and Andreessen Horowitz, quietly . deleted its website, routing users to the main Glass site. Google insists it is committed to Glass, with hundreds of . engineers and executives working on it, as well as new . fashionista boss Ivy Ross, a former Calvin Klein executive. 'We are completely energized and as energized as ever about . the opportunity that wearables and Glass in particular . represent,' said Glass Head of Business Operations Chris . O'Neill. 'We are as committed as ever to a consumer launch. 'That is . going to take time and we are not going to launch this product . until it's absolutely ready,' O'Neill said. Google has created several designer frames in a bid to make Glass more attractive . Brin had predicted a launch this year, but 2015 is now the . most likely date, a person familiar with the matter said. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers . are giving up on Glass have been building. Some developers recently have felt unsupported by investors . and, at times, Google itself. The Glass Collective, the funding consortium co-run by . Google Ventures, invested in only three or four small start-ups . by the beginning of this year, a person familiar with the . statistics said. A Google Ventures spokeswoman declined to comment on the . number of investments and said the Web site was closed for . simplicity. 'We just found it's easier for entrepreneurs to come . to us directly,' she said. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users . as 'Explorers.' But as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew . stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of . surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy . intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as 'Glassholes.' 'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Glass now sells on eBay for as little as half list price. The lack of a launch date has given some developers the . impression that Google still treats Glass as an experiment. 'It's not a big enough platform to play on seriously,' said . Matthew Milan, founder of Toronto-based software firm Normative . Design, which put on hold a Glass app for logging exercise and . biking. Mobile game company Glu Mobile, known for its . popular 'Kim Kardashian: Hollywood' title, was one of the first . to launch a game on Glass. Spellista, a puzzler released a year . ago, is still available, but Glu has discontinued work on it, a . spokesman for the company said. Another developer, Sean McCracken, won $10,000 in a contest . last year for creating an aliens-themed video game for Glass, . Psyclops, but Google never put it on the official hub for Glass . apps, making it tougher to find. He has quit working on updates. Still, there are some enthusiastic developers. Cycling and . running app Strava finds Glass well-suited for its users, who . want real-time data on their workouts, said David Lorsch, vice . president of business development. And entrepreneur Jake . Steinerman said it is ideal for his company, DriveSafe, which . detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel. In April, Google launched the Glass at Work program to help . make the device useful for specific industries, such as . healthcare and manufacturing. So far the effort has resulted in . apps that are being tested or used at companies such as Boeing . and Yum Brands' Taco Bell. Google is selling Glass in bulk to some businesses, offering . two-for-one discounts.","Sergey Brin appeared in San Francisco without trademark specs .

"Google’s French arm has been told it will have to pay a 1,000 euro fine every day should the parent company in America – Google Inc - fail to remove a defamatory article from its global network. The order, by a court in Paris, is an enforcement of the controversial so-called ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling. The case was brought against Google by Dan Shefet, a Danish lawyer employed in France, last August following a malicious campaign against his firm by various blogs and sites that was overseen by someone who couldn’t be traced. Google’s French arm has been told it will have to pay a 1,000 euro fine every day should the parent company in America – Google Inc - fail to remove a defamatory article from its global network . Google France complied with an order for links to the defamatory articles to be removed, but the U.S parent company did not, The Guardian reported. This means that the articles are not visible to internet users in France, but are to anyone based outside the country. Mr Shefet said that it was important for the parent company to remove the articles from its entire network because his firm has a global reputation. He said: ‘Google France complied, but in spite of serving judgment on Google Inc nothing happened. They simply didn’t comply and didn’t even respond to the French court order.’ The latest judgement by the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance was made possible, Mr Shefet explained, by a clause in the right to be forgotten ruling that links divisions in multinational companies. It says: 'The activities of the operator of the search engine and those of its establishment situated in the member state concerned are inextricably linked.' The order is a punitive one and opens the door for other Google subsidiaries to be sued should the parent company ignore requests for defamatory articles to be wiped off the network. Mr Shefet added: ‘Now a daily penalty can be inflicted upon Google UK by local courts until Google Inc delivers the result by way of [removing links] world wide.’ The case was brought against Google by Dan Shefet, a Danish lawyer employed in France, last August following a malicious campaign against his firm by various blogs and sites that was overseen by someone who couldn’t be traced . A Google spokesman told The Guardian: ‘A Google spokesperson said: “This was initially a defamation case and it began before the CJEU ruling on the right to be forgotten. We are reviewing the ruling and considering our options.’ This week Sajid Javid warned that terrorists are exploiting the right to be forgotten rule to wipe stories about their trials from Google in a move that amounts to censorship by the back door. The Culture Secretary condemned ‘Luxembourg’s unelected judges’ who created the rule. In a forthright speech to newspaper editors, Mr Javid accused European courts of ‘trying to restrict media freedom’ and took aim at the BBC for competing with news websites like MailOnline. Last month it emerged Google has deleted more than 18,000 web links following requests from UK Requests from Britain included a former clergyman who wanted to remove links to articles about a sex abuse investigation and a doctor who botched a medical procedure. Google said it deleted 35 per cent, or 18,459, of the unwanted links Britons requested be removed. Mr Javid said the scale of the attempts to remove links to news stories was a threat to journalism. ‘Since Luxembourg’s unelected judges created the so-called “right to be forgotten”, Google has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds,’ he told the Society of Editors conference in Southampton. ‘Each day, a thousand requests pour in from people who, for one reason or another, would prefer their pasts to be kept secret. ‘Criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other, similar crimes. ‘Terrorists have ordered Google to cover up stories about their trials.’","The order by a Paris court enforces the 'right to be forgotten' rule .

"Two patients died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm, it was revealed today. Darren Hughes, 42, and Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were each given a kidney from a transplant donor who was carrying the deadly worm in his organs when he died. Health bosses have confirmed the 'unique and tragic case' is being investigated after both patients died within three weeks of the kidney transplants. Darren Hughes, 42, and Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, died after given the kidneys from a transplant donor infected with a parasitic worm . Doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as Halicephalobus, which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes began to 'deteriorate rapidly' after their surgery and died less than three weeks later. The two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection. Halicephalobus is a parasitic worm which lives in soil and is found in horses. It is just 1mm long. The two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection. Mr Stuart, of Cardiff, and Mr Hughes, of Bridgend, had kidney transplants in November 2013 but both died before Christmas. A post-mortem examination revealed they both died from infection called Meningeoencephaltis which was caused by the parasitic worm . Their families are now taking legal action and an inquest is due to be held next week into their deaths. Their solicitor Julie Lewis, medical negligence expert at legal firm Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The families are both desperately seeking answers as to how these tragedies could have happened and what measures should have been taken to ensure the patients safety. 'They have serious concerns about the information they have heard so far about what happened and hope that the inquest will provide them with answers to the many questions they have about the circumstances leading up to the deaths.' Miss Lewis added: 'There have only been five reported cases in the world of people diagnosed with the infection, all have been fatal. 'The donor of the kidneys died from the same infection.' The transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff . Ruth Walker, Director of Nursing at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: 'This is a unique and tragic case and everyone at the health board extends their sincere and heartfelt sympathies to the families involved. 'The health board requested its own independent, external review to establish why these patients died. 'That report has been provided to the coroner's office and we continue to support his investigation into these tragic deaths. It would be in appropriate to comment further ahead of the inquest.' They are taking advice from specialist medical negligence lawyers in the hope it 'will provide much-needed answers about how their loved ones died'. Investigations have been carried out by University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, NHS Blood and Transplant and Public Health England and Public Health Wales.","Doctors not aware donor had the worm - known as Halicephalobus - when the transplants were carried at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff .

"A hunk of raw meat found inside a passenger’s luggage set off alarm bells for TSA agents in California last week, leading to an unexpected drug bust. Last Saturday, security agents at San Jose International Airport contacted the local police department about a suspicious package discovered inside a suitcase being checked onto an Alaska Airlines flight. Officers who responded to the scene examined the object, which turned out to be vacuum-sealed raw meat. Unexpected filling: TSA agents at San Jose International Airport discovered 3lbs of cocaine in shrink-wrapped stuffed inside a hunk of raw meat during a routine luggage inspection . Inside, police found 3lbs of cocaine divided among three shrink-wrapped bundles. The suspect, identified by CBS San Francisco as 24-year-old Salvador Zamaya, was promptly removed from his flight and taken into custody. Zamaya was traveling from San Jose to Seattle, and the drugs were discovered during a routine luggage inspection. Zamaya has been charged with possession of narcotics with the intent to distribute and drug trafficking. The meat-encased cocaine has been seized as evidence by police. Amazingly, this is not the first - nor the second - time that raw meat has been used to transport drugs. In March, customs agents at JFK International Airport discovered more than 7lbs of cocaine stuffed inside three chunks of frozen goat meat stashed in a suitcase, according to published reports. Drug trafficking suspect Salvador Zamaya, 24, was traveling on an Alaska Airlines flight from San Jose to Seattle when he was arrested . As recently as last month, security officials at the Kuwaiti International Airport busted a Bangladeshi cleaning company worker with two kilos of marijuana packed inside a container of frozen meat. Drug mules seeking to avoid detection by police and airport security in the US and abroad have been forced to think outside the box, or in this instance, outside the suitcase, to transport their illegal wares in recent years. Inventive traffickers have been using anything, from dolls to canned pineapples to water barrels and printer cartridges, to smuggle narcotics around the world.","Salvador Zamaya, 24, charged with drug possession with intent to sell and trafficking .

"With Polaroid cameras facing a resurgence, especially among celebrities and the privacy conscious, Prynt’s phone case could not be launching at a more opportune time. The case turns digital images into physical photos at the touch of a button, without the need for a data connection. And the French firm is working on an augmented reality feature that will also play videos around printed shots. The Prynt is set to launch on Kickstarter early next year, and will cost $99 (£63). It will initially support 4-inch screens, but larger models will be released later. The prototype can only hold one piece of paper and takes 50 seconds to print but the firm claims its final version is expected to take 30 seconds and hold up to 30 sheets . Prynt has been designed by a French startup with the same name, led by Clement Perrot. Mr Perrot’s prototype version currently holds just one piece of paper and takes 50 seconds to print a photo. The photos are sent to the case using Bluetooth, which then prints them in a similar way to how traditional Polaroid cameras work, by mixing a reagent material with chemicals in the layers to form the final image. Prynt case is set to launch on Kickstarter early next year, and will cost $99 (£63). The firm has said this final version will print images in around 30 seconds, and will be able to hold up to 30 sheets of paper. The photos are sent to the case using Bluetooth, which then prints out the image in a similar way to how traditional Polaroid cameras work. When a photo is taken using Prynt, the app records seconds either side to capture a video. Holding up the photo to the camera, with the app open, plays the video on the screen . Sales of Polaroid cameras (pictured), which were particularly popular in the 1980s, have risen by around three quarters in the past year. The popularity of the retro camera has been attributed to people’s love of Instagram, as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices, including Lana Del Rey . It will initially support 4-inch screens, such as those seen on the iPhone 5S and 5C, but larger models will be released later. Instant camera film features layers of colours of light. These layers sit on top of a black base layer and beneath an image, timing and acid layer. When the shot is taken, a small amount of reagent material is rolled onto the film sheet, which reacts with chemicals in the film. These chemicals move downward through the layers, dissolving the developer dye so it moves towards the image layer. Metallic silver areas on each layer, which were exposed to light when the photo was taken, capture the dye so it is distributed throughout the photo, to match the colours of the scene photographed. The acid layer in the film reacts with the alkali and opacifiers in the reagent, making the opacifiers become clear, and this is what makes the image appear. Source: How Stuff Works . An extra feature, which Mr Perrot revealed to Kyle Russell at TechCrunch is an augmented reality tool, built into an app. When a photo is taken using Prynt, the app records seconds either side to capture a video. Holding up the photo to the phone’s camera, with the app open, plays the video on the screen. Sales of Polaroid cameras, which were particularly popular in the 1980s,  have risen by around three quarters in the past year. Kaley Cuoco, who stars in The Big Bang Theory recently declared: ‘Polaroids are the way to go. 'No one can get those.’ Her comments were made following a recent spate of iCloud leaks, which saw private photos of more than 100 celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton, leaked online. The popularity of the retro camera has also been attributed to people’s love of Instagram, as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices, including Lana Del Rey. A Polaroid photo, for example, forms the front cover of Taylor Swift’s new album, 1989, making the format fashionable again.","Prynt case is set to launch on Kickstarter next year, and will cost $99 (£63)

"An Idaho biology teacher landed in hot water after killing and skinning a rabbit in class to show students where their food comes from. Nampa School District spokeswoman Allison Westfall said the teacher restrained the rabbit and then killed it in front of 16 10th-graders by snapping its neck on November 6 at Columbia High School. The rabbit was also skinned and chopped up in front of the students. Harsh lesson: A 10th-grade biology teacher from Idaho got in trouble for killing, skinning and cutting up a rabbit in class to teach students where their food comes from . Place of learning: The rabbit-slaughtering demonstration took place at Columbia High School in Nampa, Idaho, on November 6 . Westfall explained that the graphic demonstration is not part of the biology curriculum. She said students who did not want to view the lesson were allowed to leave ahead of time. According to the district spokesperson, the biology teacher, who owns a farm where he raises cattle and other animals for meat, agreed to perform the demonstration after repeated requests from his students, reported the station KTVB. ‘The students had asked that the teacher do this demonstration, and when the rabbit was brought in, he gave the opportunity to students to not view the demonstration,’ Westfall said. Some of the teens who stayed for the display came away distraught, and the school received several complaints from parents who deemed it inappropriate to kill an animal in class. Not for the faint of heart: The display was not part of the curriculum, and students had the option to opt out . The teacher later apologized for subjecting his students to the gruesome demonstration. He is now facing disciplinary action. Ms Westfall said that the lesson was not approved by the school's administration. She suggested that some of the students who decided to stay and watch the demonstration may have not known what to expect and ended up getting more than they'd bargained for.","The teacher snapped the rabbit's neck, skinned the animal and cut it up in front of 10th-graders at Columbia High School in Nampa, Idaho .

"Gender equality with traffic lights is being pursued in Dortmund, with 50/50 quotas for male and female icons set to be introduced. Politicians from the Social Democratic and Green parties in the German city have asked the council to consider the idea. They’ve argued that some of the lights should be partially modified in the name of equality. Gender equality with traffic lights is being pursued in Dortmund, with 50/50 quotas for male and female icons set to be introduced . The application said: ‘Since we give equal treatment to men and women, it would be consistent to partially modify traffic-light men to traffic-light women’, according to The Guardian. The plan is for extra flashing green women to be installed when traffic lights fall into disrepair to keep costs at a minimum. The plan’s backers claim that the change would make crossing the road safer as female icons – or Ampelfrauen - would emit more light through the skirt. ‘One advantage of the “traffic light woman” would be the enlargement of the illuminated area,"" the Green and Social Democrats said in a statement. Other German cities such as Bremen, Cologne, Dresden, Kassel, Magdeburg and Zwickau already have female lights, but their introduction was barred in Berlin, with officials concerned that the design – of a girl with pigtails – was too clichéd, The Guardian reported.

"A $900million nuclear submarine had to be scrapped after a worker started a small blaze because he wanted to go home early - and firefighters had no idea how to put it out, it has been claimed. Investigators say a fire on board the USS Miami at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in 2012 got out of control because of confusion over who was supposed to deal with the blaze. Local firefighters rushing to the scene were sent back to base by naval commanders before having to be recalled when the order was overturned, wasting vital minutes, says a report. The $900million USS Miami (pictured) had to be scrapped after a small blaze got out of control because firefighters had no experience of fighting blazes on ships, a report says . No water was put on to the flames for two hours at a time because the rescue effort was badly organised and firemen had no experience of tacking a blaze on board a boat, according to a report. Investigators said the fire was started by a disgruntled worker who wanted to go home early, but quickly spread, damaging the living quarters, the command and control center and a torpedo room. The sub was being repaired in a dry dock when the flames took hold. Fortunately the blaze did not reach the nuclear engines. The report added: 'Complacency had set in, based on the infrequency of shipyard fires and relative success of fire prevention measures. 'Also, there was an assumption that the proximity to far more assets, especially federal firefighters, reduced the likelihood of a fire not being quickly contained. 'This organizational reluctance to prepare for a fire of this scale should serve as a wake-up call — large fires can and do happen in industrial environments.' The Navy launched a series of investigations that led to recommendations, including the installation of temporary automatic fire detection systems while vessels are being repaired or overhauled. It also issued a new fire safety and prevention manual, and says it has learned lessons which are being applied across the fleet. Seven people were injured fighting the flames which damaged the living quarters, the command and control center and a torpedo room - but luckily did not reach the nuclear engines (pictured, fire damage on board) Navy chiefs considered flooding the dry dock to douse the flames after it looked like the ship might be lost, but fire crews battled on in small corridors with almost no visibility in an attempt to save it. Initially it was thought that they had succeeded, but the ship was eventually scrapped when the repair bill topped $700million. Investigators said firefighters were unfamiliar with the submarine's layout and that there specialist training given on how to fight a fire on a ship, and crews did not know with the layout of the boat. However, Brian Tapley, who was the shipyard fire chief at the time, hit back at the claims, saying irefighters conducted monthly walk-throughs, practiced dragging hoses through submarines and never flunked a drill. Instead he blamed holes cut into the side of the sub for feeding oxygen to the flames, turning the metal shell into a furnace. Speaking about firemen, seven on whom were injured fighting the blaze, he said: 'They climbed into the belly of an inferno. Every one of them was a hero.' The Fleet Forces report included 99 recommendations, virtually all of which were redacted because they weren't final decisions, according to Navy spokesman Lt. Timothy Hawkins. The Navy experiences a fire of comparable magnitude to the Miami blaze about every five years, and without corrective action, that pattern would continue, investigators said. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed the recommendations weren't made public. He added that he plans to ask the Navy for them, and wants to hold a hearing on firefighting techniques and training to decide whether the force needs more funding. 'The report documents a very compelling need for better training and more expert firefighters that can help stop such catastrophic fires on submarines,' he said.","Small fire started on board USS Miami by worker who wanted to go home .

"A food blogger has unveiled a new weird and wonderful donut hybrid made using fried ramen noodles. Josh Scherer's 'ramnut' follows in the footsteps of pastry chef Dominique Ansel's infamous Cronut - and Keizo Shimamoto's world-renowned Ramen Burger, taking the trend one step further in order to combine sweet and savory in one calorific treat. While some might not be too convinced by the bizarre blend flavors and textures, ramnut creator Josh, who runs foodie blog Culinary Bro-Down, insists that the custard- and jelly-stuffed delights 'tastes really good'. Scroll down for video . Sweet or savory? According to food blogger Josh Scherer, his ramnuts taste just like rice pudding . That's one way to use your noodle! The ramnuts are made using instant ramen noodles that have been cooked in a special cinnamon-spiced milk and then molded into a traditional donut shape . 'It had a flavor profile really similar to rice pudding, and a texture like kugel,' he told ABC News. 'I'd do some things differently to optimize the recipe - make them thinner to create more surface area, fry at a lower temperature to allow for more oil penetration,' Josh toldABC News. 'If you really think about it, there's no reason this shouldn't taste good, it's just fried dough and sugar.' Josh's ramnuts are made using instant ramen noodles that have been cooked in a special cinnamon-spiced milk and then molded into a traditional donut shape, before being stuffed and iced with more conventional sugary ingredients. The 21-year-old UCLA student admits that the idea might be off-putting to some, but insists that he 'really enjoyed' the end result. He even goes as far as to suggest that his iced delights can compete with pastry chef Dominique Ansel's world-famous Cronut - and kindly offers Mr Ansel the opportunity to work with him on any future Ramnut creations. 'My provisional copyright on the name “ramnut” is officially on sale,' Josh writes on his website. 'Looking for $50 and an Olive Garden gift card. Get at me, Dominique Ansel.' Despite the early success of his noodle-based creation, the budding chef readily admits that its creation could have been a disaster. Donut-shaped delight: Each ramen donut is stuffed and iced with more conventional sugary ingredients . Sweet treat showdown: Josh has offered Cronut creator Dominique Ansel the opportunity to get in on the ramnut action . 'I don’t want to consume food culture, I want to produce it,' he explains. 'By recycling the same Pinterest recipe for red velvet kit-kat cheesecake over and over, you’re complicit within cultural stagnation; you’re taking things from the conversation without adding anything new. I’m just trying to spark up a few lines of dialogue. 'I want to do things that are unique, things that have never been done before, and whether they taste good or not is tertiary to the real goal of progress. 'I’m going to shotgun method the foodie frontier until I hit a f*****g bullseye.' Try it at home: Josh was more than happy to share his ramnut recipe with the readers of his blog . Unlike Mr Ansel, who, until the recent launch of his new cookbook, kept his croissant donut recipe a closely-guarded secret, Josh has readily shared each and every step of the ramnut-making process on his blog. Indeed, he encourages any curious food lovers to try out the recipe for themselves so that they can experience the unique taste sensation for themselves, but warns that the process took up '12 hours of my life'. 'They’re starchy, they’re crispy, they’re covered in frosting and stuffed with custard — that’s about all I can tell you,' he writes. 'I enjoyed them in my mouth, I enjoyed them a lot, but as we just discussed, that information is pretty much useless. I urge you to make them yourself and figure it out.' INGREDIENTS . 6 packs instant ramen . 3 whole eggs . 64 oz prepared horchata (cinnamon-spiced milk) Nonstick spray . Oil for frying . Various frostings, fillings, and toppings . INSTRUCTIONS . 1) Get that horchata boiling in a large sauce pot. Toss in all your ramen noodles and cook 3-4 minutes or until tender. 2) Strain ramen noodles in colander and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. Whisk 3 eggs in a large mixing bowl then add in your cooled ramen noodles and mix thoroughly. 3) Spray down a 7""×11"" baking pan with nonstick spray then dump in ramen egg mixture and spread evenly across surface. Add a layer of plastic wrap on top, press the ramen down hard with your hands, then throw it in the freezer for 3-4 hours. You want it to be relatively frozen but still workable. 4) Flip the semi-frozen ramen sheet onto your cutting board, and use something circular and a chef’s knife to shape them into donuts. 5) Heat your oil to 325 degrees and fry the ramen donuts for 4 or 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown on the outside and steamy on the inside. 6) Let the oil drain on a paper towel, then slather the donut in your favorite toppings.

"Jobcentre staff are to be sent into schools under Tory plans to stop children as young as 14 from descending into a life on the dole. Iain Duncan Smith warns that too many children who leave school at 16 ‘bump around’ doing cash-in-hand work for years before they are offered help, and are left with a 'wage scar' on their backs for the rest of their lives. The Work and Pensions Secretary told MailOnline a future Tory government would send advisers into every school to help those 'most at risk' of falling out of the jobs market and ending up on benefits. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith warned too many children who leave school at 16 ‘bump around’ doing cash-in-hand work for years and are left with a 'wage scar' on their backs . Ministers argue that teenagers who pass through school gaining few, if any, good qualifications are not ‘picked up’ by the welfare state until they sign on at a jobcentre aged 18. Mr Duncan Smith warns that school leavers who are unemployed until they are 18 have ‘a wage scar on their back which blights their prospects for decades to come’. Youngsters who spend the intervening years not in education, employment or training (NEET) cost the taxpayer an extra £56,000 over their working lifetime. Under the Conservative plans, children would be given lessons in the need to find a job before they even start stuffing for their GCSEs. New figures show there are 30,000 children aged 16 and 17 who are unemployed and not in full-time education. Long-standing rules meant jobcentres were not allowed to help the unemployed until they turned 18. Trials are now being run for 16 and 17-year-olds, but Mr Duncan Smith said he wants to go further and give work advice to children aged 14 and 15 to break the cycle of welfare dependency. The get-tough plan would form a key part of David Cameron’s pledge to end youth unemployment. Mr Duncan Smith said he has ‘long been concerned ‘about young people who leave school before they are 18, ‘unsure what they want to do next’ and ending up as NEETs. He told MailOnline: ‘Restricting Jobcentre support until young people reach the age of 18 isn't good enough, because if you've got someone who leaves school at 16 they've got two years where they will bump around, maybe doing a bit of cash in hand work, probably not doing very much at all. ‘Then, when they arrive at the door of the jobcentre, they have a 'wage scar' on their back which blights their prospects for decades to come. ‘That's a personal tragedy for each of those young people, but also a tragedy in terms of wasted potential. ‘And it has an additional cost too – estimated to be around £56,000 to the public finances over the working lifetime of each person who has been NEET at this age.’ Jobcentre staff will be sent into schools to work with children as young as 14, to prevent them become benefits claimants of the future . The Tories plan to make the eradication of youth unemployment a key part of their 2015 election campaign. Jobseekers Allowance would become a 'training allowance' for 18 to 21-year-olds. They would be given six months to find a job or training to prepare them for work. After that their dole would be scrapped unless they agreed to take part in 'community projects', such as cleaning up parks. The savings would be used to fund the creation of 3million apprenticeships. Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘I have long argued that that we should be getting Jobcentre staff into schools to work with young people - to make sure that the transition from school to their next pursuit is a smooth and positive one.’ There are currently 34 trials where jobcentre work coaches are supporting 16 and 17 year olds to get the skills and experience they need to prepare for the world of work. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘This should dramatically change their prospects. It is about social mobility, as well as about ensuring we give young people the best chance to get on in life. ‘And a future Conservative Government would go even further - with every jobcentre providing an adviser with a strong local knowledge of the labour market, employers, schools, colleges, and work experience opportunities. ‘This adviser will engage with young people from the age of 14 or 15 - targeting those most at risk of falling out of education, employment or training - and will work with them to secure a better, brighter future. ‘This move will radically improve the hope and aspirations of a generation that the last Government left behind.’ New figures from the Office for National Statistics show there were 489,258 people aged 16-24 who were unemployed and not in full-time education, down 27 per cent in a year . Figures published yesterday showed that in the three months to September there were 489,258 people aged 16-24 who were unemployed and not in full-time education. The figure has fallen by 182,000 or 27 per cent in a year. Among 16 and 17 year-olds, the figure fell by 14 per cent to 32,000. It means around 14 per cent of 16-24-year-olds are not studying and not working. Mr Duncan Smith said the figures stand 'in stark contrast to the rest of Europe, where many countries are seeing youth unemployment at levels as worryingly high as 50 per cent'.","EXCLUSIVE: Iain Duncan Smith warns children need help earlier .

"More than 3,000 women in the UK face complications from controversial French breast implants it was feared today as the Government launched a review of the risks. The reassessment was triggered after a major cosmetic surgery company told ministers privately that rupture rates could be as high as 7 or 8 per cent. Around 40,000 women in Britain are . believed to have had silicone implants made by the Poly . Implant Prothese (PIP), including thousands who underwent reconstructive . breast surgery through the NHS. Defective: A plastic surgeon holding e silicone gel breast implants, which were removed from a patient when it ruptured . Transform apparently . carried out 4,000 of the implants, but if its estimate is replicated . across the total, up to 3,200 women could be affected. The UK regulator, the Medicines and . Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, had previously indicated the risk . of rupture was one per cent. As Health Secretary Andrew Lansley ordered a review by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, it was revealed that: . Mr Lansley said said the new information had left him ‘concerned and unhappy’. He added: 'We are doing everything we can to ensure that women with these implants get the best possible advice. Wealthy: Jean-Claude Mas, pictured holding a breast implant, is facing charges including manslaughter following the collapse of Poly Implant Prothese . 'So far, all the evidence from around the world suggests that women should not be worried and that there have not been abnormal levels of problems reported with these implants. But if any woman is worried, then they should contact their surgeon or GP. ‘We have, however, received new data . that requires full assessment and evaluation, so I have asked Prof Keogh . to lead an urgent investigation so that we  can establish exactly what . has happened and whether we need to improve the regulatory regime.’ Review of data: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley is 'unhappy' and 'concerned' Mr Lansley said he wanted to reassure . women that if new data came to light that called into question the . safety of the implants, the Government would act swiftly to help them. ‘Our top priority is making sure that women get the correct advice so that they are kept safe,’ he added. The review is expected to report its initial findings to ministers this week. At least 3,000 NHS patients, many of . whom were recovering from breast cancer, were given faulty implants . during reconstructive surgery, according to the Sunday Telegraph. British surgeons warned about the PIP implants five years ago with one doctor in the northeast writing in the British Journal of Plastic Surgery how he was discontinuing using the implants  because of their 'reliability.' About 400 British women are believed to be planing to bring civil cases against a number of cosmetic surgery companies for giving them faulty breast implants. French authorities shut down PIP last . year after the company was found to be using cheaper industrial silicone . intended for use in mattresses. French authorities said women should . have them removed as a precaution over fears that the silicone could leak into the bloodstream. Jean-Claude Mas, the 72-year-old . former butcher who founded PIP, remains at his luxury villa on the . Riviera, after being arrested following an Interpol hunt. Arrested: Jean-Claude Mas was detained by police following the defected implants that his firm sold .

Today . the daily Nice Matin said he is listed as a technical and commercial . consultant for a new firm set up by his son to make breast implants.

In . Britain, Amanda Harrison, from Ramsgate, Kent, was one of the unlucky . patients who suffered a ruptured implant four years after surgery. Her .

Catherine Kydd, 39, have also had the implants removed after suffering . painful complications. Mrs Kydd, a beauty therapist from . Dartford, Kent, started a Facebook page to 'bring together all victims' of the PIP implants after her breast augmentation at Transform.

"A pair of Scottish pranksters staged a fight in front of a famous Edinburgh monument when a Google Street View camera car passed by. The two young men can be seen having a fist fight on Princes Street next to the city's famous Scott Monument, in images captured by Google at the end of July this year. But council chiefs said they were 'disappointed' that Google had used the images, saying it looked like 'a homage' to cult movie Trainspotting. The Google car passed the monument in July this year, and caught the men fighting on Princes Street . The two men were caught on Google Street View staging a fight outside the Scott Monument in Edinburgh . City Centre councillor Joanna Mowat said: 'It is disappointing that Google have chosen to use a picture which appears to be staged as some sort of homage to Trainspotting rather than an image that better reflects the true nature of Edinburgh's Princes Street. 'It is a safe city centre with probably the best skyline in the world.' In the pictures a tall man in jeans and a grey t-shirt has his hand around the neck of a shorter man with blonde hair, wearing glasses, a purple t-shirt and jeans. The shorter man appears to be trying to punch the other man. In images taken further along the street in the direction of Waverley Station, the two men are seen standing in Princes Street Gardens waving their hands in the air while facing the Google van. The men were also seen in the gardens waving their hands in the air after appearing to spot the Google car .

"Predator: Cristian Pereira, 31, was jailed for 13-and-a-half years by a judge after being convicted of rape . A wanted Brazilian rapist fled to the UK and attacked a student after posing as a female au pair, a court heard. Cristian Pereira tricked his 19-year-old victim into believing he was a woman after befriending her on the internet. The predator took the teenager to a remote field where he raped her and was only caught after his van got stuck in the mud. After he was arrested it emerged that the 31-year-old was wanted by the Brazilian authorities for a similar sex attack. He had fled South America in 2012, where he had been convicted of rape and handed a 13-and-half-year prison sentence in his absence. Oxford Crown Court heard Pereira contacted his teenage victim through a fake Facebook profile in which he posed as a female au pair called Tais Bottecchia. After getting to know each other, the victim accepted an offer from Pereira for a lift to Heathrow airport on April 29. When he turned up at the meeting point, he claimed the 'au pair' had asked him to collect her. Once she got in the van, the young woman was driven to remote farmland and raped. 'The victim was terrified and feared for her life,' said Adrian Foster, the Thames Valley and Chiltern Chief Crown Prosecutor. 'She tried to escape on two occasions, but Pereira was stronger and faster than her. 'After her ordeal she had little option but to get back into his van, which became stuck in heavy mud enabling her to make her escape. 'She was found by a farmer, who contacted the police and Pereira was arrested nearby.' It also emerged that Pereira was on bail at the time of the rape after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at the exact same location. Police found possessions including an Italian ID card, a passport, £3,000 in cash and clothes in his van. Pereira's home in Samphire Road, Oxford, was virtually empty, leading detectives to believe he was planning to flee the area or the country after the attack. He initially claimed the victim had consented to the sexual activity, but admitted the offence when presented with damning evidence. It was also claimed that while living in England he hacked the accounts of up to 180 Brazilian women before blackmailing them by demanding they perform virtual sex acts in order to get their profiles back. Mr Foster said: 'As a result of further inquiries made by Thames Valley Police and the CPS, it has been established that Pereira is currently wanted by the Brazilian Authorities for an offence of rape, for which he has been convicted and sentenced in his absence in Brazil.' This is an aerial view of the remote location in the Oxfordshire countryside where Pereira drove his 19-year-old victim and raped her . Sentencing, Judge Ian Pringle told Pereira: 'Your behaviour that day was utterly unspeakable and would fill the vast majority of people in this country with horror. 'I have no doubt in finding you to be a dangerous individual. 'It is difficult to imagine a worse case than this. You have no remorse for what you did.' The track where Pereira parked his van and carried out the attack after posing as a woman on Facebook to befriend the girl . He was jailed for 13-and-a-half years for two counts of rape and four years for sexual assault, to be served concurrently. He will be deported to serve his sentence in Brazil once he has served his time in England. His victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, thanked Thames Valley Police for their support. 'All the officers I have met gave me the impression that they didn't judge me, that they believed me and that they were trying to help me while always remaining professional,' she said. 'My special thanks go out to Pc Maria Gilio, whose support played the most important role in the early days of my recovery. 'I would also like to encourage anyone - not only victims of rape - but everyone who has faced or is facing a difficult time in life to keep fighting. 'Stay strong, don't give up, it will get better again. Life is worth living.' Detective Inspector Louise Roddy said: 'I am pleased with the sentence result which prevents an extremely dangerous man being able to commit any more horrendous crimes. 'My absolute admiration goes to the victim, who has managed to start rebuilding her life due to her strength of character and determination.'","Cristian Pereira, 31, posed as woman on Facebook to befriend victim .

"Controversial payday lender Wonga has agreed with Newcastle United to remove its logo from all children's replica shirts and training wear from the 2016/17 season. Earlier this year, the payday loan giant was ordered to pay compensation of £2.6million to 45,000 customers who were harassed with threatening letters from firms that it invented to chase debts. Its sponsorship of the north-east club was criticised by fans as well as players, with striker Papiss Cisse the most strongly opposed. The Senegalese player initially said he did not want to support a money-lending organisation - who have annual interest rates of up to 5,853 per cent - for religious reasons but eventually gave in and agreed to wear the shirt. The payday loan giant will remove its logo from all children's replica shirts from the 2016/17 season . Senegalese player Papiss Cisse strongly objected to wearing shirts with the sponsor on and it will now be removed from Newcastle United's training kit for the 2016/2017 season . Wonga said the decision followed a review of its marketing launched by new chairman Andy Haste in July to ensure none of it could inadvertently appeal to the very young or vulnerable. It has already ended its puppet advertising campaign. The company said the logo was being removed from children's kit at the earliest possible opportunity, and that due to kit production schedules this would be from the start of the 2016/17 season - the last season of the current shirt sponsorship deal. The pay day loans industry has been fiercely criticised by leading figures including the Archbishop of Canterbury, who suffered embarrassment when it was revealed that the Church of England had indirectly invested funds in Wonga. Two young Newcastle fans pose in Wonga sponsored shirts with versatile stalwart Ryan Taylor . Last month, it wrote off a total of £220 million worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them. While the company presented itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with its friendly TV ad puppets, the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority found extensive evidence of ‘thuggish’ behaviour. Among Wonga’s victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage. But Mr Haste has promised to clean up the company as he admitted it had made 'serious mistakes'. Wonga said it now expected to become 'smaller and less profitable' in the near term following the changes. Darryl Bowman, Wonga marketing director said: 'As a responsible lender we believe removing our logo from children's replica shirts and training wear is the right thing to do. We appreciate the club's support in this matter.' Newcastle United managing director Lee Charnley said: 'We understand and respect Wonga's position and are happy to support their decision.'","Payday loan giant will remove logo from children's replica shirts .

"A care worker who was caught on camera hitting a disabled teenager on the back of the head has been jailed for six months. Zak Rowlands, 19, who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was assaulted and called a 'stupid boy' by Stanley Nkenka on his birthday. When his parents noticed the vulnerable teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at Oxen Barn Residential Home in Leyland, Lancashire, and captured Nkenka's abusive behaviour. Zak Rowlands, 19, (left) who cannot speak and suffers with autism and severe learning difficulties, was assaulted and called a 'stupid boy' by Stanley Nkenka (right) on his birthday . The care worker was seen hitting the vulnerable teenager, throwing him to the bed and calling him a 'stupid boy'. Nkenka, 36, from Bolton, pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court last month to ill-treatment of a person without mental capacity in the early hours of May 12. The footage showed Nkenka bringing Mr Rowlands back to his bedroom after he wandered off during the night before hitting him. As the youngster lay in darkness, he later approached him and quietly said: 'Do you want some more?' before he went on to strike him again on the back of the head on a separate occasion. When his parents noticed the vulnerable teenager was flinching, they set up a hidden camera at Oxen Barn Residential Home in Leyland, Lancashire (pictured) Zak Rowlands' father Paul (left) said Nkenka (right) has damaged the fragile trust they have in the care of their precious son . Judge Christopher Cornwall said: 'The ill-treatment that is complained of seems to me to be dismissive of him as an individual, unkind and uncaring, and really disrespectful of him as a human being. 'Carers must know that if they fall so far below the standards that are expected of them to the extent that they ill-treat the people they care for, they must know they put their liberty at jeopardy.' Oxen Barn - privately run by the Priory Group - is a specialist home for adults who have autistic spectrum disorders and severe learning difficulties. Mr Rowlands' mother Julie said she felt 'sick, heartbroken and angry' when she saw the hidden camera footage. 'Sadly Zak, my loving, affectionate, special and incredibly vulnerable son hasn't the mental capacity to be able to speak but he communicates in his own way,' she told the court. 'By making sounds and by the sparkle in his eyes when he's happy and by the tears and the sorrow in his eyes when he's sad or hurt. But when that's not enough I am my son's voice and will always be until I take my last breath. She said she knew something was wrong when her son started to flinch when he was touched or approached. 'When I saw the video recording of Nkenka hitting him, I felt sick, heartbroken, angry and incredibly guilty,' she said. 'It's hard to articulate the actual words that really describe my emotions. I'm scared, really scared that it will happen again.' 'I have to trust the people that care for him because as much as I don't like it I haven't got a choice. We've been to look for other places closer to home so that I can keep a closer eye on him. I miss him so much but we can't find anywhere that is suitable.' Her husband, Paul, said: 'Each day there is as good as it gets and the impact that you have on these vulnerable people and their families is immeasurable. 'Whether it be a good one as is the case with many carers or a bad one as is the case with you. 'You have damaged the fragile trust that we have in the care of our precious son and that damage can never be fully undone.' Earlier this year, two care workers working for another Priory Group company in Bury were jailed for seven months after they were caught on a secret camera physically and verbally abusing a quadriplegic man.","Zak Rowlands, 19, cannot talk and suffers with severe learning difficulties .

"This is the terrifying moment a reckless driver came within inches of causing a horrific three vehicle smash with a dangerous overtaking manoeuvre. In the shocking footage an impatient motorist can be seen trying to squeeze past a slow moving lorry as another car approaches from the opposite direction. The video, captured on the truckers dashboard camera, initially shows the heavy goods vehicle travelling along a narrow country road as a Vauxhall Vectra heads towards him. Just as the vehicles appear to pass each other a white Peugeot 308 can be seen pushing into the small gap between them at high speed. Scroll down for video . Dangerous overtake: This is the moment the impatient Peugeot 308 squeezed between the lorry and the Vauxhall Vectra travelling in the opposite direction. The image was captured at 15.57.43 .

The 308 careers into the side of the lorry, but narrowly avoids being deflected into the path of the Vectra. As it pulls in front of the heavy goods vehicle extensive crumple damage can be seen along its passenger side. Its driver then pulls over to the side of the road before the short clip finishes. The whole incident lasts just a matter of seconds. The near-miss was filmed in South Yorkshire in January last year on the lorry's dashboard camera. Moments before the shocking overtake the lorry, which was travelling at around 30mph, had passed through what appears to be a small village. It was not known whether the driver of the Peugeot has been prosecuted for the harebrained overtake just before 4pm. The clip has only emerged after it was passed onto Simon Marsh, the managing director of camera maker, SmartWitness. He described the near-miss as one of the 'closest' he had ever come across. The businessman, who used to own a transport company with 200 vehicles tragically lost two employees in separate incidents on the roads. ""It's a miracle that there wasn't a three-way collision,"" he said. ""I've never seen a closer head-one near miss caught on our cameras and the actions of the driver of the Peugeot were crazy.

"Two boys who died in a house fire thought to have been started by their father have been described as 'a shining light' at a funeral service attended by hundreds of people. Talented musician Jack Sykes, 12, and his aspiring athlete brother Paul, nine, died after a blaze at their father's home in Penistone, South Yorkshire, last month. Today, family and friends packed St John's Church, in the Pennine town, and scores more braved atrocious weather outside to form a 'circle of love' in the churchyard. The funeral of tragic brothers Paul, nine and Jack, 12 Sykes of Penistone, South Yorkshire, has taken place at St John the Baptist Church in Penistone. Pictured is the boy's mother Claire Sykes . Grief: The church was packed and scores more braved atrocious weather outside to form a 'circle of love' in the churchyard . Darren Sykes with sons Paul (left) and Jack (right). All of them died in a house fire at his home . There was silence and tears in the town centre as the two white coffins, one slightly smaller than the other, were carried into the church with the boys' mother, Claire Sykes, 42, leading mourners behind. During the funeral she was led to the matching coffins and rested her hands on each for a moment, and bowing her head. The hour-long service had no hymns, but was instead packed with tributes, stories and songs, including 'Sing' by Gary Barlow, 'Wonderful World' by Louis Armstrong and 'I Had A Dream' by Abba . 'Yes, Jack and Paul's lives were cut short but I think we'd be doing both them and Claire a disservice if they were to be remembered for the tragic nature of their death,' Andy Platt, the head of Springvale Primary School - where Paul was a pupil and Jack a former pupil - told the congregation. 'Instead, let's try and remember the shining light that was their lives.' The boys' coffins arrive at St John's Church, in the Pennine town of Penistone . Show of support: The community outside the packed church . The two boys' coffins are taken into church. The head of their primary school said: 'They were children who stood out, children who other could take a lead from' He added: 'In many ways he was a marvellous role model for all his peers, Jack was a friend to everyone and everyone's friend. 'He had a real passion for music and was a standout trumpet player. 'He clearly had a lot of natural talent but it was his commitment, his hard work and his practice that allowed him to make the most of his talent.' He described Paul as a talented athlete who showed a real aptitude for running and won many medals. Mr Platt said: 'He was a character was Paul, he was a joker and a real enthusiast. 'He was a really powerful role model to his peers, dealing with victory and any disappointment with dignity . Firefighters paid their respects at the funeral, struggling to contain their emotions . Solace: A grieving firefighter is comforted by a member of the conregation . Overcome: As requested many members of the funeral party and mourners came dressed in bright colours . Their primary school head teacher said: 'Let's try and remember the shining light that was their lives' 'For different reasons Paul and Jack were children with a high profile in school, they were children who stood out, children who others could take a lead from. 'They were two terrific boys.' Speaking of their mother, he said: 'Claire is a lady of great fortitude and empathy and her children were built in the same mould.' As requested many members of the funeral party and mourners came dressed in bright colours - Ms Sykes, 42, wore a patterned dress and red cardigan. Jo Higgins, principal at Penistone Grammar School ALC, said there were so many pupils and teachers who wanted to attend the service today it wasn't logistically possible - so they held a simultaneous service at the school. Ms Higgins read out many memories of Jack from fellow pupils and became emotional at the end of her tribute. The teachers were met with a round of applause when they finished. Jo Hamer, the boys' aunt, regaled the congregation with tales of the brothers dancing at her birthday, going to funparks and baking cakes. In his address, Rev Hopkin spoke of the brothers looking forward to Christmas, he said: 'These boys, as you might expect, were looking forward to Christmas, the two Argos catalogues are still were they left them under the TV and apparently their Christmas list was endless.' He said the last words spoken by the boys were words of love to their mother, as she dropped them of she said 'love you' and they responded 'to infinity and back'. The two boys were rescued from the house in Penistone, along with their father, Darren Sykes, on October 22. But Paul and Mr Sykes, 44, died later the same evening. Jack was taken to a specialist unit in Manchester but died almost a week later. Detectives have confirmed the fatal fire was started deliberately but said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation. Mrs Sykes said on a specially set-up Facebook page that her estranged husband, the boys' father, had murdered them.","Jack Sykes, 12, and brother Paul, 9, died after blaze at their father's home .

"Squadron Leader Ronald Fairfax Hamlyn shot down five enemy planes during three missions in a single day during the Battle of Britain in August 1940 . The remarkable story of an RAF hero who achieved 'ace' status in a single day of flying has come to light after his medals were put up for sale. Squadron Leader Ronald Fairfax Hamlyn - known as the 'Pied Piper of Harrogate' - shot down five enemy planes during three missions in a single day during the Battle of Britain. On the first occasion he shot down a Junkers 88 bomber  in his Spitfire followed by a Messerschmitt 109 (Me109) off the Kent coast. Records show how he took off again at 11.35am and chased another Me109 across the English Channel before taking it down over Calais. He then achieved his fourth and fifth hits after lunch with two more Me109s off the Isle of Sheppey. His log book shows the three separate flights lasted just three and a half hours. Within days Squadron Leader Hamlyn was invited on to the BBC to broadcast his account of 'Bringing Down Five German Bombers' to the nation. In all, the airman claimed 11 kills during the Battle of Britain, with eight in only six days in August 1940. His exploits helped repel Adolf Hitler's plans to invade Britain. The failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences, or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or even an outright surrender, is considered its first major defeat and a crucial turning point in the Second World War. Squadron Leader Hamlyn's personal log book from the day when he achieved 'ace' status in one day of flying . Squadron Leader Hamlyn pictured standing in front of his Spitfire - claimed five kills in just over three hours . Before breakfast, he set off in his Spitfire for his first mission of the day. On his first flight of the day, lasting an hour and ten minutes, he shot down a Junkers 88 bomber followed by a Messerschmitt 109 off the Kent coast. He then returned to the mess at Biggin Hill, in south east London, for breakfast. He took off again at 11.35am and was soon in action, chasing another Me109 across the English Channel and taking it down over Calais. He then returned for lunch in the mess shortly after 1pm following an hour and 35 minutes of flying. After lunch he returned to the skies, this time achieving his fourth and fifth ‘kills’ - two Me109s off the Isle of Sheppey. His final mission lasted just 45 minutes. Squadron Leader Hamlyn was personally commended by Winston Churchill for his exploits and was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for the 'ace in a day' feat. He went on to fly Hurricanes and sink German shipping in the North Sea and the English Channel before being posted to an air sea rescue squadron which helped recover more than 60 men from the sea. His impressive medal group, including the DFC and the Air Force Cross, is now being sold at auction for an estimated £60,000. They have been owned by a private collector for more than 15 years. The medals are being sold with his log book, which includes his own drawings of German aircraft and shipping he had destroyed. Oliver Pepys, of auctioneers Spinks of London, said: 'As far as we are aware there were only two British airmen in the Second World War who achieved ace in a day status, Ronald Hamlyn was one of them. 'It is a very distinguished but very rare list. His job was to shoot down enemy aircraft and he had one fabulous day where he got into the groove and just carried on.

'These men might have had tally-hunting in their mind but when you have a Messerschmitt 109 in your sights you probably aren't thinking about that at the time, it is more kill or be killed. 'But I'm sure when he got back to the mess he would have had a few drinks to mark the achievement. 'The size of the estimate reflects the story and the man behind the medals. It is there to guide people to the fact this medal group deserves serious consideration and a high bid.' Hamlyn (pictured to the left of the cockpit, one hand in pocket) retired from the RAF in 1957 . The citation for his 'Distinguished Flying Medal' in August 1940 stated: 'The pilot's feat of destroying five enemy aircraft in one day shows great skill, courage and good marksmanship' Squadron Leader Hamlyn, from Harrogate, in North Yorkshire, joined the RAF in 1936 at the age of 22, and was posted to 72 Squadron in Scotland. By June 1940 the squadron was rushed to Kent and he took part in air patrols over the beaches of Dunkirk where 400,000 Allied troops were waiting to be evacuated. He was then moved to 610 Squadron which he served in for the Battle of Britain. The citation for his 'Distinguished Flying Medal' in August 1940 stated: 'The pilot's feat of destroying five enemy aircraft in one day shows great skill, courage and good marksmanship.' Squadron Leader Hamlyn retired from the RAF in 1957. In civilian life he worked for the Save the Children charity. He died in 1991 aged 77.

"More than 90 people are in quarantine in Mali after a cleric from Guinea who was carrying the Ebola virus infected a nurse and a doctor before dying. A nurse has already died after treating the imam at a private clinic in Bamako after he sought treatment for what doctors initially thought was kidney failure. Yesterday a doctor at the same clinic was also revealed to be infected. A woman who was being treated at Bamako's Gabriel Toure Hospital - the city's second largest - tested positive as well. Lockdown: A blue-capped UN peacekeeper stands guard outside the Polyclinique Pasteur, where a nurse died of Ebola fever after treating an imam who came to the country for treatment from neighbouring Guinea . Quarantine: Police stand outside the clinic at the centre of the second outbreak of Ebola to affect Mali . The world's worst epidemic of the haemorrhagic fever on record has killed at least 5,160 people since it erupted in March in West Africa, a region dogged by poverty and poor healthcare. It has ravaged Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and spurred a global watch for its spread. Now Mali, which shares an 500-mile border with Guinea, is rushing to impose tougher measures to contain the spread of Ebola. 'The president of the republic has asked the prime minister to look urgently at the entire system put in place to fight Ebola and to strengthen health controls at the different frontier posts,' a government statement said. More than 90 people have been quarantined in Bamako since the nurse's death, and health workers are now seeking to trace an unknown number of contact cases. 'We tested two cases today. One was negative but the other preliminary test was positive. We're waiting for the definitive results,' health ministry spokesman Daou Markatié said. 'She had participated in the washing of the imam's body.' Infection control: Health workers work at an Ebola treatment center in Bamako, Mali's capital. The Malian government has announced new measures to combat the spread of the Ebola virus in the country . Healthcare crisis: More than 90 people have been quarantined in Bamako since the nurse's death, and health workers are now seeking to trace an unknown number of contact cases . The death of the nurse in Mali forced a lockdown in the clinic where she had worked. The Pasteur Clinic, one of Bamako's leading medical facilities and the default health centre for expatriates, was being guarded by U.N. peacekeepers with armoured personnel carriers and by Malian security forces, witnesses said. Mali's first case of Ebola was a 2-year-old girl who had been infected in Guinea and died last month. Just as the people who had been in contact with her finished their 21 days of quarantine, Mali must now trace those who had contact with the nurse and those infected with her. Medecins Sans Frontiers 'wasted time' by waiting too long to call for vaccines to fight an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, a veteran of the medical charity told Reuters. The group's response to the epidemic which has so far killed more than 5,000 people has been widely praised by governments and the World Health Organization. While Western donors dithered and other aid groups pulled out, MSF deployed hundreds to the Ebola 'hot zones' and treated more than 3,000 patients. But the emergency group relied too much on strategies it developed during smaller previous eruptions of the virus, leading it to make mistakes as this year's rampant multi-country epidemic pushed it to its limits, said Jean-Herve Bradol, a member of MSF's internal think-tank. 'Our response was too orientated toward the management of previous outbreaks,' Bradol, of the Paris-based Centre For Reflection on Humanitarian Action (CRASH), told Reuters, adding that MSF's public appeal for vaccine development in September came months too late. 'We wasted time before speaking about a vaccine and treatments...It's very hard to imagine controlling this epidemic now without a vaccine.' President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita urged the World Health Organisation (WHO) and health services in Mali and neighbouring states to set up a permanent information exchange to improve awareness about public health and hygiene. Fueling hope of progress in containing the disease, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said she would not seek to extend a state of emergency imposed in August. On Wednesday, the WHO said the Ebola death toll in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had reached 5,147 out of 14,068 cases as of November 9, with 13 more deaths and 30 cases recorded in Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain and the United States. It said there was some evidence that case incidence was no longer increasing nationally in Guinea and Liberia, but steep increases persist in Sierra Leone. Some 421 new infections were reported in Sierra Leone in the week to November 9, especially in the west and north, and the virus is still spreading intensely in Freetown, the capital, as well as in Guinea's southwest near the Liberian border, the WHO said. The Liberian emergency, which allowed authorities to curb movement in the areas worst affected, officially expired earlier this month. Sirleaf said a night curfew would remain in effect. Last September, the International Monetary Fund provided $130million to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in September to help them cope with the economic impact of Ebola. On Thursday, it said it would discuss debt relief for the three countries with Group of 20 leaders meeting in Australia this week. In Washington, the Obama administration tried to assure a sceptical Senate that its efforts to combat Ebola were bearing fruit and urged lawmakers to approve $6.2 billion in new emergency funds for that purpose. Tens of thousands of nurses across the U.S. staged protest rallies and strikes on Wednesday over what they say is insufficient protection for health workers dealing with patients possibly stricken with Ebola. The global medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Thursday that clinical trials of three potential Ebola treatments would begin in December at MSF medical centres in Guinea and Liberia.","One nurse has died and a doctor has been infected after treating the man .

"A man was charged $27,000 for chicken parmesan and two beers at a Tennessee restaurant after a card machine glitch added extra zeroes to customers' bills on October 21, one as high as $99,000. James Morgan, 22, never expected to leave Chop House in Knoxville with a full stomach and an empty bank account but last Friday he noticed a very suspicious charge of $27,000 on a bill that should have been $27. 'Just having everything kind of stripped away from you,' said James Morgan of how it felt to notice the card error. Overcharged: A man was charged $27,000 for a chicken parmesan dinner that should have cost him $27 .

He says he's never had something like this happen to him before and that he's considering ripping up his debit card and only using cash. 'I'm considering just using cash now instead of using my credit card, debit card, just to make sure,' he said. 'I was just kind of in shock of the whole thing. I've never been in that situation or anything like that happening to me before,' he added. Morgan isn't the only customer who got overcharged that night and some were stripped of even more cash for their meal. WATE spoke with a customer who said she was charged $80,000 for her dinner and her account is thousands of dollars in the red. The CFO of Chop House's parent company, Nicki Dawson, told WATE that the overcharge was due to a problem with the company's card processor. When the charges showed up last Friday, customers began calling the restaurant in panic. Dawson said the glitch only affected customers on October 21 and that the restaurant is working on getting all of the charges reverse red.

"One of the more prestigious Sydney properties to go under the hammer this weekend will be the North Shore home of Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and his wife, Lady Lynne Cosgrove. The couple, who recently moved to their official residences at Kirribilli's Admiralty House and Government House in Canberra, are expecting a cool $2.1 million for the three-bedroom Neutral Bay semi when it goes to auction on Saturday morning. They bought the Spruson Street property back in 2007 for $1.95 million. McGrath Estate Agents say the 'Tuscan inspired home' enjoys views over North Sydney's CBD skyline, a  'sun washed' courtyard and private garden sanctuary. The 320 square metre block is within walking distance to popular cafes and Hayes Street Wharf. The Governor General's Neutral Bay semi in Sydney's North will go under the hammer this weekend, as Sir Peter Cosgrove and wife Lady Cosgrove up-size to their official residences at Kirribilli's and Canberra's Government House . The three-storey semi features a separate lounge area that opens onto a garden 'sanctuary', and and open plan kitchen and dining space . The double-sized master retreat includes a mosaic tiled ensuite and built-in wardrobes . The home is one of 5,000 properties this month that, according to Australian Property Monitors, will 'smash the all-time monthly record for auctions' in Sydney, reports Property Observer. Sir Peter Cosgrove was appointed Australia's 26th Governor-General in March this year, replacing Quentin Bryce. A graduate of the Royal Military College, Cosgrove served in the Vietnam war and in 1999, became commander of the international peacekeeping mission in East Timor. He was appointed chief of the Australian Army in 2000 and the chief of the Defence Force in 2002, overseeing Australia's involvement in the Iraq war. Earlier this year, Sir Cosgrove was the first man in Australia to be knighted under Prime Minister Tony Abbott's revived honours system. 'Every human being wants to be uplifted and inspired and I can think of no better man than Peter Cosgrove to maintain our national morale and to find faith in ourselves,' PM Abbott said at the Parliament House ceremony in March. Sir Cosgrove told Australians at the time that he saw his role as the Queen's representative being 'to reflect the community to itself.'

"Tragedy: Banker Gary Clarence arrives at the Old Bailey as his wife is being sentences for killing their three disabled children . A mother wrote a letter to her husband after suffocating two of their disabled children, telling him she was finding it 'difficult' to kill their daughter after smothering their twin sons. Tania Clarence used a nappy to kill three-year-old twins Ben and Max as well as four-year-old daughter Olivia, who all had a degenerative muscle-wasting condition sometimes known as ‘floppy baby’ syndrome. In the letter, Clarence wrote to her husband Gary that she was 'so, so sorry' for killing the boys, and that she 'struggling' to take Olivia's life. Clarence broke down in hysterics yesterday after the letter was read to a jury at the Old Bailey, and had to be excused from court to be taken back to hospital. According to The Times, the letter reads: 'Gary, I need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take Liv's life. I am so ghastly and I feel every ounce of it for doing this. 'The boys were bad enough. I am struggling with Liv. I waited until the boys were asleep. The same with Liv. If I could take my own life and leave her to wait for you I would. But the wait will be as traumatic. 'This is so bad and I am so, so sorry. My only solace is that pain and future suffering I am saving her from.' Clarence was assigned a new, less experienced social worker in an ‘ill-conceived’ decision two months before she suffocated her three disabled children, a court heard yesterday. She has admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Clarence and her husband had been supported for 15 months by social worker Suzie Holley, who was ‘specifically chosen because she had expertise in looking after children under the age of five’, the Old Bailey heard. But she was ‘suddenly replaced’ by ‘younger and less experienced’ Sarah Daws and quit her job soon afterwards. 'Gary, I need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take Liv's life. I am so ghastly and I feel every ounce of it for doing this. 'The boys were bad enough. I am struggling with Liv. I waited until the boys were asleep. The same with Liv. If I could take my own life and leave her to wait for you I would. But the wait will be as traumatic. 'This is so bad and I am so, so sorry. My only solace is that pain and future suffering I am saving her from. 'I am so sorry. This life is better without me. I am nothing. 'The only thing giving me the motivation to continue is the belief that the boys are already playing up in heaven like they could never play here. I can seem them running around...' Clarence, 43, killed the children before trying to kill herself at the £2million family home in New Malden, Surrey, while her husband was in South Africa with the couple’s eldest child, now eight, who does not suffer from the condition – SMA type 2. Outlining the case ahead of sentencing, prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC yesterday said the ‘disruption’ of Miss Holley being replaced happened partly because the social services department thought she ‘had got too close’ to Clarence and was not having monthly meetings with the children. ‘Miss Holley resigned soon afterwards. Miss Daws became the Clarence family social worker just six months after she joined Kingston social services,’ she said. ‘With hindsight that perhaps was an ill-conceived decision by the social services department.' Friends said Clarence ‘constantly felt under pressure and criticised by social services’ and had been ‘very derogatory about Kingston social services’, the court heard. Jim Sturman QC, defending, criticised the actions of the ‘inexperienced social worker’ and said her predecessor resigned ‘in disgust’ after being moved off their case because she was an ‘advocate for the family’. Last night Kingston Council said a serious case review was ongoing. In a letter Clarence wrote for her husband dated April 20 – two days before the killings – she told how she made up her mind two days earlier, on Good Friday, ‘to say goodbye’ and her ‘plan’ had given her inner peace, the court heard. Proud father: Mr Clarence with his three-year-old twin sons, Ben and Max, who were smothered along with their sister Olivia . Pictured: Tania Clarence inside a prison van at a previous hearing and she has been held at a secure mental unit which cannot be named . Crime scene: The Old Bailey heard Mrs Clarence lied to a nanny so she could be alone with the children and then killed them, before putting them in funeral poses . She wrote: ‘I cannot face going down this path watching Liv and the boys continue to get weaker. ‘Most importantly, the interference in our lives (you know: GOSH [Great Ormond Street Hospital], NHS, Kingston/Moor Lane). I am tired of it all. No matter what we overcome, no matter what we do, it will never be enough.’ The court heard there was a ‘fundamental tension between Mr and Mrs Clarence and the plethora of medical professionals involved in the care of the children’. Nanny Jadna Coelho, known as Jade to the family, was duped into leaving Tania Clarence alone while she killed her children. She had been told Mrs Clarence's mother was visiting only to discover it was a lie. She then rushed to the south-west London home where she found the mother injured and the children dead in their beds. Mrs Clarence then handed her a letter which read: 'I am so sorry I had to do this but I could not carry on. I also could not leave the children with Gary. It would have been too much for him. 'You have been the most amazing person in our lives over the last few years. Without you I most likely would have done this a lot sooner. Please don't think that there was anything more you could have done to avoid this. 'Please believe me when I say that you did far too much as is. There was nothing more you could have done. You were/are perfect. I am so sorry I had to end things this way. 'Please look after Taya for me. Taya and Gary still need you (very much).' They included those from Great Ormond Street and Kingston Council, which provides support for disabled children and their families from its Moor Lane Centre in Chessington. When the case was handed over to Kingston, the documents included a quote from Clarence ‘stating that she didn’t want to see her children’s suffering prolonged’, Miss Johnson said. Relations between doctors and the family reached such a crisis in 2013 that medics were ‘actively considering child protection measures on the basis of neglect’, Miss Johnson said, although the children were ‘happy and looked after’. There were ‘up to 60 professionals’ involved with the three children, ‘often descending in groups on the home’, the prosecutor said. ‘One can well imagine how intrusive that felt.’ Yesterday it was also revealed for the first time that Clarence smothered the twins while they were asleep using a nappy ‘so they couldn’t smell her’. She later told a doctor she killed all three children between midnight and 5am on April 22, the court heard. She found it harder to kill Olivia and wrote a letter to her husband between killing the boys and her daughter. In it she said: ‘Gary, I need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take Liv’s life… If I could take my own life and leave her to wait for you I would… My only solace is the pain and future suffering I am saving her from. I am so sorry… . ‘The only thing giving me the motivation to continue is the belief that the boys are already playing up in heaven like they could never play here.’ Yesterday Clarence stared at the dock floor clutching a tissue in her left hand, sobbing as she listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s speech. Mr Clarence, a banker, sat by the dock door. But after 20 minutes, before the details of how the children’s bodies were found were disclosed, she became too upset and was excused by the judge, Mr Justice Sweeney. The judge reserved sentencing until Tuesday. An earlier version of this article followed incorrect agency copy in quoting Jim Sturman QC as saying that there was no evidence Mrs Clarence would have harmed a hair on her children’s head but for the illness they suffered. In fact her said she would not have harmed her children but for her illness. We are happy to set the record straight.

"Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning today admitted sexually assaulting 28 boys . Former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning was facing jail yesterday after admitting sexually abusing 26 boys as young as nine while he was at the BBC. One of the founding disc jockeys at the station, the music producer molested children at the height of his stardom before opening a computer shop near his home, which became a magnet for schoolboys. The 73-year-old paedophile lured them to his shop in Parkstone, Dorset, to look at video games and computers before asking them to do jobs for him. Using his fame, Denning also enticed children to his home and a campervan where he plied them with alcohol and indecently assaulted them. His offences span two decades from 1967, when his career took off as he joined the opening line-up for BBC1, working with stars such as Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan and John Peel. But he was sacked in 1969 after telling listeners: ‘I got up this morning feeling like a 16-year-old boy. But where do you get one at 6am?’ Yesterday the sex offender, who has a string of convictions dating back to 1974 for assaulting young boys, was warned that he faced jail after he admitted 41 charges of indecent assault and gross indecency between 1967 and 1987. The frail pensioner shuffled into Southwark Crown Court to plead guilty to the offences. He had previously admitted 29 sex attacks on 22 children at a hearing in August, but was due to stand trial later this month for a series of allegations relating to other schoolboys. Yesterday the defendant, who struggled to hear and suffers from a range of illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and diabetes, admitted the remaining 12 charges, muttering: ‘Yes guilty, but never to penetration.’ The disgraced former DJ, who suffered a heart attack in 2009 and struggles to walk after fracturing his spine, showed no remorse in the hearing. Denning, second from right in the middle row, was one of the original DJs on BBC Radio 1 . Denning was one of a group of men, including former BBC DJ Jonathan King, who targeted youngsters at the Walton Hop, a 1970s teenage disco. He was first convicted for gross indecency and indecent assault in 1974 at the Old Bailey. Before his conviction, Denning had been working for King’s newly founded UK Records, but was sacked by King, who was later jailed for seven and a half years for child sex offences in 2001. Denning was was arrested in April last year by detectives from Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile paedophile scandal . Since then Denning has been in and out of prisons in England and Europe for sex assaults and child pornography. Many of his victims were picked up in bars and games arcades. He was living at an Essex homeless shelter when he was arrested in April last year under Operation Yewtree, the police probe launched after the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal. Detective Chief Inspector Michael Orchard said: ‘Denning’s only redeeming quality is that he has not made his victims go through the trial process.’ Denning was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on December 9.","Chris Denning has pleaded guilty to a total of 41 sex abuse charges .

"A Canadian traveller received a nasty surprise when he was hit with a sky-high $1,200 (£750) bill after using on-board wifi on a  Singapore Airlines flight. Toronto businessman Jeremy Gutsche said he was shocked when he saw the charges and accused the airline of ripping off passengers who connect their devices to do work or just pass the time on a long-haul journey. He said he racked up $1,200 in charges with just 155 page views, mostly to his email, and a file upload. Scroll down for video . 'Sticker shock': Jeremy Gutsche says he was charged £750 for using Singapore Airlines' in-flight wifi . The CEO of Trend Hunter wrote on his blog: ‘I know this because for the first time I counted up my page views to see where all the dollars went. ‘I wish I could blame an addiction to NetFlix or some intellectual documentary that made me $1,200 smarter. ‘However, the Singapore Airlines internet was painfully slow, so videos would be impossible and that means I didn’t get any smarter… except about how to charge a lot of money for stuff. I did learn that.’ Canadian businessman Jeremy Gutsche is accusing Singapore Airlines of gouging its wifi users . Mr Gutsche spent an hour uploading a four-megabyte PowerPoint document. He said: ‘That doc probably cost me $100 to upload, so I hope my team liked it. ‘I actually even emailed them a warning that my upload was taking a while. That email probably cost me $10. ‘And yes, the pricing per (megabyte) was disclosed on sign-up, but I bought the $30 package, slept through most the flight, and really didn't think I'd end up a thousand bucks past the limit.’ Singapore Airlines said its wifi price plans may be volume based or time-based, depending on the provider . On its website, Singapore Airlines said it offers wifi with different price plans on its Airbus A380 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Before passengers connect they must select a price plan through providers OnAir or Panasonic, depending on the flight. Singapore Airlines said the price plans may be volume based (approximately £6.50 for 10 megabytes) or time based (approximately £7.50 for one hour). Jeremy Gutsche said he racked up $1,200 in charges with just 155 page views, mostly to his email . Passengers can opt to have their session automatically disconnect when they reach their limit or they can stay connected and incur additional charges per kilobyte of data. Mr Gutsche wrote on his blog: ‘I can think of a lot of other things I'd rather spend $1,200 on, like a flight… to Singapore! ‘But alas, I've already done that and the flight ended up costing way more than expected.’ He reached out to Singapore Airlines and was told that the matter is being investigated. The carrier told MailOnline Travel: 'Mr Gutsche has contacted us with his feedback and we are following up directly with him on the matter.' Singapore Airlines did not indicate if it will offer to lower the Canadian's outrageous bill.","Jeremy Gutsche says he was 'gouged' for just 155 page views, file upload .

Halloun, who had been concreting the driveway of the Henley property at the time of her death, told police three versions of events of what happened that day. In one, he alleged masked intruders stormed the lavish house where he had been working and that the last time he saw her she had a gun pointed to a head. A Supreme Court jury unanimously found tradesman Tony Halloun guilty in September . Dr Qidwai (pictured at an earlier court appearance) also described his wife as the bond that held the family together . The court has previously heard the financially-strapped Halloun went into the home and killed Mrs Qidwai, stealing more than $3000 from the family home. Justice Lucy McCallum said on Friday that it was difficult for her to make any finding of what really happened in the house that day as Halloun continued to profess his innocence. Crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau, however, submitted that Halloun had an intention to kill Mrs Qidwai because after the 'sustained attack' he stayed at the property for half and hour and didn't call Triple '0'. Halloun will be sentenced on December 5. The Qidwai family said they are still not able to accept the fact that Shahnaz (far right) is gone .","Shahnaz Qidwai was killed on June 15, 2012 at her Sydney home .

"Britain will never have full control of its borders as long as we are part of the EU, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond admitted . Britain can never have full control over national borders as long as we remain a member of the European Union, the Foreign Secretary has admitted. Philip Hammond warned the British people will vote to leave the EU if we do not get reform. In a forthright interview, Mr Hammond said ‘destabilising movements’ across Europe in recent years had seen ‘large waves of migrants’ settling in Britain, putting pressure on public services. He said Germany should realise that if we do not get new powers to at least limit the number of migrants from the Continent, British voters will choose to leave the EU in the 2017 referendum. ‘If your ambition is that we have total unfettered control of our own borders to do what we like, that isn’t compatible with membership of the European Union, it’s as simple as that,’ he said. ‘So if that’s what you want, you’re essentially talking about leaving the European Union. ‘If what you want is the ability to avoid the kind of destabilising movements that we’ve seen over the last decade or so – large waves of migrants settling in concentrations that puts pressure on public services, people coming in to take advantage of the benefits system, people coming here who are working but who are getting an unwarranted bonus out of our benefits system through things like child tax credits and so on – if that’s what we want to deal with, I think there are ways we can agree to deal with these things with our partners in Europe.’ Mr Hammond went further than David Cameron has gone in saying Britain will walk away from the negotiating table if other countries are not prepared to give us greater immigration powers. He also hinted that ministers may try to force the EU to pay for extra school places needed by the rise in child immigrants, adding that the Conservatives will 'look at everything' to relieve pressure on strained public services. The Foreign Secretary revealed he has already started talking to his counterparts among the other 27 member states to work out what their ‘red lines’ are, ahead of official renegotiation after the election. He said the talks had made him more optimistic that Britain could get enough powers back without wholesale reforms to EU treaties. Only 20 per cent of Britons believe David Cameron will be able to strike a deal with the EU of border controls . These treaties mandate freedom of movement, but Mr Hammond said the wording was more flexible than many countries think – and the freedom could be limited by ‘stretching’ the meaning of the treaties. Last night, an opinion poll showed there is deep scepticism about whether Mr Cameron can deliver on his ambition to curb the free movement of EU workers. IpsosMORI found that only 20 per cent think he can strike a deal that will allow the UK to turn some European citizens away at its borders. The overwhelming majority, 73 per cent, are doubtful. Mr Hammond’s intervention comes just after Sir John Major warned that Britain is likely to leave the EU unless it allows us to restrict immigration. Sir John Major warned that Britain is likely to leave the EU unless immigration can be restricted . The former premier said the chances of Britain leaving the EU were now ‘just under 50 per cent’ – and would grow unless Brussels agreed to accommodate UK concerns on freedom of movement. Yesterday Mr Cameron, attending the G20 summit in Australia, said he agreed with Sir John’s ‘excellent’ speech about ‘the need there is to address Britain’s concerns about immigration inside the EU’. But the Coalition received a blow last night when Irish foreign minister Charles Flanagan said freedom of movement was a cornerstone of the EU and unlikely to be reformed. But Mr Hammond, who has been on a tour of European capitals since taking the post in July, said: ‘We’re in the beginning stages of a negotiation. ‘I’d like to be telling my German counterpart honestly if you draw the line there, I don’t think we’re going to get this past the British public in a referendum. But if you could move your line to there, I think we might.’ He said that if Britain does not get what voters want, the referendum result is likely to be a ‘no’. And the Foreign Secretary said Britain is floating the idea of an ‘emergency brake’ which could be applied to limit numbers if migration exceeded forecasts. He welcomed this week’s European Court ruling saying member nations can refuse to pay certain benefits to jobless migrants. ‘I don’t want to knee-jerk react, but it clearly means that because most of our benefits system is non-contributory, it gives us probably more scope than almost anybody else in Europe to look at how we apply the availability of benefits to EU migrants,’ Mr Hammond added. The Foreign Secretary said the court’s ruling showed that movement from Brussels on freedom of movement was possible. Roma gipsy Elisabeta Dano's refusal to work spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism . Wrapped up warm for a day out in town, this is the Roma gipsy whose refusal to work has spurred a crackdown on benefits tourism. Elisabeta Dano, 25, has found herself at the centre of a landmark European case, which has apparently given Britain the green light to block welfare claims from migrants who refuse to work. But while the courts – and her own family – insist she must now get a job, Dano yesterday declared: ‘It is unfair’. The Mail tracked down Dano to a high street apartment in the German city of Leipzig, 120 miles south of Berlin. The newly married mother – whose husband is also unemployed – moved four years ago from Romania to Leipzig, where her sister Cristina had already relocated with her husband and five children. Dano is a convicted criminal who has never worked a day in her life but has been given a State-funded flat and a range of benefits. The European ruling this week, however, means she cannot claim welfare benefits intended for jobseekers because she has made no effort to find employment in Germany. The judgment suggests the UK can, similarly, refuse to pay welfare benefits to migrants who have moved to Britain simply to live off the State. Dano insists she does want to work and is unemployed only because she cannot get a work permit. Speaking as she waited for a tram into the centre of Leipzig, she told the Mail: ‘I came here to babysit for my sister who has five children, but now the children are older I’m not needed as a babysitter any more. I then tried to get a job, but was told I needed a work permit. I applied several times but I was never granted one. It is unfair.’ Dano completed just three years at school in Carei, a small town of 20,000 residents close to the Hungarian border in north-west Romania. She has a five-year-old son, Florin, whose father is unknown. She has no professional training, has never worked, and was sentenced to two years on probation for petty theft while living in Romania. Despite living in Germany since November 2010, she can speak only basic German and can barely read, write or do basic sums. Her sister, Cristina Mihai, said she was desperate for Dano to start supporting herself. ‘I wish my sister would get a job. Anything. Cleaning, yes. I can’t bear the situation any more.’ The European Court of Justice ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits . Dano was apparently given a flat in central Leipzig for her, her husband and her son so she could move out of her sister’s apartment. At the apartment in a smart block above a bank, Dano’s husband said he did not understand what the fuss was about. The European ruling is seen as a boost to the British Government’s welfare reforms and means EU countries do not have to pay jobless EU migrants who emigrate looking to live off state handouts. But critics say the case simply shows that not enough is being done to stop migrants emigrating for handouts – because Dano is still entitled to other benefits. Dano receives £145 a month in child benefit and £105 a month in ‘maintenance’ payments, which she will continue to get from the State. She also applied for ‘basic provision’ benefits worth £300 a month to jobseekers. The local job centre refused this application so Dano appealed to a social court and the case was referred to Luxembourg. This week, the European court rejected her appeal, declaring that rights of free movement depend on migrants not being an ‘unreasonable burden’ to the host country.","Foreign Secretary admits Britain will never have border control in the EU .

"The curve of a person's lower spine is unique, like a fingerprint, scientists say . The age old advice to help people safely lift heavy objects - 'bend your knees and keep your back straight' - is flawed, a group of scientists claim. New research by a team at Aberdeen University has found how a person should lift is determined by the shape of their spine. An individual's curvature of the spine is unique, like a fingerprint, the study found. As such, a 'one size fits all' approach to advising on how best to lift heavy objects is not effective, the scientists said. The new research suggests the mantra approach of 'bend your knees and keep your back straight', will not suit everyone. Anastasia Pavlova, lead author of the study, said: 'The bones making up our lower back - the lumbar spine - form an inward curve that makes the hollow of our back. 'Some of us are more curvy than others. 'What we showed was that the curve of our backs is specific to each individual, a bit like a fingerprint. 'Interestingly, this affects the way we life objects from the floor, so that those with 'curvy' spines tend to bend over, or stoop, to lift a box whereas those with straighter spines tend to bend their knees and squat.' The study examined pain-free volunteers aged between 18 and 65. Images of their spines were taken using MRI scans in six postures ranging from leaning backwards to bending forwards, as if to touch their toes. A special computer method known as 'shape modelling' was then used on each of the images to describe the shape of their lumbar spine, whether curvy or straight. The volunteers were then examined at a motion analysis laboratory, where special cameras were used to video them while they lifted a box, with weights inside it, from the floor in the way they found most comfortable. A weight that was 'moderately heavy' was chosen by each person, varying from six to 15kg. Researchers then compared how people with different spine shapes moved when lifting the box. Professor Richard Aspden, said: 'Our research showed that not only is the curve of our lower back specific to each individual but it also affects the way we lift objects from the floor. 'The degree to which spines were curvy or straight correlated with whether the volunteers stooped or squatted to lift the objects from the floor. The team at the University of Aberdeen studied pain-free volunteers, concluding that the age old advice of 'bend your knees and keep your back straight' is flawed . 'We're clearly not all the same, so should guidelines be telling us to lift in the same way? 'Giving more attention to our individual spine shape could allow these guidelines to be better tailored to individuals. 'Back pain is costly to the NHS and employers. 'It is common in manual occupations involving lifting and it can be devastating for the patient when they are no longer capable of performing their job. 'Understanding the mechanisms behind occupational back pain can allow for more appropriate prevention strategies.' Dr Jude Meakin, from the University of Exeter said: 'For many years we have ignored the fact that our spine are all slightly different and work in slightly different ways. 'Our research highlights these differences and paves the way for improving our understanding of what causes people to be injured when they lift and carry loads.' The paper was recently awarded the best paper at the annual meeting of the Society for Back Pain Research. The scientists said depending on whether a person has a curved or straight lumbar spine will dictate the best way for them to lift a heavy weight. Those with curved spines found it more comfortable to bend over or stoop while people with straighter spines found bending the knees and lifting was most effective .","Scientists at the University of Aberdeen found how a person should best lift is determined by the shape of their spine .

"Leading Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm left more than £1.8million in his will, it has been revealed . Leading Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm left more than £1.8million in his will, it has been revealed. Hobsbawm, who died aged 95 in October 2012, was one of Britain’s most eminent historians, but he was widely criticised for his defence of communist regimes. He was accused of being an apologist for the totalitarian evils of Soviet communism and labelled a ‘useful idiot’. According to records held at the Brighton probate office, Hobsbawm – who joined the Communist Party at 14 and once described himself as an  ‘unrepentant communist’ – left an estate with assets totalling £1,835,341. The bulk is to be held in trust, with the income going to his second wife Marlene. The couple were married for 50 years. Hobsbawm left the capital of the trust to the University of Warwick and his two children from his second marriage – digital entrepreneur Andy, 50, and PR guru Julia. His son Joshua Bennathan, 55, who was born from an affair with Marion Bennathan that took place between his first and second marriage was left just £3,000. Hobsbawm, who lived in a six-bedroom semi-detached house in Hampstead, north London, was born in Alexandria, Egypt, and lived in Vienna and Berlin before his parents died. He moved with an aunt and uncle to England in 1933. He later became friends with Ed Miliband’s father Ralph Miliband. The will was drawn up three months before Hobsbawm died at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he had been suffering from pneumonia and leukaemia.

"Far-right political group Britain First is being investigated over claims it is misusing an image of the Queen's crown on its merchandise. A crown appears on top of an emblem which features on the BNP splinter group's hoodies, caps and beanie hats as well as election leaflets. It is an offence under both the Trades Descriptions Act 1968 and the Trade Marks Act 1994 to use the image without authorisation. The far-right political group Britain First, whose leader Paul Golding is pictured, are being investigated over misuse of the image of the Crown on their merchandise . An image on top of the group's badge bears a striking resemblance to the St Edward's Crown, which can only be used with the Queen's authority . The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it is investigating the organisation at the request of the Cabinet Office, which is in charge of who can use royal symbols. Britain First was formed in 2011 when a number of figures from the British National Party broke away to form their own group. They have since been accused of inciting racial hatred during their campaigns against the building of mosques and what it calls the 'Islamification' of the UK. The group's leader Paul Golding is expected to be questioned in relation to the authorised use of the image of St Edward's Crown, one of the most important of the Crown Jewels. The Cabinet Office had reportedly written to the group asking them to remove the image from their merchandise, but referred the issue to the police when it received no response. Mr Golding appeared defiant when informed of the police probe, telling the Independent: 'I wish them [the police] the best of luck with their politically-motivated quest.' A Buckingham House spokesman told the paper that they are aware of the investigation, but it was being dealt with by the Cabinet Office. The image is a representation of St Edward's Crown, one of the most famous of the British monarchy's Crown Jewels, which is kept in the Tower of London . The image is used to denote royal authority and features on the badges of police and the armed forces. Organisations such as the Royal Regiment of Scotland (pictured) are authorised to use the symbol . Trading laws mean it is illegal to give the false impression that goods are approved by the Queen or to use any 'device, emblem or title' wrongly suggesting a product has links to the Royal Family. The image of St Edward's Crown replaced the Tudor Crown in 1953 as the image used to show royal authority. It has since appeared on coats of arms and badges of the military as well as police and other authorities both in Britain and the Commonwealth. Britain First was last month accused of using the death of former television star Lynda Bellingham to attract visitors to its website. Facebook users clicked 'like' on pictures of Ms Bellingham, unaware that they had been posted by the group. Posts on the group’s Facebook site include comments such as calls for British Muslims to be ‘wiped out’ and all non-whites to be deported.","Far-right group  dogged by controversy since split from BNP in 2011 .

"Ian Ousey (outside court today), 51, was chief financial officer at FremantleMedia when he fleeced the media company so he could keep up with instalments on his dream home in Portugal . A former executive at the company behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent was jailed for 40 months today for stealing £225,000 from the producer to pay for his holiday home. Ian Ousey, 51, was chief financial officer at FremantleMedia when he fleeced the media company so he could keep up with instalments on his dream home in Portugal. He submitted false invoices for four years and was only caught out when senior colleagues spotted a gaping hole in the firm’s finances and launched an audit. Suspicious transactions were discovered in 2012 by FremantleMedia’s group financial director Mark Riddleston. The company credit card was also used to pay for vehicles, mobile phones and other unauthorised expenses. But a charge relating to the corporate card was dropped when investigators failed to distinguish legitimate claims from potentially fraudulent ones. Ousey, who lives in a £1.9million five-bedroom detached home in Ascot, Berkshire, has since paid back the full amount he stole, as well as £1million to cover the cost of FremantleMedia’s internal inquiry. He is also believed to have surrendered his full pension to the company. Today, prosecutor James Benson said the fraudster spent thousands on ‘flights to Brazil and Australia and so on and so forth’. Mr Benson revealed Ousey has already repaid FremantleMedia £1.25million after civil proceedings were launched against him. The sum included the false invoices, plus abuses of the company expenses system and the cost of the internal auditing procedure, the court heard. Sentencing him, Judge Peter Clarke noted Ousey had damaged ‘his family life and his self-respect and the respect with which he is held by his spouse and children’. He said it was highly unlikely Ousey would work again as a chartered accountant, adding he ‘could not contemplate the question of a suspended sentence’. Samuel Parish, defending, said Ousey, who worked for FremantleMedia for 23 years, began siphoning money from the company when he could not afford payments on his holiday home. Ousey, who worked at the company behind The X Factor (above) and Britain’s Got Talent, was jailed for 40 months today for stealing £225,000 from the producer to pay for the holiday home . Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry . The barrister said his client’s career was ‘finished’. ‘He is extremely remorseful about it, not just because he has been found out but because of the disgrace he has put brought onto his family and himself. ‘He has kicked himself well and truly in the teeth. ‘He’s been to Portugal with his wife, he’s decided to buy a property which he had to pay for in instalments. ‘At the last stretch there was some hiccup and he was unable to make the final instalment, the conditions were such that if he was unable to pay he would have lost the whole lot. ‘He submitted a false invoice for a company that did not exist but which had a similar name to a company that did supply to [FremantleMedia]. ‘He’s stated that he couldn’t stop, but he’s paid everything back.’ He added: ‘He’s a man with children in paid schools, and his whole way of life has gone completely. ‘He can’t get a job, he’s had to inform his professional body and has been struck off their rolls.’ Mr Parish added: ‘And now what he is most worried about is the welfare of his family because he’s left them in really difficult circumstances, and Mr Ousey would like to get this dealt with as soon as possible.’ Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry. He trained at accounting firm PwC in the 1980s before taking a job in Monaco with Grundy Worldwide, the Australian production company behind Neighbours, the long-running daytime soap opera. Ousey then went on to work for the European entertainment giant RTL when it bought out Grundy, and then FremantleMedia when the companies merged. After leaving the company last year, he was made redundant from a rival firm in April and then worked as a self-employed consultant. On his online social networking LinkedIn profile, he describes himself as ‘a highly experienced CFO, with a reputation for significant contribution to the business, and delivering the best commercial outcome’. Ousey admitted fraud by abuse of position between October 30, 2008 and November 30, 2012.","Ian Ousey, 51, was chief financial officer at FremantleMedia; he was jailed for 40 months today .

"An 81-year-old Army veteran from Wisconsin wants the U.S. government to know he's alive and well, despite its information to the contrary.

"The case of a fisherman who was left dead at sea after his boat was attacked by a rival three-man fishing crew was 'murder for lobster,' his murder trial was told. The body of Phillip Boudreau, of Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, Canada, was never found after he went out on his speedboat in Petit de Grat harbour in June last year - at the height of lobster season. Joseph James Landry denies second-degree murder. But on the first day of his trial at Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Port Hawkesbury yesterday, prosecutor Steve Drake declared: 'This case is about murder for lobster. 'Not a momentary lapse of reason…James Landry carried out a sustained attack.' 'Murder for lobster': The court was told that fisherman Philip Boudreau, pictured, was killed in Petit de Grat harbour over shellfish . The court heard Joseph James Landry launched a 'sustained' attack. He denies second-degree murder . Mr Drake told jurors that Mr Boudreau, aged 43, died after an attack by a lobster-fishing crew on a boat from the area called the Twin Maggies - that included Landry. He explained that the crew on Landry's boat saw Mr Boudreau near their lobster traps off the and the Twin Maggies charged at his smaller, open boat. The court heard deckhand Craig Landry was told to load a rifle. He added: 'You will hear through witnesses Landry using his own words, 'Get him … Kill him'.' The court also heard Joseph James Landry, 67, of Little Anse, aimed a rifle at Mr Boudreau and hit him in the leg after the crew of three men took deliberate aim at his boat - ramming into it three times. The boat capsized and Mr Boudreau disappeared. Three others have been charged in the death of Mr Boudreau. Dwayne Matthew Samson, of d'Escousse, who is the captain of the boat, also faces a second-degree murder charge. His wife Carla Samson, the owner of the lobster boat, who is also Joseph Landry's daughter, also faces a charge of accessory after the fact. Deckhand Craig Landry faced a second-degree murder charge at first - which were later withdrawn. He now faces a charge of accessory after the fact. Nova Scotia Supreme Court, pictured, heard Mr Boudreau left his Cape Breton home on his speedboat in June last year but he never returned . Craig Landry told police that Mr Boudreau, who was wounded, clung to a gas can floating in the water after his boat capsized. Joseph James Landry hooked him with a fishing gaff, reported the National Post. At one point, Mr Boudreau freed himself only for Landry to hook him again. The crew then tied an anchor to his neck and arms and dropped him in deep water. According to Craig Landry, Joseph Landry then said 'That's deep enough', and the crew then continued fishing. A bullet recovered from Mr Boudreau's boat came from a gun that was later found at Dwayne and Carla Samson's home. Jurors heard that diving teams, as well as helicopter crews and the navy, spent more than a week looking for the fisherman's body. All that was recovered was a  teal baseball cap on the shore near the Petit de Grat harbour, which is believed to be Mr Boudreau's.

"David Lancos, pictured, convinced a woman he was dying of cancer and conned her out of $15,000 . A gambling addict convinced a woman he was dying from cancer for two years in order to con her out of $15,000 to pay for his habit, police say. David Lancos, 59, from Pennsylvania, met Judith Brown, also 59, while watching harness racing - a type of horse racing - at a casino and racetrack in Butler County. The pair began talking when Lancos told Ms Brown he was suffering from cancer and couldn't afford his treatment, it has been claimed. Ms Brown took pity on Lancos and in December 2012 agreed to start paying him $300 per month, payments which continued until March 2014, according to police. The charges against Lancos also state that he asked Ms Brown to pay an undisclosed amount for two trips that he claimed were to a cancer centre in Philadelphia. He also allegedly demanded $9,000 is order to pay lawyers, saying he was left unable to work and had to liquidate his share of the family business. Investigators say Ms Brown borrowed the $9,000 from a bank after Lancos promised to pay her back, but never received the money. Shortly afterwards she discovered that Lancos didn't have cancer and contact police, but by that point was already $14,790 out of pocket. When officers went to arrest Lancos they discovered he was already in jail on unrelated charges. Police questioned him about the money, but he told them that none of it was left because he had already frittered it away gambling, investigators say.

"Boston Scientific Corp was ordered Thursday to pay four women a total of $26.7million after it was found liable for selling faulty transvaginal mesh devices, following one of the first federal trials resulting from thousands of lawsuits over the devices. After deliberating for a few hours, a Miami federal court jury found Boston Scientific liable following an eight-day trial. Plaintiffs said they suffered injuries such as pain, bleeding and infection as a result of the company’s Pinnacle device, used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. The company was ordered to pay the women $26.7million in compensatory damages, between $6.5 million and $6.7million each. It will not face additional punitive damages. Company: Boston Scientific Corp was ordered Thursday to pay four women a total of $26.7million after it was found liable for selling faulty transvaginal mesh devices . Boston Scientific is facing 14,000 federal lawsuits over its mesh devices. It is one of seven companies - including Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon Inc and C.R. Bard - that have been hit with lawsuits over the products. Endo International Plc said in September it had set aside $1.6billion to settle 'substantially all' the cases against it and its American Medical Systems unit. During the Miami trial, plaintiffs' lawyers accused Boston Scientific of failing to perform critical safety studies in its rush to bring the device to market. The company denied it had done anything wrong and said each woman and her doctor had been aware of the risks. One plaintiff, Amal Eghnayem, said the verdict was fair. Jim Perdue, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said, 'this company needs to understand that jurors will understand what (it) did, and will not hesitate to award the damages necessary.' Device: Plaintiffs said they suffered injuries such as pain, bleeding and infection as a result of the company’s Pinnacle device, used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence . A representative for Boston Scientific, Kelly Leadem, said the company disagreed with the verdict and believed it had strong grounds to challenge in post-trial motions and on appeal. Boston Scientific previously faced three trials in state court over the mesh, resulting in two wins for the company and one $73 million loss, later reduced to $34 million. Boston Scientific is currently in another federal trial in West Virginia involving claims from four women implanted with the company's Obtryx device for stress urinary incontinence. The Miami and West Virginia cases are both 'bellwether,' or test, trials, that will help both sides assess the claims' value.","Boston Scientific Corp was ordered Thursday to pay four women $26.7million in compensatory damages .

"Police probing an alleged VIP paedophile ring are examining its links to a number of suspected murders. Scotland Yard announced yesterday it is investigating a 'possible homicide' more than 30 years ago centring on a block of luxury flats long popular with MPs. The explosive allegation could even extend to a series of murders related to child sex abuse 'parties' involving senior politicians, spy chiefs and prominent military and legal figures. Scotland Yard announced  it is investigating a 'possible homicide' more than 30 years ago centering on luxury Westminster flats at Dolphin Square, popular with MPs . Two witnesses have come forward reporting sexual abuse by a paedophile ring with links to government that took place at a number of locations including Dolphin Square – the home of many MPs. One victim contacted police earlier this month claiming a number of killings were linked to the VIP group. Another spoke to an investigative website. The information has been passed to Operation Fairbank – a Scotland Yard team originally set up to investigate allegations that a paedophile ring with links to government operated more than 30 years ago. Police have responded with a new probe, Operation Midland, involving detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command and the Child Abuse Investigation Command. A victim picked out a picture of Sir Peter Hayman - a former deputy director of the secret service - as one of his abusers from the sex parties at the Westminster flats . At one point, Dolphin Square was home to up to 70 MPs and around 10 lords, pictured is the spa . They are looking into a series of alleged suspicious deaths and stress the investigation is at a very early stage. No names of any potential victims have been released and it is not known if the youngsters were reported missing at the time. Last July it emerged that a 40-page dossier on suspected Establishment paedophiles – compiled by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens and sent to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983 – had vanished. But a recent Home Office inquiry into its whereabouts has failed to uncover the files and Home Secretary Theresa May said she could not rule out suggestions of a cover-up. The luxury complex boasts an award-winning spa, squash courts and a shopping mall for residents . A number of witnesses have claimed they were between 11 and 13 when they were first taken to parties at the riverside block . Yesterday a witness in the case, who has spoken to detectives, told the BBC he was a child victim for nine years at 'abuse parties' held at Dolphin Square and elsewhere. He claims two former Conservative MPs, including an ex-cabinet minister, and other senior Establishment figures, sexually abused him. Speaking anonymously, and using the name 'Nick', the alleged victim said he had given three days of videotaped evidence to detectives. Now in his 40s, he said that he was first abused by his own father before being handed over to the group who abused him from the age of 11 between 1975 and 1984. He was forced to drink alcohol before being beaten and raped while his head was held under the water in a bath. He said he was one of between 15 and 20 children who would be picked up in cars and taken to hotels and apartments where they were physically and sexually abused. 'They were very powerful people and they controlled my life for the next nine years', he told the BBC. 'They created fear that penetrated every part of me, day in, day out. Tom Watson MP (left) aired claims about a suspected paedophile ring linked to Westminster. It emerged  a dossier on suspected abuse sent to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan (right) in 1983 had vanished . 'You didn't question what they wanted, you did as they asked without question and the punishments were very severe.' He has given the names of those he believes were involved to the police and the BBC in hope of encouraging others to come forward. 'We weren't smuggled in under a blanket through the back door,' he said. 'It was done openly and people must have questioned that and they need to come forward.' Detectives have been examining allegations of sex attacks at Dolphin Square for a number of months. The proximity to Westminster of the plush estate of 1,250 flats in Pimlico has made it popular with politicians. Former residents include Harold Wilson, David Steel and William Hague. The escalation of the inquiry comes as Mrs May struggles to find an acceptable chairman for an inquiry into claims of a top level cover-up of VIP paedophiles. Two people asked to lead the inquiry, lawyer Fiona Woolf and retired judge Baroness Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, have so far quit over their links to the Establishment. Last night Labour MP John Mann said the bombshell claims, which are the most serious so far to emerge in the scandal over the possible links of MPs and peers to paedophiles, must be taken seriously. The exclusive Westminster estate houses 1,250 flats and is just a short walk from the House of Commons . He added: 'This shows the gravity of the situation; it is what some of us have been saying for the last year. I have said there have been murders and therefore I'm pleased to see this development. 'I'm not the slightest bit surprised. There are more suspicious deaths that need to be investigated and the police are aware of.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Over the past month, detectives working on Operation Fairbank within the Met's Specialist Crime and Operations Directorate have been made aware of allegations concerning serious non-recent sexual abuse, said to have occurred over 30 years ago. 'Our inquiries into this, over subsequent weeks, have revealed further information regarding possible homicide. Based on our current knowledge, this is the first time that this specific information has been passed to the Met.' Details of where and when the suspicious deaths took place have not been revealed. A spokesman added: 'It is important that officers are allowed to pursue their work without interference. 'We will not comment upon speculation as to the identity of any person or locations that may or may not feature in this inquiry.' September and October 2012: Jimmy Savile abuse scandal breaks. October 2012: Labour MP Tom Watson claims at Prime Minister’s Questions there is ‘clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10’ and that a ‘senior aide to a former prime minister’ had links to a child sex gang member. November 2012: Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk uses parliamentary privilege to claim Cyril Smith sexually abused boys. November 2012: The CPS reveals it considered Smith allegations in 1970, 1998 and 1999. It admits Smith should have been prosecuted. December 2012: Operation Fairbank set up to examine allegations that VIPs, including politicians, abused young men at Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London, in the 1970s and 1980s . February 2013: Operation Fernbridge begins investigating the alleged paedophile ring linked to Elm Guest House. The Mail reveals Peter Hatton-Bornshin – allegedly abused there as a teenager – killed himself in 1994, aged 28. December 2013: Ex-Labour MP Lord Janner’s home searched by police investigating historical child sex abuse. He is not arrested. June 2014: Lord Janner’s Westminster offices searched by police. Again, he is not arrested. July 3, 2014: It emerges Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens’ dossier on suspected Establishment paedophiles – sent to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan in 1983 – disappeared. But the Home Office could find no record of it, fuelling claims of a cover-up. Lord Brittan amends his story twice over his dealings with the original document. July 5, 2014: More than ten current and former politicians reported to be on list of alleged child abusers held by police investigating Westminster paedophile ring claims. The Mail reveals the Establishment protected diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange, when police found child porn at his flat in 1978. July 6, 2014: Home Office permanent secretary Mark Sedwill reveals 114 files relating to historical allegations of child sex abuse, 1979 to 1999, have disappeared from the department. July 7, 2014: Home Secretary Theresa May asks NSPCC’s Peter Wanless to head inquiry into Home Office handling of historical sex abuse cases. She also announces overarching inquiry. Chairman Baroness Butler-Sloss is forced to step down amid questions over the role played by her late brother, Lord Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s. October 2014: Replacement Fiona Woolf resigns amid criticism over her ‘Establishment links’, most notably in relation to Lord Brittan.","Police investigating Westminster paedophile ring claims by Tom Watson .

Sneaky: The lady is seen putting a large bottle of Patron tequila under her dress at one point . Between them, they reportedly snatched a total of five bottles. Miami Police Sgt. Freddie Cruz told CBS News that the duo took it in turns to distract employees as they raided the store. 'What they’re doing is actually asking the employee, as part of a distraction tactic, various questions,' he explained while watching the surveillance tape back. 'As she’s talking to one, the other one - the male - is actually stuffing his pants with two or three bottles of vodka.' The male thief is described as a black man, in his mid-to-late thirties, around 5ft 9in and weighing 150lbs.

"Aldi and Lidl are to carpet Britain with dozens of smaller convenience outlets, threatening the dominance of big established stores. The move marks another blow for Tesco and Sainsbury’s, which are already under pressure from the discounters as their supermarkets lure customers with cheap food and special offers. Hundreds of smaller Tesco Metro, Tesco Express and Sainsbury’s Local stores have been opened to capitalise on the fastest growing area of fiercely competitive grocery retailing. Aldi and Lidl are set to open smaller convenience stores across the country in a move which marks another blow for supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury's, which already has smaller high street outlets . Many shoppers have dumped the traditional weekly supermarket shop, preferring to top up with more frequent visits to smaller local stores. Lidl and Aldi will up the ante in the lucrative London battleground where convenience stores are the big growth area. Aldi has been trialling a shop in Kilburn, North London, and is opening one in Tooting, South London. Both discounters are snapping up sites in London ahead of a national expansion, according to Property Week magazine. Aldi is hunting for two kinds of new convenience store across London as part of a £600million development drive. Cormac McNabb, managing director of its property advisers Stripe Street, told Property Week: ‘Aldi has a huge appetite to expand in London where affluent middle-class shoppers are flocking to their stores.’ He added: ‘We expect to exchange on four new stores this side of Christmas.’ Tesco has hundreds of smaller convenience stores including Express and Metro outlets like this one in Westminster . Lidl has its own plans for a new town centre brand, and is transforming a 7,500-square-foot former Co-operative store in Kentish Town, North London, into the first outlet. Property Week said Asda, Britain’s second-biggest supermarket, is also opening its first high street convenience stores. Asda chief executive Andy Clarke questioned whether Aldi and Lidl’s move into a small convenience format would force them to put prices up. ‘This would mean a move into higher rental sites and more expensive operating costs,’ he said. ‘The big question is whether they would have to pass these costs on to shoppers and start charging more in the smaller stores.’ Many Sainsbury’s Local stores have been opened to capitalise on the fastest growing area of fiercely competitive grocery retailing . Aldi and Lidl have turned up the pressure on the so-called Big Four supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda – with their low prices and award-winning products. The latest figures from consumer analysts Kantar Worldpanel for the 12 weeks ending on September 14 showed Tesco sales were down 4.5 per cent, leaving its market share at 28.8 per cent. Sainsbury’s share slipped from 16.6 per cent to 16.2 per cent, while Aldi and Lidl now account for 4.8 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively. Aldi recorded a sales increase of 29.1 per cent on the same period last year, while Lidl sales rose by 17.7 per cent. Morrisons sales were down 1.3 per cent and its market share slid to 10.9 per cent. Asda recorded the best results of the Big Four, with a 0.8 per cent rise in sales and a 0.1 per cent increase in market share to 17.4 per cent.","Hundreds of smaller Tesco and Sainsbury's capitalised on growing area .

"Other Australian states and territories may follow Queensland's tough-cop lead in dealing with problem motorcycle gangs, after its controversial anti-bikie laws were upheld in the High Court on Friday. The High Court has rejected a challenge, brought by Hell's Angels member Stefan Kuczborski, to the new Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment (VLAD) laws introduced by the Queensland government in October last year. The VLAD laws, brought in following a public bikie brawl in a Gold Coast restaurant last year, declared 26 gangs criminal organisations and banned their members from wearing club logos and gathering in public. The Australian High Court has rejected a challenge to Queensland's tough anti-bikie laws which ban outlaw motorcycle clubs from wearing club patches and gathering in public spaces . The United Motorcycle Council (UMC), on behalf of 17 Queensland clubs, had funded the High Court challenge in an attempt to overturn the laws, which it claims are unconstitutional. But the High Court found the laws are not unconstitutional and said Mr Kuczborski lacked standing to pursue the challenge because he had never been charged under the legislation. In doing so, it has opened the way for other states to look at hardening their approach to outlaw  gangs. 'We'd be crazy not to take advantage of that and make some modifications to our laws,' said South Australian Attorney-General John Rau, who wants to see  the power to declare criminal organisations in the hands of the parliament as it is in Queensland. Attorney-General of Western Australia, Michael Mischin, said Friday's ruling was encouraging. 'I shall read the judgement with interest to determine what lessons can be learnt and how the effectiveness of ours may be improved,' he said. Northern Territory Attorney-General John Elferink said his government was also attracted to a number of elements in the Queensland laws. Similar laws banning convicted criminals and criminal organisations from meeting in NSW are already in place. Following the High Court ruling, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman told reporters in Brisbane: 'It would be good to see everyone work together to make Australia a far safer place.' United Motorcycle Council spokesman Mick Kosenko said he was disappointed the judges focused on whether Mr Kuczborski was entitled to challenge the laws.

"A Ugandan pop star faces arrest after her ex-boyfriend posted naked ‘revenge porn’ photographs of her on the internet. Desire Luzinda has gone into hiding after the pictures went viral on social media websites and were published in newspapers in the East African country. But the nation’s State Minister for Ethics and Integrity Simon Lokodo has said that the 26-year-old musician should be investigated or even arrested amid a tightening of restrictions over pornography. Scroll down for video . Desire Luzinda (pictured) faces arrest after her ex-boyfriend posted naked ‘revenge porn’ photographs of her on the internet . The singer, who has a young daughter, told the BBC: ‘I was in love. I have never taken nude pictures. When my mother called me she asked, “Were you drugged, were you drunk? Because honestly, this isn’t you.” I didn’t have an answer.’ It has been claimed that the photographs were leaked after a row between Ms Luzinda and her former lover. But Lokodo told the Monitor: ‘I have directed the police to arrest her, but first they should investigate her. ‘She should be locked up and isolated.’ According to The Week, a more conciliatory tone was struck by ethics ministry official Patricia Okiria who suggested the singer would simply be 'contacted to help in the investigations' over the leaked photographs and might not be charged. Desire Luzinda (pictured centre) has gone into hiding after the images went viral on social media websites and were published in newspapers in Uganda . Local media outlets are well known for exposing 'immoral' sexual behaviour among high profile public figures, the website says. Ms Luzinda, who lives in Kampala, Uganda, has since thanked fans who have supported her while apologising for any offence caused by the publication of the pictures, the Independent reports. ‘I want to sincerely apologise to my mother, to my daughter, to my family, to my friends, my fans and any other people who have been offended by these images,’ the newspaper quotes her as writing. ‘Like I said, this was a breach of trust by someone I loved. I take full responsibility for having lost my mind to take such shameful pics. This person has not only abused that trust but now seeks to drag me down. ‘Those who have interacted closely with me know I am a decent person, a doting mother and an industrious woman. These images in no way should define who I am.’","Naked pictures of Desire Luzinda went viral on social media websites .

"An irate stripper went ballistic on a fellow employee at a gentlemen's club and attacked her with a clear plastic high-heeled shoe leaving the victim with huge puncture wounds on her scalp. Carolyn Wright, 22, allegedly grabbed Ashley Michaels-Hoder, 24, by the hair and began hitting her with the deadly spiked shoe at club 'Chez Joey' in Myrtle Beach. The brutal beating   took place in the bathroom of the South Carolina club on Wednesday at 2 am, according to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun. Stripper: Carolyn Wright, pictured here, allegedly grabbed Ashley Michaels-Hoder by the hair and began hitting her with the spiked shoe at 'Chez Joey' in Myrtle Beach . Victim: Ashley Michaels-Hoder, also referred to as 'Bianca the bartender' on the club's Facebook page, suffered a swollen left eye, and swelling to her forehead . Michaels-Hoder, a bartender at the strip joint, said that she was unable to defend herself since Wright was holding her head down. But when she managed to lift her head, ‘the offender struck her multiple times in the face with the same shoe,’ police reported. The victim was interviewed while being treated in hospital. She suffered a swollen left eye, swelling to her forehead, and two puncture wounds that a doctor said would require staples. Wright has not yet been arrested in connection with the incident, which police have classified as an aggravated felony.

"A woman has launched an online petition asking Kmart to give its employees Thanksgiving Day off so that her mother can spend the holiday at home with her family. After the company announced plans to keep its stores open for 42 hours straight, from 6am on Thanksgiving straight through until midnight on Black Friday, Jillian Fisher, 25, called for the retailer to give its employees – including her mother – a chance to spend at least some of the holiday with their families. 'We understand that it is retail, and employees understand that they have to work hours on holidays. However, Kmart’s unnecessary hours are forcing its employees to miss out on important time with their families,' wrote Ms Fisher, who lives in Wilmington, Delaware. Controversy: One daughter has launched a petition asking Kmart to give employees time off on Thanksgiving Day, so that her mother won't have to spend the holiday working. An employee at a New York City Kmart is shown on Black Friday three years ago . 'With lives that are continuously busier and busier, it is more important now than ever to put an end to this before we no longer have holidays.' Since posting the petition Wednesday night, she has already garnered 1,250 out of the 2,000 signatures she's seeking. Ms Fisher told MailOnline that, while she has not yet received a response from Kmart, 'the response from Kmart employees has been very positive.' 'Employees, as well as non-employees, are expressing that it is enough that we have Black Friday, and it shouldn't ruin the time we have with our families on Thanksgiving.' Speaking to ThinkProgress, Ms Fisher added that her mother, who has worked for the retail giant for 21 years, hasn't even been told whether she'll be required to work on the holiday this year, but revealed that last year’s Thanksgiving sales saw her working not one, but two separate shifts at her local store. 'She was not going to be able to spend any real time with our family. To hear her on the verge of tears really infuriated me, to think why are they doing this to people, they need time to be with their families,' she recalls. 'This is the one holiday where the whole family gets together: her mother’s brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces. Thanksgiving is pretty much the one time of year we all get together.' Ms Fisher’s petition has already received support from a number of current and former Kmart employees, many of whom share her anger and frustration. 'I used to work at KMart, and missed MANY holidays with my family. It is NOT volunteer work, it is required. They are ridiculous and should be ashamed at themselves for trying to make money on Thanksgiving! Let people be with their families!' wrote Chrissy M. Although Black Friday is generally regarded as the biggest date on America's shopping calendar, recent years have seen other stores begin their sales on Thursday night. Macy's and Kohl’s have previously led the way for promotions to start early - opening on Thanksgiving rather than Black Friday. However, some leading retailers have announced that they will not open on Thanksgiving amid anger that traditional time at home is being lost to shopping. A Facebook page called Boycott Shopping on Thanksgiving and various other online petitions were formed to stop shopping on the holiday, and stores such as Costco and Nordstrom will now close so that staff can enjoy the day with family.","Last week Kmart announced that its stores would remain open for 42 hours straight over Thanksgiving and Black Friday .

"Four officers were arrested after they shot a man dead when he allegedly armed himself with a knife and took a delicatessen manager hostage. Brendan John Lindsay, 38, entered The Lunch Club in Carlisle, Perth and grabbed a knife from behind the counter as he threatened to kill Sheila Tran, 37,  on Saturday morning. Tran  suffered stab wounds to her neck and back and was accidentally shot twice in the leg during the incident while Lindsay was shot dead by officers at the scene. But WA Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan said he regrets the officers were detained for several hours after being arrested under the Criminal Investigations Act. Scroll down for videos . Footage has revealed the shocking moment Brendan John Lindsay held a knife to a woman known as Sheila's throat . He said questioning the officers was part of the internal investigation, but it would have been more appropriate to do so under police regulations. He also said it was unacceptable that the officers had to stay at the scene for some time and that one was not allowed to wash blood from his hands after trying to resuscitate Mr Lindsay because of a delay in the forensic testing. Ms Tran remains at Royal Perth Hospital with serious injuries. Mr O'Callaghan said he had apologised to the officers, who had not complained about their treatment. WA Police Union president George Tilbury said it was unnecessary to treat the officers like 'criminals' after they experienced the trauma of taking a life to save a life. Mr Tilbury said Mr O'Callaghan needed to ensure such matters were never handled the same way again as it had upset ""every police officer in the state"". 'We need to get to the bottom of who made the decision. I don't blame the officers at the scene but someone in the professional standards portfolio has given the directive,' Mr Tilbury said. 'One way or another, heads need to roll.' WA Today reports that officers from across the state are 'disgusted' by the arrest of officers involved in the fatal shooting and are threatening to go on strike. WA Premier Colin Barnett agreed the officers should not have been arrested and it was appropriate Mr O'Callaghan had apologised. Mr O'Callaghan said he was happy to work with the union to develop improved guidelines for police shootings, which were rare in WA. He said the incident would be pulled apart ""shot by shot"" in the Coroner's Court. 'There were a lot of shots fired in this,' he said. 'Every one of those ... will have to be justified.' He said nothing suggested the officers hadn't acted responsibly, 'so I've been supporting the officers all the way through this'. Lindsay was shot dead by police after the threatened to kill Sheila, and started stabbing her . Lindsay had been having an argument with his father, according to The West Australian, which Sheila has tried to intervene in. Shocking footage captured by a witness and aired by Nine News shows the man holding his hostage tightly in a headlock with the knife close to her head. An exchange between him and police can be heard, with one officer trying to negotiate with Lindsay saying 'Tell me what you want and I'll try and do it for you'. He grabbed the knife from behind the counter of the deli Sheila managed and dragged her outside . Officers are said to have fired around eight shots at the man . Lindsay was screaming 'Get back! Get back!' at the officers while Sheila yelled 'Let me go! Let me go, please!' Officers were forced to shoot him when he began stabbing his victim. Witnesses described the chaos and terror of the scene, describing how Lindsay had threatened to cut the woman's throat. 'While I was in there this chap came from the front, bolted into the shop, grabbed knives then grabbed the boss and took her outside ... and threatened her, local Donald McCaw told the ABC. The woman was rushed to hospital with stab wounds to her neck and a bullet wound to the leg . The incident took play the The Lunch Club delicatessan in Carlisle, Perth . 'Then he took her outside and they were trying to quieten him down, trying to stop her doing anything, any harm,' he said. 'He said I'll cut her throat, and everyone was around and they tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't.' Police arrived at the scene and shot at the man, firing between six and eight shots. Mr McCaw said 'They [the police] were lucky to get shots in I think.'","A man entered The Lunch Club delicatessen in the Perth suburb of Carlisle on Saturday morning .

"A new review site will speak on behalf of the animals at wildlife attractions around the world and give TripAdvisor-style ratings to the best and worst of them. Care for the Wild International has launched Zoo Review to provide assessments of tourist parks that feature animals, from giants such as SeaWorld to small koala petting parks. Chris Pitt, Care for the Wild's RIGHT-tourism campaign manager, said: 'Most people who visit zoos and animal attractions won't bother to check reviews online, but those who do will most likely check out the TripAdvisor and Google reviews - these can be a great measure in many ways, but when it comes to animal welfare, they aren't always accurate.' The Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand was given a positive appraisal on Zoo Review . The Care for the Wild's RIGHT-tourism initiative looks at animal welfare in interactive wildlife attractions . Zoo Review is starting in Thailand with ten reviews of some of the most popular animal attractions and zoos in a country that has a  notoriously poor reputation for animal welfare. Ratings range from 'best in class' to 'unacceptable'. 'Some of the tiger attractions in Thailand are a case in point,' Pitt says. 'These places will get lots of five-star reviews because people get to meet tigers – how cool is that? But often these reviewers won't see the chains holding the tigers down, the sticks that hit them or the tiny enclosures they are kept in. 'Zoo Review aims to supplement these reviews by focusing purely on the animal welfare side of things. It's an internet-based review system – like TripAdvisor, we're not actually visiting these places, we're relying on the information available in reviews, in blogs and news stories, and on websites. We're basically doing the research that anyone could do – but that most don't.' Major attractions including SeaWorld will come under the microscope in the TripAdvisor-style site . Zoo Review looks behind the marketing and assesses attractions back on real experiences . The initiative aims to reward places that do the right thing with positive publicity, and steer tourists away from the places that don't. 'It's sometimes easy to point out what people shouldn't do, but they also want to know what they can do, for example how do they see elephants without taking part in an elephant trek, which can be harmful?' says Pitt. 'Zoo Review will enable us to flag up the best in class, and point tourists towards them. By doing that, and by warning people of the zoos or animal attractions with the poorest conditions, we can not only help tourists do the right thing, but ultimately cause a shift in behaviour and understanding which will lead to improved conditions for the animals, which is the whole point of doing this.' 'A lot of zoos say they do a lot of work in terms of conservation – but do they really? And are the interactions with animals, for example, done in the best interests of the animals and education, or purely for entertainment? 'So yes, we’ll be looking at SeaWorld, London Zoo and so on. If they truly deserve the best in class review, then they’ll get it; but if there are flaws that people need to know about then we’ll point them out too.' A dog, a tiger and a pig share an enclosure at Sriracha Tiger Zoo, which Zoo Review says should be avoided . BEST IN CLASS . Elephant Nature Park: 'Overall this is a seemingly incredible place to support where you can to see “happy” elephants. If you believe that animals have the right to live a peaceful and natural (as best as can be afforded) life, free from fear or pain or distress then this would be a place to go to in Thailand.' AVERAGE . Safari World, Bangkok: The animal ‘shows’ draw a lot of praise, but here is where problems occur. While elephant parades, dolphin shows and orangutan boxing may please the customers, they are hiding almost certain animal cruelty. While orangutans hitting each other is more obviously abusive, tourists will not see the violent and cruel training methods that must be used to ‘train’ an elephant. There is no indication that Safari World is any different. BEST IN CLASS . Boon Lott’s Elephant Sanctuary: 'A caring and loving sanctuary that strives to provide the best life they can for rescued elephants. They have fields and forests that the elephants wander around and actively encourage them to form herds and breed. Their goal is to set up a reserve for the elephants to be released into. AVERAGE . Maesa Elephant Camp: Maesa states that it was the first elephant camp in Thailand to achieve international accreditation for animal safety and welfare, but there is significant room for improvement. Despite presenting itself as ‘a new-age elephant camp which gives… visitors a real glimpse into the lives and facts about elephants’, the camp prioritises 'entertainment’ (unnatural animal behaviours) over educational, conservational or animal welfare goals. Elephant Nature Park: 'Overall this is a seemingly incredible place to support where you can to see “happy” elephants. If you believe that animals have the right to live a peaceful and natural (as best as can be afforded) life, free from fear or pain or distress then this would be a place to go to in Thailand.'

While orangutans hitting each other is more obviously abusive, tourists will not see the violent and cruel training methods that must be used to ‘train’ an elephant. There is no indication that Safari World is any different. Khao Kheow Open Zoo: This reviewer would warn against this zoo and suggest that sanctuaries and reserves are more worthy of your money. That said, if you wish to visit a zoo whilst in Thailand then this would be better than most of the others. Animals are allowed to wander rather than being in small cages, and there is a focus on studying the animals and reintroducing them to the wild. However there are animal shows, which can often lead to cruelty. POOR . Tiger Kingdom, Chiang Mai: Tourists searching online for reviews of the Tiger Kingdom will be greeted with many five-star reviews, however, further research shows that the animal welfare standards may not be as high as they first appear. Although Tiger Kingdom seems preferable over Tiger Temple, there is still much cause for concern over animal welfare. UNACCEPTABLE . Tiger Temple: The Zoo Review score is perhaps higher than it could have been, due to good reviews on TripAdvisor and Google. It is obvious that many people love the Tiger Temple as it gives them the chance to get close to the tigers. Many claim not to see evidence of mistreatment or cruelty. However, focusing purely on animal welfare criteria, the Tiger Temple seems to deserve an Unacceptable rating, as the conditions of the tigers is of extreme concern. Sriracha Tiger Zoo: Tourists searching online for reviews of the Sriracha Tiger Zoo will be greeted with many positive reviews; however a greater number speak of the unsanitary conditions the animals live in, the rough handling of tiger cubs and the evident fear and intimidation of tigers during the shows. These conditions and the treatment of the animals are of huge concern to animal welfare experts and wildlife charities, and therefore, we recommend that Sriracha Tiger Zoo should be avoided. Samui Aquarium and Tiger Zoo: The welfare of the animals here appears secondary to making money and entertaining the visitors. No education, conservation or reintroductions are performed by the zoo in direct contradiction of the principles of “ethical zoos”. The relatively high score is more indicative of lack of internet exposure than positive aspects of the animals' welfare. Phuket Zoo: One of the most popular attractions in Thailand, but by all accounts it’s a horrific place for the animals, with poor conditions and severe abuse reported. Crocodiles were found to have piled up due to lack of space while tigers and elephants were chained and drugged for the shows. Animals were also found to have severely abused for the photographs. Reviewers strongly urge this zoo to close down until its situation is improved. A crocodile 'show' at Phuket Zoo .","Care for the Wild International has launched the Zoo Review website .

"A long time ago in a studio far, far away... artist Colin Cantwell created these incredible sketches of spaceships that would be made into icons by the Star Wars movies. The artwork includes early versions of the X-wing fighters, piloted by Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy of films, and the Imperial Star Destroyer - the flagships of Darth Vader's fleet. The pencil drawings were done in 1974 and 1975, two years before the release of the first Star Wars film, and show George Lucas's franchise could have looked quite different. A long time ago: The original sketches of spaceships from Star Wars show how different the films could have looked, including this X-Wing fighter with just two wings . Iconic: Later sketches show how the two-wing design turned into a craft with four wings that flipped out from the sides, as in the final movies . Different: This strange ship is actually an Imperial Star Destroyer but flipped around. The fighters emerging from its sides suggest that the design of the TIE fighter also changed several times . As it appeared: This is how the Star Destroyers appeared in the final version of the Star Wars films . The Imperial Star Destroyer appears back-to-front, with the bridge at the traditional front end of the ship, while the flat back end has a large pillar coming from it and fighter bays to each side. Rather than a series of laser cannons, the ship is instead equipped with three large satellite-dish weapons, and judging by the fighters spilling from its side, was originally intended to be much smaller than the version which appeared in the films. As for the TIE fighters themselves, these drawings seem to suggest the originals would have been small, white, triangular craft which bear no resemblance to the bat-like ships they became. And judging from one sketch, the X-Wings could have had only two wings instead of their iconic four - though a later sketch shows them almost as they appear in the films. The artworks were kept by Mr Cantwell in his own provate collection, but are going up for auction in Beverly Hill in December. Evolving: This later design of a Star Destroyer shows it has taken on something resembling its final form, although rather than laser cannons it is now armed with weapons that look like satellite-dishes . Use the force: In this sketch, completed some time between 1974 and 1975, an X-wing fighter attacks a Star Destroyer, foreshadowing the epic space battles the films would become famous for . Far, far away: These pencil sketches were completed between 1974 and 1975, two years before the first Star Wars films was ever released . Almost identical: Bar a few minor changes, the X-Wings appeared almost identically in the film version . Alongside the drawings is an original screenplay for the first Star Wars film from January 1975, when it was called 'Adventures of the Starkiller (Episode One)'. Mr Cantwell's career spanned film, television and news programming, and items from Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey, Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the very first IMAX film called Voyage To Outer Planets, will be up for grabs. Also on sale is a set of NASA Apollo 11 flight plans that Mr. Cantwell used in studio at CBS as he worked with Walter Cronkite in his historic broadcast of the 1969 moon landing. Mr Cantwell's career began in 1955 when he attended the University of California Los Angeles as an art and engineering major. After suggesting that UCLA add an animation major to their curriculum, he then became the first animation graduate from the University. After working for Hewlett Pakcard and as a PR agent for NASA, he moved into film and moved to England to work with Kubrick. Unfamiliar: This ship seems to be based on the early version of the TIE fighters seen coming out of the Star Destroyer, but perhaps more closely resembles the snow speeders used in the battle on Hoth . On the attack: A snow speeder is seen during the famous Hoth battle scene, the design of which could have been taken from the craft above . For sale: The sketches, all done by artist Colin Cantwell, will be auctioned as part of a collection of his film memrobilia, which also includes items from the set of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Battlestar Galactica . During a midnight snack at Kubrick's home, the director told Colin that he had replaced his fourth composer and still was not satisfied with the music. Mr Cantwell was the one to suggest  Also sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss as the opening music, and mentioned Adagio by Aram Kachaturian and Atmospheres by Gyorgy Ligeti. After working with Kubrick, Mr Cantwell helped to design and direct the first IMAX film - then called OMNIMAX - before going to work for George Lucas. Mr Cantwell worked on both the first Star Wars film and Star Wars: A New Hope, designing the X-Wing, Y-Wing, Tie Fighter, Star Destroyer, Landspeeder, Sandcrawler, and Millennium Falcon, and Death Star. Valuable: Also included in the auction is this fist edition of the original Star Wars script when the series was still called Adventures Of The Starkiller . He was also responsible for designing the tench and hole which Luke fires into to destroy Vader's ultimate space station. During the moon landing in July 1969, Mr Cantwell was also behind the 'Hal 9000' computer that was feeding Walter Cronkite landing data that was broadcast live on CBS. Martin Nolan, executive director of Julien's Auctions, said:  'The Colin Cantwell Collection is beyond extraordinary. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for collectors to own a piece of history from some of the most important moments in film and television.'","Sketches were done by Colin Cantwell two years before first film released .

"A woman who lost her left eye two years ago when a police officer fired a single shot at her following a drunken 40-mile car chase is suing the cop and police force involved. Kristine Biggs Johnson was driving drunk through Morgan County, Utah, on November 24, 2012 when the shooting occurred. At a press conference on Thursday to announced her legal action, Johnson said she couldn’t recall much from the evening in question - which doctors have put down to either head trauma or excessive alcohol intake. In her lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Johnson’s lawyer argues that Sergeant Daniel Peay ‘utilized unreasonable, improper, unnecessary and excessive deadly force’. Scroll down for video .

She decided to file the lawsuit after Davis County Attorney Troy Rawlings found the shooting to be unjustified, although no charges were ever brought against Peay. On the night of the shooting, Johnson was traveling from Evanston, Wyoming, to California with her dog and all her possessions – including a bottle of vodka. ‘I hadn’t opened it and I had no plans to,’ she told The Salt Lake Tribune on Thursday, but toxicology tests have since proved that Johnson was legally drunk that night. When Morgan County sheriffs encountered Johnson she refused to pull over after a deputy tried to stop her for having a broken headlight. A 40-mile chase into Davis County then ensued after Johnson drove off. The officer called for backup and at some point during the chase, officers placed spike strips on the road, which destroyed three of Johnson’s tires. The chase eventually ended in a cul-de-sac and dash-cam footage shows Johnson surrounded by three cop cars. Peay can be seen getting out of his vehicle and approaching Johnson’s truck as she tries to drive off - his gunfire can then be heard. The bullet struck and blinded Johnson’s left eye. During the news conference, Johnson removed her eye patch to reveal the damage done by Peay. 'It hit the bottom of my orbital socket, blew out the side of the arch,' she said. 'The doctor described it as an orbital blowout. The chase eventually ended in a cul-de-sac and dash-cam footage shows Johnson surrounded by three cop cars .

"Shamed former Tory peer Lord Hanningfield is set to be suspended from the House of Lords for claiming more than £3,000 for work he did not do, it was announced today. The former Essex County Council leader was caught turning up at Parliament to 'clock in and out' to claim his daily allowance before leaving minutes later to go home. Parliamentary sleaze chief, the Lords Commissioner for Standards, investigated 11 occasions when the peer spent less than 40 minutes in Parliament but claimed the full £300. He found that Hanningfield 'did not undertake parliamentary work' on these days and should be kicked out of the Lords until next year for ripping off the taxpayer. But, it emerged today that Hanningfield tried to avoid punishment by claiming he needed the cash to pay for staff to look after his animals. The former Lords opposition frontbencher and Essex County Council leader Lord Hanningfield has already spent time in jail for expenses fraud . He told the inquiry, set up to investigate his behaviour, that he had to fork out for staff throughout the year - even when Parliament was not sitting . The peer said his monthly staff wage bill amounted to 'approximately £1,500 alone' He revealed that he employed a man called 'Bruce' to 'care for Theodore (my Bernese mountain dog) and my chickens whilst I am in London'. Bruce, he added, 'also helps me to perform various administrative tasks (i.e. scanning, typing etc.) when working from home'. But the Lords Standards Commissioner, ex-Hampshire chief constable Paul Kernaghan, ruled that Hanningfield had ripped off the taxpayer for £3,300 in daily allowance claims by clocking in but not working. In making these claims Hanningfield 'failed to act on his personal honour', Mr Kernaghan said. It is the second time the peer has been caught ripping of Parliament's pay and expenses regime. He served nine weeks in prison in 2011 for fiddling £28,000 in expenses. Hanningfield will now be forced to repay the £3,300 he wrongly claimed this time. He also faces being suspended from the House of Lords until at least May next year - the maximum punishment available. Lord Hanningfield was given a peerage in 1998 before becoming the Tory leader of Essex County Council in 2001. The peer, who was born Paul White, ran the Chelmsford council for 10 years while also sitting in the Lords. But his career and reputation were left in ruins in 2011 after he was found guilty of fiddling his expenses and jailed for nine months. The trial heard how he claimed nearly £14,000 - including £174 for overnight stays in London when he was not in the capital. As a result, he was expelled from the Conservative Party - but was able to cling on to his position in the Lords as an independent. Under the archaic rules of the House of Lords, peers cannot be kicked out permanently - even if they have been jailed. After Hanningfield's suspension was lifted in early 2012 he began turning back up at Parliament - pocketing an average of £3,206 a month, tax free. However, just a year after his suspension was lifted he was caught 'clocking in' to claim his daily allowance without doing any work. In July last year he was filmed 11 times going into Parliament before coming out to go home within less than half an hour. Following an inquiry into the allegations the peer was today attacked by the Lords Commissioner for Standards. Ex-Hampshire chief constable Paul Kernaghan urged peers to suspend Lord Hanningfield for the rest of the Parliament - which runs until the next election in 2015. The Tory peer was caught by the Daily . Mirror claiming the daily attendance allowance on 11 days in July 2013 . when he had not done any work. Under . House of Lords rules, peers only have to sign-in personally in . Westminster to get their hands on the £300-a-day 'attendance allowance'. But in his report to . the House of Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee, which investigates . sleaze claims, the Commissioner said peers must also 'undertake . parliamentary work on the day of the claim'. The Commissioner said Hanningfield was unable to show that he undertook any parliamentary work on the days when he was caught clocking in and out in under an hour. The recommendation to suspend Hanningfield must now be approved by peers in the House of Lords before coming into force. Peers will be asked to approve the report and the suspension tomorrow. Despite Hanningfield's suspension, he will be able to take back his seat after the next election. Even peers jailed for serious criminal offences, like Hanningfield, cannot be permanently removed from the House of Lords. MPs lose their seats if they are sentenced to more than a year in prison. But peers can only be banned from the Lords for the duration of their sentence - or until the next election. Tory peer Lord Archer was jailed for four years for perjury and perverting the course of justice in 2001. He had lied under oath during his 1987 libel case against the Daily Star over allegations he had sex with a prostitute. Yet he is still a peer and has been allowed to keep his seat. Jailed former media tycoon Conrad Black spent three years in a US jail for defrauding investors. He was released in May last year and may return to the Lords. Hanningfield and Lord Taylor of Warwick, both jailed for fiddling their expenses, have kept their seats in the House of Lords. They are all eligible for a £300 attendance rate. But Hanningfield, 73, speaking for the first time since the damning judgement was published this morning, insisted he was 'unaware' at the time that he was doing anything wrong. He said he regarded his peer's allowances as a 'de facto salary' and made it clear he intended to return to the House of Lords after his suspension. Lord Hanningfield, pictured here in his full Parliamentary costume, is now facing being kicked out of Parliament twice in his career. His behaviour has led to calls for peers to be able to be permanently banned from the House of Lords . Hanningfield said: 'Since my release from prison and return to the House, I have had but one goal in mind, and that is to return to work and continue to serve the taxpayer, something I believe I have tried my very best to do since I became a peer in 1998. 'Following my release from prison I was suffering from psychological and physical health problems, I was anxious about returning to the House following my suspension and while it was thoughtless of me to claim the full allowance on the 11 dates in question, considering I spent so little time on the parliamentary estate, I never attempted to hide any of these transgressions, simply because I was unaware that what I was doing was wrong. 'Nevertheless, I would like to thank my fellow peers, and members of the general public, for their ongoing support during what has been the most difficult period of my life. 'I regret that my mistakes have ultimately resulted in me being suspended from the House but would like to assure the people and organisations that I was in the process of helping that I will continue with the work that I have started, outside the Lords, to ensure that our efforts will not have been wasted upon my return. 'Like many other Lords, I believe the allowance to be a 'de facto' salary, something which the Commissioner himself conceded in his report, is an acceptable way to view it. 'As I have stated many times before, I claim the allowance on 100 days during the year, which amounts to an annual salary of £30,000 and no more. I also consider myself to be a working peer every single day of the year and regularly conduct parliamentary work outside of the parliamentary estate, from my home in Essex. 'And so, even if I am not speaking in the House or participating in a debate or vote, I am still required to travel to the House in order to claim the allowance, just as there are many more days a year where I will work all day and not claim at all. 'The fact remains that the Daily Mirror elected to follow me and monitor my movements over the course of a month in which I was decidedly unwell, and I maintain that had they chosen to do so in any other month since, they would have gleaned an entirely different account of my activities and efforts, one which far more accurately reflects my normal routine. 'The House of Lords does not offer any form of 'sick pay' and while I realise that my efforts to return to the House proved to be counter-productive, I rely on the aforementioned allowance in order to pay the various people whom I employ. 'It appears that I am now going to be reprimanded, on a technicality, as I could not provide ""substantial"" evidence of the work that must be carried out on the days in question, in order to justify the claim, even though that would appear to contradict the principal idea that the allowance may indeed be viewed as a 'de facto' salary. 'It will be difficult to recover from this most recent setback but that has never stopped me before. It will at least allow me the opportunity to complete the book I have begun to write on my life, and the last five years in particular.' Many MPs are concerned that continuing headlines about Parliament's expenses regime is undermining the public's trust in politics. Labour's John Mann has called for Lord Hanningfield to be banned for life . Labour MP John Mann called on the Government to introduce legislation in next month's Queen's Speech to automatically expel anyone committing a criminal offence from the House of Lords. The Bassetlaw MP said: 'A one-year ban is hopelessly inadequate. Lord Hanningfield should be banned for life. 'If this were a case of a benefits cheat who repeatedly offended, he would receive a significant prison sentence. 'A lifetime ban is the only appropriate punishment for the 'clocking in' Lord Hanningfield."" Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's hard to imagine what else Lord Hanningfield could do to be thrown out of the House of Lords for good. 'It's welcome news that he's been suspended for the rest of this Parliament but taxpayers are right to be angry that he'll be back on the red benches in a year's time. The reputation of Parliament will be dragged even deeper into the mud if he has the cheek to take another penny from the taxpayer. 'The system should be reformed so those with criminal convictions can be expelled permanently.'","Lord Hanningfield claimed daily allowance 11 times without doing any work .

"MPs have signed off on plans to spend more than £200,000 doing up Parliament's most exclusive restaurant. The plush Strangers’ Dining Room will be almost entirely refurbished, House of Commons authorities have confirmed. A ten-week touch up will take place during the MPs’ summer holiday this year - with the carpets, curtains and fireplaces set to be given an overhaul. The public subsidy for MPs' food and drink runs into the millions every year, House of Commons figures reveal . A Commons spokesman claimed the refurbishment would pay for itself - because it is can be hired out when MPs are away from Parliament on recess. But critics are likely to point out that the dining room is already subsidised by taxpayers - alongside all the other restaurants, bars and coffee shops in Parliament. MPs have access to the outside terrace of Strangers' Bar in Parliament - a sister pub to the the Strangers' Dining Room which is getting a £200,000 facelift . Last year it was revealed that the bars, restaurants and cafes in the House of Commons cost taxpayers £4.9million in 2012/13 - a subsidy of £7,500 per MP. The eight venues selling food and drink in the Lords needed a further £2.3million of public cash, according to freedom of information. This meant the total subsidy for both houses was £7.2million. A House of Commons spokesman today insisted the the 'Strangers’ Dining Room', as it is known, was 'a part of the Grade I listed Palace of Westminster' and was in desperate need of a touch up. 'Its deteriorating condition means conservation work is now necessary to restore many of the room’s historic features to a comparable standard of other Grade 1 buildings and World Heritage Sites and to secure future income generation,' the spokesman added. A source added that the room was an 'architecturally and historically important fine room' in Parliament. The room is used as a function room for hire when MPs are away on holiday, Commons officials argued - meaning that it needed redecorating to attract more diners. The Conservation of Strangers’ Dining Room project is scheduled to be carried out during the summer recess later this year. Decorators will touch up the ceiling, reinstate a 'historic decorative scheme, involving painted stencil decoration and wood graining, using traditional paint' and 'revive polish and repair oak panelling'. The carpet and curtains will also be replaced, alongside the 'restoration of the fireplace including new stone fender, new brass fireguard, encaustic tile fireback and glazed tile hearth, all to a bespoke design'.","The Strangers' Dining Room is a favourite among MPs and their staff .

"In an effort to mark Guinness World Record Day, two German men have gotten their stomach into knots trying to speed eat a German food icon. Unfortunately, the two men failed their first World Record attempt: downing a pretzel in 30 seconds without any water. However, a winner was eventually declared - one minute and 12 seconds later than his initial attempt target. After taking their seats, the two contestants chose their pretzels, rubbed off the salt and waited for the timer to start. Realising the difficult task ahead, both men folded their pretzels - attempting to trick their minds into believing they only had half the amount in front of them left to eat. Their mind trick didn’t appear to help though, as neither men were quick to finish after the fold. Struggling: Alexander struggled to keep eating the pretzel, without any water, even after scraping off the salt and folding it in half . Eyes on the prize: Alexander's fellow competitor couldn't help but check how the eventual winner was getting along with the task at hand . Open Wide!

"Supporters of a charity that provides books for school children were caught by undercover investigators chanting 'White Power', and using slogans from Hitler's Mein Kampf. The Steadfast Trust bills itself as being 'the first and only registered charity which undertakes work specifically for the English community' but has been accused of attracting far right extremists. Now an undercover investigation team has secretly filmed charity supporters giving Nazi salutes, chanting 'white power' and 'victory to the Aryan race', and using references to Hitler. Scroll down for video . Supporters of The Steadfast Trust, a charity that provides books for school children were caught by undercover investigators making Nazi salutes (pictured) and chanting 'White Power' The Steadfast Trust bills itself as being 'the first and only registered charity which undertakes work specifically for the English community' but has been accused of attracting far right extremists . The footage will be shown on ITV tonight, during an Exposure documentary called Charities Behaving Badly. Undercover reporters spent a year infiltrating The Steadfast Trust, as well as Islamic charity The Global Aid Trust, where they witnessed a charity worker expressing his support for the Charlie Hebdo killers' mentor, and The Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh UK charity - where children at a summer camp were told Islam is the 'world's worst religion'. In footage shot with supporters of The Steadfast Trust at an event to mark the Battle of Maldon in 991 AD, one man - whose name is given as Piers, explains how he was once a candidate for far right political party the National Front, and was involved with the Klu Klux Klan. The footage will be shown on ITV tonight, during an Exposure documentary called Charities Behaving Badly . Steadfast Trustee Tim Hawke raises a toast to England at an event to mark the Battle of Maldon in 991 AD . 'I was a candidate for the National Front in the 1980 something,' he says. 'When the Ku Klux Klan started up over here I got involved in that. 'A lot of us here took it to the extreme, where we was actually going out and mob up and attack them. That's because all we had. We didn't have the Steadfast charity years ago.' The group are then shown making Nazi salutes, as well as chanting 'white power' and 'victory to the Aryan race'. One man at the event uses the phrase '14 Words',  a reference to a quote from Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, which states: 'We must ensure the existence of our people and a future for our white children'. Members are also seen using the n-word, and insulting a boy aged around five from a mixed race family. Elsewhere in the documentary, Steadfast trustee Tim Hawke, who had previously explained that one of the Trust's main duties is providing books and storytellers for schools, is shown referring to a group in Chelmsford as 'Burn the Mosques'. He adds: 'They’re not going to burn the mosques down. Maybe if there was a strong, Nationalist, English focus, and there was more militancy – that might happen. It’s not gonna happen in the next few years. Maybe it’ll happen in the future, but not now.' A spokesman for the Steadfast Trust, which has now had its charity status removed, said: 'Tim Hawke has been suspended pending an internal investigation. Elsewhere in the documentary, Steadfast trustee Mr Hawke is shown suggesting 'Burn the Mosques' as a name for a group in Chelmsford, Essex . A spokesman for the Steadfast Trust, which has now had its charity status removed, said: 'Tim Hawke has been suspended pending an internal investigation' It added: 'The Trust does not share or support the offensive views expressed, some by people unknown to the charity. 'We cannot be held responsible for the views, actions or political affiliations of our supporters.' 'The Steadfast Trust is not and has never been political in its aims and we are perplexed by the suggestion it has become the focal point of the far right.' A spokesman for the Charities Commission said: 'Steadfast Trust is not a charity and has been removed from the Register of Charities. We made this decision because there are rules in law about who can benefit from a charity. 'In this case it was not clear that the Trust's beneficiaries, described as 'members of the Anglo-Saxon community living in England', could be identified or are a sufficient section of the public, as required in charity law. 'As the Trust's purposes are not charitable for the public benefit, the Trust is not a charity.' The Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh UK (HSS) claims it 'advances the Hindu religion and educates the public in the Hindu ideals and way of life'. The undercover team filmed a Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh UK (HSS) leadership camp (pictured) HSS says the camp gives volunteers a chance to discuss their opinions without censorship, but the charity is not 'anti any other religion' However, at a leadership camp at a school in Hertfordshire, children are seen being told by a teacher: 'To destroy the Hindu history is the secret conspiracy of the Christians.' And when a child asks Child: 'Do you think Muslims are the biggest problem for Britain?', a teacher responds: 'Yes. For everybody, for everybody.' After the class he adds: 'See if it comes to Islam they are the World’s worst religion and they don’t have common sense to find out what is humanity and all that.' A spokesman from HSS UK said: 'The depiction of us as anti any other religion is wrong and counterproductive to the positive work HSS has done in building interfaith relations. 'We promote Hindu values which are about cohesiveness, duty to society and universal peace. 'Our actions over the years show that HSS promotes diversity and unity in Britain. 'Our training camp is attended by a cross section of society and we try to give our volunteers an opportunity to discuss their opinions and understand all views. 'There are some strong views on interfaith issues but these are personal views. 'We do not deny these views exist nor do we seek to censor or ignore them and we strongly oppose any suggestion that by not censoring them we promote or agree with them. 'We are investigating these alleged comments to ensure those who made them are better informed, trained or prevented from making statements which may be interpreted as anti another community. 'The Teacher said to us that that he does not intend any harm or hurt to other people or cultures and regrets that any words could be misconstrued to create disharmony.' Rizwan Hussain, the chief executive of the east London-based Global Aid Trust has stepped down from the charity ahead of the documentary. A GAT worker called Saffiq Shabbar (pictured) is shown speaking of his admiration for hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who was believed to have inspired a string of terror attacks, including the Charlie Hebdo shootings . Mr Shabbar tells the reporter: 'He incited bombings basically. Bruv, he was a brilliant guy though' In the programme the undercover reporter, posing as a volunteer, is introduced to a GAT worker called Shaffiq Shabbar who tells him of his admiration for the late hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who was believed to have inspired a string of terror attacks, including the Charlie Hebdo shootings. Mr Shabbar tells the reporter: 'They spread loads of lies about him...He's a scholar and basically he was imprisoned and after he came out of prison he started to incite hatred and telling the Western Muslims to bomb. 'He incited bombings basically. Bruv, he was a brilliant guy though.' The documentary also shows preacher Dawah Man speaking at an event in which he makes a series of anti-Semitic comments, telling those gathered: 'America, European countries, whatever you call it, these countries are controlled by Zionists. 'If you look at the biggest bankers in the world, that fund these countries, they are Zionists, and Zionists run Israel. So we can safely say that at any time there was an American, or English or whatever, invasion of the Muslim lands, it is all a problem coming back to the Children of Israel.' In the programme GAT said it 'firmly condemns and reject comments' made by Mr Shabbar and the external speakers. It adds: 'We express our great regret at these incidents, which were the result of a process failure in the organisation.' Rizwan Hussain, the chief executive of east London-based Global Aid Trust has stepped down from the charity ahead of the documentary probing whether the organisation was promoting extremism . It confirms that Mr Hussain left GAT in December 2014. GAT claimed that a due diligence form regarding the content of what the speaker might say was not provided when he was booked and that the staff member responsible was suspended and later resigned . The Charity Commission, which has already opened a case against GAT, has been told of the footage. A spokesman said they were 'already aware that there were concerns of a similar nature' regarding 'allegations of links to extremism' against GAT. He said the new evidence will be added to its current case, noting: 'The claim is that they had invited external speakers to events without doing proper checks on the individuals or as to what they would be saying at the event. 'Certainly the film evidence is of someone who has been invited to an event and it is clear that a young lad has no steer about what he should be checking or asking of that person.' Mr Hussain, who is also a television presenter for the Islam Channel and a barrister, told Third Sector magazine that he had left the charity 'in connection with the documentary'. GAT describes itself as an independent charity which aims to promote education among the underprivileged and to help orphans achieve their full potential. The Charity Commission said it had visited and inspected GAT's premises in November 2014 after 'concerns' were identified regarding one of GAT's events in May 2014. A spokesman said: 'We are already taking action in relation to a number of concerns raised with us as a result of undercover filming in charities undertaken by a TV production company . We remain in contact with the film makers regarding the final broadcast and have requested all footage. We will issue an update on our regulatory action when appropriate to do so.'","The Steadfast Trust was filmed by undercover investigators for ITV .

He had started as a cook and worked his way up to being a general manager. ‘I said, ""why can't we be the company that stands up and says we care about our employees and they can have the day off?"",’ he told WSBT22. He said he would not open the restaurant he managed on Thanksgiving. ‘Thanksgiving and Christmas are the only two days that they're closed in the whole year and they're the only two days that those people are guaranteed to have off and spend it with their families.’ But his goodwill cost him his job as he was told to sign a letter of resignation. Rohr said he did not want to quit, but instead wrote a letter explaining his position to his boss. Forced to quit: Rohr said he was told to sign a letter of resignation, which he refused to do . Letter: Instead, he wrote a letter explaining his position to his boss, saying the decision by the company to stay open on Thanksgiving was 'greedy' and 'immoral' ‘I am not quitting. I do not resign however I accept that the refusal to comply with this greedy, immoral request means the end of my tenure with this company. ‘I hope you realize that it's the people at the bottom of the totem pole that make your life possible.’ Rohr, who is now unemployed and looking for a new job, says it was worth it. ‘They're still going to be open. I'm sure they're still going to sell pizza but I just didn't think it was right.’ However, according to the direction of operations for Pizza Hut in Indiana and Illinois, Rohr resigned from the job and was not fired. He told WSBT22 that opening on Thanksgiving was not an individual's decision, but a company decision. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","Tony Rohr worked at the Jackson Boulevard Pizza Hut in Elkhart for 10 years .

"Cleared in 15 minutes: Headteacher James Bird, 53, was found not guilty of 4 counts of gross indecency . A respected headmaster  was cleared by a jury in just 15 minutes of molesting an unruly pupil in his study. James Bird, 53, was arrested at his desk and subjected to a year long court ordeal after he was accused of assaulting a boy more than decade ago when he was head of a Church of England primary school. The boy, now 20, described as 'aggressive, confrontational and challenging' by staff had been sent to Mr Bird's study for being rude to a teacher in class. Ten years later he went to police after a drinking session with a friend to claim he was forced to perform sex acts upon Mr Bird as 'punishment' for being naughty at St Peter's C or E Primary School, in Accrington, Lancashire. During the inquiry Mr Bird was suspended and computer and phones were seized from his home in Leyland - but no inappropriate material was found. This week following a trial at Preston Crown Court, Mr Bird who is currently headmaster at Newton Bluecoat C of E Primary near Kirkham was cleared of four counts of gross indecency after jurors dismissed the claims almost as soon as they had retired to consider their verdicts. They retired at 12.41pm on Thursday and came back at 12.56pm. After the case Mr Bird, a Christian father of four said in a statement he was looking forward to getting back to work. He said: 'I'm very happy that the truth has come out. It was made crystal clear in court these incident did not occur and it has been very difficult since these allegations came to light. 'I'd like to thank my many friends colleagues, parents of pupils and other well wishers for all their support prayers and kindness and also particularly the support of our church. We have taken enormous strength from them all. 'Their strong faith and prayers, along with ours have made these 11 months bearable. After 338 very difficult days my family and I need to get our lives back to normal. I am now looking forward to spending some quality time with my 13-year-old daughter who I have not been allowed to be alone with since before Christmas last year. 'Secondly I'm looking forward to returning to my fantastic job as a headteacher and thanking my deputy and all the staff for the wonderful work they have done in my absence.' Rev David Lyon of St Annes Parish Church who was chairman of governors at St Peter's and who gave a character reference as part of Mr Bird's defence case, said: 'I wonder why this case was brought. 'His approach to children was one that he wanted them to excel and be the best they could possible be. It's unbelievable.' Row: A former pupil claimed he was abused ten years ago but after the suspect was cleared friends have said the case should not have been brought to Preston Crown Court, pictured . The court heard Mr Bird was accused of molesting the young boy on 'seven or eight occasions' between September 1 2002 and April 30 2004 when he was ten after he had been sent out of lessons for bad behaviour. The complainant told a jury when he was taken into Bird's office for the first time, he thought he would be given lines to do as a punishment. He said: 'He used to say ""you're bad aren't you?"" and ""you have to do this, this is your punishment"". I just cannot get it out of my head what he has done now that I am older. It has just messed up my life.' He added: 'I did not know what he was going to do. Normally you get lines that you have to write. We went to his office. He sat down and we did talk a bit about why I was misbehaving, but we did not really talk for that long. 'That is when he said, ""it is more serious than you think and you are going to have to take a punishment for it"". That is when he started making me do stuff.' Back to work: Mr Bird, 53, pictured with his wife, was suspended pending the conclusion of this case but will now go back to his Lancashire school . It was claimed on one occasion he was disciplined by Bird, who took him out of class to his office, where he shut the door and blinds and forced the boy to perform sex acts on him before calling his mother in to school to discuss his behaviour. In December last year, while he was drunk, the man told a close friend about his claims and he was encouraged to report Mr Bird to police. In an interview, hours after his arrest Bird blasted the man's claims as being 'absolutely ridiculous' and told officers he had always had an open door policy when disciplining pupils. He said he remembered the pupil, telling officers: 'He wasn't always a good boy, I remember that.' But he said he could not remember any specific incidents where he had been involved in disciplining the schoolboy or spoken to him in his office. Joan Smith, a former college of Mr Bird recalled the boy's behaviour being 'confrontational and challenging' at times and added: 'I often wondered what his aggression was about. He was quite an aggressive boy and I couldn't understand the reason. We got on well and had a good relationship.' Today Det Con Karen Parker of Lancashire Police said: 'Whilst we are disappointed with the outcome of this trial, we of course respect the decision of the jury and I would like to thank them for their consideration of this case. 'Lancashire Constabulary remains committed to investigating allegations of sexual offences, no matter how historic, and no matter what the role, position and status of the alleged offender, and we would encourage anyone who has been a victim to come forward safe in the knowledge that they will be treated sensitively and professionally.' A spokeswoman for the CPS said: 'The jury have had an opportunity over the course of the trial to hear and fully consider both the prosecution and the defence cases and we of course respect the verdicts.'","James Bird, 53, was accused of repeatedly abusing boy for being naughty .

"The House of Representatives on Friday passed legislation giving the makers of the Keystone pipeline the go-ahead to build the fourth and final section of the oil transportation system. The House has already sanctioned the construction of the XL portion of the pipeline eight times but today it passed language identical to a bill under consideration in the Senate by a vote of 252-161. The Democratically-controlled upper chamber has long declined to vote on the matter but had a change of heart on Wednesday after Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana begged her colleagues to immediately bring the legislation to the floor. Landrieu's Senate seat hangs in the balance after neither she nor her Republican opponent, Congressman Bill Cassidy, crossed a state-mandated threshold of 50 percent plus one in last week's election. The three-term senator hopes to fend off Cassidy in an upcoming run-off election by pushing through approval of Keystone. The solid black and gray lines on the map shows already built portions of the Keystone Pipeline. The red line represents the path of the proposed XL portion that Congress is currently debating . Sen. Mary Landrieu, chair of the Senate Energy Committee, left, is pictured here on Wednesday at the Capitol speaking to reporters with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Landrieu is facing an uphill fight to hold her seat in a Dec. 6 runoff against GOP Congressman Bill Cassidy, right.  Cassidy is seen participating in a campaign rally on Monday in a Baton Rouge bar in the above picture . Approval: Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana is begging her Democratic colleagues to approve the construction of Keystone XL next Tuesday in a bid to get reelected . Cassidy and Landrieu will go head to head on Dec. 6 as a result of Louisiana's jungle primary, which authorizes all candidates seeking office to appear on the ballot on Election Day. The top two vote-getters advance to a runoff if neither are able to reach a simple majority. Landrieu currently trails Cassidy by 16 points, according to internal polling taken by the GOP candidate that was shared with MailOnline. Passage of the pipeline may be her only shot of closing that gap. Chair the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Landrieu has made her seniority on the committee her main argument for reelection in her oil-rich state. However Cassidy got a bump of his own when incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell publicly promised him a seat on the committee this week, assuming he wins next month's election. As soon as lawmakers returned to the Capitol for work this week Landrieu took to the Senate floor and called for a vote on Keystone in an attempt to even the score. 'We can have the Keystone pipeline and answer the frustrations of the American people so they can... say ""Oh my gosh the senators of United States of America have ears, and they have brains, they have hearts and they heard what we said,"" ' she argued. The Keystone Pipeline System is an oil transportation system owned and operated by energy company TransCanada. It stretches from Alberta, Canada to southern Texas and Louisiana and would bring 700,000 barrels of oil daily from Canada to the Gulf Coast upon completion. The first three phases of the pipeline have already been built, while a fourth phase, the XL portion, is still awaiting both government and court approval. The XL pipeline would replace the already constructed first phase and would run from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. Environmental groups strongly opposed the completion of the pipeline and have lobbied the U.S. government to shoot down the proposal. In April the Obama administration announced that it was suspending its review of the pipeline until a court case in Nebraska challenging the XL route concluded. White House officials, including the president, have repeatedly said in recent days that the administration's position on the issue has not changed. After Landrieu rallied fellow senators on Wednesday to bring Keystone XL under formal consideration, Cassidy took to the House floor to ask the lower chamber to do the same. The legislation currently being debated was sponsored by Landrieu in her capacity as energy chief and was authored by Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota. It now awaits a vote in the Senate, scheduled for next Tuesday, giving Landrieu a few more days to round up the 60 votes she needs to overcome a filibuster. Every Republican in the Senate has committed to supporting the bill, giving her 45 yeas right off the bat. Now she needs to convince just 14 of her Democratic colleagues to vote her way, too. As of today, whip counts put her just one commitment shy of  60. If the Senate joins the House in approving the legislation, it will go directly to the president's desk, per an agreement between Senate Republicans and Landrieu. President Barack Obama has not said whether he would veto it or not. If he did, it would take 67 votes in the Senate to bypass him - a number that Landrieu will not likely be able to match. Notwithstanding a veto from Obama, Landrieu is convinced that authorization of Keystone will be the miracle she needs to stay in Congress. Cassidy has owned the issue as well in the final days of the campaign and tweeted this morning, 'Not so fast, my friend: Don’t fall for’s desperate “Hail Mary."" ' The sponsor of the House version of the bill, Cassidy pointed out on Thursday during debate on the House floor that its been more than six years since TransCanada first applied for permission to build the pipeline. 'The bill considered today that I introduced is the language asked for by the Senate. So we are going to make it as easy as possible for the Senate to finally get a bill to the president’s desk that approves this long-overdue Keystone XL pipeline,' Cassidy said. 'I encourage my colleagues to join me in approving the Keystone XL pipeline to finally provide 40,000 promised jobs to the American people.' After the House vote Hoeven, a Republican, sent out a statement congratulating fellow GOPer Cassidy on passing his legislation in the House - making it clear just where his allegiances lie in the Senate race, even if Landrieu's name is on the Senate bill with him. Hoeven also stated that if the Senate was unable to reach 60 votes, he would reintroduce the bill next session after a handful of newly elected GOP lawmakers are seated. And if Obama vetoes the legislation, 'we aren't finished,' Hoeven said on Thursday. 'We'll pass it as either part of broader energy legislation or as an amendment to another must-pass bill.' XL Extension map: The House has already sanctioned the construction of the XL portion of the pipeline eight times but today it passed language identical to a bill under consideration in the Senate by a vote of 252-161 . President Barack Obama would not say at a press conference last week if he would veto the construction of the XL portion of the pipeline. Obama said he was waiting to make a decision until after Nebraska's Supreme Court makes a ruling on the proposed path. 'On Keystone, there’s an independent process. It’s moving forward, and I’m going to let that process play out,' he said. 'The process is moving forward, and I’m just going to gather up the facts.' That court ruling is anticipated to come in the next few weeks. Obama told reporters covering his press conference in Burma on Friday that his position on the issue remains the same. He did however push back on claims that Keystone would be a 'massive jobs bill' as proponents have claimed. Furthermore, several senior level White House officials have said on the record this week that the administration has a 'dim view' of efforts in the legislative branch to force government approval of the pipeline, foreshadowing a possible veto from the president. Obama has only issued two presidential vetoes in his nearly six years as president, but with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress beginning in January, that number is expected to go up dramatically. House Speaker John Boehner chided Obama on Friday for his role in slowing down the Keystone construction process. 'Thousands more Americans would be working today if President Obama had put their priorities ahead of his political interests and approved the Keystone pipeline,' Boehner said in a statement after the House vote. 'Instead, he continues to block the project, and the new jobs, lower costs, and increased energy security it would provide,' Boehner continued. 'The president doesn’t have any more elections to win, and he has no other excuse for standing in the way. It’s time he start listening to the vast majority of Americans who support Keystone.' A major environmental group, on the other hand, celebrated the prospect that the 'ill-considered legislation' could earn 'a well-deserved presidential veto.' Danielle Droitsch, Canada Project Director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement on Friday afternoon that the 'House-passed bill is wrong for our country' and would 'short-circuit the deliberative approval process that President Obama has said should run its due course.' 'It turns Congress into a permitting agency; even worse, one waiving all environmental safeguards and legal challenges from the public,' she claimed. 'President Obama has ample reason to veto this measure,' the statement went on to say, pointing out that the number of no votes in the House today show's just how many legislators 'know the pipeline would be a disaster for our climate and a danger to the land and water that sustains countless Americans.'","The House today passed a bill by a vote of 252-161 with identical language to legislation under consideration in the Senate .

"A Home Office minister last night demanded a ban on controversial US 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc entering Britain. Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone took the rare step of speaking out publicly to say she was lobbying Home Secretary Theresa May to refuse the self-styled dating coach a visa. Mr Blanc has been heavily criticised over £2,000-a-head seminars in which he is said to teach men sexually abusive and racist methods to attract women. Julien Blanc has been heavily criticised over £2,000-a-head seminars in which he is said to teach men sexually abusive and racist methods to attract women . He disturbingly encourages men to treat women with disrespect and contempt, including video footage of him apparently grabbing women by the throat. Other recommended pick-up methods include threatening to commit suicide, injuring pets and isolating women from friends. Crime minister Ms Featherstone spoke out as pressure mounted on the authorities to block an upcoming seminar by Mr Blanc in London, scheduled to begin in February. She said: 'I am extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements Julien Blanc has made about women. If he was allowed to perform in the UK I have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase. Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone (right) took the rare step of speaking out publicly to say she was lobbying Home Secretary Theresa May to refuse the self-styled dating coach a visa . 'Free speech is obviously hugely important, but with free speech comes responsibility. It is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Blanc should be barred from coming to the UK on the grounds that his promotion of violence against women is 'not conducive to the public good'. She said: 'It is important that respect for the laws on sexual assault and violence are upheld and that we send a clear message from Britain about zero tolerance of violence against women and girls.' Mr Blanc has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'. It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'. Video footage has emerged of him apparently grabbing women by the throat and threatening to commit suicide as a pick-up line . But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them. A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him urging men in the audience not to bother being 'polite' to Japanese women - but instead 'grab girls and shove their head' into their 'crotch.' More than 110,000 people have signed an online petition calling for Mr Blanc to be refused entry to the UK after he was forced to cut short a visit to Australia following widespread protests. Sarah Green, from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'His so-called pick up coaching promotes behaviour amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault. 'More broadly, he is part of a culture which trivialises abuse of women and racism. At worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them doesn't matter, and gives potential abusers the nod that such behaviour will not be taken seriously.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules. 'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.'","'Pick-up artist' Julien Blanc should be barred from Britain, says minister .

The beloved activist has been urging the US to step up its involvement and recently accused the US of being 'overly optimistic.' 'What significant reforms have been taken within the last 24 months?' she asked at a news conference last week. 'This is something the United States needs to think very seriously about as well.'

After the conference Michael Aung-Thwin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii, said that it is not custom for women to kiss in public, which is why Suu Kyi may have shied away. He told the International Business Times: 'It is not at all the custom (in Burma, also known as Burma) as it is here in Hawaii, and (Suu Kyi's) backing away is almost instinctive for most Burmese women, even those brought up in or have lived a long time in the West.'

'The democratic process in Burma is real,' Obama said. 'We recognise change is hard and you do not always move in a straight line but I'm optimistic.' During his two-night trip to Burma the US leader has also raised alarm over the direction of reforms, however, citing the cramping of freedom of expression, ongoing conflicts and the treatment of Burma's minority groups -- especially the Muslim Rohingya.

For his part, Obama has been battered domestically with poor approval numbers compounded by a thumping defeat for his Democrats in last week's mid-term elections. He has invested a large amount of political capital in Burma's transition from military rule and hopes his second visit will boost the process as elections edge closer. His visit has coincided with the start of a debate on constitutional reform, in particular over the clauses effectively blocking a presidential bid by Suu Kyi and reserving 25 percent of seats for the military.

"Teachers have lost their ‘morality’ and are cheating in exams and coursework to boost pupils’ grades, an expert has claimed. Professor Robert Coe said teachers were falling into ‘bad behaviour’ because they believed other schools were bending the rules. It coincided with revelations that whistleblowers reported teachers for telling students what to write and completing coursework for them. There are even claims of staff employing external consultants to finish projects. Teachers have been attacked for cheating exams and coursework to boost their pupils' grades, amid growing pressure to boost grades . In a separate move, exams watchdog . Ofqual this week opened an unprecedented anonymous online survey that . urges teachers to report experiences of improper tactics or cheating. The questions detail some 30 strategies thought to be used to boost . results. Professor Coe, an . expert in exams at Durham University and an Ofqual adviser, said: ‘I . think there is a big issue about morality here, professional morality . and how we have lost sight of the bigger picture. The Education Secretary Michael Gove came into office vowing to get a grip on falling examination standards . ‘It . is kind of [seen as] OK to do things you know are wrong because . everyone else is doing them: “Because I need to for the sake of my . school surviving Ofsted.” 'Bad behaviour drives out the good – if other . people are doing it, it is much harder to resist,’ he told the . Westminster Education Forum in London. The . former teacher also  suggested coursework marks could be capped . according to pupils’ exam scores, the Times Educational Supplement said. He called for more support for whistleblowers, saying: ‘When there is . cheating, people know there is cheating. So why don’t they tell us about . it? 'Partly because there are some strong incentives for them not to, . but  also because there isn’t really a mechanism.’ Freedom . of Information  disclosures show Ofqual has received 73 complaints from . whistleblowers since April 2012, many about controlled assessments – . coursework done under exam conditions in class. The complaints range . from inflated grades to altered marks in spoken exams. One . said pupils were ‘told what to write’ and another complained of . ‘inappropriate granting of extra time by the school’ during an A-level. Children will be taught by computers for large parts of the day at a controversial new school. Academy operator Ark is setting up a ‘blending learning’ school in London – where lessons are both online and with teachers. The idea, which will help cut costs, will see pupils spending significant periods learning from computer software packages. The school – to be known as the Ark Pioneer Academy – is expected to open in 2016 and is loosely based on a US scheme, which led to cuts in teacher numbers. Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, raised fears over possible job cuts and the loss of ‘quality education’. Ark yesterday denied the initiative would lead to fewer teachers or bigger classes and said plans are at a very early stage. A complaint headed ‘ICT’ alleged that an ‘external  consultant was employed to complete students’ work’. Education . Secretary Michael Gove’s GCSE and A-level reforms substantially reduce . controlled assessments. But some subjects will still need coursework to . test skills not assessed in written exams. Ofqual . will use its survey – which runs until July 18 – to cut out loopholes . as it finalises the new-look exams. It asks about practices such as . pupils learning mark schemes, the ‘hot housing’ of borderline students, . and giving ‘hints’. Glenys . Stacey, the head of Ofqual, said it had ‘heard increasingly . . . that . certain approaches are used which create unfair advantages’. Insisting . the survey was ‘not condemnatory’, she said: ‘We want teachers to be . open and honest with us . . . How much assistance are you going to give a . child? Is he going to memorise the mark scheme? Is that right, is it . wrong?

"It was a notebook that was meant to be burned. Ordered by his mother-in-law, perhaps a sign of their fractured relationship and his stormy marriage to her daughter, personal notes and 19 handwritten poems written by Dylan Thomas were meant to be destroyed. But the book was saved from being sent to the boiler, preserving some of the poet's most cryptic poems for decades. It has spent 70 years stashed in a brown paper bag in a desk drawer. Now, with its corrections and crossings-out it could help reveal what Thomas was thinking as he composed and revised his verses, and is expected to sell for £150,000 at auction. Insights: This newly discovered notebook written by the poet Dylan Thomas could help to clear up some of his most cryptic lines of poetry. It is up for sale at Sotheby's and is estimated to go for as much as £150,000 . A separate letter with the notebook, which is also to be sold, sheds some light on the lives of Thomas and his wife Caitlin, as shown in his dislike for her mother. Thomas and Caitlin had a passionate but often destructive relationship, marred by drinking and infidelity by two fiercely free-spirited individuals who were introduced in a London pub. They moved around the country, had affairs and had three children who were often not shielded from their parents' passionate rows. One scholar told The Times that the notebook, which goes on sale at Sotheby's in London on December 9, as 'the most exciting discovery since his [Thomas's] death in 1953.' Written up during the a burst of creativity during the 1930s, the notebook contains early versions of poems before he met his wife, which finally appeared in Thomas's first two collections of poetry. According to the Sotheby's catalogue notes: 'This notebook was written during a crucial year in Thomas's life and work, when he firmly established a place for himself in the literary world. 'It was a period marked by two major events: his move to London in November 1934 and the publication of his first collection, 18 Poems, the following month. 'This notebook shows that he continued to write during his months in London, but his most intense burst of creativity came when he left the city and its distractions.' Many of Thomas's published poems were written during this period, often material he had filled his notebooks with after finishing a job as a journalist. Great writer: Thomas left the notebook at his mother-in-law's home and it survived despite her when the servant she instructed to burn it and Thomas's other papers decided to rescue it and keep it . Thomas and his wife Caitlin had a fiery relationship, both known for their rows, infidelity and heavy drinking . It was left at the home of Yvonne Macnamara, Thomas's mother-in-law, with whom he had a poor relationship, and survived despite her wishes. The pair did not get on, possibly because she had gained some insight into his relationship with her daughter which saw the couple having numerous fights fuelled by alcohol. His mother-in-law told Louie King, a member of her household staff, to burn it in the kitchen boiler along with a lot more of the poet's notes. Instead he rescued it and it has remained in his family ever since. A handwritten note by Mr King, seen by The Times, which is accompanying the notebook in the lot, reads: 'This book of poetry by Dylan Thomas was with a lot of papers given to me to burn in the kitchen boiler. 'I saved it and forgot all about it until I read of his death.' Thomas's relationship with his mother-in-law is revealed by a letter which is also to be sold at Sotheby's next month. In a letter to his friend and fellow writer Charles Fisher, Thomas wrote: 'This flat English country levels the intelligence, planes down the imagination, narrows the a's, my ears belch up old wax and passages of misunderstood music. 'I sit and hate my mother-in-law, glowering at her from corners and grumbling about her in the sad, sticky quiet of the lavatory.' 'The sad, sticky quiet of the lavatory': A letter in which Thomas alludes to his dislike of his mother-in-law. It is also up for sale at Sotheby's next month and is expected to go for between £2,000 and £2,5000 . The bounced cheque written by Thomas - a sign of his drinking as it was given to the landlord of his local pub . The lives of Dylan Thomas and wife Caitlin were depicted in 2008 film The Edge of Love with Sienna Miller . Thomas met blonde Caitlin Macnamara in a pub in London in 1936 and the couple married a year later, having three children. But their relationship was fractured - marked by passion, heavy drinking, arguments and infidelity. Thomas once described their marriage as 'red, raw bleeding meat' but it was understood that Caitlin was the true rebel of the partnership. The couple moved between London, Wales, Oxford and Ireland - buying a house in Wales that would eventually see Thomas's reputation catch up with him. Caitlin Thomas-Fazio was known as the true rebel in the marriage to Thomas, and died in 1994 . In 1945 a jealous husband fired a machine gun at the house, thinking he was having an affair with his wife. Whether he actually did has been long disputed, although his wife later conceded the man may have been cross because they had been drinking so much of his money. So notorious was the incident that it was made into a film The Edge of Love, starring Sienna Miller. Their daughter Aeronwy described an upbringing where she often had to look after her younger brother Colm while her parents went out drinking. The poet was also said to be frustrated with his limited means as a writer - supplementing his income with broadcasts on BBC which saw him rise in popularity. He was also said to be angered by the way his wife kept their home, which had no running water or electricity. They also had numerous unpaid bills. Thomas would frequently travel to America in the 1950s and Caitlin later found out he had a fling, which became the subject of many rows between the couple. But in 1953 fell ill while drinking. At the time the poet claimed he had drunk 16 whiskies. Despite the rows and affairs, it was Caitlin who rushed to his bedside and was with him when he died. She was so overcome with grief that she had to be put in a strait jacket and taken to a mental health hospital. It is said that his latest mistress was also at the bed, causing Caitlin to fly into a rage. The sale of the notebook and letter comes after a pair of bounced cheques given by Thomas to the landlord of his local pub sold at auction for £3,750. The two cheques, both made out for £3 and signed by the Welsh writer, were given to Phil Richards who was the landlord of the Cross House Inn in Thomas's home town of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. They went under the hammer at Bonhams in Knightsbridge, London, fetching more than several books of his verse which were also sold that day.","Notebook of handwritten Dylan Thomas poems was meant to be burned .

"The sight of Colin Firth in a wet white shirt left millions of women swooning and transformed the actor into a household name. Playing the brooding Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, he dived into a lake and swam underwater before emerging with his clothes dripping and clinging to his body. But the screenwriter of the BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel has now revealed that the ‘wet shirt scene’ should have actually been the ‘Mr Darcy full-frontal nudity scene’. Andrew Davies said the 'wet shirt' scene with Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice was intended as the 'Mr Darcy full-frontal nudity scene' but the shirt was added later . The writer said he wanted to reveal Mr Darcy's 'animal' side by showing him diving into the lake . Andrew Davies said he did not know why the shirt was introduced but that it might be because Colin Firth was trying to hide his ‘love handles’. ‘I intended it as a funny little scene about social embarrassment,’ Mr Davies said. ‘Here are two people and one is soaking wet and neither of them refers to it. ‘In fact it seems to have affected women in quite a different way - and who am I to complain?’ He said he wanted to show Darcy’s ‘animal’ side by having him dive naked into a lake. ‘The wet shirt scene was intended to be total male frontal nudity because that was how guys went bathing in those days. But it was not for titillation - it was about nature and culture, to put it in a very grand way,’ he added. ‘It was my notion that Darcy was an actual man but he spent all his time being constrained by the demands of society. Colin Firth has filmed nude scenes since, such as this one in Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You . Mr Davies said the famous scene was about 'social embarrassment' ‘In those particular circumstances he had just spent weeks and months in London being polite with a group of very stuffy people, he was about to host a house party for the same stuffy group of people and he had a few hours in which he could be blissfully alone. ‘He could be blissfully himself. It was a hot day. He arrives at his lake. There is nobody to stop him. It is his property. I thought he would strip off completely and dive into that other element and become just a creature, an animal for once. ‘I don’t know the reason why it (the shirt) came to be. Maybe it was felt it would take too long to get him dressed, although they could have just shown him diving in naked and then cut to later. ‘It may have been something about Colin’s anxiety about love handles or something.’ He told the audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival that he had deliberately written physical elements into the screenplay of the Austen classic. ‘I had a kind of project to try to emphasise that these people have bodies as well as brains and little bits of wit and irony and so on,’ he said. ‘I devised as many scenes as possible in which people were getting dressed, getting undressed, having a bath, girls combing their hair - what we call hair and shoulder scenes.’ It has previously been revealed that Colin Firth never actually dived during filming. A stuntman performed the dive amid health and safety fears that the actor might catch a water-borne disease from the lake. And footage of him swimming underwater was actually filmed in a tank at Ealing Studios in West London, hundreds of miles from Lyme Park in Cheshire which was the location for Pemberley in the 1995 BBC adaptation.","Andrew Davies said he wanted it to be the 'Mr Darcy full-frontal nudity scene'

"It has been giving Britain’s aristocracy advice on social etiquette for more than 200 years. Now Debrett’s is branching out from producing guides on elegant manners and will start offering courses in social skills to jobseekers. The publishing house is offering residential and day courses - starting at a £1,000 - to a generation of young people who struggle to make eye contact or proffer a firm handshake. The publishing house is to offer courses to young people who lack social skills needed in the workplace . Debrett’s developed its programme on ‘social intelligence’ for under-30s after business leaders raised serious issues around young people entering the modern workplace. Its research highlights concerns over the employability of graduates and school leavers who have no idea how to behave at work. Debrett’s says that ‘manners, social intelligence, personal presentation and impact can be as important as academic qualifications. ‘With so much focus on exam results and the hectic informality of modern family life and technology, social graces can be a casualty.’ The courses come amid accusations that schools and universities are so focused on academic targets that they are failing to produce rounded graduates. Instead they are turning out young people who are shy and awkward after spending all their time on the internet or mobiles, who lack the ability to spell or write a letter, and are unable to get through a day without regular online checks on what their friends are up to. Louise Ruell , Debrett’s director of training, said: ‘Young employees need to differentiate themselves beyond their academic achievements. Employers listed dependency on the internet and text jargon as some of the reasons why young people are so ill equipped in the workplace . The research clearly shows that this is often lacking.’ Ninety per cent of the senior executives on a panel at Debrett’s believe social skills are just as important, or even more important, than academic skills. Some 63 per cent said their office juniors often lack any such skills at all. A quarter said they had even embarrassed them in front of clients. Meanwhile, one in four business leaders complained that prospective candidates had inflated expectations regarding salaries and career progression and were over-confident and formulaic in interviews. Misplaced informality was another complaint. Some 21per cent of employers said young employees had dressed inappropriately for the workplace or had drunk too much at work social events. Amelia Higham, managing director of Dovetail Insurance, said: ‘There is so much emphasis on passing written exams that there’s no room for them to be taught life skills. ‘Throw in text jargon and overuse of the internet to communicate and you’ve got a generation which cannot connect one to one. Being a nice person to do business with is crucial no matter what business you are in.’ She said she would prefer a job applicant to have good social skills rather than perfect academic grades. ‘We have just had a chap in. On paper he looked fabulous - he had brilliant qualifications. On the second day he had to write a letter - he couldn’t do it. It was appalling really. ‘It’s the whole ethos of this generation - they miss a trick with their attitude of expectation. ‘We all expected to do rough jobs during the summer holidays or whatever, pick fruit, knock on doors selling things, working in a factory. Those jobs taught life skills. ‘Every teenager should have to do some sort of summer job. It would teach them not to rely on the bank of mum and dad and help their development as well.’ The publishing house considers itself an expert on 'knowing the who's who and what's what of today's Britain' Almost three quarters of the 58 business leaders in the survey did agree that a preoccupation with technology hurts the social skills of young employees, affecting their ability to build relationships with clients. Even firms whose business is in the digital world are concerned. Linford Haggie, managing director at Graphic Alliance, a digital advertising agency, said: ‘We want candidates who live and breathe the digital world but too many are over-reliant on technology. ‘They are shy and scared. They don’t want to pick up a phone and have lost any people skills. I don’t blame them, no, they need to have the working world demystified and schools and businesses have a part to play.’","Publishing house, Debrett, to offer £1,000 'social intelligence' courses to under 30s .

"Though he is condemned to spend the rest of his life behind bars and likely in solitary confinement, Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman has a prominent online presence with thousands of followers. The Blind Sheik, an Egyptian Muslim leader who was sentenced to life in prison for orchestrating the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, has recruited family members to operate various social media page, from Facebook to YouTube to Twitter. Part of the sheik’s message is rallying Islamic extremists to rally for his release from prison; another is keeping his followers abreast of his teachings. Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman's Facebook page, which has since been taken down, had more than 5,000 'likes' and was full of videos, photographs, and messages to his Islamic extremist followers . The Radical Muslim, pictured in 1993, is currently service a life sentence in a North Carolina prison for his part in the World Trade Center bombings, and plotting to attack the United Nations and the Holland Tunnel . According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, which published a report on the Sheik’s internet presence earlier this year, the Blind Sheik’s social media accounts are run by his sons and other devotees out of Egypt. The cleric's sons, as well as other radical followers in Egypt, have been updating the felon's Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages . The February 26 report was recently picked up by the Washington Guardian. The MEMRI, a non-partisan and non-profit organization, reports that the postings are operated through a server in Chicago. His own official website, written in Arabic, was created in June of 2010, according to an IP address look-up. ‘The word “right” – Official Site professing sheik Dr Omar Abdul Rahman’ reads the banner across the convicted terrorist’s home page. According to the report, one of the sheik’s sons, Ammar Omar Abdel-Rahman, runs the website, which also includes documents that claim to support the innocence of his father. More than 8,000 people have signed the petition to seek his release from prison. Abdel-Rahman’s Twitter page shows tweets that date to as recently as April 10. ‘Present of the “Shura” agrees delegation to visit Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman in America,’ the latest tweet, written in Arabic, reads. His Twitter account has more than 9,400 followers. The sheik’s YouTube page was created August 2, 2011, and has a mere 56 subscribers as of Monday morning, with videos entitled ‘Two deputies of parliament demand to be released’ and ‘Sheik Oamr Abdel-Rahman leads (encourages) Egyptians to overthrow Mubarak.’ A commenter on the video responded: ‘Oh God, give us victory over those who do wrong.’ Firefighters and rescue crews work outside the World Trade Center in February 1993 after the car bomb . The parking garage of the Twin Towers was bombed in the February 1993 attack, leaving six dead . MailOnline could not verify the authenticity of the sites, though the Facebook page seems to have been taken down. Facebook told MailOnline in a statement: 'The page was reported and taken down because it is in violation of our terms of usage, specifically that pages will be taken down which praise or support or represent terrorism.' Steven Stalinsky, the author of the MEMRI report, notes that there was a recent cry for the sheik’s release by Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri, released the day before last year’s deadly attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The attack left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. The now-defunct Facebook page also showed Al-Zawahiri in a video demanding that the Blind Sheik be released in exchange for an American the terrorist organization kidnapped. ‘By the grace of Allah, (we) have announced that we will not release the American captive Warren Weinstein, Allah willing, until the Crusaders release our captives.’ Weinstein, a 72-year-old American aid worker was kidnapped in 2011 in the eastern city of Lahore in Pakistan. In an appeal last fall, the hostage said that President Obama and the American government ‘have shown no interest in my case.’ The most recent tweet from Abdel-Rahman's sons and followers was from April 10 . The sheik's YouTube page has only 56 followers, and nine videos posted; it was created in August of 2011 . The sheik's website, which is originally written in Arabic, has a petition for his release from prison . The site also comments on the hostage crisis at the Ain Amenas gas installation in Algeria in January, where an al-Qaeda linked terrorist group held more than 750 workers – Algerians, Americans, and others – hostage. At least 68 foreigners were killed in the natural gas plant attack. Abdel-Rahman, the former leader of Gama’at al-Islamia, was arrested July 1, 1993 in Brooklyn, five months after the first World Trade Center attack that left six dead. He was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to life in prison a year later. His organization, which means simply ‘Islamic Group,’ was classified as a terrorist association by U.S. officials. The sheik was moved from a prison in Springfield, Missouri, to North Carolina in 2007 where he continues to serve out his term. Along with conspiring to blow up the World Trade Center, Abdel-Rahman was convicted of plotting to blow up both the headquarters of the United Nations and the Holland Tunnel. His former defense attorney, Lynne F. Stewart, 73, served two years in prison for helping her client smuggle information from prison to his group of followers in Egypt.","Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman has been in prison since the 1990s but has used his sons and other devout followers in Egypt to run YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter pages .

"Children’s health is being harmed because academies and free schools are allowed to opt out of serving healthy lunches to their pupils, one of the country’s top doctors has warned. Professor Terence Stephenson believes that two million children are at risk of obesity because of the government’s divisive and ‘irresponsible’ policy. Prof Stephenson, a leading paediatrician, is the chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) – the professional body for the UK’s 250,000 working doctors – also said that the schools were setting young people a bad example. Academies and free schools are not obliged to comply with the same nutrient-based standards for pupils' meals as grant-maintained schools (File photographs) Academies and free schools are not obliged to comply with the same nutrient-based standards for pupils' meals as grant-maintained schools. He told The Observer: ‘It's damaging children's health. Allowing children in academies and free schools to be exposed to unhealthy choices, unhealthy foods and unhealthy diets when there's still huge concern in this country about obesity in children is definitely a backward step. 'Too many schools have been allowed to withdraw from this excellent, evidence-based system. ‘It just doesn't make sense to have a “them and us” policy on something as important as school food. If it's the right policy for children in maintained schools, it's the right policy for all children. It's irresponsible to have a two-tier policy on this.’ It was in 2010 that Michael Gove, the education secretary, to grant exemption to academies from the standards, which were introduced by Labour after the television cook Jamie Oliver showed in his 2005 programme Jamie's School Dinners how much poor food was dished up in schools. Last week, Oliver urged ministers to stop the ‘madness’ of fast food outlets opening near schools. Celebrity cook Jamie Oliver serves up a healthy school dinner to pupils from Ealdham Primary School, Greenwich as part of his programme Jamie's Dream School . In 2013, the AoMRC issued a report on obesity with 10 key recommendations, Prof Stephenson said that he was ‘disappointed’ and ‘frustrated’ at the complete lack of progress on five of its suggestions including a crackdown on junk-food advertising and introduction of a 20% tax on sugary drinks to reduce consumption. Linda Cregan, the chief executive of the Children's Food Trust, said that it believed every pupil should receive healthy, nutritious food while at school. Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove joins the Breakfast Club at Lauriston School, Hackney. in 2010, Mr Gove granted exemption to academies from the standards, which were introduced by Labour . But the Department for Education dismissed Prof Stephenson's concerns. ‘There is no evidence whatsoever that academies and free schools serve less healthy food than council-run schools. It is utterly disingenuous and untrue to claim the academies programme is harming children's health,’ a spokesman said. ‘A survey by the Children's Food Trust found 99% of academies have voluntarily agreed to follow the food standards, even though they are not required to do so. By contrast many council-run schools – unlike the best academies – are failing to provide healthy options, instead continuing to serve fried food, fizzy drinks and pizza. ‘Instead of pretending there is a problem with a particular type of school, we should concentrate on improving food in all schools,’ the DfE spokesman said.","Schools setting bad example for young people by poor nutrition .

"Pfizer last night signalled that its £63billion takeover of British rival AstraZeneca may cost thousands of jobs. The US drugs firm told MPs its planned takeover would ‘reduce overlaps’ between the firms and create ‘significant financial synergies’. The language is business shorthand for cost savings – such as laying off workers. US firm Pfizer - maker of blockbuster drugs like Viagra and Lipitor - claims its takeover of UK rival AstraZeneca would create a giant British-based drugs company . The warning came in evidence handed to . MPs ahead of chief executive Ian Read appearing before the business . committee of the Commons today. Pfizer . insists its pledges of a long-term commitment to Britain are ‘tangible, . legally binding and represent significant investment in the economy, . skilled workforce and knowledge base of the UK’. Business Secretary Vince Cable will be grilled by MPs tomorrow over the planned takeover . Downing Street declined to say whether Government lawyers accepted that the pledges were legally watertight. ‘We . are taking a very robust approach on this because in the event of there . being an agreement between shareholders we want the very best possible . deal for the UK, and we will be exploring every way of getting that,’ said a No 10 spokesman. Ministers . are under pressure to order an inquiry into the deal, following . warnings that it could have a major impact on British science and jobs. Authorities . in the United States and in Sweden, where AstraZeneca has 5,900 staff, . are also concerned about the potential impact on jobs. Business Secretary Vince Cable will be pressed by MPs today over whether he plans to call in the deal for scrutiny. Astra boss Pascal Soirot will also face questioning about the likely impact on his firm of any takeover. Labour said Pfizer’s promises were ‘not worth the paper they’re written on’. And . Sweden’s finance minister Anders Borg has warned Mr Cameron the pledges . should be taken with a ‘sackful of salt’ as Pfizer reneged on similar . promises on jobs and investment after its takeover of Pharmacia. A . poll last night found that just 14 per cent of the public believe the . takeover is in Britain’s interests. Only 19 per cent of people think . ministers are doing enough to protect jobs and skills. The . Survation poll for the Unite union found that 74 per cent believe a . deal on this scale should be subject to a ‘public interest test’ by . Government – a move that would require a change in the law. In . its evidence to the Commons business committee last night Pfizer . repeated its pledge to continue investment in the UK for at least five . years. The Financial Times lent its weight yesterday to the growing criticism of Pfizer’s attempts to take over AstraZeneca. In its leader column, the influential business newspaper suggested directors at AstraZeneca had a duty to employees and customers as well as to shareholders. It said: ‘One of the most troubling aspects of Pfizer’s bid is its lack of evident commercial logic. Pfizer’s dealmaking history is a deeply dispiriting one. ‘The group has a reputation for delivering returns ... through cost-crunching acquisitions.’ The firm will face . questions today over how it will reconcile its pledges to Britain with . its nod to shareholders that the deal will result in massive job cuts . and savings. David Rutley, Tory MP for Macclesfield, where Astra employs . 2,000 staff, last night urged Pfizer to offer further assurances. Mr . Rutley said: ‘Our science base is a vital national asset. This is an . uncertain time for employees and I want Pfizer to put their cards on the . table and provide stronger, more enduring commitments.’ City sources are expecting Pfizer to return with a higher bid this week of potentially £60 a share. An . offer, worth £10 a share less, has been rejected by the Astra board of . directors. Mr Read could lose out on a £70million shares windfall if the . controversial takeover collapses. As .

"A federal judge in Washington ordered the U.S. military on Friday to at least temporarily stop force-feeding a hunger striking prisoner at the Guantanamo Bay naval base. The order from U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler bars the force feeding of prisoner Abu Wa'el Dhiab at least until a hearing on Wednesday. It also directs the military from forcibly removing the prisoner from his cell at the U.S. base in Cuba. Hungry: A judged ordered the military to not force-feed GITMO detainee Abu Wa'el Dhiab, who is on a hunger strike . The temporary restraining order is in place at least until the judge can hold a hearing to determine when the U.S. government will turn over the Syrian prisoner's medical records and any videotapes of the force-feeding procedure he has undergone while on hunger strike. Lawyers for the prisoner have challenged his treatment during the hunger strike as part of a broader legal challenge of his overall confinement and are ultimately seeking a court order for his release from Guantanamo. They welcomed Kessler's order on force feeding as an important step. 'This is a major crack in Guantanamo's years-long effort to oppress prisoners and to exercise total control over information about the prison,' said Cori Crider, an attorney with the British legal rights group Reprieve that represents the prisoner. GITMO: Several detainees at GITMO have resorted to hunger strikes, at which point the military has force-fed the prisoners in many cases . A Defense Department spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, said the military only feeds prisoners against their will to keep them alive and follows all laws when it does so. 'We will, of course, comply with the judge's order here,' he said by email. Prisoners at Guantanamo have engaged in hunger strikes for years to protest their confinement. The military force feeds prisoners a liquid nutrient mix through a nasal tube against their will when doctors at the base determine it is necessary. Officials no longer disclose how many of the 154 prisoners at the base are on hunger strike and meet the guidelines for force feeding. U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler's order also directs the military from forcibly removing the prisoner from his cell . Dhiab, 42, has been held without charge at Guantanamo since August 2002. His lawyers say he has been cleared for release and media in Uruguay say he is one of a handful of Syrians held at the base who are being considered for resettlement in the South American country.

"A shocking one in six inmates released from Guantanamo Bay prison have returned to terrorism, according to a U.S. intelligence report made public last week. Of the 603 prisoners set free from the military facility, 100 are confirmed to have rejoined jihad against the West. These include 17 ex-detainees that are dead, 27 that are in custody and 56 that are still free. A further 74 former inmates at the notorious prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are suspected of returning to terrorism, including two that are dead, 25 that are in custody and 47 that are free. Secure: The sun rises over the razor-wired detention compound at Guantanamo Bay, located at the U.S. Naval Base in Cuba . Alarmingly, three of the ex-Gitmo inmates confirmed as re-engaging in terrorism, and two suspected of terrorist activity, were released into the community in the past eight months, according to the report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Thomas Joscelyn, a terrorism analyst . with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News that releasing prisoners from the detention facility increases the danger they will return to jihad. 'Once a detainee is transferred from . Guantanamo to his home country, or a third country, there is no . guarantee that appropriate security measures will be put in place,' he said. 'Thus, even detainees who are known to be very dangerous have rejoined the fight after leaving Guantanamo.' Detainees: There are currently 164 inmates held at the notorious prison. Of the 603 prisoners released from the military facility, 100 are confirmed (and another 74 suspected) to have returned to terrorism . The ODNI report, which is released every six months, also warned against the unconditional release of Guantanamo inmates, stating there was a risk they would 'reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities'. It additionally highlighted the dangers posed by transferring ex-prisoners to countries with ongoing conflicts and active terrorist recruitment. In May, President Obama announced he was lifting a ban on the transfer of Guantanamo prisoners to Yemen, where the al Qaeda affiliate is seen as a major threat. He also pledged to renewed push to close the detention facility, which has recently provoked controversy over its restraint chair, operating theatre and force-feeding processes. Restraint chair: The detention facility has recently provoked controversy over its restraint chair, operating theatre and force-feeding processes . Force-fed: During hunger strikes, inmates are strapped to a chair and kept alive with a liquid nutrient mix fed through a nasal tub - a process known as 'enteral feeding' Feeding tube: The controversial procedure has been described by medical experts as unethical and dangerous . There are currently 164 inmates held at the prison, which costs the U.S. Defense Department around $150million a year to run. During a recent hunger strike, more than 100 inmates . were strapped to a chair and kept alive with a liquid nutrient mix fed through . a nasal tub - a process known as 'enteral feeding'. Under the procedure, described by medical experts as unethical and dangerous, a prisoner who refuses nine successive meals or whose body weight drops significantly is offered a twice-daily can of a nutritional supplement, Ensure. If he refuses, guards shackle him into the chair by his . arms, head and feet, and a nurse inserts the tube up his nose, down the . back of his throat and into his stomach. Last month, William Lietzau, the Pentagon official in charge of Guantanamo Bay, admitted that, in hindsight, he believed the notorious detention camp should never have been built.","603 inmates have been released from Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba .

"Universities have been accused of social engineering after drawing up admissions schemes that favour applicants from poorer backgrounds. Instead of selecting students solely on merit, four institutions – Edinburgh, Leeds, Bristol and Birmingham – have devised systems which boost the grades of children from low-income homes. In some cases, this can see a disadvantaged child with three Bs at A-level winning a place over a privately-educated child with three A*s. Controversial: Universities have been accused of social engineering after drawing up plans to actively favour pupils from poorer backgrounds. Leeds university is one of those which has drawn up points systems which boost the exam grades of children from low-income homes. Critics said the system could discriminate against middle class children whose parents have sacrificed a lot to give them a good education. Ministers have previously urged universities to consider backgrounds – or ‘the contextual data’ – when deciding whether to offer a place, and most do this on a case-by-case basis. Speaking out: In May, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said universities should take 'into account the impact of background in assessing university applications; to create a 'fair race' for degree places . But the latest plans are different – and more controversial – because they give each applicant a numerical score based partly on social background. Freedom of Information requests reveal the points awarded by Edinburgh for going to a very low-performing school boost the score of a child with three Bs beyond that of one with three A*s from a better school. At Leeds, the system allowed medicine applicants to be given so many points for coming from a poor area that three B grades effectively became three A*s. It was suspended earlier this year. Bristol is implementing a points system where pupils from poor schools ‘will be given an automatic weighting to their total academic score’, while Birmingham has drawn up a similar policy but is not yet using it. Tim Hands, headmaster of the independent Magdalen College School in Oxford, said admissions which scored contextual data could be ‘bordering on generic discrimination’. ‘Students deserve transparency and accuracy, not hasty measures which risk appearing subservient demonstrations of political correctness.’ But Rebecca Gaukroger, head of admissions at Edinburgh, said: ‘We don’t accept that the scoring of academic grades or contextual data undermines the holistic assessment of applications.’","Edinburgh, Leeds, Bristol and Birmingham have drawn up the plans .

"When Japan hosts the summer Olympics in 2020, prime minister Shinzo Abe is determined to make it an event to remember. And what better way, he claims, than to include robotic competitors to show off the world’s technical achievements. Mr Abe made the comments during a tour of robotics factories in Tokyo and Saitama, where he also announced the creation of a taskforce to treble the size of the Japanese robotics industry. Prime minister Shinzo Abe made the comments during a tour of robotics factories in Tokyo and Saitama, where he also announced the creation of a taskforce to treble the size of the industry . The industry could help revitalise the country's economy, and Mr Abe hopes to increase its market for machines to 2.4 trillion yen (£13.8 billion or $24 billion). 'In 2020, I would like to gather all of the world's robots and aim to hold an Olympics where they compete in technical skills,' Mr Abe said. 'We want to make robots a major pillar of our economic growth strategy. 'We would like to set up a council on making a robotic revolution a reality in order to aid Japan's growth.' There are also a number of smaller competitive events such as the RoboCup (pictured) and contests such as the Darpa Robotics Challenge . This isn’t the first time that a robotics competition has been organised on a large-scale. In 2010, China launched a humanoid battle that included 16 events. There are also a number of smaller competitive events such as the RoboCup and the Darpa Robotics Challenge. Meanwhile, Switzerland is currently gearing up to host the world’s first cyborg Olympics in 2016. Japan is currently a leader in the sector. The country recently unveiled a chatty humanoid robot that its makers say can understand people's emotions. Other robotic accomplishments include a realistic robotic newsreaders and a droid with reflexes so fast it can never be beaten at the game 'rock, paper, scissors'. In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots. Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions. Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming.

"Tiny twin babies born just a week before the legal abortion limit have made a full recovery, despite doctors warning their parents to expect the worst. Nichola Baird, 30, from Hebburn in Tyne and Wear, gave birth to twin boys Kyle and Jake  last September. The boys arrived just 23 weeks into the pregnancy, and were barely the size of a hand. The current legal limit in the UK for an abortion is 24 weeks with research showing babies born before this time rarely survive. Scroll down for video . Kyle and Jake French were born prematurely, one week before the legal abortion limit of 24 weeks . Mrs Nichola Baird, 30, and husband Colin, 42, were told to expect the worse when their sons Kyle and Jake were born 16 weeks early . But the twins were born weighing a little over 1lb each - the equivalent of a bag of sugar. The average baby weighs about 7.5lb at birth. The twins were born at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, Newcastle but had to be taken to critical care units where specialists worked to save the tiny brothers' lives. But due to bed shortages the twins had to be separated and were sent to separate hospitals. Kyle, born at 1lb 7oz, was taken to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, while his brother Jake, born at 1lb 6oz, was bound for Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI). Mrs Baird was also taken to the RVI to undergo an emergency blood transfusion after losing so much blood. She only got to see Kyle when he was two-weeks-old, with partner Colin, 42, splitting his time to make sure he visited both his sons. Kyle and Jake required operations to close  valves in their tiny hears, which are closed in babies born full-term. Kyle also needed a major operation on his bowel . Mrs Baird said she went into a 'complete panic' when she realised she was going into labour so early . On countless occasions before and after the birth, the couple were told to prepare for the worst because the twins' premature birth had led to a series of complications. Both boys underwent emergency heart surgery to close   valves, while Kyle also needed a major operation on his bowel. Mrs Baird, a sales manager, said she was 'terrified' when she realised she was going into labour weeks before she was due. She said: 'I went into a complete panic when I realised I was going into labour so early. 'I'm quite an organised person so to have this thrown on me caught me off guard. 'We were told to expect the worst because the babies were born so prematurely. 'The doctors said before I gave birth that babies are classed as not viable until 24 weeks so prepare yourselves for bad news. 'I felt as though they were being treated like foetuses. 'Not being able to hold your children when they are born was the worst feeling, we couldn't even touch them at first because their skin was so weak.' Mr and Mrs Baird, who have been together for four years, were overjoyed when they were told at their 12 week scan that they were expecting twins. Mrs Baird said it was 'extra special' when she and her husband were allowed to cuddle their sons for the first time. She said: 'They are a miracle. Looking back now, I realise how lucky we all were' But the joy turned to fear when, just three weeks after their 20-week scan, their baby boys arrived 16 weeks early. Mrs Baird was told that Jake would need major surgery on his bowel and had to be fitted with a stoma bag to collect his waste, at just 13 days old. Things got worse as both babies then underwent an emergency operation at 25 days old to close their heart valves, which usually shut in the womb. Mrs Baird said: 'Doctors gave Kyle a 50/50 chance to even survive the operation and all we could do was pray and cling on to every ounce of hope we had. 'It was never an option for us to consider what would happen if we lost them. 'We took it day by day and hour by hour. 'Afterwards, they were both left really poorly from the operations and not knowing what was going to happen was awful. 'But when I held them both for the first time, it was extra special because I had waited for so long to give them a cuddle.' After  17 weeks in hospital, the boys were finally allowed home. Jake was discharged on his original due date, January 12, and Kyle followed a week later. The boys were born so early they were barely the size of a hand and weighed just over 1lb, the equivalent of a bag of sugar. They now weigh just over 18 pounds and aside from routine oxygen checks they are healthy . Mrs Baird says she feels lucky that her children are alive and thanks Royal Victoria Infirmary - one of the hospitals where the boys were treated - for their help . The pair now both weigh just over 18 pounds and aside from routine oxygen checks made by a community nurse, they are living normal lives. Mrs Baird said she feels extremely grateful her children are alive and thanked the hospitals for their help. She said 'They are a miracle. Looking back now, I realise how lucky we all were. 'We could have not got through the past months without the help of the Tiny Lives charity at the RVI in Newcastle. 'They gave us the support and guidance we needed when Colin and I were at our lowest, they were incredible.'","Nichola Baird, 30, was overjoyed when  told she was expecting twins .

"Climate change could increase the number and severity of global conflicts, according to a report from former US military generals. This is because it might make certain regions uninhabitable, and it will also open up more trade and military routes between countries. In a report published this year they explain how a warming climate may have implications for national security, and they believe action needs to be taken. A report by former US military officials says the US should prepare for security issues from climate change (stock image shown). Environmental changes could increase the chances of threats. Poverty, population migration and more could raise the chances of conflict, . In the report, titled National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change, the CNA Advisory Board - a group of retired officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps - said there could be upcoming threats associated with climate change, reports Forbes. They expressed surprise that climate change remains such a polarising issue, despite being widely accepted as a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later. Earlier this week President Barack Obama struck a landmark deal with China that would see both countries significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades. Under the agreement, America pledged to cut between 26 and 28 per cent of the level of its carbon emissions set in 2005 by 2025 as part of the global fight against climate change. Chinese President Xi Jinping also said he would aim to cap his country's emissions by 2030. In order to successfully accomplish this, he said 20 percent of China's energy needs will come from alternative sources, such as solar power and wind energy, by that year. ‘We are dismayed that discussions of climate change have become so polarising and have receded from the arena of informed public discourse and debate,' says the report. They continue: ‘The potential security ramifications of global climate change should be serving as catalysts for cooperation and change.’ ‘Instead, climate change impacts are already accelerating instability in vulnerable areas of the world and are serving as catalysts for conflict.’ They say that actions taken by the US and the international community have been insufficient to deal with the projected effects by climate change. These, they say, could increase things such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability and social tensions - ‘conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.’ The report also says melting Arctic ice (stock image shown) could open new military  and trade routes. It could lead to 'conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence' The report says that actions taken by the US and the international community have been insufficient to deal with climate change. Extreme weather is already causing prolonged droughts and flooding, resulting in food shortages and population migration (stock image shown of immigrants fleeing unrest in Libya in 2011) They explain how in areas such as Africa, Asia and the Middle East, the impacts of climate change are already being seen. Extreme weather is causing prolonged droughts and flooding, resulting in food shortages and population migration. And in particular they say the projected impacts of climate change ‘could be detrimental to military readiness, strain base resilience both at home and abroad, and may limit our ability to respond to future demands.’ The report recommends that the US should take a global leadership role in preparing for climate change. And they should also prepare for the potential to carry out increased military operations in the Arctic as ice begins to melt. This may open new routes between countries - such as Alaska and Northern Europe - that may change how military can be deployed.","Report says US should prepare for security issues from climate change .

"It is known as the most elaborate and beautiful watch in the world – a £15million masterpiece of breathtaking craftsmanship and exquisite design. But the 1933 Patek Philippe which came to be known as the Graves Supercomplication was said to be blighted by a deadly curse. The so-called holy grail of timepieces brought a litany of bad luck for multi-millionaire US banker Henry Graves Jr throughout the years he owned it. Qatari Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al-Thani (left) died just days before the 'Holy Grail' of watches (right) he once owned was sold for a record £15million . Now the curse appears to have struck again. Hours before an undisclosed buyer bought it at auction in Geneva for a record 23million Swiss francs, time had already run out for the man who put it up anonymously for sale. The seller was subsequently revealed to be Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al-Thani, hailed as one of the world’s richest men – who died mysteriously at his London home on Sunday. The 48-year-old Qatari royal privately bought the fabulous watch 15 years ago for $11million. It became part of a massive art collection he built up through a love of fine works and access to a seemingly bottomless pit of money. No details were made public about his death but it was widely reported he had died ‘unexpectedly’ at his London residence.The watch’s provenance and ‘curse’ was chronicled yesterday in the Daily Mail. The timepiece was named after the American businessman who commissioned it, Henry Graves (right), who ended up claiming it had brought him nothing but bad luck . In 1925 Graves secretly approached Patek Philippe to make him the planet’s ‘most complicated watch’, with two faces and 24 complications, or extra settings. One face shows the phases of the moon, another the New York sunset and sunrise times. It has an alarm, a stopwatch and perpetual calendar. But seven months after Graves took possession, his best friend died. Months later his son George was killed in a car crash, the second of his sons to die this way. One day aboard his luxury yacht with his daughter Gwendolen, he stared morosely at the watch and declared: ‘Such things bring one nothing but trouble.’ Had he tossed it into the ocean that day, the curse would have ended. After his death, the watch passed without issue through the hands of his daughter, grandson, an Illinois industrialist and a museum. Then came the Sheikh.The Qatari prince, one of the most powerful and influential figures in the art world, long admired the watch and kept it as part of his personal collection. That included anything and everything that caught his eye, from great paintings to fast, beautiful cars. He was a cousin of Qatar’s current emir, and was responsible for developing libraries and museums, for which he acquired a staggering catalogue of artworks while promoting Qatari culture. According to The Art Newspaper he spent more on art in an eight-year spree from 1997 than any known individual. But two years ago the High Court in London froze some of his assets in a legal wrangle with auction houses over millions of pounds in disputed invoices. He is believed to have handed over the watch to Sotheby’s, and it was sold on Tuesday, to help pay off his debts. Made by Patek Philippe, the Henry Graves Supercomplication is the most complex watch ever assembled entirely by hand and took five years to make. It sold for £15million on Tuesday, days after the Sheikh's death .","Millionaire art dealer died just two days before his 'cursed' watch was sold .

"Jason Hall was handed three years behind bars for attempting to mug an elderly woman when she was guiding her blind husband whilst out shopping . A thug who tried to mug a pensioner and her blind husband has been jailed after being caught when Good Samaritans gave chase. Jason Hall, 39, carried out the 'despicable' theft after he spotted the elderly couple withdrawing £3,000 from a cashpoint on January 21. He then followed the 83-year-old woman and her 86-year-old husband down an alleyway before pushing them both to the ground. After a tussle, Hall managed the wrestle the handbag from the woman's grasp and sprinted off from the scene in Bilston, West Midlands. But shoppers who witnessed the robbery - including a woman in her 60s - bravely gave chase and managed to stop Hall as he tried to jump over a bridge onto a tram line. They then frog-marched the unemployed drug addict back to the scene of the attack to force him to hand back the money and he was arrested by police soon after. Hall, from Bilston, pleaded guilty to robbery and was jailed for three years at Wolverhampton Crown Court. But he showed no remorse as he sat back in the dock with his arms outstretched wearing a grey jumper and grey jogging bottoms as details of his crime were read out. Prosecutor Alka Brigue told the court: 'The victim suffers from osteoarthritis and she was with her husband who is registered as blind. 'They had been to Natwest bank in Bilston town centre to withdraw money. She had put the money into an envelope placed it in her bag and balanced it on her zimmer frame. 'They walked down the alleyway which was at the side of the bank. CCTV shows the defendant went outside the bank and followed them. 'He has grabbed the bag and there was struggle. The defendant pushed the complainant who has lost balance and fallen on to her husband who has also fallen to the ground. 'This was witnessed by several members of the public. This included a lady in her 60s who chased after the defendant as far as she could.' In a victim impact statement which was read out in court, the frail pensioner, who was not named, said: 'This man doesn’t have the right to steal my money. Hall, 39, carried out the 'despicable' theft after he spotted the elderly couple withdrawing £3,000 from this cashpoint in Bilston town centre . The pedestrianised Church Street, in Bilston, West Midlands, where Hall spotted the couple taking cash out of a machine before he mugged them . 'This has left me shaken up. It felt like a dream as it happened and I am grateful that I was not badly injured. I should be able to go about my business. I believe I was targeted because I was disabled.' Defending Hall, who has 27 convictions and 38 offences spanning 23 years, Adrian Stephens told the court: 'He believed he could take the bag and just run. 'But he couldn’t, it was a bag snatch that went wrong. The problem with Mr Hall is that for 18 or 19 years he has been a class A drug addict. 'He comes out of prison with the intention to start again and falls into the same pattern.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Nick Walton, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Hall was prepared to target an elderly, vulnerable couple and use force in order to get his hands on their possessions. 'What he didn’t count on was that the victims refused to give up, even when he knocked the pair of them to the floor. 'The caring and swift actions of passers-by meant that the couple were not only cared for until police arrived, but that the offender was captured when kind-hearted locals gave chase. 'The elderly woman, although shaken by her ordeal, was thankfully unhurt and hopefully knowing that the man responsible is now in prison will offer the couple some comfort.'","Jason Hall, 39, spotted the elderly couple withdrawing £3,000 .

"A dying man ended up living in poverty after his 'good Samaritan' neighbour stole his savings to buy scratchcards and designer clothes, a court heard. Carlos Machado, 55, was supposedly caring for Brian . Farlow, who lived in the same apartment block, but instead plundered his bank account, transferring more than £25,000 to himself. Cancer patient Mr Farlow, 63 was left living in squalor with rotting food in . his kitchen, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Abusing power: Carlos Machado, right, was able to plunder the account of cancer patient Brian Farlow, left,  after the dying man signed an authorisation form for his 'carer' neighbour . Mr Farlowe's living situation was uncovered by his family when they visited his flat in Whitham, Essex, in 2011. Mr Farlow died from lung and bone cancer in November, two months after his family found out what was happening, the court heard. Machado was able to take advantage of the 63-year-old after Mr Farlow had signed an authorisation . form allowing Machado to withdraw money from his account with his permission. The court heard £25,255 belonging to Mr Farlow had passed through Machado's bank account, all of which had been spent. Prosecutors alleged Machado stole £45,000 from Mr Farlow and spent it on scratchcards, gambling and designer clothing. Gambling man: Machado told Chelmsford Crown Court, pictured, he intended to take part in TV show Deal or No Deal and use his winnings to repay Mr Farlow . Machado claimed the amount involved was £15,000 and it was always his intention to pay it back. He told the court one way he was going . to return the money was to take part in the TV quiz show Deal or No . Deal, but show bosses said he never applied. Richard Conley, mitigating, told the court Machado had serious mental health problems, adding that Machado's condition had worsened in the past year. Judge Charles Gratwicke said Machado's actions were a serious breach of trust, as he sentenced him to two years suspended prison sentence, 200 hours of unpaid work and imposed a mental health treatment order. Machado has no assets that can be seized but if his financial circumstances improve, the authorities can pursue him in a bid to recoup the money at a later date. Machado had denied stealing £45,000 and a jury could not agree on a verdict after a trial in January. He was found guilty of fraud by abusing his position, but was cleared of seven other fraud and theft charges.","Carlos Machado stole £25,255 from his dying neighbour Brian Farlow .

"Sam Hobley filmed his friend John Dale slapping a sleeping woman in the face with his penis . A man who filmed his friend drunkenly slapping a sleeping woman in the face with his penis has walked free from court. Estate agent Sam Hobley used a mobile phone to film John Dale, 21, humiliate the victim when she fell asleep at a house party in Nottingham last year. The 21-year-old recorded the Nottingham Trent University student as he stripped to his boxers and shoved his manhood in her face - hitting her across the cheek. A court heard Hobley also sexually assaulted the woman by touching her vagina when she was naked in bed in October last year. The crime only came to light when he showed the video to his colleagues at Superdrug, where he was working at the time, who then contacted the police. The victim, who cannot be identified and did not know either men, only found about the footage when officers visited her on January 21 this year. She now suffers from Social Anxiety Disorder, post-traumatic stress, major depression and has been suicidal as a result of the video which made her feel 'sick and violated.' Hobley, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, admitted a charge of sexual assault at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday. The quivering defendant had to be helped into the dock and said 'I'm too scared' before being passed a bin by the usher when it appeared he was going to be sick. Judge Joan Butler QC took pity on Hobley and spared him jail instead sentencing him to nine months in prison, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years. Prosecutor Justin Widoger  told the court Hobley destroyed the mobile phone footage a few weeks after the incident. He said the video showed the victim asleep while the two men abused her. Mr Widoger added: 'Dale placed his penis on her head and the defendant touched her on the vagina. 'She was naked. He [Hobley] touched her with his hand. The court heard the two men - who had been out drinking - ran from the room when the victim started to wake up. Clinical psychologist Dr Jennifer Wild told the court Hobley - who suffers from an anxiety disorder - feared rejection by his peers and was trying to fit in. The judge said she was concerned about his mental health but was not convinced his disorder had played a part in the offence. Stuart Jessop, defending, said Hobley and Dale had slightly different roles but accepted it was a joint enterprise. He added: 'In interview he [Hobley] said it was Mr Dale's idea and he followed him, but Mr Dale said it was Mr Hobley and he left him to it.' Hobley, from Milton Keynes, was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for two years at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) - he had admitted a charge of sexual assault yesterday . Dale, also from Milton Keynes, admitted sexual assault and was jailed for nine months at Nottingham Crown Court in September this year. The Criminology undergraduate tried to appeal the sentence last month at the Court of Appeal, but three top judges rejected his case. The jail sentence and appeal decision has left Dale's hopes of a career in law in tatters. Refusing the appeal, Judge Alistair McCreath said the offence had caused the woman 'obvious and significant distress'. He added: 'One can see in stark form the distress caused to the victim of this offence and the continuing nature of it. 'The sentence which the judge imposed cannot possibly be wrong in principle. 'She struck a balance between the mitigating and aggravating factors and exercised her judgement in a manner which was open to her.'","Sam Hobley filmed John Dale slap a sleeping woman with his penis .

"A mother who stabbed her two young sons to death has told how she had believed she was being pursued by the devil and how voices told her she must kill them. Jael Mullings killed Romario Mullings-Sewell, two, and his three-month-old brother Delayno at their home in Kilimington Drive, Cheetham Hill, Manchester in 2008. She wiped tears from her eyes yesterday as she spoke via a video link from a secure hospital during an inquest into the children's deaths at Manchester Crown Court. Tragedy: Romario Mullings-Sewell, left and his brother Delayno, right, were stabbed by their mother in Cheetham Hill in 2008 . Mullings told the court: 'At the time . Romario was born, I started suffering from paranoia. When Delayno was . born I started to turn really psychotic. I couldn’t cope. I was getting . no support from the children’s father. 'From there it built up and became . worse. I was . hearing lots of different voices. They were telling me to kill the . children. They were saying all these different things. I can’t remember . exactly what they said. They were telling me to kill the children,' she . told the court.' It was the first time she has spoken since she was sectioned indefinitely in 2009 after killing her children on November 12 2008. Mullings, then 21, had denied murder and pleaded manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The children's bodies were discovered by their uncle Leighton Dennis, who became concerned when his sister arrived at his house after killing them. She said she thought she would lose her home and that a Manchester City Council van was following her, and that she steadily became more paranoid. 'The TV was doing sign language and trying to say things to me. I was hallucinating. I thought the devil was after me. I was speaking in tongues. I was talking gibberish. I went into this religious mode. I had to do everything from the Bible. I felt I had to circumcise the children. I think it was the night before.' Inquest: Mullings spoke to Manchester Crown Court via video link from her secure hospital . Mullings said she became 'confused and psychotic' and that she 'thought everyone was after me'. 'I thought they were going to take the kids off me, which would be devastating. I was having full-blown conversations with myself. I thought I was speaking in my head but I was speaking out loud.' She told the court she took full responsibility for killing her children and said: 'If I had dealt with these problems, things would have been different.' 'I loved my children. I wasn’t thinking about trying to kill them or taking their lives. I was scared and I was psychotic. I didn’t know what was going on. I wanted to kill myself. 'I think I had been smoking too much weed and smoking something other than I normally smoked.The memories are like flashes. I don’t remember things in order. I just know that I did the killings. I put them on the bed and I went to my auntie’s house. 'I tried to stab myself in the heart, but I missed and was too scared to try it again. I wanted a way out. I couldn’t cope with how I was feeling. I loved them with all my heart. I did my best. If I knew then what I know now, they would still be here.' The inquest continues.","Jael Mullings killed her three-month-old and two-year-old children in 2008 .

"Two primary schools are the  first in the country to teach pupils meditation techniques using Maltesers. Youngsters are taught self- control skills in a simple exercise where they have to resist eating one of the sweets. The training improves pupils’ performance by helping them concentrate, stay calm and cope with stress, teachers say. What a Mal-teaser:  Bilal Khalid, ten, a student at Stanley Grove Primary Academy in Manchester is learning mindfulness and meditation techniques by seeing how long he can resist a Maltester . It is being introduced at three Manchester schools run by Bright Futures Educational Trust – Stanley Grove and Gorton Mount primaries, and Cedar Mount Academy, a high school. The weekly lessons were originally introduced for teenager students at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, which is also part of the trust. But teachers believe that even younger pupils can benefit from the fun mental exercises, which include controlled breathing and a will power-based activity which challenges students to hold off from eating a tasty Malteser sweet. The classes - known as 'mindfulness' training - was pioneered in America but has been running in a handful of UK secondary schools. However the schools in Gorton, which started covering the exercises in September, are among the first British primary schools to introduce the scheme. Resisting temptation: The training helps pupils such as Bilal and his friends Aicha Sadeg, nine, and Zarren Jemshaid, ten, by improving their ability to concentrate, stay calm and cope with stress . A psychologist linked to Manchester University is currently carrying out research into the impact of the hour-long lessons. Amanda Bailey, from Bright Futures, said: 'It's not about the children sitting crossed legged at the table. There are a number of highly-structured practical activities. 'The same techniques have been used to treat adults with recurring episodes of depression to improve their capacity to cope. Organisations such as Google also offer mindfulness training to all their employees. 'The course for primary students is a version of the same thing. 'We are already starting to see some benefits in terms of the improved focus. Just as you might go to the gym and train your body, this is a way for pupils to train their minds.' She added early lessons in how to bounce back from stressful situations, such as exams, could help students when older.","Manchester schools use chocolate treats to teach children mindfulness .

Vita, 47, who claimed the death was an ‘accident’, yesterday returned to the  High Court in Glasgow after earlier being convicted of murder. Judge Sean Murphy, QC, jailed him for life, saying: ‘This is an incredibly sad case and has had tragic consequences for  everyone who knew her, including you. ‘You had lived an exemplary life but all of that ended when you discovered she was having an affair with another woman.’ Devastated: Elwira Rumniak, who was said to be having an affair with Mrs Vita, arrives at the High Court Glasgow, Scotland . Vita – who often broke down at his trial in March – showed no emotion as he was led handcuffed to the cells. A jury heard how Mrs Vita secretly started seeing Miss Rumniak soon after they first met in 2012. She eventually spent most of her time at Miss Rumniak’s home in Edinburgh. Mrs Vita, who worked as a manager at the Crown Office in the city, later proposed to her lover and the pair even discussed starting a family together. The affair then came to light last September 19 – the night before the killing – when Vita found intimate messages between the women on his son’s iPad. Miss Rumniak told the trial: ‘Marion said, “He knows about us”. He had discovered text messages. I went up to her and held her really tightly. I said, “we will be OK”.’ Miss Rumniak recalled Vita sending ‘horrendous’ texts including one to her. She said: ‘He mentioned Auschwitz and how he wanted me to suffer more than what happened there.’ Vita meantime put an entry in a calendar which read “Marion = cheating lesbian whore” and  cut his wife out of family photographs. The court heard Mrs Vita went to meet her husband the next night at their Glasgow home – and it was there, in a rage, he stabbed her four times. The  couple’s 11-year-old son later told how he discovered his mother unconscious on the couch. In an interview with police, he added: ‘Her lips were quite grey. She was not moving at all. She was lying on the sofa, sort of on her side.’ In evidence, Vita said he did not realise his wife was injured that night and that she had died due to a bizarre accident when she fell on the knife during a struggle. He also told how he had gone upstairs and stabbed himself twice in a failed suicide attempt. Judge Murphy yesterday praised the Vitas’ son, adding: ‘He will have to come to terms with the loss of his mother and the imprisonment of his father.’ Outside court, Jennifer Harrower, Procurator Fiscal for Homicides and Serious Crime in the West of Scotland, said: ‘Yet again a knife used in anger has left  family and friends devastated at the loss of a loved one.’","Marion Vita, 48, was killed after husband Tony, 47, discovered her secret .

"A woman plied a vulnerable 14-year-old schoolgirl with alcohol and cocaine before selling her to a builder for sex for £60, a court has heard. Leanne Gilder, 26, is accused of setting up the teenager to be molested by Michael Booth in the back of his Ford Transit van in central Manchester. Miss Gilder, is alleged to have 'pimped out' the vulnerable youngster after seeing her as a 'useful source of cash'. Accused: Leanne Gilder, pictured outside Manchester Crown Court, allegedly 'pimped out' a 14-year-old girl to builder Michael Booth, right . Mr Booth, 43, admits having an intimate encounter with the girl in the back of his van, but says he thought she was 18. Miss Gilder, on trial at Manchester Crown Court, denies exploiting her. The youngster graphically described the alleged ordeal in a videoed police interview shown to the jury. She said: 'I must have conked out and when I woke up he was just pulling up his pants...I didn't give any consent. 'I didn't even know what was happening, I didn't want it. I was coked out of my head.' Asked how she felt, she added: 'I was scared - I wanted my mum.' It is alleged that late on the evening of October 19, 2010, the youngster travelled into Manchester and met Miss Gilder, who she says she had met twice previously, at a drop-in centre in Piccadilly. It is alleged she agreed to go to Oldham with Miss Gilder, who gave her booze before taking her to an address at Lynn Street, where the youngster took cocaine. The pair are said to have then walked to Manchester's Gay Village in the early hours, where Miss Gilder is alleged to have told the girl to get in the back of Mr Booth's Ford Transit Connect. The court heard the youngster told police that after she was sexually assaulted Miss Gilder said to her 'you've just made me £60'. Manchester Crown Court heard the teenage girl was plied with alcohol and cocaine before being sold for sex . Mr Booth is alleged to have turned up in Oldham later that day expecting to have sex with the girl again, but she refused. Richard Orme, defending Miss Gilder, put it to the girl that she had told a 'pack of lies'. Mr Orme highlighted occasions when she could have alerted police or run away from Miss Gilder in the aftermath of the alleged attack. She was found at Lynn Street by police the next day. Mr Orme said records do not support her claim that she called them to the property, and the court heard she gave an officer a false name. The court was also told she was 'moved on' from Manchester's 'red light district' about a month after the alleged attack. Miss Gilder, from Chadderton, Greater Manchester, denies causing or inciting child prostitution and controlling a child prostitute. Booth, from Padiham, near Burnley, denies sexual assault, causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and paying for the sexual services of a child. The trial continues.

"A major sea search has been called off after a passenger was reported to have 'jumped' from a ferry in the English Channel. The passenger was reported missing by the crew just after 1.30am when the Pride of Kent ferry was around six miles off the coast of Dover. HM Coastguard sent a helicopter, three lifeboats and a tugboat  to search the sea in darkness after the ferry crew said they feared someone had gone overboard. A witness claimed he saw someone having a drink on the deck before calmly putting down their glass, climbing over the railings and jumping into the Channel. Hunt: A huge search has been launched for a woman who went missing in the English Channel while travelling on the Pride of Kent ferry (above, file picture) just after 1.30am six miles off the coast of Dover . Channel at dawn: The tug helping with the search last night returned to Dover at around 7am having not found the missing passenger . But a Coastguard spokesman said that after the ferry arrived at Calais, a head count established that all crew and passengers were accounted for. However, the search continued after the witness insisted they saw someone go overboard before finally being called off at 9,30am. The spokesman added: 'The area has been extensively searched overnight and into this morning with nothing found. 'Unless any new information comes to light, the search has been stood down.' The ferry left Dover at 1.11am with 385 passengers on board, with the weather conditions described as 'pretty good' when the missing-person report was made around 20 minutes later. There had been conflicting reports about whether the passenger was a man or woman. Witness: A passenger on board the Pride of Kent insists he saw someone climb up and jump off the ship . Chris Laming, spokesman for P&O Ferries, told MailOnline: 'We had a witness report that a male had been seen to jump over the side of the ship. 'The witness described the man as being perfectly calm. He finished his drink and walked calmly to the rail and jumped over.' Mr Laming said the ferry went into a 'search and rescue' holding pattern as is standard procedure in the event of a person going overboard. He added: 'These things happen from time to time very sadly'. The coastguard said it had received reports the passenger was a woman. A coastguard helicopter, several lifeboats and a tug boat from the Port of Dover were involved in the search .","Passenger reported missing just after 1.30am around six miles from Dover .

"Family doctor Kenneth Thompson is accused of having had illicit sex sessions with a troubled patient at his surgery in Belfast between July 2003 and December 2005 . A family doctor had sex sessions with a troubled patient saying it would help save her marriage, it was claimed yesterday. In one encounter Dr Kenneth Thompson, 68, allegedly had sex with her over a table in the surgery to demonstrate how she should make love with her husband. The GP is also said to have asked her to perform a sex act on him to make her ‘more confident’. And it is claimed he encouraged the woman, a mother, to walk about the house naked and asked her to visit him at his surgery wearing a white tennis skirt. The woman, known only as EC, was one of three patients who complained about Dr Thompson’s conduct at the surgery between July 2003 and December 2005, a General Medical Council hearing in Manchester was told. She said she went to see him in October 2003 after getting stomach pains following sex with her husband. She later told Dr Thompson she had been sexually abused as a child and was having trouble sleeping because of the memory. Giving evidence via video link she told the hearing: 'It came up in a conversation between Dr Thompson about counselling and Dr Thompson claimed he had been a counsellor and he would counsel me for free to try and get over the stress of it. 'I told him about me being raped by my father, uncle, grandfather and when I was 12 and abused by my father’s friends as well. 'I couldn't perform with my husband in bed properly, I couldn't speak to him about it. I was very withdrawn with my husband and the thought of oral sex terrified me and still does. 'I think I had gone to talk to the doctor about my childhood. I can't remember why and he suggested counselling, private counselling on a Monday at 6pm in the surgery. Thompson pictured outside the GMC hearing in Manchester where he was accused of having a string of sexual encounters at his surgery. The woman on the right is unknown . 'We spoke about my childhood, the effect it was having on my marriage and the effect it was having with my husband in our love life. 'I felt it wasn't right because I just didn't feel comfortable even with my husband. At the start it was all about my self-esteem and how to build it up. He told me I was a pretty looking girl and that I had nothing to worry about that he had been a psychiatrist and to put my trust in him.' She said she 'fully' put her trust in Dr Thompson and recalled how she told him everything adding: 'From my childhood, what I was made to do, what I couldn't do in bedroom with my husband and my relationship with my children. 'He told me I should walk about the house naked with my children present, that I should have a bath with my boys, that there was nothing to be ashamed of and to show him how to clean himself because I couldn't touch my son. 'It didn't feel right to me after what I'd been through to touch my son.' By Christmas 2003 the patient said she considered the doctor a friend and even bought him a Christmas present, she said: 'I called him a friend.' 'I always thought it was to help me but I wasn't, it was always about his own needs and what he wanted.' She said the sessions did begin to change when the doctor examined her back and found she had a curvature of the spine. He commented on the unusual shape of her tail bone and asked if he could take a photo for medical reasons and the patient agreed. She said he had also examined her internally because of the pain in her stomach, which occurred after sexual intercourse with her husband. EC said her home life began to suffer. She explained: 'Because I don't think my husband understood why I was getting counselled, so it caused arguments in the house why I was getting counselled.' 'Later if I brought my childhood up with Dr Thompson he would change the subject he would talk about myself and my sex life with my husband and what I was like with my children and suggested things I should do to try and help myself orgasm.' 'He said he needed to work on things that I was afraid of most and told me to trust him and that he was in charge, he knew what he was doing and just to trust him, he wouldn't do anything to hurt me and he wouldn't let anything go too far and I believed him.' On occasions the GP was said to have asked the woman to give him oral sex after she claimed it was 'her worst fear'. When asked about the point of doing this the patient replied: 'That it would save my marriage and it would make me a bit more confident and I would get over my fear.' 'He asked me to bend over the table and he would show me way of having sexual intercourse that wouldn’t hurt.' 'I always thought it was to help me but I wasn't, it was always about his own needs and what he wanted. He said I dressed well and that I had a lovely figure for a girl my age and that I shouldn't be ashamed of my figure or my body.' Counsel to the GMC Paul Williams said it may seem surprising the patient did not realise sooner what was happening but he said given her past and vulnerability she was unaware. He said the events had caused her great emotional and psychological distress and said she went on to self-harm and her marriage failed. He told the hearing: 'EC no longer wanted to talk about the sexual abuse she suffered at her father's hands but the doctor encouraged her to talk about it and that it would allow her to be more sexually open. 'The panel may think it does have the elements of grooming rather than an impulsive act and this is in the context of a vulnerable patient. 'The doctor we say was taking advantage and in the end the therapy was to perform sexual acts with the doctor that EC feared within the context of her marriage. 'He said she was in total control and that would free EC to try these acts out with her husband.' 'Towards the very end the doctor forced EC to have sexual intercourse during a session explaining he was showing her a different position to use with her husband. This made EC realise what was happening.' The hearing was told a friend of EC known as MC who had also suffered a sexual abuse ordeal as a child and a third woman known as ST made complaints of a sexually motivated nature about Dr Thompson. He denies misconduct and the hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dr Kenneth Thompson, 68, is accused of a string of sexual encounters at his surgery .

Happy place: Speaking about her love of trolls on TLC's My Crazy Obsession, Michelle said: 'Trolls make me really happy when they are all looking at me' Troll dolls were originally created in 1959 by Danish fisherman and woodcutter Thomas Dam who used his creative talents when he couldn't afford a Christmas gift for his daughter . He then sold them as Good Luck Trolls and they became a huge fad in American between 1963-1965 . The fad spread to video games, a Trollies Radio Show and music hits based on trolls . After several companies copied the trolls, in 2003 a Congressional law allowed the Dam family of Denmark to restore their original U.S. copyright, allowing them to become the only official manufacturer . The brand was modernised by DIC Entertainment and became 'Trollz' in 2005 but was soon dropped after a lack of success . DreamWorks Animation recently announced that it has acquired the intellectual property for the Trolls franchise from the Dam Family and has 'big plans' to redevelop the toy .","Michelle Kerrins owns over 3,000 trolls .

"The New York man photographed on Nov. 6 riding the subway naked has been identified and says his days of letting it all hang out are far from over. The New York Post has identified the naked subway rider who appeared on the cover of the newspaper last Saturday as Ed Haines, a homeless 40-year-old man. Haines is regularly seen in the buff on park benches in Madison Square Park in Manhattan, according to the Post, but last week was the first time he graced the cover of a newspaper in his birthday suit -- very Kim Kardashian-esque. Scroll down for video . Snoozing: On Nov. 6, Haines was caught snoozing on the E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers . 'I like to be naked. It turns me on,' Haines told the Post. 'I wish I could do it all the time. I would if I could, if I wouldn’t get in trouble.' On Nov. 6, Haines was caught snoozing on the southbound E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers. Passengers watched as Haines took swigs of whiskey in between naps, according toDaily News. At first, Haines denied to the Post's reporters that the naked man in the photograph was him, but then admitted that it was saying he was so drunk he ended up in a hospital that night and didn't remember the trip there. It was only when he sobered up that night that he recalled being naked in public, the Post reports, however, he didn't realize the extent of his nudity until he saw himself on the front page of the Post. 'I saw it in The Post and knew I had been naked,' Haines said. Haines admitted to the Post that he gets naked ' a lot' and jokingly said he is jealous of Kim Kardashian's similar exploits. 'I wish I could get naked like that,' he said. The photograph of Haines on the subway last week was photographed by Peter Davis, an editor at the Daily Front Row fashion magazine, who said Haines -- unidentified at the time -- was 'really drunk' during the train ride. 'He would swig it and then nod out,' Davis told the Post. 'He must’ve taken four swigs in four stops.' Naps: In between naps, Haines took swigs from a jug of Jack Daniel's as he let it all hang out on the southbound train . Haines reportedly rode the train for at least five stops with as many as 30 passengers on the train. Davis said last week that Haines looked oblivious and didn't seem to care when he snapped the photo around 8pm. The photo of Haines' naked body went viral when Davis posted the photo to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where comments ranged from jokes about the man to concern, according to Daily News. Afraid: Peter Davis, a train passenger, snapped a photo of the then unidentified Haines and said that the other passengers seemed afraid of him . In his Facebook post featuring the photo, Davis wrote 'Just spotted on the E Train. After a lifetime in NYC I thought I had seen everything...' Some made light of the situation with comments like 'They turned on the heat on the subways today. I'm just sayin'... It was hot down there,' and 'He didn't want to take off his shoes and socks for fear of getting athlete's foot.' Social Media: Davis posted the photo to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where comments ranged from jokes about the man to concern . Some Twitter users were more concerned, tweeting things like 'This is so incredibly SAD. His bag of life belongings must be next to him. He's probably mentally ill and tragically lonely.' The incident seemed to be very similar to a scene from an episode of the popular TV show 'Seinfeld.' In the season three episode titled 'The Subway' Jerry has a strange train encounter of his own when he awakes from a catnap to find a naked man sitting directly across from his reading a newspaper. Haines told the Post that he had, in fact, seen the episode and thought his actions fit the scene.","Ed Haines, 40, has been identified as the E train passenger who let it all hang out last week .

Over the next three hours, he allegedly fired nine rounds toward police in the building's courtyard, before threatening to shoot down a news helicopter  flying over the scene in Providence Road. Minutes later, police launched tear gas into Smith's window, before throwing a stun grenade into his apartment and storming the room, Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told The Inquirer. There, they reportedly discovered the pensioner crouched on all fours with a 9mm gun in his head. Despite dropping the pistol, Smith allegedly lashed out at six officers who tried to detain him, persisting even when he was struck twice with a Taser. Angry reader: Smith (pictured in his mugshot) reportedly called 911 and threatened to kill himself and the dispatcher because he had a 'beef' with The Philadelphia Inquirer following the loss of his money in stocks .

'He's one nasty senior citizen,' Supt Chitwood said following the incident at 7.45pm on Wednesday. 'When we tried to negotiate with him, he would scream all types of things.' Supt Chitwood added that none of his officers had been struck by the fired bullets. Following the alleged attack, police reportedly recovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition - along with the 9mm gun and a .22-caliber rifle - from Smith's apartment.

"British tourists in the Caribbean are being struck down by a debilitating and potentially deadly virus carried by mosquitoes. An unprecedented outbreak of the Chikungunya virus is affecting islands including Barbados, St Lucia and the Grenadines, where many UK holidaymakers flock during the festive season. Thousands have been hit by the illness, which leaves victims bedridden for days. Some have reported feeling the effects for months or years after contracting the bug, and more vulnerable victims have died. An unprecedented outbreak of the Chikungunya virus is affecting islands including Barbados, St Lucia and the Grenadines, where many UK holidaymakers flock during the festive season . Trials of an anti-viral drug in the US have had positive results, but there is currently no vaccine commercially available. Yesterday, there were fears that British tourists may not realise the dangers until it is too late, amid reports that tour operators are playing down the problem. Chikungunya, which is contracted through mosquito bites, causes a sudden onset of fever and agonising joint pain, particularly affecting the hands, wrists, ankles and feet. British tourists and expats are among hundreds of thousands of cases reported since the beginning of the outbreak last year. Dr Saranthdany Xavier, a doctor on Bequia island in St Vincent and the Grenadines who contracted the disease, said: ‘The outbreak began here in April and since then there have been about 2,000 cases in the country as a whole. ‘From August, it has been calming down but we are still treating a few cases. 'Lots of my friends have come down with it. The mosquitoes … bite everyone the same.’ Shavern Ollivierre, of the community group Action Bequia, said: ‘I had it back in May and it was really quite painful for three days. 'It’s a very grave problem … in the entire region. 'I’ve got a lot of family in Barbados and it is rampant there.’ According to the Caribbean Public Health Agency, there have been 165 confirmed cases in St Vincent and the Grenadines – and locals say the suspected number is much higher. In Barbados, there were 58 confirmed diagnoses and 1,258 suspected sufferers. The Dominican Republic had six deaths, with 498,916 suspected cases, while Martinique has had 1,515 diagnoses, 74 deaths and 68,140 suspected sufferers. The disease has spread into Nicaragua, Honduras and other countries in central and South America. Between 65,000 and 117,000 people are estimated to be infected in Venezuela. As of last month, a total of 739,410 suspected cases and 118 deaths have been reported in the Caribbean and the Americas. But health officials warned the true numbers could be higher as some countries have been slow in testing and reporting. Popular tourist destinations such as the Dominican Republic are among the worst-hit nations . A tourist makes a purchase at a fruit and vegetable market in Grenada, where some Brits have fallen ill . It is feared the virus could spread from Bequia to the nearby private island of Mustique, which is a favourite among celebrities and royalty. The Duchess of Cambridge holidayed there with Prince George in February. Yesterday there was anecdotal evidence that some businesses want to play down the dangers. One British expat in Bequia, who said her husband had been in ‘sheer agony’ from the virus, described it as a ‘dirty little secret’. She added: ‘Visitors and tourism are a vital part of the economy … There are concerns that news is getting out and the tourists aren’t coming.’ Chikungunya was first reported in the region by the World Health Organisation last December. It said the outbreak was ‘unprecedented’. There have since been cases in Montpellier, France – prompting fears it could spread to the UK. The majority of UK cases are associated with travel to South and South East Asia, say experts . Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by infected female mosquitoes with symptoms including high fever, headaches, rashes and severe joint pain. After being bitten the onset of illness occurs usually between four and eight days but can range from two to 12. There is no vaccine or cure and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. Most patients recover fully but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months or even years. Occasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, in addition to gastrointestinal complaints. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death. The disease was first described during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952 and has spread to nearly 40 countries in Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe. Europe’s first transmission was reported during a localised outbreak that affected nearly 200 people in north-eastern Italy in 2007. Last month, France confirmed four cases of ‘locally-acquired’ infection in Montpellier. Since 2005, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Maldives and Myanmar have reported over 1.9 million cases. Experts say chikungunya shares some clinical signs with dengue and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. The name ‘chikungunya’ derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, meaning ‘to become contorted’ and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.

"A Florida woman accused of killing a neighbor was indicted on a first-degree murder charge Wednesday after it was revealed in court that she allegedly hacked the victim’s body into pieces and tried to cremate them using her stove after drugging and stabbing him to death. Angela Stoldt, 42, of Deltona, was arrested in April 2013 in connection to the killing of James Sheaffer and was initially charged with second-degree murder. On Wednesday, a grand jury indicted her on charges of abuse of a dead body and tampering with physical evidence, on top of the upgraded first-degree murder charge. Gruesome murder: Angela Stoldt, 42 (left), allegedly stabbed neighbor James Sheaffer, 36 (right), with an ice pick, strangled him and then tried to dispose of his body by hacking it to pieces and cooking the remains . Crime scene: Stoldt got into an argument with Sheaffer while sitting in her car at the Osteen Cemetery in Deltona in April 2013 . Prosecutors said they will not be seeking the death penalty in Stoldt's case. In September, Stold's attorney filed a motion claiming self defense under Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law, but Judge Randell Rowe III rejected the motion. Court documents obtained by Daytona News-Journal this week revealed chilling new details about the 2013 murder and its gruesome aftermath. James Sheaffer, a limousine driver and a married father of three, had reportedly asked his neighbor, Ms Stoldt, to act as the payee on his Social Security disability benefits, but the 36-year-old kept overdrawing their joint account. The limo driver also wanted Stoldt to ask her father for a $4,000 loan. On the morning of April 3, 2013, Stoldt, with her two children in tow, picked up her neighbor from his work at Blue Diamond Limousines and drove to her home on Horseshoe Terrace, where the two drank vodka and peach schnapps cocktails. But according to court filings, the mother of two spiked her neighbor's beverage with a prescription pain medication, which she had stolen from her father knowing that it causes drowsiness, especially when mixed with alcohol. Stoldt then allegedly loaded the drugged man into her car and drove to the Osteen Cemetery after dropping the kids off at her parents'. Husband and father: Sheaffer, who was married with three kids, was stabbed in the eye and then strangled; police were never able to locate all of his remains . By the time the two reached the burial ground, Sheaffer and Stoldt got into a heated dispute over the loan. ‘Sheaffer said that he was going to kill Ms. Stoldt as well as her children,’ the stand-you-ground motion stated. During questioning, Stoldt told detectives that Sheaffer started yelling at her and 'swinging his hands around.’ The woman said that while Sheaffer never actually hit her, he started coming at her in a threatening manner, making her fearful for her life. 'I just snapped,' she was quoted as saying. 'He came at me and I stabbed him.' That is when Stoldt pulled an ice pick from a box in the backseat and plunged it into his right eye, but the burly limo driver allegedly kept coming at her. She then grabbed a cord with two handles and used it to strangle Sheaffer by wrapping it tightly around his neck. After the man stopped moving, the 42-year-old mother grabbed the ice pick again and drove it through Sheaffer's left eye. She then wrapped the man's head in Saran Wrap to keep him from bleeding all over the car interior and drove home, with Sheaffer's corpse propped up in the passenger seat, the ice pick still protruding from his face. After parking her car in her garage, Stoldt shoved her dead neighbor's body out of the car and plopped it in a kiddie pool, leaving it there for the night. The following morning, the suspect allegedly went to work hacking James Sheaffer's body to pieces with a hacksaw. Life and death situation: Stoldt's attorney filed a motion claiming that the woman was in fear for her life because Sheaffer was threatening to kill her and her two children . According to the judge's order rejecting the self-defense motion, Miss Stoldt told police she had tried to 'destroy the evidence by cooking and cremating body parts.' The woman reportedly said that she put some of Sheaffer's remains into pots and tried simmering them on the stovetop, and also placed one of his legs in the oven hoping to burn it. Having failed that, Stoldt dumped the mutilated body parts in trash bags and disposed of them with the help of her teenage son, who was led to believe that they were getting rid of a deer his mother had killed with her car the night before. To cover up the murder, Miss Stoldt then buried her neighbor's cellphone and driver’s license in different parks, and got rid of the pots and pans used to boil human flesh. When Stoldt's daughter, who is now 16 years old, asked her about the foul smell lingering in the house, the 42-year-old woman initially lied that a rat had gotten trapped inside the oven. But she eventually came clean to the girl, telling her that she had drugged and killed James Sheaffer after he threatened to kill her. However, it was not until three weeks later that Angela Stoldt confessed to the rest of her family, prompting her sister to call 911 on April 21 because she was afraid the distraught, sleep-deprived woman might commit suicide. In the course of her questioning, Miss Stoldt spoke without hesitation of her attempts to dispose of her neighbor's corpse. 'Thursday is when I was cooking him. Friday is when I was dumping him,' she was quoted as saying. The woman showed little remorse for her actions, telling police she believed at the time Sheaffer was going to ruin her life. ‘I’m sorry, but I put Jimmie where he belonged, in my opinion at the time,’ she told detectives. Ms Stoldt eventually led sheriff's deputies to various locations around Volusia County to help recover James Sheaffer's remains, but officials said they were never able to locate all of Sheaffer's body parts. Confrontation: Sheaffer, a limo driver, allegedly attacked Stoldt while sitting in her car and would not let go of her until she wrapped a cord around his neck . Investigators who canvassed Sheaffer’s Deltona neighborhood looking for the missing man before Stoldt’s confession had talked to the woman on more than one occasion. She acknowledged being friends with Sheaffer and said she handled some of his financial affairs for him. She told investigators that she last saw Sheaffer on April 5 and 15, even though family members hadn’t seen him since April 2. The investigation took a turn April 20 when Stoldt’s sister called 911 saying that the mother of two was acting suicidal and had admitted to killing James Sheaffer. The caller told the Sheriff’s office that Stoldt was hugging her children and saying goodbye. ‘Why’s she hugging her kids goodbye?’ the emergency dispatcher asked. ‘Because she came to the house and she told my parents that she committed a crime and that she’s being investigated for it,’ the woman’s sister replied. Ms Stoldt initially declined to talk to investigators and was taken in for a mental health evaluation. But officials were able to obtain a search warrant to enter her house, where they came upon evidence indicating a crime had been committed there. A short time later, Angela Stoldt confessed to stabbing and strangling Sheaffer, and then disposing of his body. Stoldt then led investigators to a location where human remains were recovered. Ms Stoldt is being held without bail.","Angela Stoldt, 42, confessed to killing limo driver James Sheaffer, 36, in April 2013 by stabbing him in the face and strangling him with a cord .

"An Indian woman was clawed by a tiger in the first known case of its kind - because it had no teeth to bite with. Tigers usually kill by biting the neck, but the 34-year-old woman was clawed to death in the rare case. It is believed the tiger's teeth had fallen out or were not functional, according to findings published in the Legal Medicine Journal. A Royal Bengal tiger clawed a woman in India to death in the first known case of its kind. File photo . The woman had been collected collecting tendu leaves in the Bramhapuri forest when the Royal Bengal tiger pounced. Others attempted to distract the tiger by throwing stones when they heard the woman's cries, but she had already received fatal injuries. An autopsy revealed multiple fatal and non-fatal injuries caused by tiger claws - while characteristic injuries due to the tooth impacts were absent. The tiger itself was found dead the next day around four kilometres from the scene of the attack. Its paws matched prints taken near the scene and it had no functional teeth. It is believed the tiger had been hungry and saw the woman as easy prey. India is home to more than half of the 3,200 tigers believed to be left in the wild in the world. Their numbers are also dwindling fast because of deaths at the hands of poachers, who target the creatures for their skin, bones, teeth and claws.
