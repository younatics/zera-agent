"New Yorkers were mystified on Tuesday after spotting what appeared to be skinned goat heads dangling from a lamppost at a busy intersection. The skulls dangled over Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street in Park Slope until just before noon when an employee at the nearby business Continental Car Service knocked them down and chucked them in the trash. Prior to their removal, another unidentified man tried to knock down the hanging carcasses with a metal rod but he quickly gave up. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Animal heads: New Yorkers were mystified on Tuesday after spotting what appeared to be skinned goat heads dangling from a lamp post at a busy intersection at Ninth Street and Fifth Ave in Park Slope . Failed attempt: One man tried to knock over the animal heads with a metal pole but he eventually gave up . Police were called at around 11:00 on Tuesday and an investigation is ongoing to find a suspect. The MailOnline spoke to an employee at Continental Car Service who said he's baffled by the incident. 'I haven't seen anything like this in the 17 years I've been here,' he said. The dangling animal heads surrounded by a swarm of flies in the posh residential area has some wondering whether or not voodoo may be involved. 'Maybe it's some of those wackos who go for Santeria or voodoo,"" said local resident Louis Katenzakes to DNAinfo. 'It's the occult. They do rituals. They kill animals. A butcher at Aloor Halal Meat Market nearby, Lorenzo Hernandez, said that the heads definitely belonged to goats and that they appeared to be jaggedly cut by hand instead of by machine. He told DNAinfo that he sells goat meat at his shop everyday but that people generally use the meat for food,. Skinned: What appears to be a skinned goat head sits opn the ground after being removed from a Brooklyn street light by an employee at a local car service company . Trashed: The mysterious animal heads were chucked in the trash after being spotted dangling from a lamppost in Brooklyn . 'Most people use it for food,' Hernandez said. 'The head especially, for soup.' Mohamad Almerdie whose family owns the building on the corner where the heads were found told DNAinfo that he's seen many goat heads but not on poles. 'In my country... You take the head off, then you put it in the oven. It tastes good. It's expensive, too. They say it's good for the body,"" said Almerdaie who is from Yemen. 'Over here, I don't know what it means,' he added. Gothamist spoke to some Brooklynites who stopped to stare at the strange sight. 'That's disgusting—I got to show my sister,' said Mickey Guzman as he snapped some photos of the lamppost. 'That's messed up,' said 9-year-old Aiden Rahieb. 'That's some sick s**t. I don't want no part of that s**t. You see those bottles with names and oils in them at Prospect Park? Don't ever touch them. We got witches out here,' said J.C. Rivera. This isn't the first time dead animals have been found in Brooklyn, either. Severed goat heads and rooster heads were found in Prospect Park in March. The New York Post reports that severed heads also found in Prospect Park in 2010 were linked to Santeria.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"Stuart Lancaster wore a broad grin on Saturday night but when England’s coach reflects in the mirror on Sunday morning, he will know his side have much work to do to mount a credible World Cup challenge. England deservedly stopped the rot against the southern hemisphere’s big three with a forward-dominated victory over a disjointed and horribly underpowered Wallaby side who somehow stayed in the game through a combination of sheer will and high-quality back play. No 8 Ben Morgan and lock Courtney Lawes produced towering displays as England’s pack - who have performed admirably all autumn - crushed Australia’s scrum with ridiculous ease. But it was no thing of beauty. VIDEO England v Australia highlights . Ben Morgan gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score England's first try of the match at Twickenham . England players celebrate Morgan's second try at Twickenham during the November international on Saturday . The number eight breaks an attempted Australian tackle to surge towards the line before the first of his tries . Morgan screams his joy after scoring England's opening try at Twickenham on Saturday against Australia . Four years ago in Perth, Martin Johnson’s England produced a similarly muscular scrummaging performance but somehow lost. Mercifully, in no small part thanks to Morgan’s ballast and Lawes’ astonishing work-rate for the 50 minutes he was on the field, England did not make the same mistake on Saturday and instead repeated last autumn’s Twickenham victory over the same opponents. But let’s not kid ourselves. While Morgan scored two tries - one of them a pushover from yet another commanding scrum - and Lawes was imperious all over the field, England’s three-quarters rarely threatened. Despite an extraordinary level of set-piece dominance, England hardly created anything of note beyond fly-half George Ford. Lancaster rightly pointed out on Saturday night that with a scrum so dominant there was no need for his side to go wide. Bernard Foley of Australia crosses the try line to score the Wallabies' first try at Twickenham on Saturday . England players jump for joy as their scrum crashes over the line to allow Morgan to score his second try .

England were leading 13-3 when Australia roared back as Bernard Foley (above) scored a brilliantly-worked try, combining with Rob Horne to run right through the heart of the home defence (below). But Ben Morgan’s second try of the match (right) kept England out of reach . England: Brown 6; Watson 6, Barritt 6 (Farrell 62 blood), Twelvetrees 5 (Barritt return blood 68), May 6, Ford 7, Youngs 5 (Wigglesworth 70), Marler 8 (Mullan 50), Hartley 7 (Webber 71), Wilson 8 (Brookes 61), Attwood 7, Lawes 9 (Kruis 50), Wood 7 (Haskell 76), Robshaw 7, Morgan 9. Tries: Morgan (2). Conversions: Ford (2). Penalties: Ford (4). Australia: Folau 8, Speight 6 (Beale 64), Ashley-Cooper 7, Toomua 7, Horne 6, Foley 7 (Cooper 44), Phipps 5 (White 50), Slipper 4 (Alexander 52), Fainga'a 5 (Hanson 73), Kepu 4 (Robinson 68), Carter 6, Simmons 5 (Jones 40), McMahon 6 (Skleton 58), Hooper 8, McCalman 6. Tries: Foley, Skleton. Conversions: Foley, Cooper. Penalty: Foley. Referee: Jerome Garces (France). Ratings by Sam Peters. But throughout the autumn England have had parity or better up front but failed to utilise their quick men out wide. The gap in skill and spatial awareness between their three-quarters and the southern hemisphere’s finest remains seismic. ‘Sometimes if your set-piece is dominant you don’t get width on the ball because you get penalties and you kick them or you get a try,’ England’s head coach said. ‘We could have moved the ball from the scrum straight away and maybe scored a try with our wingers but why would you do that? ‘The most pleasing thing overall, if you look back at 2014, irrespective of today’s result, we scored 26 tries and 21 were by the backs.’ Lancaster has every right to accentuate the positives, and there have undoubtedly been some this autumn, but overall it is hard to see how his side have progressed. Robbed of seven Lions and the hugely influential Joe Launchbury, Lancaster entered the series with one hand effectively tied behind his back. But the lack of opportunities created and the failure to take those opportunities when they did present themselves, must be a concern. on Saturday the latest midfield combination of Billy Twelvetrees and Brad Barritt again lacked incisiveness, while some of scrum-half Ben Youngs’ decision-making at the breakdown was ponderous. It was perhaps telling when asked what single thing he would add to his squad ahead of his side’s next match against Wales at the Millennium Stadium on February 7 Lancaster simply replied: ‘Manu’, in reference to the hulking Leicester centre who has missed this series with a groin injury. ‘We’ve got seven Lions to come back into the team as well as Joe Launchbury who is a quality player for us,’ Lancaster said. ‘We have not got everything right by any stretch of the imagination, there’s still a lot of work to do.’ It looks increasingly likely Ford will be the man to pull the midfield strings going in to the Six Nations following another extremely composed performance from the 21-year-old Bath fly-half on only his second start. Ford was largely responsible for England’s much-improved kicking game and, while he will hope to add more layers to their attacking game, he can be satisfied with another fine contribution.

It was sharp, incisive and effective and a reminder of the way England played for much of last season’s Six Nations, with forwards running flat to the line and off-loading to another runner. The home side took a 13-3 lead into half-time but when Bernard Foley scored a superbly worked try - combining brilliantly with Rob Horne - shortly after the break the Wallabies were somehow back in the game. Morgan’s second came courtesy of a clever kick from Mike Brown - and an equally good chase from Jonny May - which forced Australia replacement Quade Cooper to carry the ball over his line and concede a five-metre scrum.The resulting pushover try was as certain as death and taxes. Another Wallaby replacement, Will Skelton bulldozed over to bring the score back to 20-17 with 20 minutes to go but with England’s pack maintaining their vice-like grip, the home side pulled clear with Ford adding two late penalties, taking his tally to 16 points. Lancaster and his coaches embraced at the final whistle. They have worked incredibly hard but received only limited rewards this autumn. They deserved their moment of victory on Satuday.

"Employers should do more to help staff going through difficult divorces to stop them quitting and ending up on benefits, Iain Duncan Smith has said. The Work and Pensions Secretary warns that when people have problems in their private lives 'their work suffers', and after going on sick pay their employer eventually says 'bye bye'. He wants companies to follow a German model of 'trying to engage the worker' when they have personal problems which means they risk 'crashing out of work'. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith warns that staff suffering from stress stop going to work, and eventually the company says 'bye bye' Ministers warn that 60 per cent of people who leave work with mental health problems suffer from anxiety or depression. The government wants firms to take a more proactive approach to intervene in the lives of their staff. By supporting workers when they are going through a family break-up or other stressful period, they are more likely to stay in work and not fall into a life on benefits. Mr Duncan Smith said: 'What happens in private sector companies, particularly, is people suffer a problem, then their work suffers, they cease coming into work regularly, what happens is they go into their statutory sick pay and at the end of it the business sort of says ""bye bye"". A pilot scheme is working to offer people on benefits with mental health problems help earlier, to get them back into work sooner. Campaigners warn that the impact of family break-up on workers can last for a long time . Mr Duncan Smith told the Work and Pensions Select Committee: 'If you go to other countries like Germany and others they have a much more proactive process in trying to engage the worker at that point really, to find out what the problem is. 'Quite often they are really quite minor problems, they may be family problems, maybe there is family break up going on, or a hiatus or something that actually you can then deal with. 'They can be sent to some kind of help and support whether it is treatment if they are suffering some kind of mental health condition early on, stablilising them and keeping them in that job. 'So that is what we are now trying to focus our attention on is to get to people much earlier where they are work where they start to show indications of difficulty and start to get that treatment.' 'We would like to push companies even further to do more and we would like to support them to a greater degree', he added. Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, told The Telegraph: 'Iain Duncan Smith is undoubtedly correct in recognising that employers are often among the first people to discern the tell-tale signs of failing mental and emotional health and can play a valuable role in encouraging colleagues under strain to seek medical help. 'He describes this as more proactive approach, but it is still a reaction to a problem that has already begun to manifest itself. As a society we need to be proactive at an earlier stage still.'","Work and Pensions Secretary urges companies into intervene earlier .

"Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, begins tomorrow, and across Asia preparations are being made, showering the region in bright colours and gold. The five-day celebration symbolises the victory of good over evil, new beginnings and light from darkness - and commemorates Lord Ramis' return to his kingdom Ayodhya after completing a 14-year exile. The word Diwali translates as 'row of lamps' and devotees illuminate and decorate their homes using lanterns, garlands, oil lamps, candles and colourful light bulbs. Many draw colourful rangoli – traditional decorative patterns made with rice flour – outside their homes. Indian sweetmeats known as mithai are eaten both with meals and between them throughout the five days and fireworks and crackers are in heavy demand across India as the Hindu Festival of Diwali approaches . Dhanteras, the first day of the five-day Diwali Festival, celebrated in parts of India, holds special significance for the business community due to the customary purchases of precious metals on this day. Meanwhile, Nepalese Hindus celebrate their own version of Diwali - known as Tihar festival, during which they worship cows, which are considered a maternal figure, and other animals. Outside India, the largest Diwali celebrations take place in Leicester, during which around 35,000 people commune along Belgrave Road for the switching-on of the lights.

"The decision for Australia to join air strikes against Islamic State jihadists in Iraq will be made within days, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said. On Tuesday the federal government national security committee and cabinet is expected to meet to discuss how to clear any hurdles to Australia's participation in the conflict in Iraq, with the timing of a final decision just a 'question of days'. This comes as RAAF aircraft set to participate in attacks on the Islamic State have conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region. Scroll down for video . F/A-18F Super Hornet aircrew head to their aircraft in preparation for departure to the Middle East from RAAF Base Amberley last week in Amberley, Australia . Defence said F/A-18F Super Hornets, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and KC-30A airborne refueler all conducted preliminary flights from Australia's Middle East base on Sunday. That was aimed at familiarising aircrew of the Air Task Group with local conditions and coalition procedures so they can operate in the coalition command and control network. These missions will continue this week. The government has yet to give the final go-ahead for air attacks to start. It hasn't said yet whether IS would be targeted in Syria as well as Iraq. Defence chief Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said Australia was planning and coordinating operations of the Air Task Group with international partners. He said this task group, which comprises six Super Hornets plus the Wedgetail and KC-30A was well-suited to operating with coalition aircraft. RAAF aircraft set to participate in attacks on Islamic State  jihadists have conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region . 'They will significantly enhance the ability of Iraqi security forces to strike at ISIL terrorist elements,' he said in a statement. All aircraft in the Air Task Group are conducting their first ever combat deployments. The Super Hornets can conduct precision strikes against IS ground units and supply lines in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Wedgetail, regarded as the most advanced aircraft of its type in the world, can coordinate movement of coalition aircraft in what's likely to be very crowded airspace over the battlefield. Australia's tanker aircraft will contribute to the air campaign by refueling coalition aircraft, allowing extended missions. A 200-strong ground force, including special forces, stands ready to advise security forces inside Iraq.","Government expected to make decision to join air strikes 'within days'

"'I'll do anything to save my sight': Ella Woodhouse, above, is testing out the new technology, which could be rolled out to the NHS next year . A mask that shines green light into the eye during sleep could save the sight of thousands of Britons facing blindness. Diabetic retinopathy, one of the main causes of vision loss in people of working age in the UK, occurs when high blood-sugar levels damage the blood vessels in the retina. The condition causes the vessels to swell and leak fluid or close off completely, and sometimes causes abnormal vessels to appear on the surface of the retina. The Noctura 400 eye mask, which patients wear at night while they sleep, emits a low-level green light through the eyelids which mimics daylight. Although the light initially appears bright, the eyes quickly adjust. The mask interferes with the process that usually causes the eye to produce new blood vessels when it gets dark. While this tissue growth is beneficial for those people without diabetes, in those with diabetic retinopathy it increases the production of smaller blood vessels prone to damage and swelling which contribute to loss of vision. Until now, diabetic retinopathy has been treated with lasers, which can help to seal broken blood vessels and destroy damaged ones. But three per cent of patients experience some loss of peripheral vision and more than half will have some difficulty with night vision as a ‘side effect’. In about a third of patients, the treatment won’t work at all and these patients may go on to have injections into the eye of a drug called Lucentis. The injections are carried out under local anaesthetic at a cost of £1,000 each. They have to be given once a month for at least six months, and in most cases they are less effective as time goes on. The Noctura 400 is currently being evaluated by rationing body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and trials are under way in teaching hospitals including Moorfields in London. The plan is for the technology to be rolled out to the NHS next year. According to Professor Ian Grierson, a trustee of Moorfields Eye Hospital and professor of ophthalmology at the University of Liverpool, who is involved in running the trials and research into the mask, as many people as currently benefit from laser surgery could stand to benefit from the new device. ‘I envisage it being used as a first-line defence for patients who are in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy,’ he says. ‘The eyes of diabetic patients are closely monitored through annual checks, which aim to pick up the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. The Noctura 400 could replace the current laser treatment which is unsuccessful in three per cent of patients . The mask is going to be suitable where an ophthalmologist can see changes in the back of the patient’s eye that indicate he or she could be on the path to visual loss but before the patient has noticed a change in their vision.’ Prof Grierson believes the mask could also be used as a last resort for patients for whom laser therapy hasn’t worked and for those patients who want an alternative to unpleasant injections. The fashion design graduate started using the mask last week having already undergone laser therapy and injections . Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas fails to produce insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. It can be controlled with regular insulin injections, but if left untreated a build-up of glucose can cause damage to the small vessels, nerves and organs. One type 1 diabetes patient currently testing the mask is Ella Woodhouse, 22. She started using it last week, having already undergone laser therapy and injections. The graduate in fashion design from Sheffield says: ‘As a teenager, I did not take my insulin as regularly as I should have. It wasn’t bright because it allowed my sugar levels to rise at certain times.’ Earlier this year she started suffering blurred vision and then, to her horror, lost sight in one eye temporarily due to a burst blood vessel. ‘The injections helped and I’ve got my sight back,’ she says. ‘But my parents then saw some information on the internet about the light mask and my ophthalmologist said I should try it to prevent further damage.’ Every three months for a year, ophthalmologists will monitor her eyes and find out if their condition has deteriorated further. Ella, who wants to be a Savile Row tailor, is now taking her medication properly and says: ‘I will do anything to avoid losing my sight again.’ PolyPhotonix, the company that invented the mask, is also looking to start trials for treating age-related macular degeneration of the eye. This is also caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels on the retina and is the biggest single reason for loss of eyesight in the elderly. Prof Grierson adds: ‘We hope by next year to have the technology approved for use in the NHS. Initially it will be for long-term use, but some patients might only need to wear it short-term.’ Earlier this year Ella started suffering blurred vision and then, to her horror, lost sight in one eye temporarily due to a burst blood vessel .","Diabetic retinopathy one of UK's main causes of blindness in young people .

"It is one trademark celebration we’ve seen rather a lot of this season. At the final whistle, if Ipswich have claimed the three points, their captain Luke Chambers hangs around on the pitch. The fans linger too, knowing what’s coming. When all his team-mates have drifted off towards the tunnel, Chambers runs towards the stands and gives a victory shout and a fist pump. The crowd respond with a guttural roar of their own. On Saturday at Portman Road, Chambers did the celebratory fist pump no less than six times. It was, by popular Twitter consensus, the most passionate one yet. But then this had probably been the team’s best performance yet. Luke Chambers often leads the celebrations for Ipswich after victory at Portman Road . ‘We are going up,’ chorused the home faithful as Chambers (pictured) finally made his way off. They may well do. Ipswich look better equipped to mount a promotion challenge than in any of the last dozen campaigns since they dropped out of the Premier League. This was a surprisingly straightforward victory against a high-flying Middlesbrough side usually so assured on their travels but timid and toothless here. One of the Ipswich scorers was expected, the other less so. Republic of Ireland international Daryl Murphy rattled home his 14th of the season to move top of the Championship scorers’ chart, before Jay Tabb headed in the contest-killing second. The diminutive Tabb, discarded by his former club Reading, may have found himself on the scrapheap again at the end of last season but stayed at Ipswich to fight for his place — with outstanding results. Jay Tabb (left) has impressed at Portman Road, signing after being discarded by Reading . Tyrone Mings has been linked with Arsenal after an outstanding season so far in defence for Ipswich . ‘I think I was waxing lyrical about him last week,’ said manager Mick McCarthy. ‘He just continues to flourish and get better and better. ‘We made them all back themselves in a little sweepstake within the club and if they don’t get the goals, their £100 goes to charity. He only needs another seven so he’d better pull his finger out.’ There was an amusing debate about Tabb’s actual stature. Wikipedia suggested 5ft 7in, McCarthy thought that might be generous. Either way, he managed to outmuscle two burly Boro players in Emilio Nsue and Albert Adomah to head in Teddy Bishop’s perfect cross. ‘I’m 5ft 5in, maybe 5ft 6in but I have always had a good leap on me,’ said Tabb. ‘I win my fair share of headers out there on the wing. Mick McCarthy has taken Ipswich to second in the Championship table . Daryl Murphy (centre) is congratulated after scoring for Ipswich against Middlesbrough at the weekend . ‘I saw the ball come in and I just timed my jump well. I probably leaned into them a bit to win it but I managed to get above them. ‘Mick said to me at the end of last season things haven’t really worked out so if a club came in for me or I wanted to leave he would not stand in my way. ‘But I said “no” straight away. I like Ipswich Town, I like Suffolk, I like the gaffer and TC [assistant manager Terry Connor], and I wanted to stay and fight for my place. I’ve done that and it’s working out.’ With left-back Tyrone Mings linked with a move to Arsenal, McCarthy is also braced for a flurry of interest in 18-year-old midfielder Bishop, whom Boro boss Aitor Karanka described as the best player on the park. Bishop, a product of the club’s academy, has made his breakthrough this season but McCarthy issued a stern hands-off. ‘It would be wrong anyway. He should play his football here. It’s funny, when he starts doing well, everyone wants to get him out the door and sell him to a big Premier League club. If he wants to play in the Premier League, let’s see if we get there,’ said the Ipswich manager. You can only imagine the Chambers fist pump if they do make it. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe insisted the Capital One Cup loss to Liverpool wouldn’t affect his team. He was proved emphatically correct as the Cherries routed Blackpool 6-1 to ensure the Championship No 1 spot at Christmas. Matt Ritchie’s goal to make it 3-0 was pick of the bunch. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe (right) applauds Bournemouth's fans after beating Blackpool 6-1 . ‘It was an horrendous day,’ said Blackpool manager Lee Clark. ‘I’m angry, disappointed, embarrassed and upset.’ Not the best start for new Reading boss Steve Clarke as they went down 1-0 at home to 10-man Watford. They’ve now not scored in their last three Championship games at the Madejski. MK Dons boss Karl Robinson said his team were ‘sensational’ as they routed Oldham 7-0 to move into the automatic promotion spots in League One. Steve Clarke lost his first game as Reading manager 1-0 at home against Watford, who went down to 10 men . Will Grigg struck twice and there were five other scorers. Luton left Newport’s nine-match unbeaten run in tatters with a 3-0 win at Kenilworth Road to move third in League Two. The Hatters have won their last eight home league games.","Ipswich are second in the Championship after beating Middlesbrough .

Two men have been arrested and an investigation launched after armed police were called to the premises . When armed police arrived at the premises they discovered 99 dogs were on site, including the two Alsatians which caused the victim's injuries. Among the breeds discovered were Bull mastiffs, Dobermans, Alsatians and Pit Bull Terriers. A source told the Sun: 'The victim has horrendous life-changing injuries. Her arms and torso were very badly damaged.' Police have launched an investigation into the incident and two men, aged 20 and 27, have been arrested and bailed. The landowner, who did not want to be named, said two men running a company supplying guard dogs for security purposes had been renting the property. He had driven to inspect the farm on Thursday but was shocked when he opened his door and a large dog, which he thought was German Shepherd, jumped into his vehicle. He saw blood around his mouth and assumed it had been in a fight with another dog, until he found the victim. 'I came up here in my car and opened this gate and a German Shepherd came over and jumped in my car,' said the landowner, who is married with children. 'I just said ""oi, get out"". He had blood all over his face. I though he had been in a dog fight. 'Then I heard the screaming and found the girl in the little barn. She was in trauma. When police arrived they discovered 99 dogs  on site, including the two which caused the victim's injuries . 'It was horrific, she was in a bad way and all I saw were her arms. That's all I can remember, I was in shock. 'There were two dogs that had got out. The one that came over when I arrived and another next to the girl. 'It was just lying next to her and she was screaming. There was blood everywhere. 'I took her into my car and then closed the dogs into the pound. I drove to the end of the lane and rung an ambulance but it took 45 minutes to arrive. 'I rang and asked if I should just go to the hospital but they told me to wait then they eventually came and took her away.' The man said he thought the woman had been Eastern European. 'She just kept saying ""water"" and ""help me"" over and over,' he said. 'I don't know who employed her or if she knew the guys. I don't know how she's doing either.' The landowner originally bought the old stables to keep horses for his daughter but decided to let it out when she lost interest. He said he still used a large barn and a container situated just next to the pound for storage. The man said he didn't know much about the owners and said he had not been contacted by the RSPCA, which was today referring calls on the matter to police. He added: 'I have rented this place out to some guys who had been keeping dogs here. I didn't know much about it at all to be honest. Police using specialist equipment search the kennels at the site, which neighbours said had attracted complaints to the RSPCA and police on previous occasions . 'They had been here about a year but it was getting to the stage where they were no good. I hadn't had any hassle but there had been a bit of trouble with some locals. 'We wanted them out for a while but there was nowhere for them to go with a hundred odd dogs there. 'It was all rented out to them and I didn't have much to do with it.' Chief Inspector Gerry McDonald said: 'Officers are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding this serious incident.' 'A number of officers, including dog handlers and firearms officers are at the location as a precaution to ensure public and officer safety until we can fully understand what has happened. 'At this time we believe the scene is contained and that none of the dogs homed are currently on the loose, however we would ask members of the public to remain vigilant and avoid the area where possible until further notice. If you do see a loose dog in this part of the county please call the police straight away.' The isolated rural complex where the dogs were housed contained several outbuildings and it is believed the dogs were being trained for the security industry. Yesterday the police searched fields next to the farm for evidence, while footpaths in the area were sealed off. Firearms officers and specialist dog teams were among those deployed to the site. One local resident said: 'There were stables up there until a couple of years ago when they moved the cages and the dogs in. The isolated rural complex where the dogs were housed contained several outbuildings and it is believed the dogs were being trained for the security industry . Yesterday, police searched fields next to the farm for evidence, while footpaths in the area were sealed off . 'Complaints have been made to the police and RSPCA. I know animal rights people have not been very happy.' Hilary Lawrence-Tinsley, 57, lives across the road and said she had heard of complaints to the RSPCA. She said: 'I haven't heard of any getting out before but there have been complaints to the RSPCA in the past. 'Apparently they don't live in very good conditions but nothing was ever done about it as far as I'm aware.' Another resident, who did not want to be named, added: 'The only thing that bothers me is the barking. In the evening it can get quite loud.' Police blocked off pathways to the farm. On a gate the RSPCA had posted a note on Friday referring to the 99 dogs. Among the breeds discovered at the site were Bull mastiffs, Dobermans, Alsatians and Pit Bull Terriers . It said: 'The RSPCA would like to contact the person responsible for the animals to discuss their welfare. If the RSPCA does not hear within 14 days it will assume the owner has given up all legal rights.' The pound has been left abandoned by police and dozens of kennels today lay empty following the removal of the dogs. CCTV cameras had been fitted at the entrance to the compound and warnings about guard dogs were plastered on the surrounding fence posts. Dozens of kennels had been placed inside wrought iron cages which lay in a square around a central empty space. Fences fitted with plastic sheeting were also erected around its perimeter in a bid to keep the cages private from the fields that surrounded it. A police spokesman said: 'The compound contains outbuildings and a significant number of dogs were found to be homed at the location. 'Two dogs have been seized as part of the investigation and officers will be working with other agencies to identify the other dogs at the location and re-home them appropriately.'","Woman in hospital with 'life-changing injuries' after savage dog attack .

"Author Wilbur Smith wooed wife Mokhiniso Rakhimova, pictured together in 2011, with an expensive lunch... but his plan almost backfired . As a best-selling author with millions in the bank, it is not hard to see why women might find Wilbur Smith attractive. But his attempts to use his fame and estimated £100million fortune when trying to seduce the woman who is now his current wife almost backfired. The 81-year-old met Tajikistan-born Mokhiniso Rakhimova, 42, in 1999 in a London bookshop while she was browsing Dan Brown novels. He quickly directed her attention to his own writings – before treating her to a £1,000 caviar lunch. Mr Smith’s efforts almost backfired when she assumed he must be penniless. In Russia, where she was educated, writers are often badly paid and caviar is treated as an everyday commodity. Mr Smith has sold more than 122million copies of his 36 books since 1964. But the South African writer said it took a while to persuade Russian-educated Miss Rakhimova he was successful. But he eventually persuaded her to overlook their 39-year age gap and made her his fourth wife months later. Recalling the moment they met in a London bookshop, Mr Smith told Reader’s Digest: ‘I lurked among the bookshelves and she was as exotic and lovely as I’d first thought. I sidled up to her and said, “Why are you looking at Dan Brown’s books?” ‘She told me she was studying English and her teacher had told her to read some colloquial writing. I said, “Let me suggest another writer,” and got down one of my own books. ‘When she realised I was the author she felt very sorry for me - in Russia, where she was from, writers are badly paid. And my clothes seemed horribly old to her.’ Mr Smith has sold more than 122million copies of his 36 books since 1964. He has a five-bedroom house in Cape Town, facing Table Mountain, and a three-bedroom town house in Knightsbridge in London. But the South African writer said it took a while to persuade law student Miss Rakhimova – whose is nicknamed Niso – that he was successful. He said: ‘She agreed to have lunch with me so, trying to impress, I took her to a caviar restaurant. Then she thought I must be really poor because in Russia, caviar is the cheapest thing on the menu. ‘Being a student and hungry, she ate four pots of the stuff, and when the bill came in at over £1,000, she couldn’t believe it. ‘Niso and I have been married 15 years. She’s made me a happy man and, except when I look in the mirror, I feel about 40 and know there are still many good memories to come.’ In the past, Mr Smith has admitted that his first two marriages – which gave him three sons – were ‘lust matches’. Novelist Wilbur Smith, 81, married his current wife, pictured right in their London home, after he eventually persuaded her to overlook their 39-year age gap . He was married to his third wife, Danielle, for 28 years and dedicated his books to her until she died from cancer in 1999, months before he met Miss Rakhimova. Describing that marriage he said: ‘It was so good and then, at the end, so very sad. The cancer got into her brain and she was no longer the woman I’d loved all those years. ‘I sat beside her when she died and thought, “My darling, you’re at peace now”. She died in 1999, the same year as [his publisher] Charles Pick, and I felt so alone.’ Mr Smith is best known for his adventure novels, most of which are set in Africa. The author also recalled one incident from his childhood that could have come straight from one of his own plots. Aged just 14, he was left in charge of his parents’ 30,000 acre ranch while they were on holiday, when three lions attacked their cattle. He said: ‘I grabbed my father’s rifle. When we got to the pasture, I could see three dead cows – and the distinctive ears of a lioness. ‘She charged at me, so I shot her. Then another lioness came out and I shot her as well. Then a big male who’d been lurking nearby ran at me so I shot him.’ He added: ‘When my father came back he was amazed. He gave me a hiding for being so stupid as to go after lions, then gave me the rifle as a reward for being so brave.’","Best-selling author met Mokhiniso Rakhimova in London bookshop in 1999 .

"A virus that has been causing severe respiratory illness across the country has for first time been blamed for the death of a four-year-old child. A medical examiner in Hamiltown Township, New Jersey, has ruled that Eli Waller died last week was a result of enterovirus 68. The virus - which carries symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sneezing and body aches - has sickened more than 500 people in 43 states and Washington, D.C. - almost all of them children. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this week that four people infected with the virus had died, but it's unclear what role the virus played in those deaths. Scroll down for video . Urging calm: Hamilton Mayor Kelly Yaede addresses the media concerning the death of a Hamilton Township, preschooler from enterovirus 68 on Saturday October 4, 2014. The mayor said New Jersey wull continue to follow the necessary protocols in order to prevent the spread of the virus . Scene: On September 25, four-year-old Eli Waller from New Jersey, who attended preschool at Yardville Elementary School, died from Enterovirus 68 . Widespread:From mid-August to October 3, 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 538 people in 43 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 . Tragic: Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital. She was infected with EV-D68, but died from a bacterial infection that hit her in tandem with the virus . Some children are especially vulnerable to infection because of pre-existing conditions, though the medical examiner said that was not the case in the New Jersey boy's death. Eli Waller, who attended Yardville Elementary School in Hamilton, died at his home on September 25. Most of the severe cases nationwide have involved children because they generally have not been exposed to enteroviruses as often as adults have and are less likely to have developed immunity to them, officials say. Township officials said the boy's parents have asked for privacy. 'When you're given the news that a virus was the cause of death to your child, of course they were saddened, even more so because they won't get the answers or closure they need,' Mayor Kelly Yaede said. ""The mother said, `We will never find out where he contracted this.'"" The virus was also found in four other patients who died in September, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC declined to release any other details about those deaths. Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital. The  child's death was the result of a bacterial infection, Staphylococcus aureus, that hit the girl in tandem with the virus, Rhode Island officials said in a statement. They called it 'a very rare combination', and stressed that most people who catch the virus experience little more than a runny nose and low-grade fever. The child was in good health before she developed severe breathing problems and her parents called 911, said Dr. Michael Fine, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health. Warning: Children's Hospital Colorado pediatric neurologist Teri Schreiner, MD, speaks during a press conference at the hospital September 30 to update the media on the condition of 10 patients with EV-D68 . Recovering: Melissa Lewis, of Denver, helps her son, Jayden Broadway, 9, as he coughs in his bed at the Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo. He was treated for the enterovirus 68 and released . She was taken by ambulance to a Providence hospital, where she died. 'Very quickly after they got to the hospital, things became dire,' Fine said at a news conference. This enterovirus germ is not new. It was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before. Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold. This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. Beginning last month, hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago have received a flood of children with trouble breathing. Some needed oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many, but not all, had asthma before the infection. Germ: Enterovirus EV-D68 is uncommon but not new and causes prominent respiratory symptoms, like a cold but worse. There's no vaccine for EV-D68 . Sick: 13-year-old Will Cornejo is recovering at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver on September 5 from human enterovirus 68 that has come to Colorado . Health officials say they have not detected a recent mutation or other change in the virus that would cause it to become more dangerous. The government says enterovirus 68 has sickenedover 500 people in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Almost all have been children. Health officials are also investigating whether the virus played a role in a cluster of 10 Denver-area children who have suffered muscle weakness and paralysis.","Eli Waller, from New Jersey, died from EV D68, health officials have confirmed .

"It was meant to be a fun-filled trip with his family to Disney World, but reality set in for a former senior Venezuelan judge when he stepped off a flight in Miami and federal agents carted him off to jail. Benny Palmeri-Bacchi, 46, never made it to the Orlando theme park, and instead today it was revealed he will now be spending at least 20 years in prison over links to Colombian drug cartels. Mr Palmeri walked into the 'bear trap' in July after a secretive and far-reaching inquiry by US investigators into links between Venezuelan government officials and Colombian 'narcos'. Prosecutors had accused Mr Palmeri of taking bribes to allow traffickers smuggle cocaine through Venezuela from neighbouring Colombia, the world's No 2 producer of the drug after Peru. Benny Palmeri-Bacchi (right) had planned a fun-filled trip with his family to Disney World (left), but was arrested in Miami over links to Colombian drug cartels while he was a judge under the government of Hugo Chavez . The consignments of cocaine were shipped through Venezuela to Mexico and the Caribbean by plane to be sold and distributed in the U.S. The former  legal official in the South American country pleaded guilty in a federal court in Miami this week to money laundering, conspiracy and extortion charges. He initially denied the accusations. Mr Palmeri's arrest and admission over the claims against him is the first time an ally of the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has been tied to the Colombian drugs trade. The prosecutors dropped a charge claiming Mr Palmeri was involved in the distribution of cocaine in return for his pleading guilty on the three other counts, each of which carries a 20-year jail term. Venezuela's self-styled socialist government has always denied claims it has links with smugglers who traffic cocaine from Colombia through its 1,400 mile porous border with the neighbouring country. Harry Landen, a Venezuela expert at the University of South Florida, said the country's leadership under President Nicolas Maduro would likely distance themselves from Mr Palmeri. An academic said if the government of president Nicolas Maduro (left) is 'smart' they'll distance themselves from Palmeri. His arrest is the first an ally of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez over links  to the 'narcos' 'Whether the government is embarrassed by this depends on how senior this judge was, how close he was to the previous party of Chávez or the new party of Máduro, and who he knew. 'If they're smart they'll write him off as a rogue agent, someone acting on his own and whose activities they condemn completely.' Mr Palmeri's plea deal recommends his terms be served concurrently, but the US district court judge Ursula Ungaro can decide at the sentencing hearing in February to make them run consecutively. Informants were key in bringing the case against Mr Palmeri. Veteran prosecutor Richard Gregorie, who brought down Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega in 1992, led the team of investigators. The indictment alleged, Mr Palmeri threatened an estate agent by emailing photographs of a man being murdered and videos of prisoners being sodomised in Venezuelan prisons. Authorities saw an opportunity to get Mr Palmeri when he applied for a visa at the US embassy in Caracas for his family holiday to Florida. Mr Palmeri's Miami-based lawyer, Edward Abramson, told the court at his initial appearance after his arrest in July, that his client had walked into 'a bear trap' of the US government's creation. The former judge had pleaded not guilty to all charges but changed his mind apparently in return for cooperating with investigators. Prosecutors dropped the distribution charge, which carried a sentence of life. Mr Gregorie's office did not respond to a request for comment yesterday. Mr Palmeri was one of three men indicted in December 2013 by department of justice investigators looking into the Colombian Cartel of the Suns. U.S. anti-drugs officials have claimed there was a loose alliance of political leaders and military officials in the government of long-time late Venezuelan president Chávez.","Benny Palmeri-Bacchi, a senior Venezuelan judge, arrived on family holiday .

"Two Hawaii residents have been arrested for trespassing to see lava and taking selfies, police said on Friday amid growing interest from people eager to witness the slow-moving flow. Hawaii County police said officers saw a man and a woman on county property Thursday taking photos within 5 feet of the lava in the small town of Pahoa. Ruth Crawford, 65, and Stephen Koch, 59,  had two golf clubs that had been dipped in lava, which had hardened on the clubs, police said. Scroll down for video . Beating the heat: Ruth Crawford, 65, shows reporters an egg beater dipped in lava after getting so close to the volcanic heat that she was arrested for trespassing . Put-put you in trouble: Stephen Koch, 59, had two golf clubs that had been dipped in lava and also was arrested for trespassing along with Ruth . Busted: Ruth Crawford was arrested for trespassing to get a closer look at lava creeping towards a town . They crossed private property to get to the spot where they watched the lava and later spoke with reporters at KITV. 'It was very hot and I felt like my face was burning. It was really hot,' said Puna resident Ruth Crawford. When reporters asked her why she ventured into the forbidden territory she told them, 'Just because it's lava and I've been here 23 years and I was kind of excited and scared and just wanted to do it.' After their arrest, Crawford and Koch posted $250 bail. 'I know we're not supposed to, but, OK, I won't again,' said Crawford. Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said the county is restricting the public's access to the lava flow to keep people safe. 'It's unfortunate. We would hope we wouldn't have to take steps to enforce the rules,' Oliveira told reporters. He said the lava is currently in people's backyards. The county may be able to enable public viewing if and when it enters public land, he said. Hot stuff: Lava flow is burning vegetation near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii and is making a small crawl towards a major road in the area . Creeping slowly: The Hawaii National Guard is deploying troops to a rural Hawaii town as lava makes a slow crawl toward a major road and threatens to further isolate the community . But authorities need to be able to manage the situation. In 1990, when lava poured into Kalapana on the Big Island's southern coast, parked cars lined the roads and people crowded in to watch. Tourists and residents have been streaming into Pahoa for a glimpse of the lava since the flow edged closer to the town's main road. Tourists and residents from around the Big Island are giving restaurants extra business. Glen Bousquet, a tree trimmer from the nearby community of Nanawale, said he hiked to the flow multiple times since the weekend and trtrespassed to do so. He followed the glow through 6-foot-tall grass, he said. ''It's so interesting to see nature unfolding. It's like a once in a lifetime chance to actually see it up close and personal without having to wait for it to be on TV,' he said. 'You kind of get the real deal.' Though he trespassed, he said he did so with 'the utmost respect' and didn't break any fences or otherwise harm anyone's property. But he said won't go back because he doesn't want to get arrested. Some are jilted by the lava but others say that they're not afraid of the heat, . 'I don't think people need to panic. Auntie Pele is going to do what she wants to do so allow things to move the best way possible to allow things to move and stay safe. Everything is going to be OK,' said coconut vendor Vince McMillon to KITV. The Star Advertiser reports that others have been arrested because they are taking advantage of an emergency situation and using it to loot homes.

"Church of England vicar James Ogley pictured outside court during an earlier court appearance . A Church of England vicar who told a 13-year-old girl to sexually abuse her nine-year-old sister during an online chat has been jailed for just two years. Reverend James Ogley, a married father of two young children, told the teenager he wanted her and her sister to have sex with their own mother. In another online exchange, he told the teenager to rape her younger sibling. Police officers discovered the clergyman's communications when they went to the vicarage in Luton, Bedfordshire, where he lived with his family and seized his laptop computer from his study. Ogley had been a regular visitor to the chat room for youngsters, deriving sexual gratification from the chat logs, a court was told. At Luton Crown Court, 38-year-old Ogley, the vicar of Saint Francis Church in Luton, pleaded guilty to seven charges of publishing obscene material in the form of chat logs. Six offences relate to material posted online in June 2012 and one to a publication in November 2012. Ogley, who had been suspended from his post since his arrest, was jailed for two years. Passing sentence, Judge David Farrell QC told him: 'What you did was totally incompatible with the beliefs and teachings of a vicar. You are there to uphold and further Christian beliefs. 'You were and still are the vicar of St Francis Church here in Luton. You have let down all those who looked up to you as the holder of a respected office.' The court was told he had lost everything following his fall from grace. His marriage had fallen apart, he had lost his home and now he would be dismissed from the church. Prosecutor Daniel Siong said it was on January 10 last year that officers went to the home in Luton where, as vicar of St Francis Church since August 2011, Ogley lived with his young family. The officers had gone to Ogley's home because they had received 'intelligence' that someone at the address had been attempting to contact children via the chat room 'Internet Relay Chat' and asking them to 'commit child sex offences.' Questioned about their use of IRC, the vicar said he had not visited the chat forum for 'some time.' His wife said she had not used the chat room since her days at university. Ogley admitted having obscene conversations with children under the age of 16 on an internet chat log . But after officers were provided with a password to his laptop, chat logs were discovered that showed he had been having 'sexually explicit' online conversations with youngsters who appeared to be under the age of 16. Mr Siong said: 'The material included graphic descriptions of sexual abuse of children. These included incestuous, sadistic, paedophiliac sexual acts on young and very young children - four years old in one instance.' He added: 'He was arrested on suspicion of facilitating child sex offences and taken to the police station.' Judge David Farrell QC, hearing the case, was told how Ogley had talked online of performing sex acts with an eight year old boy, and told a young girl to remove her clothing. Ogley has been vicar at St Francis Church in Luton (pictured) since August 2011 . Speaking after an earlier hearing when Ogley pleaded guilty to the offences, The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, said: 'I am deeply saddened that one of the clergy, of whom I expect the highest standards of behaviour, has committed these offences. 'My prayers are with all those affected by [his] actions and with the people of his parish.' Ogley was appointed as the vicar of St Francis in August 2011. He was formerly vicar in the Diocese of Winchester, near Southampton. In a statement, the Diocese said: 'Upon conviction of a criminal offence, the Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, may, under the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003, impose a penalty on a clergyman without further legal process. 'The Bishop will impose an appropriate penalty after sentencing. 'He will take account of what he sees as the gravity of this case and the breach of the trust reposed in Ogley by the church and by the parishioners of St Francis Luton.' The prosecutor went on 'He then asked her to sexually abuse her sister who is asleep in another room.' Mr Siong said Ogley understood the sister to be nine years old. Ogley himself had pretended to be a youngster and on one occasion during a conversation claimed he was a 14-year-old boy from Ireland. Ogley (pictured) was told that had police been able to trace the children receiving the chat logs, he could have faced charges of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity . When interviewed by detectives, Ogley admitted he had been sexually aroused while having the online conversations, but he said he had never arranged to meet anyone. He claimed he had been 'role playing' and Mr Siong said there was no evidence he had tried to meet the people he was chatting to. The court was told that it hadn't been possible for police to trace the people Ogley had spoken to in the chatroom. Mr Siong added 'The prosecution say this case involves a serious breach of trust by reason of his position as a Church of England reverend. 'As a member of the clergy there is a higher degree of trust placed in him by members of the public, especially vulnerable members of the public, such as children. 'His clear motivation was to obtain sexual gratification by discussing with vulnerable children paedophiliac sexual matters.' The court was told the true identities of the people Ogley was talking to in the chat room would never be known, but he said: 'The clear inference to be drawn from the chat logs is that the defendant must have believed he was communicating with children, as he now accepts.' Andrew Morton, defending, said Ogley had been suspended from his post as vicar of St Francis in January 2013 - the day after his arrest - and 'in all likelihood' he would be dismissed. He told the court that Ogley had got into the habit of surfing the internet in the evenings and going into chat rooms, some of which were devoted to 'explicit topics.' 'What we are dealing with is a man with a deeply unhealthy tendency to be aroused by children engaging in sexual activity.' he said. Passing sentence, Judge Farrell told Ogley had police been able to trace those people receiving his chat logs, then he could have faced the much more serious charges of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. 'You have let down all those who looked up to you as the holder of a respected office.'","Married father and reverend James Ogley admitted obscene material charges .

"A driver had to pay £150 to have his car released after police wrongly accused him of driving without insurance - and tweeted a photo of the seized car before he could prove his innocence. Nathan Phipps, 34, was left stranded at the side of the A19 near Skipton, North Yorkshire when police pulled him over as he was taking his newly-bought Renault Clio for a test drive. The security guard, from Earby, Lancashire, was questioned by officers and told he was being charged with driving without insurance - an offence which carries a £300 fine and six penalty points. Nathan Phipps, 34, from Earby, Lancashire, pictured left, was furious when police posted a photo on Twitter, pictured right, claiming he was driving without insurance - despite him proving his innocence the next day . Mr Phipps insisted he was covered by third party insurance but was left standing at the roadside when police seized the vehicle. He and his girlfriend Jane Jarvis, 39, who were with their two dogs, then had to find their own way home. But before leaving, the officer slapped a sticker on the Clio, saying 'No insurance means no car!'. The officer then took a photo of the car and posted it on Twitter with the message: 'finished the day as started, another no insurance £seized'. The next day, Mr Phipps took his insurance documents to the station, proving he had third party insurance and the charges were dropped. But Mr Phipps still have to pay £150 to have his car released - despite it being unfairly seized. And his colleagues knew all about the incident the next day - become someone had seen the post online. Now the father--of-one has lodged an official complaint against the North Yorkshire officer who stopped him on September 18. He said: 'I'm absolutely disgusted. It was my girlfriend's car and we had just bought it. 'I've used the garage a lot so they said I could take it for a drive and if I wanted any extra work doing on it, they would carry it out and I could pick it up the next day. Mr Phipps had to pay £150 to retrieve the car after police seized it at the side of the A19, near Skipton . North Yorkshire Police confirmed that no action was being taken with the no insurance. The force added that Mr Phipps' complaint was being investigated . 'I knew I was covered by my third party insurance and I was absolutely positive I had all the documents at home to prove it. I told the officer this when he stopped me but he wouldn't listen. 'He was very arrogant and he just kept playing with his phone. I told him to ring my insurance company to check it out and he said he would. 'But he came back a few minutes later and told me he'd phoned and they said I had no insurance.' After being left stranded on the side of the road, Mr Phipps had to ring his father to pick him up from the side of the road. He continued: 'I knew at the time it was a mistake. I don't know why they told him I had no insurance but I'm sure that was just a misunderstanding. 'But what really annoyed me was when I saw what he was doing on his phone. 'When he started taking the picture of my car, I asked him what he was doing and he said he had a Twitter account and he and a few of the lads had a good laugh about it. I said I didn't find it funny at all. 'A few minutes later, when I looked at the screen I saw him send the Tweet with a picture of my car. 'When I told him I was not happy about it he just told me 'it was done' and there was nothing he could do about it.' He added: 'Once I proved I had insurance they decided to drop it so I haven't had to pay the £300 fine or had the six penalty points. 'But the police said if I want get my £154 back I have to go to a solicitor. I haven't received a single apology either. 'When I got into work the next day, my colleagues knew about it because someone had seen it on Twitter.' After lodging his complaint, Nathan has been told that police regard tweeting as a useful public relations exercise. He added: 'I don't think it is good PR at all - I think it is highly unprofessional. 'The officer should not have been on his phone Tweeting when I was standing there, and he put it out that I was uninsured when I was. 'I am totally disgusted. I wouldn't do it at work and I don't think he should have done it either. Plus all my colleagues were aware of it and so I looked really bad. 'I don't know what I'm going to do next but they've picked on the wrong person.' North Yorkshire Police confirmed that no action was being taken with the no insurance. The force added that the complaint was being investigated. A spokesman said: 'As this issue is the subject of an investigation by the force's professional standards department, it is not appropriate for us to comment at this time.'","Nathan Phipps, 34, was taking his newly-bought Renault Clio for a test drive .

"The terror in the voice of a New Jersey man who escaped a fatal bear attack is palpable is a newly released 911 call record just moments after the animal had fatally wounded his friend. Rutgers University senior Darsh Patel was hiking through the Apshawa Preserve with friends this Sunday when they were attacked. At least one male member of the hiking party - not identified by authorities - was able to get away and call for help. Scroll down for video . Attacks: Northern New Jersey locals captured this black bear looking for food in their garbage in September. Just a day after the footage was shot,  a black bear mauled a 22-year-old student to death in the woods nearby . Patel, 22, was later found mauled to death. In the 911 call, the friend can be heard to explain the situation, ABC News reports. 'We were hiking and we saw a bear and we all started running and it started chasing us,' he says. He adds that two other friends were also 'really close' to the animal. 'I'm scared out of my mind for them,' he says. 'I want to go back but I'm hurt and I don't know what to do.' The dispatcher asks: 'You're hurt, you said?' 'Not badly,' he replies. 'I just scraped my leg. It's nothing major, but I'm more worried about them. Can anybody get here anytime really soon please?' Locals in northern New Jersey believe they filmed a black bear hunting for food hours before a 22-year-old hiker was mauled to death in nearby woods at the weekend. Two men splitting wood on Saturday captured a video of a bear going through garbage just a few feet from where they were working, before scampering off into the woods, according to CNN. On Sunday, Patel,  who was majoring in information technology and informatics, was found dead in Apshawa Preserve - about 45 miles northwest of New York City - with a 300-pound bear guarding his body. Officials say the attack was the first fatal bear-human encounter on record in New Jersey. The bear was about 30 yards from the body and circling, Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese said, and wouldn't leave even after officers tried to scare it away by making loud noises and throwing sticks and stones. The male bear was killed with two rifle blasts and is being examined at a state lab for more clues as to why it may have pursued the group of five hikers. Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food. State and local officials stressed that bear attacks are rare even in a region of the state that may have as many as 2,400 bruins in its dense forests. 'This is a rare occurrence,' West Milford police Chief Timothy Storbeck said, noting that his department receives six to 12 calls per week regarding bears, usually involving them breaking into trash cans. Locals: Residents in northern New Jersey often spot bears in and around their yards. There are as many 2,400 bruins in the area's dense forests, but until now had never been a fatal human-bear attack . Preserve: This photo from NJUrbanForest.com shows the Apshawa Preserve, a 526-acre park with hiking trails . Wildlife officials believe there is a current shortage of the acorns and berries that bears eat. The hikers had granola bars and water with them, Storbeck said. Officials don't believe the hikers provoked the bear but they may have showed their inexperience when they decided to run. The safest way to handle a bear encounter is to move slowly and not look the bear in the eye, DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said. New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife guidelines direct law enforcement to euthanize 'Category I' bears, which are deemed an 'immediate threat to human safety.' NJ Advance Media reports that the New Jersey State Medical Examiner, the Fish and Wildlife Division of the state Department of Environmental Protection and the West Milford Police Department are looking into the circumstances of Patel's death. Idyllic: The wooded preserve provides hiking trails and a peaceful setting for visitors to the northern New Jersey site . 'Bear sightings are not unusual by any stretch in New Jersey,' said Bob Considine, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection. 'They have been seen in all 21 counties, although they’re obviously most common in the northwest part of the state.' Black bears rarely pose a threat to humans and often retreat when confronted. In 2006, a tabby cat scared a black bear up a tree in West Milford. The bear only climbed down and left after the cat's owner had called it back into the house.","Darsh Patel, 22, was hiking with friends in the Apshawa Preserve in West Milford on Sunday when a bear started following them .

"Gurning for the camera clearly isn't anything new if these fascinating photographs from over 100 years ago are anything to go by. The newly unearthed pictures from the Northumberland Archives at Woodhorn Museum, in Ashington, prove that our ancestors enjoyed messing around in front of the camera as much as we do. From moustachioed gentlemen to laughing ladies and cheeky children, the images show that the notion of those from a bygone era being prim and proper isn't quite true. Scroll down for video . Gurning: Newly unearthed pictures from the Northumberland Archives at Woodhorn Museum, in Ashington, prove that our ancestors enjoyed messing around in front of the camera as much as we do . In just this small sample of pictures from the collection a family can be seen enjoying a bizarre day out at a gallows known as Winter's Gibbet, on Steng Cross, in Elsdon, Northumberland. In another photo rows and rows of youngsters are pictured sat up in their beds on Friday May 28, 1926, with the staff of Stannington Sanitorium near Morpeth. The children are pictured under a sign reading 'Happiness' apparently awaiting a visit from the Duke of York who would 10 years later become King George VI. And perhaps the most fascinating set of images are the series of Northumbrian natives making odd faces for the camera - although the date of these pictures is not known. Labour of love: Chris Wild, founder of Retronaut, spent a year assembling the pictures - which will be exhibited from September 27 . Technical matter: Mr Wild said that in the late 1800s the long exposure times meant that holding a smile was quite difficult, so people tended to have a blank expression . The collection has been compiled by the museum and Chris Wild - who founded the past pictures website Retronaut. He has spent the past year mining the photographic collection of the Woodhorn Museum and Northumberland Archives for fascinating treasure trove which will be exhibited from September 27. Mr Wild, 44, from Oxfordshire, said: 'I started Retronaut four years ago. Ever since I was a young boy, I have wanted to go back in time. 'When I was working in museums, I started to see early colour photographs. These photographs didn't look like ""the past"", the colour made them look like ""now"" - but another version of now. Fun factor: Mr Wild explained that those from the Victorian era did clown around in the front of the camera - it was just harder to capture it . These pictures of children were taken by a Northumbrian photographer visiting the Low Countries and shows the fascinating traditional dress of women in the Netherlands . Smiles better: While the main subjects of this picture, taken in the Netherlands, hold serious expressions, the two women to the side see a funny side to the situation . 'These pictures gave me the closest experience to time-travel I had had. I started to collect them, and other pictures that had a similar effect. The collection became Retronaut.' Mr Wild said the photographs of people pulling faces in the archive were perhaps the most fascinating aspect of his research. He said: 'The exposure time for a photograph in the late 1800s is several seconds - very long by modern standards, but miniscule compared to the first photograph, taken in 1827 and with an exposure of several days. 'Still, that several-second exposure meant that the subject had to stand very still. 'Holding a smile was too difficult, and would either look very false and fixed - or would blur. 'So people posed with blank and unsmiling faces. Much as we are asked to do for passport pictures today. 'If someone a hundred years from now was to judge our temperament from our passports alone, they would conclude we were serious, stilted and stiff. 'We are not, but the passport medium records us that way. In the same way, the Victorians were recorded as serious, stilted and stiff - but that is the medium we are describing, not the people. Victorians clowned around - it was just harder to record that photographically. 'The most interesting thing to me about this archive is that there is nothing especially interesting about it. 'It is a typical British county archive collection - in other words, something that most people will not think about very much, unless they are researching their family tree. 'I wanted to show that archives and museums are the custodians of all our fragments of time. And that those fragments can be very arresting and engaging, when cast in the right light. 'Retronaut has come to mean anachronistic images - pictures which don't fit with the way we think of the past. 'And because of this way of selecting images, they usually are very engaging, and create online traffic for their source. An unknown group of women pose for an undated photograph, with one clearly keen to show of her chunky hairbrush . Staff of Stannington Sanitorium near Morpeth scrubbed this ward to within an inch of its life. The beneficiary of this frenzied activity was the Duke of York, who just over 10 years later would become King George VI. The children all posed for a photograph under a sign that read 'Happiness' Bizarre: A family day out in the early 20th century at a former hanging post known as Winter's Gibbet, on Steng Cross, Elsdon, Northumberland. Named after one William Winter who was hanged at Newcastle's Westgate in 1792 for murder and whose body was subsequently displayed as a warning to all . 'In other words, Retronaut is like a shop window for archives. I want that to continue, and for Retronaut to be able to show more of the world's archival wonders in its window.' Keith Merrin, director of Museums and Archives Northumberland, said the Retronaut project was very important. He said: 'Archives remain one of the best kept secrets of the heritage sector. They contain amazing records covering all aspects of life in the communities around the UK but many people are unsure how to access them or what they contain. 'At Woodhorn and our other museums in Northumberland we have a brilliant track record of enthusing people about their local history and we are keen to find new ways of making sure that our archive collections can also reach the widest possible audience. 'Through his Retronaut work Chris has established himself as a world leader in terms of bringing archives to audiences that otherwise would never see them. 'These audiences are often younger and more comfortable searching the digital world.' Mr Wild will work with archivists from Museums and Archives Northumberland to explore its collections and help the organisation reach new audiences. It is hoped that a physical exhibition curated by The Retronaut will take place at Woodhorn in 2014. Retronaut's first book has just been published by National Geographic.

"Tipping the scales at a staggering 38 stone, Craig Wood was morbidly obese, having racked up £15,000 debt to satisfy his £200-a-day addiction to takeaways. The 31-year-old admits he even shoplifted chicken wings, stuffing them in his trousers to gorge on when he got home. His diet was laden with sausage rolls, deep fried treats, chocolate and biscuits - washed down with pints of lager, Baileys and Jack Daniels. But after undergoing gastric band surgery on the NHS, Mr Wood has shed 20st - and now weighs 18st. His body mass index (BMI) was 61 - almost three times the recommended range of 18.5 to 25. Craig Wood, 31, from Hereford, tipped the scales at a staggering 38 stone - almost quarter of a tonne . He now weighs 18 stone after undergoing weight loss surgery on the NHS. He said doctors told him he had to lose nine stone before he was eligible for the operation . Mr Wood racked up £15,000 debt spending around £200 each day on takeaways and pints of beer . The electronics technician admits he would shoplift chicken wings from supermarkets, stuffing packets into his trousers to feed his addiction to fat-drenched foods . His chest measured 78 inches, his waist 58 inches and he wore a size XXXXXXXXXL shirt. The electronics technician said: 'I'd always been overweight, and by the age of eight, teachers were pulling me out of lessons to tell me that they were worried about my size. ‘My mum would cook normal-sized portions, but I’d spend all of my pocket money on chocolate and secretly scoff biscuits in my room. ‘I remember when I was 13 and there was a promotional offer on Snickers, where you could win a pair of David Beckham football boots. 'I pretended that I was buying loads of Snickers to win the boots, but really I just wanted to eat them.’ By the time he left school, Mr Wood was morbidly obese. Unable to find a job, Mr Wood spent five years housebound, rarely leaving home. He said: 'I was too big for interviews, so I just couldn’t get a job. Employers would judge me as soon as I walked into the room. But after undergoing a gastric band operation on the NHS, Mr Wood has shed 20st and now weighs 18st . ‘So instead, I’d stay inside and play computer games all day, eating sandwiches and drinking fizzy pop. ‘And when I did go out, I’d guzzle down takeaways, beer and Baileys with ice - spending up to £200 a night.’ While he played the joker with his friends, Mr Wood said he was miserable and  ashamed of his appearance. Worse still, he had racked up an eye-watering £15,000 debt, overspending on food. Mr Wood, from Hereford, said: ‘I was disgusted with myself. 'Strangers would come up to me in the pub and say: ‘Good God, look at the size of you.' ‘I didn’t need to be told I was massive - I already knew. Every time I looked in the mirror, I could see just how enormous I was. ‘It got the point where I knew my friends were embarrassed to be seen with me, and they stopped inviting me to things. ‘But I still couldn’t stop eating. I even shoplifted chicken wings from supermarkets to fuel my addiction.’ The turning point came in July 2007, when Mr Wood was struck down with meningitis and only one friend came to visit him in hospital. He said: ‘I realised then that I was throwing my life away. I didn’t have a career, or friends or a girlfriend. ‘I had almost died, and only one person cared enough to come and visit me. ‘Everyone around me was getting married and starting a family, and I knew this was something that I would never have unless I did something about it.’ Mr Wood visited his GP, and was horrified to learn that he weighed a massive 38st - nearly a quarter of a tonne. At 61, his BMI was almost three times the recommended range of 18.5 to 25 and he was at serious risk of having a heart attack or developing diabetes. In 2009, he was referred to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, where he was advised that a gastric band would be best option. Although he was eligible for the operation on the NHS, Mr Wood was told he had to lose more than nine stone before he was allowed to undergo the two-hour operation in June 2012. He has called for more to be done to help people with a an addiction to food. He said: ' At the end of the day, an addiction is an addiction. If I had been addicted to heroin, I think I would have been taken more seriously' The turning point came in July 2007 when Mr Wood was admitted to hospital with meningitis and just one person came to visit him. He said he realised he had no job, no friends and no girlfriend as a result of his weight . Mr Wood said: 'I’m so grateful that I’ve been given another chance, and I’ll never let myself go again' Diet before: . Breakfast - nothing . Lunch - Sausage roll, flapjack, cheese sandwiches and a fizzy drink . Dinner - Sausage, chips, beans and egg . Snacks - Cheese, chocolate, biscuits, crisps, Baileys, beer, Jack Daniels and Coke . Diet now: . Breakfast - Apple . Lunch - Ham and mixed leaf salad with peppers . Dinner - Vegetables with Philadelphia sauce . Snacks - Yoghurt . Today he called for more to be done to help people with a food addiction. He said: ‘People think that surgery is the easy option, but it really isn’t. 'I had to go to months of counselling and lose a lot of weight before the surgery. ‘For weeks after the operation, I could only eat yoghurt and drink milk. ‘At the end of the day, an addiction is an addiction. 'If I had been addicted to heroin, I think I would have been taken more seriously. ‘Food is something that people have to be around every day - it isn’t a case of just stopping eating. 'I have now had to learn how to eat all over again.’ Now having lost a massive 22 inches from his waist and even one shoe size, Mr Wood is looking forward to a new, healthy future. He said: ‘I’ve been left with a lot of loose skin, but that’s a small price to pay for getting my life back. ‘I’m so grateful that I’ve been given another chance, and I’ll never let myself go again.’","Craig Wood, from Hereford, tipped the scales at a staggering 38 stone .

"Police have identified the man who was found strapped to a chair dead as Gregory John Hudson . Police have identified the man who was found strapped to a chair in an apparent kinky sex act gone wrong as Gregory John Hudson. The 57-year-old was found dead at a townhouse on the Gold Coast, reportedly tied to a chair at a Mulgrave Crescent address in Varsity Lakes  at 11.40am on Thursday. The residence has been declared a crime scene with forensic and scientific officers continuing their examination of the scene.

"Bookies have slashed the odds on Kate Middleton giving birth to Royal twins after a flood of wagers prompted fears that punters had inside knowledge. Betting on two new Royal babies could now pay out at as little as 5/2 while one bookmaker, William Hill, has suspended bets entirely after reportedly receiving 200 in just over an hour. The surge came on Monday night, prompting William Hill to slash the odds on Royal twins from 20/1 to 9/1 before suspending bets entirely. Scroll down for video . Two new siblings to play with? Bookies have slashed the odds on Kate Middleton giving birth to twins after a flood of wagers on Monday night with one bookmaker, William Hill, suspending bets on a multiple birth entirely . William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said: 'We have had a load of unexpected bets including a large number of new accounts. 'With any other market I would say that people know.' At the same time Coral had a surge of bets which prompted it to slash its odds - which were 20/1 just a few weeks ago - from 10/1 to 8/1. Ladbrokes was also offering odds of 8/1 last night while Paddy Power had cut its offer to 5/2. Coral claims it was the first bookmaker to cut the odds on Royal twins last month after one punter placed a £1,000 bet at 20/1. Coral was reportedly the first bookmaker to cut odds on Royal twins after one punter placed a £1,000 bet . Baby: Punters may be wary, as odds were also slashed on Royal twins when Kate was pregnant with George . GIRLS' NAMES . Elizabeth     7/2 . Victoria       12/1 . Alexandra   14/1 . Catherine   16/1 . Diana         20/1 . BOYS' NAMES . James       12/1 . Philip         14/1 . Henry        16/1 . Alexander  20/1 . Charles     20/1 . Even after the odds were halved to 10/1, a psychic from Hampshire placed a £500 bet on the double birth. Coral spokesman Nicola McGeady said yesterday: 'Since Will and Kate announced their news, all the big money has come for twins. 'With the gamble picking up pace overnight, we fear someone knows something we don't.' Punters have made a string of special wagers since it emerged last month the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with her second child. Elizabeth is the bookies' favourite for the baby's name if it is a girl, or James if it is a boy - and David Cameron and Boris Johnson are 50/1 outsiders to be godparents. The odds on history-making Royal triplets, meanwhile, remain steadfastly remote at 100/1. And betters may be wary, as odds were also slashed on the prospect of Royal twins during the Duchess's first pregnancy. Experts said her age and the severity of her morning sickness raised the chances of a double birth - but when Prince George was born weighing 8lbs 6oz, he had no brothers or sisters to play with. The last Royal twins in what are now the British Isles came in the 15th Century, when James I of Scotland’s wife Queen Joan gave birth to two boys. Alexander was named heir to the throne but died as a child, and after his father was killed it was left to his twin brother James to assume the title of King James II of Scotland. But there have been Royal twins elsewhere in the world since - including Josephine and Vincent, who were born to Danish Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik in 2011.","William Hill reportedly had 200 bets in less than two hours on Monday night .

"It was once the world's fourth biggest sea, a vast lake in the middle of the Kyzylkum Desert. However, a massive water diversion project begun by the Soviet Union in the 1960s has caused it to shrink dramatically - and this year, to dry up completely for the first time. This series of images from Nasa’s Terra satellite reveals the shocking change. Scroll down for video . Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union undertook a major water diversion project on the arid plains of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The region’s two major rivers, fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains, were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops.

The region’s two major rivers, fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains, were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops. Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. The lake they made, the Aral Sea, was once the fourth largest in the world. Although irrigation made the desert bloom, it devastated the Aral Sea. This series of images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite documents the changes. At the start of the series in 2000, the lake was already a fraction of its 1960 extent (black line). The Northern Aral Sea (sometimes called the Small Aral Sea) had separated from the Southern (Large) Aral Sea. The Southern Aral Sea had split into eastern and western lobes that remained tenuously connected at both ends. These images show the incredible changes in the region. Taken on August 15th 2001 (left) and August 19th 2014, they show the entire central area has dried up. By 2001, the southern connection had been severed, and the shallower eastern part retreated rapidly over the next several years. Especially large retreats in the eastern lobe of the Southern Sea appear to have occurred between 2005 and 2009, when drought limited and then cut off the flow of the Amu Darya. Water levels then fluctuated annually between 2009 and 2014 in alternately dry and wet years. Dry conditions in 2014 caused the Southern Sea’s eastern lobe to completely dry up for the first time in modern times. As the lake dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides. The blowing dust from the exposed lakebed, contaminated with agricultural chemicals, became a public health hazard. According to NASA, the loss of the water's moderating influence has also led to more extreme temperatures in the region, making winters colder and summers hotter and drier. Aralsk's Mayor Alashbai Baimyrzayev points at a fishing boat on dry dock 23 March 1999 near the city of Kyzmet in the Aral Sea. The Aral Sea is actually not a sea at all. It is an immense lake, a body of fresh water, although that particular description of its contents might now be more a figure of speech than practical fact. Beginning in the 1960s, farmers and state offices in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Central Asian states opened significant diversions from the rivers that supply water to the lake, thus siphoning off millions of gallons to irrigate cotton fields and rice paddies. As recently as 1965, the Aral Sea received about 50 cubic kilometers of fresh water per year—a number that fell to zero by the early 1980s. Consequently, concentrations of salts and minerals began to rise in the shrinking body of water. The Aral Sea supported a thriving commercial fishing industry employing roughly 60,000 people in the early 1960s. By 1977, the fish harvest was reduced by 75 percent, and by the early 1980s the commercial fishing industry had been eliminated. The shrinking Aral Sea has also had a noticeable affect on the region's climate. The growing season there is now shorter, causing many farmers to switch from cotton to rice, which demands even more diverted water. A secondary effect of the reduction in the Aral Sea’s overall size is the rapid exposure of the lake bed. Strong winds that blow across this part of Asia routinely pick up and deposit tens of thousands of tons of now exposed soil every year. The salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields, degrading the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water. The loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier. In a last-ditch effort to save some of the lake, Kazakhstan built a dam between the northern and southern parts of the Aral Sea. Completed in 2005, the dam was basically a death sentence for the southern Aral Sea, which was judged to be beyond saving. All of the water flowing into the desert basin from the Syr Darya now stays in the Northern Aral Sea. Between 2005 and 2006, the water levels in that part of the lake rebounded significantly and very small increases are visible throughout the rest of the time period. The differences in water color are due to changes in sediment.","Images show the giant lake from 2000 until 2014 - where it dries up completely for the first time .

"House prices have begun rising again, hitting a new record high of £189,333 one average, Nationwide Building Society revealed today. Property values grew by 0.5 per cent in October, reversing a 0.1 per cent month-on-month fall seen in September. But the year-on-year pace of house price growth has been slowing for two months in a row, and Nationwide said that the housing market does appear to have lost momentum. Values lifted by 9.0 per cent year-on-year in October, drifting down from a 9.4 per cent annual uplift in September. Year-on-year house price growth had consistently been in double digits over the summer as house prices hit a string of new all-time highs. Typical UK house prices surpassed their 2007 peak in cash terms in May this year and between then and August they had hit a run of new records, before falling back slightly in September and then recovering to a fresh peak this month. It suggests buyers have returned to the market after the summer break. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: 'A variety of indicators suggest that the market has lost momentum. 'The number of mortgages approved for house purchase in September was almost 20 per cent below the level prevailing at the start of the year.' He pointed to some recent studies which have suggested that interest from prospective house hunters is dropping off and said that activity may soften further in the near-term, particularly in London. Mr Gardner said that with mortgage rates having fallen to rock bottom levels, the typical mortgage payment as a share of someone's take home pay remains close to the long-term average, despite house prices being at an all-time high. House prices rose by 9.0 per cent year-on-year in October, drifting down from a 9.4 per cent annual uplift in September . In a sign of what is to come, the Bank of England reported yesterday that the number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers fell to a 14-month low in September. Some experts have said this is evidence of the market becoming steadier after a strong burst of housing market activity seen earlier this year. But other commentators have predicted that with the wider economy still picking up, the weaker patch of mortgage approvals will not last for long. Stricter mortgage lending rules came into force earlier this year which caused some disruption to the market, but in recent weeks there have been signs of lenders gaining a stronger appetite to do business and slashing the mortgage rates on offer in attempts to meet end-of-year lending targets. Expectations about the prospect of a rise in the Bank of England base rate from its historic 0.5 per cent low, pushing up borrowing costs, also appear to have been pushed back. The Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane recently indicated that there will be no hike until well into next year. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist for IHS Global Insight, said: 'The Nationwide data for October are consistent with our view that house prices will keep on rising but at a more restrained rate. 'Even so, buyer interest in houses is unlikely to fall away with appreciable support is likely to come from elevated consumer confidence, markedly rising employment, and still low mortgage interest rates, especially as they now look unlikely to rise before mid-2015.'","Prices rise by 0.5% in October after 0.1% drop in September .

"Musicians playing for money in tube stations may have to up their game because now there’s a Wi-Fi orchestra on the scene. Using Wi-Fi signal on the New York subway, 11 buskers performed together, led by a conductor above ground. They used an array of connected laptops, smartphones and headphones, which took two hours to set up, to perform the musical feat. Scroll down for video . Using Wi-Fi signal on the New York subway, 11 musicians performed together, led by a conductor above ground. Lev Zhurbin can be seen here facing an array of laptops to conduct the musicians . The live experiment, involving musicians playing at nine stations, was arranged by Chris Shimojima, a writer, director and editor living in New York City. They played a piece called ‘Signal Strength’ by Russian composer and conductor Lev Zhurbin, who is known as Ljova. Each performer wore headphones to hear their fellow musicians and could see a smartphone screen so that they could follow the directions of the composer, while the device could transmit their work in real-time, using the Wi-Fi signal. Each performer wore headphones to hear their fellow musicians based in other locations and could see a smartphone screen so they could follow the directions of the composer and the device could transmit their work using Wi-Fi signal. Here players of the trumpet, djembe and shekere and pictured . The musicians played a piece called ‘Signal Strength’ by Russian composer ans conductor Lev Zhurbin. This is the view that he saw when he was conducting the disparate groups of remote performers . The experiment relies on the New York subway's Wi-Fi network. Each of the 11 performers connected to it using a smartphone, which enabled them to see the conductor in a nearby park. They also wore headphones so that they could hear eh other. The conductor set up 11 laptops, which were all connected to the network and used Skype, allowing him to see the performers. The 'full' performance comprising all 11 instruments was only heard by the conductor at the time, but is now available in a Sound Cloud clip and a video. Instruments included an accordion, bass, cello, viola and trumpet, as well as more unusual ones such as a beat box, Theremin, and African instruments the djembe and shekere. A Theremin is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the performer using hand gestures. The musicians were simultaneously connected to the conductor so they could see his hand movements and he could check they were playing in time and in tune. In a square in the middle of the city in Bryant Park, Ljova conducted the 11 musicians by standing in front of 11 laptops with their cameras turned on, that were connected to Skype. It took eight takes to get it right thanks to a few hitches with the Wi-Fi connections,Yahoo News reported. While music fans can see the final result in the video and a Sound Cloud clip, listeners in the subway would not have got the full effect. They would only have heard the lone sound of one instrument, meaning that the performance would have sounded different – and sparse – depending on which instrument they passed.

"Eight-year-old Isabel Krige stayed up till 10pm baking cupcakes for SES searchers who are searching for toddler William Tyrell in northern NSW . An eight-year-old girl has penned a handwritten letter and baked cupcakes for the  volunteers who have been combing the bush for missing toddler William Tyrell. The letter written by Isabel Krige was read to the volunteer State Emergency Services on Thursday night as rescue teams debriefed after the seventh long day searching for the three-year-old on the NSW mid north coast. 'Dear SES I made these cupcakes for you to show your great courage of never giving up hope,' wrote eight-year-old Isabel. It was read out by State Emergency Service unit controller Paul Burg to assure the search teams they were doing a good job. A week after three-year-old William disappeared from his grandmother's house in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast, police have started focussing on the likelihood he was picked up by a car in the absence of any other clues. The community has been completely shaken by the tragedy, with parents keeping a close watch on their children and residents trying to come to grips with the fact that something sinister may have happened in their small town. Isabel, from nearby Bonny Hills, stayed up until 10pm in order to bake the cupcakes because she was determined to help the SES searchers in any way she could. 'I thought it would be good to give them something because it's such a little community doing something for a three-year-old boy,' she said. 'I'm doing something for them and that will give them energy to do something for someone else, so it sort of goes along.' Three year-old William Tyrell was playing outside his grandmother's house  in Kendall on the NSW mid north coast when he was last seen a week ago . Isabel, like everyone else in the community, is completely baffled by William's disappearance. 'I really don't know because he's got a front yard and he was playing with his sister and I don't know if someone came in and stole him or he just went to the back of the bush,' she said. 'I hope they find that three-year-old boy because I'd be really scared, I'd probably be tucked up near a rock.' On Sunday Isabel went out to the bush with her parents and sister to help the search. State Emergency Service unit controller Paul Burg stood up on Thursday evening to read out a letter (right) from a local schoolgirl who had baked cupcakes to show her thanks . David Hughes, acting principal at St Joseph's Primary School in Laurieton where Isabel goes to school, said the playground had been full of chatter and rumours about William's disappearance. 'Our main business has just been to suppress any fears for the kids in the school environment,' he said. 'You know they see police cars driving around and they've visited schools here just asking question about strangers, just covering all the angles. 'Basically what we're doing here is just trying to keep a lid on the gossip and the stories that are flying around a small community, so just trying to keep the fear level down I suppose and make sure the kids are safe.' Isabel wanted to help the people searching for William and thought her cupcakes would give them energy to find the missing toddler . Isabel, like everyone else in the community, is completely baffled by William's disappearance and went out with her parents on Sunday to help with the search . Superintendent Paul Fehon said William's family were struggling with the fact that there were still no leads in relation to his whereabouts. 'Of course, being a week from when young William went missing, it's emotionally distressing for them,' he said. 'They are doing it very tough.' About 70 volunteers, State Emergency Service crews and police will continue searching roadsides in the nearby Middle Brother State Forest for evidence as they focus on the possibility William was picked up by a car. More than 200 volunteers and residents have scoured kilometres of bush surrounding the property in the seven days since he disappeared. The toddler was dressed in his favored Spiderman costume when he was last seen . 'It's emotionally distressing for them': Police say the search for William has taken a huge toll on his family . A number of leads into William's disappearance have uncovered no trace of the missing three year old . A special task force was set up on the fifth day of William's disappearance . A number of tips, including reports that a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man stopped at a local shop on Friday morning to ask directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive where William was last seen, have uncovered nothing. Forensic tests performed on a patch of blood found near a creek just over 2km from William's grandmother's house were also negative. Test results showed it was not human blood. Bush trackers have found clues such as a knife sheath and a set of small footprints, but tip-offs from bush searches, investigations of CCTV and interviews with neighbours and local businesses have not uncovered a solid lead. But despite the lengthy search efforts Supt Fehon said police were aiming to broaden their investigation. 'We are following every possible avenue of inquiry that is being provided to us, be it CCTV, be it information regarding persons that may have been in the area, and we're asking the public if they know of anything to provide that information to Crime Stoppers,' he said. The street William Tyrell was last seen playing in the garden of his grandmother's home at Kendall . Police searching for missing toddler William Tyrell have questioned motorists who may have been driving past the house where he disappeared more than a week ago, in an increasingly desperate hunt for clues . Police predict the three year old, who was last seen on Friday morning playing in the front yard of his Kendall home, is in a poor state of health and has had no food or water for three days since going missing . Around 200 volunteers from the local community helped out to try and find the toddler.

"One of Britain’s biggest charities has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on school fees for its chief executive’s children. The high-profile Halo Trust, which clears landmines from war zones, was facing severe criticism last night after revelations that its founder, Guy Willoughby, had his annual bill of more than £70,000 covered for his children to attend some of the country’s most expensive boarding schools. The charity rose to prominence in 1997 when Diana, Princess of Wales, visited a minefield it was clearing in Angola shortly before her death. Prince Harry is still a patron. Last year its income was more than £26million, including £4million from the Department for International Development. For more than a decade the Halo Trust - which was made famous after a visit by Princess Diana in 1997 - has given the go-ahead for the payments for Guy Willoughby's four children . Mr Willoughby founded the mine clearance charity, whose patron is Prince Harry and whose trustees include actress Angelina Jolie . According to the charity's latest accounts he receives a package of between £210,000 and £220,000 a year  - including the cost of sending his children to boarding schools. Mr Willoughby's son is said to attend Oundle School in Northamptonshire - which charges £30, 705 a year for boarders -  and two of his daughters attend Queen Margaret’s School in York, which charges £27,825. Queen Margaret's offers a discount for siblings, the Telegraph reports. Mr Willoughby’s eldest child is now at university but her boarding school fees were once footed by the charity. Robert Halfon MP is a member of the Commons public administration committee which is investigating charity pay. He said that charity chief executive salaries and perks should be displayed on their websites so people can decide whether they then want to donate.

According to the According to the charity's latest accounts Mr Willoughby receives a package of between £210,000 and £220,000 a year  - including the cost of sending his children to boarding schools . Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP, added: 'Clearly, this is an outrageous abuse of charitable money. It highlights the need for better control of charities and greater respect for volunteer fund-raisers.' Mr Willoughby, 53, co-founded Halo in 1988. It hit headlines when Princess Diana was pictured at a minefield in Angola, in 1997, shortly before she died. He defended the charity's decision to pay his children's school fees to the paper highlighting  that the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office paid for the private education of children whose parents were posted overseas. Mr Willoughby said that he often travelled overseas for work. He said the charitable sector should pay salaries that would attract the best talent. Mr Willoughby, 53, co-founded Halo in 1988. It hit headlines when Princess Diana was pictured at a minefield in Angola, in 1997, shortly before she died . Staff who have worked for the charity for more than seven years are eligible for its school fees scheme, but there are just three members of staff which qualify, including Mr Willoughby. The fees are paid for children between 10 and 18. Mr Willoughby said:'The advantage to the Halo Trust of the remuneration package and the school fees allowance is actually that as employees [and their children] get older, it costs the charity less.' The board of trustees for The HALO Trust said: 'Like some other charities and their senior executives, Guy is very much hands on and leads from the front putting his life in danger regularly, as he himself gets involved clearing landmines by hand, working, surveying and travelling in conflict and post-conflict countries such as Afghanistan, Colombia, Somalia, Angola, Sri Lanka and The West Bank. 'In 2013, Guy spent 60-70 per cent of the year working abroad to drive the charity’s goals and ambitions to rid the world of landmines. 'Our entire ethos as a charity is focused on efficiency and productivity to ensure that we achieve the maximum outcomes in the field and make the world a safer place. 'HALO’s beneficiaries and staff deserve and require a highly competent and professional management team and the Board has taken the necessary steps to recruit and retain one. The charity has had to remain competitive alongside our counterparts, such as the UN, Army and the Foreign Office. 'As a result, we introduced a school fees scheme for senior staff with over seven years’ service, and children from the age of 10 through to 18 are eligible and receive a percentage of their salary, which they put towards the part-payment of their children’s education - this is a taxable benefit. 'Guy’s remuneration package as fully disclosed reflects the complexity and responsibility of his role, pay in comparable jobs, entitlements of subordinate staff, the amount of time he is expected to spend abroad, and the value he provides in driving the efficiency and productivity of the charity to the benefit of mine-impacted communities. 'An ancillary benefit of the school fees scheme is that, as children come out of the education system, eligible senior staff’s salary will reduce accordingly and therefore it is a more efficient approach in the longer term for the organisation.'","Guy Willoughby's four children privately educated thanks to charity .

"Former hippie Pete Mckenzie has refused to wear shoes for 50 years - even on his wedding day. The 69-year-old is dubbed Pete the Feet by pubgoers in Birmingham's leafy suburb of Moseley after insisting: 'I won't put the buggers back on until the day I die'. A former  telephone exchange engineer, he even eschewed footwear on the day he married his wife Jennifer. But she didn't mind: they are still happily wed 44 years later and have three grandchildren. Scroll down for video . Feet of endurance: Former hippie Pete Mckenzie has refused to wear shoes for 50 years, insisting: 'I won't put the buggers back on until the day I die' - and his unusual choice has made him a legend in Birmingham pubs . No cold feet! Dubbed Pete the Feet, the now-69-year-old refused even to wear shoes when he married his wife Jennifer in 1970 (pictured). They are still together, and he says he never feels the cold even in mid-winter . Pete has become the stuff of legend in local pubs, where he hawks homemade merchandise including stickers and cigarette lighter covers bearing his logo of two bare feet. Those who know him well have been shown one of his two amputated little fingers - which had to be partially removed due to 'tendon problems' - which he keeps mummified in resin in his pocket. The other is in formaldehyde on the mantelpiece of his £90,000 Moseley flat. 'I don’t like shoes, or in fact anything on my feet,' he said. 'Even when I got married, I didn’t wear shoes - and that was in a church. 'My wife has maybe seen me wearing shoes once or twice, but my daughter hasn’t and my granddaughters definitely haven’t. Hippie: Locals said the much-loved eccentric (pictured in 1973) paints his nails to make up for a lack of shoes . Best foot forward: The sociable Pete (left on his wedding day and right in 1980) is widely-known in Moseley, where he is known to show pub-goers his amputated little finger which he keeps in resin in his pocket . 'They just don’t suit me, they don’t suit my feet. Ever since taking my shoes off permanently, I’ve been called called Pete the Feet. I won’t put the buggers back on until the day I die.' The pensioner said he stopped donning footwear for good as a hippie in the mid-sixties. He was in his 20s and had already tried to escape the constraints of footwear but was scolded repeatedly by his mother. 'As far back as I can remember, I never liked wearing shoes,' he said. 'I was walking home once when I was 16 and took my shoes and socks off and flung them over a bridge.' He insists that in the last 50 years his bare feet have never got cold - even when temperatures are sub-zero. Favourite ale: Pete (above in 1981) has his own beer glass in which he sinks pints of Cotswolds-brewed Lion . Following in their footsteps: Pete (left in 1967, right in 1969) said many hippies eschewed shoes in the sixties . Character: Pete in 1971. He worked as a telephone exchange engineer and has lived in Moseley for 50 years . Humans first began wearing shoes 40,000 years ago - but there is still a strong 'barefoot movement' among activists who say we should return to how nature intended. Especially in cities, the dangers are obvious. They include cuts which can become dangerously infected or lead to illnesses such as tetanus, while people on beaches fear stepping on drug needles. It's a common myth that it's illegal to drive barefoot - in fact, the Highway Code only specifies that 'clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner'. That counts out loose-fitting flip flops. Much of the stigma is about poverty - bare feet were seen as a sign of homelessness and many bars and restaurants have entry policies which bar people without shoes. But a burgeoning barefoot movement is trying to 'reclaim' the trend, insisting many commonly-held myths are untrue. Activists say shoes are no better than feet at repelling germs, correcting posture or preventing all but the most serious injuries. 'They swear blind that they must be freezing but I tell people to touch them and they always reel back because my feet are hot,' he claimed. 'People get cold feet because they wear shoes and socks.' He uses a mobility scooter - with the personalised numberplate PTF 1 - but says that is to do with his 'icky ticker' as he had a heart attack some years ago, and his feet are still in perfect health. 'People seem to think that I collect dirt, but the fact is that I wash my feet every day,' he said. 'If I stand in anything that I shouldn’t then I really know about it, but if you’re wearing shoes you might not realise then trample it all over the bloody carpet. 'Where as I know I stand in it then I can just wash it off my feet dead easy.' He added: 'In the sixties it wasn’t uncommon to see people not wearing shoes around Moseley, it was very hippy place back then. 'I find my notoriety a bit silly, I don’t think people should be so bothered - I find it amusing really. 'I do get nasty comments but it doesn’t bother me. Sometimes I’ll go to the pub and they say sorry I can’t serve you, you haven’t got shoes on. 'One time I was told that staff couldn’t serve me because they sold food, but as I was being taken out there was woman with a dog, feeding it at the table. 'I’ve been into pubs where there’s dog muck on the floor in the pub, and they say I’ll bring dirt in. It’s their fault, not mine.' The pensioner has been honoured in multiple pubs around the country with his own glass inscribed with his name, from which he drinks his favourite Cotswolds-brewed Lion ale. A little help: The pensioner rides a vintage mobility scooter, but it is more to do with his heart than his feet . Merchandise: As well as making stickers and cigarette lighters, Pete has the personalised scooter plate PTF 1 . Alice Chandler, 26, a supervisor at the Sun at the Station pub, told MailOnline: 'I've known him since I was ten. He knows my mum and used to buy me crisps after school. 'I don't ever remember him wearing shoes. He's always painted his toenails different colours though. 'Everyone knows him and speaks to him and buys him drinks. He's got both of his little fingers amputated and he's mummified one in resin which he keeps in his pocket. The other one's in formaldehyde on his mantelpiece. 'He's a local legend. I expect his feet are like leather by now. Nothing could faze him.'","Pete Mckenzie, 69, is a pub legend in the Birmingham suburb of Moseley .

Just 10 weeks later, on September 23, she felt contractions. To watch the full video visit WCNC. All six girls were born in ten minutes and within two hours had died in their parents' arms. Now,  the couple has decided to speak out about their horrific ordeal as a sign of support to others who have gone through similar situations, and to show that they will move forward through their trauma. 'We don't have strength right now, we are broken, we are in deep mourning,' Lindsey told NBC. 'We held each one of our six girls and said goodbye to them. Strength: The couple of Charlotte, North Carolina, has vowed to speak out about their ordeal to stay strong . Glimpses of happiness: The couple are pictured with their two daughters ahead of their tragedy . Trauma: Lindsey had already miscarried a seventh fetus at 12 weeks before her waters broke at 21 weeks . 'They were all living. They all have birth certificates, they all have a first name a middle name and a last name.' The couple, who live in Charlotte, North Carolina, met at Wake Forest college where Lindsey played soccer and Steve played football. After marrying in 2009, they had two daughters - four-year-old Hannah and two-year-old Hope. When they tried for a third, they discovered Lindsey had contracted PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome, which vastly reduces the chance of getting pregnant. On Steve's birthday, Lindsey handed him a positive pregnancy test, NBC reported. One trip to the doctor's surgery found there were at least six babies - and later it emerged there was a seventh. No regrets: Lindsey recounted the birth to NBC but said she does not regret keeping all seven babies . He urged them to abort some. 'Steve and I didn't even have to look at each other. That was just not going to be an option,' Lindsey said. They were hit by tragedy in the 12th week when Lindsey miscarried. It was not until four weeks later that their doctor revealed yet another surprise: all six remaining babies were girls. However, as they were still celebrating the news, Lindsey's waters broke. 'I started to feel some contractions and I wanted to not believe that,' she said. 'What I would give to nurse them, to hold them, to rock them to sleep, to dress them. I want to be their mom, I want them to be here, you know. But that wasn't God's will.' However, the couple maintain they do not regret their decision to keep all seven. 'I would do the past 21 weeks again and again and again if I had the choice,' Lindsey insists.","Former Carolina Panther center Steve Justice and wife Lindsey endured fertility treatment to conceive third child, within a year conceived seven .

"The Globe Theatre in London took a break from Shakespeare this weekend to host the Alternative Miss World Awards. The beauty pageant - which is open to entrants of any gender or nationality - is supposed to be a celebration of everything unique, with drag, avant-garde design, PVC sculpture dresses and even automobile costumes featuring in the show. The competition mimics the official Miss World contest in that it has a day-wear, evening dress, swimwear and interview round, but that is where the similarities end. Miss Zero +, real name is Sasha Frolova, being crowned Miss Alternative World 2014 at the Globe Theatre in London on Saturday. The beauty pageant - which is open to entrants of any gender or nationality - is supposed to be a celebration of everything unique . The theme of this year's competition was neon numbers. Contestants are required to undergo a total transformation in the special costume round, with everyone encouraged to think outside the box and go further than just the typical man-to-woman drag costume. This year the winner was Miss Zero +, whose real name is Sasha Frolova, of Russia. Founder Andrew Logan, who started the awards in 1972,said: 'It’s about transformation. 'People say drag, which it is, man to woman or woman to man, but that’s a rather a lack of imagination, just doing man to woman when there is so much more that you can be.'

Artist and founder of the pageant Andrew Logan stands to her left . Andrew continued: 'I’ve always felt like I wan to encourage people - if I can inspire just a few then I’ve done something in this world. 'Of course it’s great fun, but it was always something more than that.' Artist Grayson Perry, who is almost as famous for his outlandish dressing as he is for his art, is a longtime supporter of the awards and hosted this year's competition.

'It’s like why you do your front garden - you might not sit in your front garden and enjoy it, but it makes the street nicer for everybody who’s walking down it.' Judges this year were from a range of backgrounds and included the fashion designer Dame Zandra Rhodes, actress Zoe Wanamaker and Madness frontman Suggs, who met his wife at one of the early competitions.

The 30-year-old Russian, who is a contemporary artist by trade, said: 'I have a show where I sing and perform in latex with inflatables, so my character int he pageant was connected to that. It was great that they chose me as the winner, I cried because it was like a gift from above. 'It gets extremely hot inside the costume - I have to wear it for three hours at a time and all I change is the mask, but I love the way it looks - I feel like a plastic woman. 'People should know that I am not a fetishist though, it is not a sexual thing for me - it is for performance art.'","The world-famous beauty pageant was held in London's Globe Theatre .

"A four-wheel drive has crashed into a Sydney cafe during rush hour and injured seven people while it was trying to park. Police were called to the Wild Basket cafe on Grosvenor Road, Neutral Bay on the city's north shore, after reports of the accident at about 9am on Wednesday. One female patron, who was dragged to the back of the business by the speeding car, was trapped under the vehicle for 20 minutes before being freed by Fire and Rescue personnel, according to Detective Inspector Mike Birley. Scroll down for video . Seven people were injured  after a 4WD (pictured) smashed into a North Sydney cafe . Four people were rushed to hospital including one woman who suffered severe leg injuries . She was rushed to hospital with severe leg injuries but is in a non-life threatening condition. The driver of the 4WD, a man aged in his 50s, has been taken to Royal North Shore Hospital to undergo mandatory blood and urine testing, police have said. '[He was] attempting to park his vehicle as he inadvertently accelerated into the café hitting seven people who were situated inside having coffee,' Detective Insp. Birley said. 'The speed at which the car reversed into the café didn't allow people to get out of the way, so we are very fortunate that they were not more seriously injured.' The other six customers at the Wild Basket cafe only received minor injuries . The seven people who were injured had been sitting at tables inside the cafe . The driver was taken away on crutches by police and is believed to have been suffering from a disability. Witnesses said he was 'incredibly apologetic' about the incident. Three other people were also rushed to hospital with non life-threatening injuries, according to an ambulance spokesperson. The other six customers received only minor injuries and are all in a stable condition. The driver of the car, a man aged in his 50s, has been taken to Royal North Shore Hospital to undergo mandatory blood and urine testing . The car, a silver Lexus, could be seen parked on the footpath outside the cafe after being removed from  the scene. A large scratched dent could be seen on the side of the vehicle, with the rear-view mirror hanging on precariously. An emotional cafe owner was at the scene and police are investigating the damage to the cafe, where scattered stools and broken glass can still be seen outside. Residents in the flat above were escorted out of the building and police have closed the road to cars.

Jenni Heads, the owner of Woodlands Kitchen Bar next door to the Wild Basket café, said she has been left 'shaken' after the accident. Ms Heads arrived 20 minutes after the incident occurred, to see her friend's business closed off with police tape. 'It's a very tight knit community here and we know the guests who come in to the restaurant every day, so she [the café's owner] would have known the people who were quite seriously injured. It's a horrible thing to have happened,' she told Daily Mail Australia.","A 4WD, driven by a man in his 50s, has smashed into a Neutral Bay cafe in Sydney's north .

"Chelsea Manning is seeking a presidential pardon for handing U.S state secrets to the WikiLeaks website because it was done 'out of a love for my country'. According to documents released today, Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, has sent a Petition for Pardon to President Barack Obama. The White House said last month that if Manning requested a presidential pardon she would be considered the same as anyone else. In the petition she wrote that she had started questioning the morality of U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan while reading secret military reports. She said: 'When I chose to disclose classified information, I did so out of a love for my country and sense of duty to others.' Manning acknowledged she had broken the law, adding, 'I regret if my actions hurt anyone or harmed the United States.' Manning signed the petition 'Bradley Manning', not Chelsea, as her name has not legally been changed. Chelsea Manning poses in a wig and lipstick . (left) and is escorted into a day of her court martial as her legal . identity, Bradley Manning (right) Chelsea Manning's lawyer David Coombs has sent a petition for a Presidential Pardon to the White House . Mark Osler, a law professor and . founder of a commutation clinic at St. Thomas University in Minneapolis, . gave Manning's petition a 'zero per cent' chance of success. Osler noted that the President has granted just 39 pardons and one commutation since taking . office, while he has denied 1,333. Olser added that it is also very early in Manning's confinement for the White House to seriously consider such a request. Manning is currently serving a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for her conviction on July 30 on 20 counts of disclosing information while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. Since being convicted Manning has said she wants to live as a woman and two Army behavioral health specialists diagnosed her with gender dysphoria. Manning now wants to start hormone replacement therapy inside jail, and though the courts have refused, she is challenging the decision. In another twist, she is also asking the Army to pay for her treatment under their health insurance scheme. President Barack Obama has granted relatively few pardons during his time in office . The October 2010 release by Wikileaks of hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and a video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed civilians, was the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. Following the documents' publication Manning was arrested and the Wikileaks site closed down. Julian Assange, the site's front-man, is still claiming asylum inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London following rape allegations which he claims are bogus charges designed to have him extradited to the U.S. The Obama administration has cracked . down on security breaches, charging seven people with leaking to the . media whereas only three people were prosecuted under all previous . presidents. Julian Assange has been claiming asylum inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 . Following his trial, Manning got the longest ever sentence for disclosing U.S. government secrets to others for publication. At her trial government witnesses testified that some of the leaked information endangered information sources, forced ambassadors to be reassigned, were used as al-Qaida propaganda and even obtained directly by Osama bin Laden. However, Coombs wrote in a cover letter to Manning's petition that none of Manning's disclosures caused any 'real damage' to the United States and that the documents were not sensitive information meriting protection. Coombs submitted 11 documents in support of Manning's petition including five documents about Sgt. 1st Class Paul Adkins, one of Manning's former supervisors. The sergeant testified that he was reprimanded and demoted, apparently for failing to report Manning's troubling behavior - including a photo of the soldier in a blond wig and lipstick - partly because he couldn't risk losing an intelligence analyst. Also among the documents was a letter from Amnesty International, which said Manning's leaks exposed potential human rights violations.","David Coombs, Chelsea's lawyer, has sent a Petition for Pardon to President Barack Obama .

"The number of patients on NHS waiting lists is at its highest for nearly six years. There are now 2.89million waiting for surgery or other hospital procedures, including nearly 550 who have been waiting for more than a year. Official figures also show that, for the first time since March 2011, the NHS has missed a crucial target that patients should be treated within 18 weeks. The health service is meant to ensure that at least 90 per cent of patients are treated within this time but the figure fell to 89.9 per cent in February, meaning that around 400 waited longer. NHS waiting lists have reached their highest levels in six years, as 2.8million wait for surgery or another hospital procedure . Labour warned that the NHS was heading back to the ‘bad old days’ when hundreds of thousands of patients, often in agony, waited up to two years for treatment. The rise is further evidence of the growing pressures on the health service, which is struggling to meet the demands of the increasingly aging population. Several experts have warned that it will have to make controversial changes, such as charging patients for routine treatment, to avoid bankruptcy. A patient’s right to be treated within 18 weeks is set out in the NHS Constitution, the health service’s rule book. If they are made to wait longer, they can demand to go privately – paid for by the NHS – although very few patients are aware of their rights. Labour’s health spokesman, Andrew Gwynne, said: ‘Under David Cameron, waiting lists for operations are at their longest in years. He wasted £3billion on a damaging reorganisation and patients are paying the price. The rise is evidence of the pressures the health service faces as it struggles to meet the demands of an ageing population . ‘Labour left NHS waiting times at a record low but on David Cameron’s watch the NHS is heading back to the bad old days with patients waiting months on end for treatment in pain and discomfort.’ The figures from NHS England show that the average patient waits 9.5 weeks after being referred by their GP, up from eight weeks in April 2010, just before the Coalition Government took office. However, patients needing trauma or orthopaedic procedures – those involving muscles and bones – wait an average of 12.6 weeks, while those needing surgery to their mouth or teeth wait 12.7 weeks . The NHS Confederation, which represents health service managers, said: ‘We need to acknowledge that the whole system is under more pressure than ever. The NHS needs to change.’ Dr Barbara Hakin, chief operating officer at NHS England said: ‘The NHS does face a challenge on the 18-week standard but staff are working incredibly hard to ensure patients are seen quickly. 'During February, around 270,000 patients were admitted for treatment within the standard, and around 400 waited longer than we would have liked. 'We are doing more operations and treating more people than ever – over a million people start treatment with a consultant each month. ‘We are determined to redouble our efforts so that we do meet the standard. ‘But this may take several months as it is imperative we focus on those who have waited longest.’","Nearly 500 patients have been waiting for more than a year .

"The Caribbean is known for its magnificent beaches. But with the recession, the waves of good fortune that generally lap its shores became crashing breakers as the financial storm blew harder. Anguilla suffered more than most. Just perfect: Anguilla plays host to a selection of beautiful retreats, including the lovely Malliouhana Resort . It is not the easiest island to get to, and it is not cheap, so the visitors drained away. Investment soaked away into the sand, leaving developments marooned, some half-built, on the beaches. But though Anguilla lost its mojo for a while, there is no doubt it is still a special place - certainly to judge by some of the visitors who have stuck by it, including Paul McCartney, Denzel Washington , Liam Neeson and Kelly Osbourne. Of course beaches themselves are not affected by recession. And after 25 years of research - exhaustive research, you understand - lying prone on towels and loungers, counting grains of sand, I'd say that Anguilla has the finest beaches and sea in the Caribbean. You can get the idea with an early morning walk on a near-deserted strand. A gentle stroll? Not in Anguilla. In places the sand along the mile-and-a-half stretch of Meads Bay is so deep that walking becomes aerobic exercise. And the waves there are mesmerisingly beautiful - they swell into glassy green, their vertical faces marbling momentarily as they catch the sun, and then furl and crash. On top of the bluff at one end of Meads Bay is Malliouhana, one of the Caribbean's loveliest hotels, which will re-open next month under the flag of Auberge Resorts from California. At the other end sits the outsize Viceroy (with an unfeasible 300 rooms on an island just 16 miles long), which has attracted an LA crowd, and sometimes offers good deals. Star quality: Anguilla has played host to stars such as Beyonce (left) and Jay-Z, and Denzel Washington (right) For something more sympathetic and self-contained, there's Carimar, or the lovely Meads Bay Cottages. On the south coast, Cap Juluca, set on the heart-stoppingly pretty Maunday's Bay, and Cuisinart on Rendezvous Bay, roll on. And that's not to forget Anguilla's villas, some of the finest in the islands. After breaking the mould in the mid-1990s as the island's first 'supervilla', Cerulean has returned completely restored. The spectacular Villa Kishti, a geometric abstraction in glass and white concrete, which opened to acclaim last year, is opening two more villas on Meads Bay soon. The restaurateurs have also stuck at it, working hard through difficult times. Anguilla's restaurants are excellent - well, it is British territory with mainly American visitors - but throw in some French chefs, and excellent produce brought via nearby St Martin, and you have excellent cuisine. Look out for Hibernia, Blanchards, Veya and Dolce Vita. On the beach at Meads Bay, Blanchards has opened its Beach Shack for simple meals, and French-inspired Jacala offers an elegant and lazy lunch. Anguilla is much lower-key than nearby St Barts, but don't let that put you off. You might still bump into Beyoncé and Jay-Z… . Turquoise Holidays (www.turquoiseholidays.co.uk, 01494 678400) offers seven nights (room only) at Cap Juluca, with prices starting from £1,899 per person. This includes British Airways return flights via Antigua and onward flights with LIAT.","The little island of Anguilla is one of the Caribbean's less-seen hotspots .

"Dog owners may potentially face on-the-spot fines if their dog tries to attack someone - even if the animal doesn't bite. The fines will be issued for dogs that charge at people from behind fences or chase people down the street under a new proposal put forward by Queensland's councils. The 'rush attack' fines will give local councils the power to fine pet owners on-the-spot for less serious attacks, like rushing, growling or barking. The fines will be issued for dogs that charge at people from behind fences or chase people down the street under a new proposal put forward by Queensland's councils . While these attacks often don't cause injury, they do instil fear, according to Brisbane City Councillor Krista Adams. She said on-the-spot fines were necessary because the only option councils had at the moment was to take pet owners to court but that often didn't happen due to high costs. Cr Adams said owners of dogs involved in these rush attacks often escape prosecution just because it's a less serious attack. 'It's a warning or court, there is nothing in between,' Cr Adams told the Brisbane Times. 'When you're talking about a big dog standing in front of you barking and scaring you, that's not necessarily something we would take to court but an infringement is something we think is a different tool we could use. The 'rush attack' fines will give local councils the power to fine pet owners on-the-spot for less serious attacks, like rushing, growling or barking . 'It's about getting legislation to use an infringement notice for this type of attack, at the moment under the animal management rushing animals are recognised as an offence but we don't have the power to enforce through a fine.' Brisbane City Council won support for the proposal from the Local Government Association of Queensland on Wednesday. The association will now lobby the Queensland State Government for legislative changes. 'We don't need to take dog owners to court over things that are out of their control but they do need to think more carefully about how they are looking after their dogs in public,' Cr Adams told the ABC. Brisbane City Council won support for the proposal from the Local Government Association of Queensland on Wednesday. The association will now lobby the Queensland State Government for legislative changes . 'The dog may or not actually ever attack that person. It's about causing fear in the other person, so that's the difference.' But the 'rush fine' proposal has been shut down by some, including RSPCA spokesman Mark Townend, who says it will just cause trouble. 'There will be a lot of disputes, they'll end up going to court fighting it because most dogs, even non-aggressive dogs will rush up to people in some circumstances,' he said. 'I think it's a bad move and I think there needs to be a lot more consultation with council before this is ever introduced.'","Fines may be issued for dogs that charge at people behind fences or chase people down the street .

"Banned: Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, a locum surgeon, fled the country after being charged with violent disorder . A Muslim surgeon who was convicted in the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain has been banned from practising as a doctor. Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, a locum surgeon, fled the country after being charged with violent disorder during an extremist rally in Central London in May last year. He is now feared to be fighting as a jihadi in Syria. In June, Ali, from Walthamstow, East London, was found guilty in his absence at the Old Bailey of violent disorder and sentenced to 15 months. Last week, Ali was struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after a hearing in Manchester. The MPTS heard how Ali – who worked as a general surgery registrar in hospitals across the capital – helped to organise a rally against the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad for members of the banned Sunni Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun in Edgware Road, Central London. Some of the protesters at the rally assaulted a number of Shia bystanders, and Ali was seen hitting one of the victims repeatedly with a flag post, the tribunal heard. Scotland Yard said an arrest warrant for Ali is outstanding, but declined to comment on whether he is fighting in Syria. Assault: Ali is now feared to be fighting as a jihadi in Syria.

"This chilled out little marsupial was just trying to have his regular afternoon nap when he was set upon by two magpies who were annoyed he had stepped into their territory. The male koala crept into the cosy looking tree on Wednesday at Campbelltown East Public School in Sydney's south west. He mistakenly disturbed two nesting magpies who wanted the tree all to themselves and did not take too kindly to being interrupted. Not only did the magpies swoop directly at the koala but they chased him out of the tree and across the field back to the reserve where he came from. This koala was just having an innocent nap in a tree on the school playing field when he was set upon by two magpies . September is the breeding season for magpies and they are known for protecting their habitats . This relentless magpie made sure the koala would never invade her territory again . Campbelltown Wildlife and Bushlands Protection have released the images to highlight the plight of the wildlife around Smith Creek due to redevelopment. A spokesman for Campbelltown Wildlife and Bushlands Protection said: 'We are trying to save the wildlife from the redevelopment in Airds where a lot of bushland has been destroyed. 'This is pushing the koala into another part of the reserve where there is already other koalas and he's a young male and more then likely to be pushed out of Smith Creek reserve by another male koala.' The magpies were nesting in the tree the koala decided to have a sleep in and that is why it seems he was chased away. Campbelltown Wildlife and Bushlands Protection is campaigning to stop the area getting redeveloped . They say development is pushing this young male koala out of the Smith Creek Reserve . They fear he will be pushed into another koala's habitat and then out of the creek . When the koala ran down the tree he made off across grassland towards the bush, he was later seen safely eating. It is not the first time magpies have been seen attacking recently, September is their breeding season and birds swoop to protect their young while males defend the nest. Trent Nicholson was attacked on his bike near Wollongong, NSW and he captured the terrifying footage on his GoPro camera and posted it on YouTube. Since the magpie breeding season began in September close calls with the birds have been well-documented on social media with posts from people recounting the moment they are terrorised by the bird. Lots of close calls with angry magpies have been documented on social media in the last month . The koala escaped to bushland at Smith Creek reserve and was safe and sound away from the magpies . Sydney Wildlife's education officer Eira Battaglia said the best way to deal with a rogue bird was to quietly walk away. 'They can swoop past your head and it’s a warning but it's only occasionally that people have had them peck their head,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you stand still and put your hands over your head, they’ll stop because you’re not threatening them. 'Do not wave your arms around, walk quietly don’t make a big fuss, and they’ll leave you alone.' A volunteer from Campbelltown Wildlife and Bushlands Protection with the koalas at Smith Creek .

"A grandmother with Crohn's disease died after a pharmacy wrongly filled her prescription, giving her medicine which lowered her blood sugar levels to fatal levels. Mother-of-three Dawn Britton fell into a coma and later died after staff at the pharmacy in Kingswood, Bristol, handed her tablets for diabetes sufferers rather than those needed to treat her condition. The 62-year old collapsed after taking the diabetes pills, which were a similar shape and size to her regular medication, for several weeks. Collapsed: Mother-of-three Dawn Britton, pictured with daughter Tammy on her wedding day, fell into a coma after taking the wrong medication for several weeks. She died in hospital one month later . She fell into a hypoglycaemic coma from which she never recovered and died a month later in Frenchay Hospital. The inquest into her death heard that she died from a lack of oxygen as a result of the tablets lowering her blood sugar level. Mrs Britton's children said they are furious that no one at the Jhoots Pharmacy branch on Pool Road  has been held responsible. They are now planning to sue. Her son Lee Britton, 41, said: 'We were told it was not in the public interest to prosecute, but how can people be allowed to get away with killing our mother? 'That's what it amounts to. I work as a gas meter reader, I am expected to spot any problems at customers' houses. 'If I checked a meter and then it blew up the next day, I'd be held accountable. Wrong tablets: Mrs Britton, pictured, died from a lack of oxygen as a result of the tablets lowering her blood sugar level, the inquest heard . 'Yet here, our mum has been killed, and it's simply swept under the carpet. It's disgraceful.' Mrs Britton's daughter Tammy Haskins, 40, added: 'Still today I can't comprehend what happened to our mother, and the devastation caused to our family by her loss. 'Even now, when I think about how she died, I still can't quite believe it. 'I go through so many emotions when I think about it. I am gutted and upset, but I am also still angry. Mum should still be here today.' The inquest at Flax Bourton Coroners Court, Avon, heard that Mrs Britton visited the pharmacy in Pool Road, Bristol, in August last year to collect her regular long-term medication. But instead of Prednisolone tablets, used to control her Crohn's disease and breathing difficulties, she was handed Gliclazide tablets, which are used by diabetics. Mrs Britton, from Bristol, had been taking them for several weeks when her son, Lee, found her unconscious next to a packet of the pills on October 23. He attempted to revive her before calling emergency services, who carried out CPR and rushed her to Frenchay Hospital, in Bristol. The grandmother-of-five remained in hospital for a month until she passed away surrounded by her family on November 20. The pharmacist who was working in the branch that day apologised to the family while in the witness box, but remained adamant she had followed all procedures. Mrs Haskins added that her mother was very organised when it came to her medication but may not have realised the mistake because the two different tablets were of a similar size and shape. 'Dispensing error': A member of staff at Jhoots Pharmacy in Kingswood, Bristol, pictured above, gave Mrs Britton the wrong medication. The pharmacist responsible apologised to her family in the witness box . She said: 'My mum was sharp and intelligent and knew when she needed her tablets and how many she had to take. 'The problem was these tablets for diabetes looked very similar to those she normally took. They were the same colour and a similar size. 'When you are given medication by a pharmacist, especially one you have had the same prescription from for some time, you don't expect it to be wrong. You trust them to get it right. 'Devastated': Mrs Britton's daughter Tammy Haskins, pictured, said she still could not believe that her mother had died . 'My mum has lost her life because somebody simply failed to check the medication they were giving out was correct.' Recording a narrative conclusion, coroner Maria Voisin said: 'She died of hypoxic brain injury as a result of profound hypoglycaemia caused by her having taken Gliclazide tablets dispensed for her in error by a pharmacist.' Renu Daly, a specialist clinical negligence solicitor at Neil Hudgell Solicitors, said Mrs Britton's death was as a result of an 'unacceptable pharmaceutical dispensing error'. She said: 'The failure to correctly label and supply Ms Britton with her prescribed medication, instead giving her a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, resulted in her falling into a hypoglycaemic coma from which she never recovered. 'Unsurprisingly, the death of Ms Britton has had a devastating impact on her family. It was completely avoidable and should never have occurred.' A spokesman for Jhoots Pharmacy said: 'A dispensing error occurred at our Pool Road Pharmacy in Bristol on 2nd August 2013. 'The Coroner found that Mrs Britton's death was due to a hypoglycaemic episode and hypoxic brain injury arising from this error. 'Everyone at Jhoots is very saddened by this tragic event. We wish to say how sorry we are for what has happened. 'We do not wish to prejudice any further investigations by commenting further at this time.'","Dawn Britton was given wrong tablets at pharmacy in Kingswood, Bristol .

"A judge, calling civil contempt a rarity, ruled that Argentina was in contempt of court on Monday for its open defiance of his orders requiring that U.S. hedge funds holding Argentine bonds be paid the roughly $1.5 billion they are owed if the majority of the South American nation's bondholders are paid interest on their bonds. U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa made the announcement after a lawyer for U.S. hedge funds led by billionaire hedge fund investor Paul Singer's NML Capital Ltd. argued that Argentina has openly defied Griesa's court orders for more than a year. The judge reserved decision on sanctions pending further proceedings. A banner reading 'Argentina or vulture funds' hangs outside the National Congress while congressists discuss the approval of the bill on sovereign payment of the debt submitted by Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Krichner . A judge ruled that Argentina was in contempt of court for refusing to pay U.S. hedge funds holding Argentine bonds the roughly $1.5 billion they are owed if the majority of the South American nation's bondholders are paid interest on their bonds . 'What we are talking about is proposals and changes and actions that come from the executive branch of the Republic of Argentina,' the judge said. He said repeated efforts to avoid paying U.S. bondholders after their bonds — unlike more than 90 percent of outstanding Argentina bonds — were not traded for lesser-valued bonds in 2005 and 2010 was illegal conduct that could no longer be ignored. 'The republic in various ways has sought to avoid, to not attend to, almost to ignore this basic part of its financial obligations,' the judge said. He said Argentina had recently taken steps to attempt to remove a New York bank as the custodian for bonds held by many of its bondholders and transfer the financial obligations to a new trustee based in Argentina. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez characterizes hedge funds suing the country for full repayment of defaulted debt as 'vultures' out to wreck Argentina's finances in their pursuit of astronomical profit . New York-based lawyer Carmine Boccuzzi, representing Argentina, had argued that a contempt finding was premature, saying Argentina bondholders who accepted swaps for lesser-valued bonds after the country defaulted on $100 billion of debt in 2001 had not been paid interest, just as the judge intended. Boccuzzi said the U.S. bondholders 'want to punish Argentina. But that's not appropriate.' 'The republic did act responsibly,' he said. But he said paying the U.S. bondholders would require Argentina to pay about $20 billion to other bondholders who were not part of the litigation. 'We're hamstrung,' he said. As he left the courtroom, he declined to comment. Millions of middle class Argentines hit poverty when their government defaulted on about $100 billion in bonds in 2002 . A lawyer for the U.S. bondholders, Robert Cohen, urged the judge to make the contempt finding and impose a $50,000 daily penalty on Argentina. He said penalties should be stiff enough that Argentina realizes it needs to change its behavior. 'It's hard to imagine how it could get worse,' he said. Before the hearing, lawyers for Argentina forwarded to the judge a letter sent to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry saying the request for a contempt-of-court finding was ""completely absurd."" Argentina said such an order would be unlawful by international standards.","U.S. hedge funds argue Argentina has defied court order to pay for more than a year .
No sanctions yet put in place pending future proceedings .

"Eric Pickles said there is no place for 'rotten boroughs' as he used emergency powers to take control of a London council following a damning report into its finance and administration. The Communities Secretary said there was a 'culture of cronyism' at Tower Hamlets Council, which has faced accusations around the mis-selling of assets including Poplar Town Hall and claims about the allocation of £400,000 of grant funding. Mr Pickles also told MPs that 'executive power is unchecked and executive power has been misused' at the East London authority, and said he would be appointing three troubleshooters to the council, who will report directly to him. Damning: Eric Pickles (left) said there is no place for 'rotten boroughs' as he used emergency powers to take control of Tower Hamlets Council, where Lutfur Rahman (right) is mayor, following a damning report into its finance and administration . He has written to the council seeking representations on his plans, which involve the three commissioners being appointed and reporting back every six months on an action plan to resolve the problems identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The report found grants were awarded to organisations 'ruled ineligible', and £407,700 given to groups that failed to meet the council’s own minimum criteria, with council officers who objected often over-ruled. Grade II listed Poplar Town Hall was sold for £875,000 to one of the council's mayor Lutfur Rahman's political supporters, even though the bid had arrived late, and after rival bids, including a higher offer, had been opened, 'creating a risk of bid manipulation', according to the report. The report and action by Mr Pickles comes after claims that grants were awarded to Bangladeshi groups linked to supporters of Mr Rahman. Mr Rahman has also faced claims of fraud over the last 12 months and sparked a protest after he raised  the Palestinian flag over the town hall ‘in solidarity with Gaza’. The raising of the flag came in July, barely 24 hours after it emerged that he was to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud. People were allegedly promised council houses if they backed him and Islamic voters were told they should be ‘good Muslims’ and support him. His supporters were accused of doctoring ballot papers, manipulating postal voting and sabotaging the chances of his main rival, Labour candidate John Briggs, by branding him racist and anti-Islamic. Sold: Grade II listed Poplar Town Hall was sold for £875,000 to one of the council's mayor Lutfur Rahman's political supporters, even though the bid had arrived late, and after rival bids . Mr Rahman was a member of the Tower Hamlets Labour Party and was its candidate to be the first directly elected mayor of the borough in 2010. But he was expelled from the Labour party after allegations surfaced about his close links with an Islamic extremist group called the Islamic Forum of Europe. He was accused of using illegal tactics to win the mayoral election in Tower Hamlets in May. But, in a statement released ahead of Mr Pickles' statement to MPs, independent Mr Rahman, said allegations of fraud had been rejected by the PwC report. However, Mr Pickles told MPs: '(The report) paints a deeply concerning picture of obfuscation, denial, secrecy, the breakdown of democratic scrutiny and accountability, and a culture of cronyism risking the corrupt spending of public funds.' He added: 'I am satisfied the council is failing to comply with its best value duty, therefore I need to consider exercising my powers of intervention to secure compliance with the duty. 'I am writing to the council asking them to make representations, if they wish, both to the PwC report and to an intervention package I am proposing. This proposed package will need to do three things.' Mr Pickles said this would include ending council activities not compatible with best value duties, remove the risk of any further failures and finally to rebuild governance and financial management at the council. He said a key problem was senior positions, head of paid service, the chief financial officer and the monitoring officer, being staffed only on an interim basis. Reply: In response to the report, Mr Rahman said it had not found evidence of fraud, and said the council would learn from the report and 'strengthen our procedures accordingly' 'My proposed intervention is centred on putting in place a team of three commissioners who will be appointed and be accountable to me,' said the Secretary of State. 'Their role will be to oversee or as appropriate exercise certain functions of the council ... I envisage commissioners will be in place until March 31, 2017. 'To help me assess the progress, I am proposing that within three months of launching the intervention the council will, with the commissioners, draw up and agree an action plan to secure the council's future compliance with best value duty. 'The commissioners will report to me on six monthly intervals on progress being made.' On grants awarded by the council, Mr Pickles said: 'PwC found the mayoral administration grants programme handed out taxpayers' money with no apparent rationale to the grants awarded. 'There were no objectives, fair or transparent approach to grants, which a council's so-called corporate grants programme board was supposed to ensure. 'There was no proper monitoring - grants were systematically made without transparency. Officer evaluation was overruled. Across mainstream grants, 81 per cent of all officer recommendations were rejected. 'Over £400,000 was given to bodies which failed the minimum criteria to be awarded anything at all.' Turning to land disposals, Mr Pickles also outlined how properties were sold to third parties 'without proper process'. Mr Pickles said the council had 14 days to make representations on the report and his proposed intervention package. Solution: Mr Pickles told MPs that 'executive power is unchecked and executive power has been misused' at the council, and said he would be appointing three troubleshooters to the council, who will report directly to him . The report, he said, which cost just under £1 million would be borne by the council, adding: 'It would have been much cheaper had the mayoral administration had not been so obstructive.' There was no place for 'rotten boroughs' in 21st century Britain, Mr Pickles added. Mr Pickles said a copy of the report would be sent to the police for their information, he added: 'If I was the mayor of Tower Hamlets I would be holding my head in shame, because what he's allowed to occur in Tower Hamlets is shameful, not that I've made a final decision.' In response to the report, Mr Rahman said it had not found evidence of fraud. 'In April 2014, Eric Pickles announced that he was concerned about potential fraud and the Evening Standard ran these claims on its front page,' the mayor said in a statement released before Mr Pickles' remarks in the Commons,. 'These allegations have been rejected by PwC. The report highlights flaws in processes. These are regrettable. 'We will learn from this report and strengthen our procedures accordingly. 'I was always confident wild claims about fraud would not be substantiated. 'Both my officers and I want to get on with our jobs serving all residents in Tower Hamlets.' A Tower Hamlets council spokeswoman, also speaking before Mr Pickles, said: 'We urge the Secretary of State to act proportionately and to acknowledge the steps we have already taken to tighten up processes as well as the high performing nature of the council's services.' During questions from MPs, shadow secretary of state for communities and local government Hilary Benn said Mr Pickles was 'clearly right' to exercise the powers granted to him under the Local Government Act 1999.","Eric Pickles says there is a 'culture of cronyism' at Tower Hamlets Council .

"A Belfast pizza delivery driver was gunned down at close range in front of three close friends, police have revealed. Kieran McManus, 26, originally from the Turf Lodge area in the west of the city, was shot by a lone masked gunman at about 11.20pm last night. He died a short time later in hospital. Investigation: Police have cordoned off the scene in Belfast where a pizza delivery driver was shot . The father-of-one, who was known to police, was hit a number of times as he stood talking to friends outside his car at Domino's Pizza in Kennedy Way, where he had been employed. Police, who have described the killing as brutal, declined to disclose whether the gunman had called his victim by name. 'Nothing justifies the brutal attack on Kieran and the death of a young man. Today we have, on Easter Sunday, a mother mourning the loss of her son, and that is a very sad state of affairs,' said Detective Chief Inspector Karen Baxter who is leading the murder hunt. A dark red Astra vehicle was found burnt out at Deanwood Park - a residential area in Andersonstown - a short distance from the crime scene. The senior officer said a motive for the shooting had yet to be established. However, at this stage the killing is not believed to be sectarian. 'What happened in Kennedy Way last night was a brutal and ruthless attack, which has no place in society,' DCI Baxter added. 'This investigation will look at Kieran's activities, but today Kieran is a victim. We are keeping an open mind to the motive and we are working on a number of lines of inquiry.' Detectives will trawl through CCTV footage in an effort to piece together the events leading up to and after murder. DCI Baxter said some key witnesses had still not come forward with information. 'We know there were people in the area, we know they have information and we desperately appeal for them to come forward,' she said. It is understood Mr McManus had a six-year-old child. Paul Maskey, Sinn Fein MP for West Belfast, said the community had been left stunned and disgusted by the attack. 'Those who carried out this shooting should be ashamed of themselves. People are shocked that this is the Easter holiday period and people were in good form and someone, last night, was willing to go out and take the life of another individual,' he said. 'I would urge anyone with information to come forward and give it to whoever they feel comfortable with, whether that be the police or community leaders.' Northern Ireland's Justice Minister David Ford has also added his condemnation. 'I condemn in the strongest possible terms this callous murder. There can be no cause that can justify the taking of a precious human life and no excuse can explain the suffering that results,' said Mr Ford. 'I offer my deepest sympathies to the family of this young man and also my prayers on this Easter Sunday.' SDLP MLA in West Belfast Alex Attwood has appealed for anyone with information to bring it to police. 'At a time of hope in the Christian calendar, this murder is all the more appalling. The sympathy of all will go to a deeply grieving family. 'I urge anyone with information about this attack to contact the police,' Mr Attwood said.","Kieran McManus, 26, was shot dead in the west of the city last night .

"The Chinese government has threatened a diplomatic row with Australia if the ABC goes ahead on Tuesday with broadcasting a programme about China's escalating crackdown on the persecuted ethnic minority group, the Uighurs. The ABC's Foreign Correspondent is due to air at 8pm on Tuesday with a report by Beijing-based reporter Stephen McDonell on the small Muslim community in the autonomous far-western region of Xianjing in China. The report, which is due to air on the ABC's Foreign Correspondent program on Tuesday night, deals with the Chinese government's increasingly harsh crackdown on the Uighurs, a small Muslim community who live in the far-western province. During his attempts to film in Xinjiang, McDonell is aggressively challenged to present a journalist's card and an 'interviewing permit' without which, he is told, interviews are illegal. Scroll down for video . ABC TV journalist Stephen McDonell (pictured above on location in Xinjiang, western China) is challenged while trying to film in far-western China and told to produce a journalists's card, which he does, and then an 'interviewing permit' without which, he is told, interviews are 'illegal' Stephen McDonell was questioned by Chinese officials as he tried to film a story about the oppressed Muslim minority, the Uighurs in far western China . Stephen McDonell's attempts to cover the situation in the Uighur autonomous region of Xinjiang just get more complicated as he is challenged by a Chinese man . ABC TV Beijing correspondent Stephen McDonell (pictured, in China) travelled to the far-western Chinese province of Xinjiang to film and interview members of the persecuted Muslim minority, the Uighurs. Chinese embassy officials in Canberra set up a meeting with ABC executives to try and stop Mc Donnell's report going to air in tonight's edition of Foreign Correspondent at 8pm . Uighur women, pictured in a market in the Xinjiang autonomous province in 2012, are no longer able to travel on buses wearing Muslim-style scarves and headdresses, nor display the Islamic crescent moon anbd star on their clothing . The Uighurs, who the Chinese blame for a campaign of violence in their quest to have an independent homeland, have fallen prey to increasing restrictions which include bans on people with head scarves, veils and long beards from boarding buses. Women who wear traditional veils cannot enter petrol stations, banks or hospitals and are also barred from taking government jobs. Uighur people in Xinjiang, who speak a Turkic language, have been beset for years by violence that the government blames on Islamist militants or separatists. Crackdown: Chinese authorities introduced rules banning people dressed in an Islamic style from boarding buses amid violent unrest linked to extremist Muslims. Pictured are Chinese soldiers securing an area outside a mosque in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, after an Imam was killed by assailants in late July . Uighur people have defied Chinese Communist rules banning ethnic clothing, with women wearing colourful veils (pictured), men sporting beards and tiny Taipak hats declared illegal by China's government . Following Stephen McDonell's visit to Xinjiang earlier this month to film the report, the Chinese embassy in Canberra set up a meeting with ABC managing director, Mark Scott, and requested that the programme not go to air. The ABC has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that embassy officials had gathered intelligence on McDonnell and his film crew's assignment and suggested if the programme was broadcast it would have wider ramifications. The embassy officials first sent a letter to Mr Scott, then held an hour-long meeting with ABC director of corporate affairs, Michael Millett. McDonell attempts to find out what has happened in Xinjiang, where hundreds of people have died during unrest and conflict with the Chinese government . Uyghur men leave the Id Kah Mosque following the Eid prayers on July 29 in old Kashgar, Xinjiang Province. Hundreds have died in unrest in Xinjiang in the past 18 months . Policemen investigate the scene outside the train station after a deadly attack by a group of knife-wielding men in Kunming, in southwest China's Yunnan province on March 2. At least 29 were stabbed to death in the attack. An official investigation found that the more than 10 attackers were separatist Uighurs . Mr Millett told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Chinese government has expressed concern about this week’s Foreign Correspondent program about the Uighur’s campaign for an independent homeland. 'Representatives from the Chinese embassy made it clear that they didn't want the program shown.' Mr Millett said the Chinese officials were polite but forceful. Women who wear traditional veils cannot enter petrol stations, banks or hospitals and are also barred from taking government jobs . 'The ABC can confirm however the programme, by Beijing correspondent Stephen McDonell, will be broadcast as scheduled tonight,' he said. McDonell braved Chinese restrictions on filming Uighurs in Xianjing, which has been beset with unrest over the last 18 months, but where the government's tight security makes it almost impossible for journalists to make independent assessments of the violence. About 100 people were killed when knife-wielding attackers staged assaults in two towns in the region's south in late July, state media said, including 59 'terrorists' shot dead by police. A suicide bombing killed 39 people at a market in Urumqi in May. Human rights activists say the Chinese government's repressive policies in Xinjiang, including controls on Islam, have provoked the unrest. 'Officials in Karamay city are endorsing an openly racist and discriminatory policy aimed at ordinary Uighur people,' Alim Seytoff, the president of the Washington-based Uyghur American Association, said in an emailed statement. While many Uighur women dress in much the same casual style as those elsewhere in China, some have begun to wear the full veil, a garment more common in Pakistan or Afghanistan, two of the eight countries which border Xinjiang province.","The Chinese Government has threatened ramifications if the ABC tonight airs its planned Foreign Correspondent  programme .

"Dallas authorities suspect a sinister plot upon finding a district attorney and his wife slain on Saturday, only months after an assistant district attorney in the same Kaufman County office was murdered. Mike McLelland and wife Cynthia were found shot in their home near Forney, police said. On Jan. 31, assistant district attorney Mark Hasse was also killed. Scroll down for video . Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow in late March and their slaying was reportedly the inspiration for the hit that Canfield tried to arrange . In January, McLelland was eulogizing assistant district attorney Mark Hasse, and authorities now suspect the killings could be connected . Assistant DA Mark Hasse was gunned down in January, and had recently pursued cases involving the Aryan brotherhood . 'It's a shock,' Kaufman Police Chief Chris Albaugh told reporters. 'It was a shock with Mark Hasse, and now you can just imagine the double shock and until we know what happened, I really can't confirm that it's related but you always have to assume until it's proven otherwise.' Texas Rangers are helping with the investigation at the McLelland's home, the Dallas Morning News reported. 'Because we have to treat it as related [to the Hasse investigation], we'll be working side by side again,' Albaugh said. Authorities were also checking on other district attorney's office employees Saturday night, and believe everyone had been accounted for . Hasse, 57, had been heavily involved in the investigation of members of the Aryan Brotherhood. He was shot dead as he walked from his car to his county courtroom office. He was shot multiple times by at least one gunman, police said. The apparent assassination took place at around 8:50 a.m. in a parking lot near the courthouse where Hasse worked as a felony prosecutor who headed murder and drug cases. Crime scene: Law enforcement officers investigate the scene of Mark Hasse's killing in January . Suspects: Authorities said they were searching for on suspects in Hasse's shooting but have yet to make an arrest . Authorities have yet to prove a connection the killings but are assuming one exists until evidence shows otherwise . Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes said he had never seen such a case in his four decade career. 'I've . been doing this 43 years and I have never experienced anything like . this before,' he told reporters at a Thursday afternoon news conference. Hasse was rushed to hospital where he died of his injuries. He was unmarried and had no children. Witnesses . told police they saw two suspects flee the scene in an older, silver . Ford Taurus. However, the number of suspects had not been verified. Kaufman Chief of Police Chris . Aulbaugh said the shooting appeared to be targeted at Hasse for a number . of reasons. 'The fact it was not an ongoing rampage, it was one . individual being shot and then (the gunmen) leaving the scene,' he said. 'It was a very small, very short confrontation.' The . suspects were of unknown race but were reportedly wearing all black, . with one or both of them wearing a tactical-type vest. Some reports . claim they were wearing masks. Brotherhood member: James Marshall Meldrum is one of the alleged white supremecists involved in the trial Kaufman was prosecuting . No arrests have been made as yet. The Dallas County District Attorney's Office told the Dallas News  that a suspect had been arrested in the case but the Kaufman County police later said DA Craig Watkins had been mistaken. The initial $10,000 reward for . information leading to the arrest of the gunmen has been doubled to . $20,000 after a local business offered to match the cash offered by . Kaufman County Crimestoppers. Investigators are searching through Hasse's . case files, trying to identify any potential enemies he may have had, . including any members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang. Shortly after the prosecutor was shot and killed, the Department of Justice put out a statement crediting the Kaufman County District Attorney's Office with helping in the investigation of two known members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang. The gang members pleaded guilty today to racketeering charges, after Hasse's shooting. The release states that Ben Christian . Dillon, aka 'Tuff', of Houston, and James Marshall Meldrum, aka 'Dirty' both 'agreed to commit multiple acts of murder, robbery, arson, . kidnapping and narcotics tracking' for the Aryan Brotherhood. Tragic: Mark Hasse, pictured in older footage, was unmarried and had no children but gave everything to his job . At the time, McLelland said that the county had suffered a . 'devastating loss.' However, he said Hasse had been fully aware of . the . dangers of his job and 'accepted them readily'. 'When you deal with bad people on a . regular basis, you know there's the potential for these bad people to do . something bad to you because they have done bad things to other . people,' he told reporters. Hasse had no active cases dealing with the Aryan Brotherhood. '(We're) a family not just an office,' McLelland had told reporters. 'And trust me . the entire office took this very, very badly.

'Anything you folks can do to help us get our hands on this scum would . be appreciated,' he said. Sheriff . Byrnes said the courthouse had surveillance cameras but they were . directed at the buildings not the parking lot so didn't capture the . shooting or the suspects as they made their getaway. He said his office was beefing up security for Hasse's colleagues. 'We will have a uniformed officer in the parking lot for the foreseeable future ,' he said. McLelland added that the walk to the courthouse would be 'humbling... unhappy' now his friend was gone. All hands on deck: ATF agents stand close to the area where an Assistant District Attorney was shot and killed on Thursday, Jan. 31, 2013 in downtown Kaufman, Texas . Lockdown: Police taped off the parking lot near the courthouse where the assistant DA was shot . But he insisted: 'We'll still show up and do the walk and send bad guys out of Kaufman County.' Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood told the Dallas News earlier today . that he did not know what cases the assistant district attorney had . been working on before his death but said he was not aware of any . heightened security. 'It's a horrible situation,' Wood . told the Dallas News. 'None of us would have ever expected anything like . this to ever happen in our county.' The county courthouse went into lockdown and was later closed after the shooting. Tonya . Radcliffe, a board member on the Kaufman County Appraisal District . whose office is adjacent to the scene of the shooting, told NBC that a staff member heard the gunshots and called police.

Sad day: David Byrnes, Sheriff of Kaufman County, right, bows his head as Mike McLelland, District Attorney of Kaufman County answered questions about Hasse's death, just months before he himself was murdered . 'When you hear a DA at 8:40 in the morning is gunned down by two people, I think there's a reasonable presumption that it's not random,' he said. Defense lawyer Eric Smenner told the Dallas News that he immediately feared Hasse had been targeted. 'I felt it very certainly had to be work-related,' he said. Smenner added that Hasse parked in the same area of the courtroom parking lot each day. 'So if somebody was out to get him all they'd have to do is watch him a little bit,' he told the Dallas News. According to CBS, Mark Hasse graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1981 and had been licensed to practice law since 1982. The 57-year-old had been a Kaufman County District Attorney since July of 2010. He was chief of the Dallas County district attorney’s organized-crime section from 1985 until 1988. Steinke said: 'Mark was really a great guy, . he was the consummate prosecutor, he was hard-working, loved his job, . and juries loved him for some reason. He wasn't very large in stature, . but juries loved him and he exuded confidence.' Hasse had recently bought a house in Kaufman County and was in the process of renovating it, McLelland said. 'It's a scary deal,' Dallas attorney Ted Steinke told WFAA.com regarding the role of a prosecutor. 'Every prosecutor every once in a while gets a death threat, and we take . them seriously, but this is the first time in 20 years that I can . remember here in North Texas a prosecutor actually being assaulted.'

"The California government will pay $1.95 million to an atheist and former parolee who went back to prison after refusing to participate in a religiously-tinged inpatient treatment program. The Record Searchlight reports Barry Hazle Jr., of Redding, and his attorney announced the settlement on Tuesday in San Francisco after a legal battle that has carried on for six years. A federal court finally ruled last year that forced participation in a religious program had violated Hazle's constitutional rights. The 46-year-old Hazle served a year in prison on a methamphetamine charge and, after being released in 2007, was ordered to take part in a rehab program. Compensated: The California government  will pay  atheist Barry Hazle Jr. nearly $2 million for violating his civil rights when he was sent back to prison for refusing a religious drug-treatment program while on parole . He was told Westcare’s 12-step program was the only one available to him in Shasta County. However the program centered on submitting one’s fate to a 'higher power' and included prayer and references to God, which Hazle took offense to because of his own beliefs. Hazle's parole agent arrested him on parole violation after he refused to participate in the program. After serving an additional three more months in prison, Hazle sued the state corrections department. A judge initially ruled that Hazle’s rights had been violated, but a jury didn’t award him any damages. Hazle then moved for a new trial on the grounds that he was entitled to compensatory damages, but it was denied by district court, only to later be reversed, the Record Searchlight reported. A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge then ruled in August 2013 that compensatory damages are mandatory in the case of unconstitutional imprisonment. The settlement was then handed down this week. Scene: Hazle claims he was forced to go here, Empire Recovery Center in Redding, California . The payout is meant to compensate for the violation of Hazle’s First Amendment religious rights, as well as to pay for the legal costs of the long-running court battle. 'I’m thrilled to finally have this case settled,' Hazle told the Searchlight Record. 'It sends a clear message to people in a position of authority, like my parole agent, for example, that they not mandate religious programming for their parolees, and for anyone else, for that matter.'","Barry Hazle Jr., 46, spent a year in prison for a drug charge .

"Rebellion: Jenny Winder, left, head teacher at Elstow School near Bedford, has now cancelled a Caribbean holiday she booked during term time . A head teacher branded a 'hypocrite' after she booked a Caribbean holiday for during term time has today caved in to pressure from parents and cancelled it. Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow Primary School near Bedford, had wanted a week off after the Christmas holidays ended for an exotic beach break. This was despite it being after the start of school term and parents being told in no uncertain terms that they cannot take their children out of lessons. Today Bedford Borough Council confirmed Mrs Winder has 'cancelled the proposed leave and will be in work from the start of the new spring term on the January 5, 2015'. Earlier today parent governor Reverend Jeremy Crocker called on Mrs Winder to cancel her holiday and apologise because her proposed holiday was blatant 'double standards'. He also said she sent a letter to parents falsely claiming her holiday was 'unanimously' backed by governors like him. Her school, which she has run for 14 years, warns had parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £60 per child for unauthorised absences. Mrs Winder had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off. She said: 'My private life is exactly what it says - private.' Her holiday was approved as 'appropriate' by a sub-committee of the school's governors and chairman Kevin Hunter said Mrs Winder was 'devoted' and 'well-liked'. But parent governor Reverend Crocker said the sub-committee was presented with the decision as though it had already been made. He said he raised it with Mr Hunter because he had 'misgivings about the double-standard of a head teacher taking a holiday in term-time'. He added that Mrs Winder sent a letter to parents saying the vote to allow her to take the holiday was 'unanimous' despite this being untrue. Rev Crocker, who is rector at three local churches, said he wanted to clarify his own position and said Mrs Winter should apologise to staff and parents and cancel her holiday. He said: 'I hold the view that the chair of governors should resign, Mrs Winder should apologise to both the staff and parents and she should not go on the holiday.' Complaint: Local vicar and governor Reverend Jeremy Crocker said that the head should say sorry and cancel her holiday - and also claims a letter she sent to parents about the issue was untrue . Rebellions: A letter said governors at Elstow School, pictured, approved Mrs Winder's holiday 'unanimously' but now one, the local vicar, says this is untrue and he expressed concerns . In its last Ofsted inspection in 2009, Elstow School was rated as outstanding and Mrs Winder is thought to be paid around £45,000 a year. The website for the school, which caters for four to 11-year-olds reminds parents  to book breaks 'only in holiday time' and encourages pupils to achieve 'highest possible levels of attendance'. It adds that the school 'will not authorise' such absences and parents are fined £60 per parent per child per period of absence, which rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days. On her Friends Reunited page, the head describes herself as a former PE teacher now ‘too old, fat and unfit’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead. The mother-of-one, who is separated from her son’s father, is understood to be travelling to the Caribbean, where average daytime temperatures in January are around 28C, with her partner. However, one parent of children at the school said: 'Mrs Winder is taking a week off in the New Year after the children have gone back. Some parents, whose children attend the school, pictured, have branded Mrs Winder 'a hypocrite' for booking the holiday . 'This is so unfair as teachers already get so many holidays and yet we wouldn't be allowed to take our children out of school for even a day.' Parents who have branded Mrs Winder a 'hypocrite' for taking a holiday during school time have pointed to new measures, which mean they can be fined for taking their children on a term-time holiday. Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year. However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'. Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, they can face a fine of £60 for every child. Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail. In the Bedford Borough Council area, where Elstow School is located, 432 parents were issued with a fixed penalty notice for taking their children out of school, when their absence was not authorised between September 2013 and July 2014. This compares to just 39 fixed penalty notices, which were issued between September 2012 and July 2013. Earlier this year, one of the first couples to be prosecuted for taking their family on holiday during term time were Stewart and Natasha Sutherland from Shropshire. The couple took their three children Keane, six, Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, to the Greek island of Rhodes last September. Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service said at the time that it was the first family holiday in five years as the couple had struggled to get time off work together. After refusing to pay the fines, they were prosecuted at Telford Magistrates Court and fined £630. Speaking at the time Mr Sutherland said: 'I know education is important but there's a bigger picture. Family time is important too.' It has been estimated that more than 24,000 children skip school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price hikes.","Jenny Winder, 53, was to fly to the Caribbean after the Christmas holidays .

"Mixed messages: Canadian Luka Magnotta, 32, admitted in court to killing and dismembering his lover in 2012, but pleaded not guilty to each charge . The so-called 'Canadian cannibal' laid out his homicidal plans in an email to a London journalist, who will testify in his trial, it has been claimed. Luka Magnotta is accused of dismembering and eating his lover in 2012 and his trial got under way on Monday, with the prosecutor alleging the crime was planned six months in advance, with the killer having warned a newspaper that he would move on from killing kittens to murdering humans. Magnotta is accused of posting a video online that showed him stabbing and having sex with the dismembered corpse of Jun Lin, 33, in Montreal, including eating some of the body parts while mailing others to political parties and schools. Sun reporter Alex West reportedly interviewed Magnotta six months previously about claims he had been posting videos online showing him butchering kittens. The newspaper then received an email from Magnotta hinting that he would kill humans next. The email said: 'This time the victims won't be small animals. You see, killing is different than smoking. With smoking you can actually quit. Once you kill and taste blood, it's impossible to stop. 'I will send you a copy of the new video.' Crown prosecutor Louis Bouthillier said: 'It is our position that this email makes it clear that Mr. Magnotta was planning to kill a human being and that he was going to make a movie of that killing.' Quebec Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer told a jury Magnotta, 32, admitted this morning to the acts underlying the five charges against him, including killing Jun Lin, but he also pleaded not guilty to each charge. Wearing a grey sweater, dark pants and dark-rimmed glasses, an impassive Magnotta stood behind a metal-and-glass enclosure in court this morning. The presiding judge said the jury will have to decide whether the acts were committed ‘with the required state of mind for each offense’ or, in other words, whether Magnotta was of sound mind. His defense is expected to claim that he was insane as it fights a murder charge and four others: committing an indignity to a body; publishing obscene material; criminally harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other members of Parliament; and mailing obscene and indecent material. Defense attorney Luc Leclair told the court Magnotta is a diagnosed schizophrenic. Scroll down for video . Hoping for a glimpse: Cameramen follow a prison van in a bid to get a shot of Luka Magnotta arriving at court for the first day of his murder trial Monday in Montreal . Magnotta, pictured left after his capture, is accused of stabbing to death, dismembering and cannibalizing Chinese national Jun Lin (right), 33, in May 2012 in Montreal . 'The issue of whether Mr. Magnotta is exempt from criminal responsibility will be the issue you will have to deliberate on,' he said. Bouthillier warned the jurors to expect 'graphic' and 'gruesome' evidence, including the video and photographs of Lin's dismembered body. Defense attorney Leclair said his witnesses will likely include Magnotta's father, Donald Newman, a diagnosed schizophrenic. Magnotta, who was born in Scarborough, Ontario, legally changed his name from Eric Newman in 2006. 'I expect that his father will tell you about the family background and how life was for Mr. Magnotta and the family,' Leclair said. Insanity defense: Magnotta's attorneys Luc Leclaire (L) and Pierre Panaccio (R), pictured in 2013, will argue that the 32-year-old was not of sound mind when he killed his lover . Jury selection for the trial, expected to be one of the most sensational murder trials in Canadian history, took two weeks as the prosecutor and Magnotta's lawyer chose from some 1,600 candidates in an attempt to find impartial jurors that are as yet unswayed by the intense publicity surrounding the 2012 murder and manhunt. ‘You must avoid all media coverage of this case,’ Justice Cournoyer told the eight women and six men selected to sit as jurors. ‘Keep an open mind as the evidence is presented.’ Two of the 14 jurors will be dismissed at the end of the trial with the remaining 12 left to deliberate. Cournoyer told jurors not to ‘tweet’ about the trial. A publication ban imposed by the court bars media from reporting certain details of the case. Explicit details were publicized during the international search for Magnotta, but cannot be repeated. The case quickly gained international notoriety after a package containing a severed foot was found at the headquarters of Canada's ruling Conservative Party in May 2012. That same day, a hand was discovered at a postal facility, in a package addressed to the Liberal Party of Canada. Lin's torso was found in a suitcase at a garbage dump outside Magnotta's apartment building in Montreal. About a week later, the missing foot and hand were found mailed to two schools in Vancouver. Diran Lin, father of victim Jun Lin, walks to the courtroom for the murder trial September 29 . A makeshift memorial for Jun Lin, murdered Chinese student, close to Concordia University is seen on June 11, 2012 in Montreal . Magnotta was eventually arrested in an Internet cafe in Berlin, where he was reading about himself, following an international manhunt. Lin's father, Diran Lin, traveled from China to attend the trial, which is expected to last between six and eight weeks with testimony from 60 witnesses. Magnotta faces life in prison, if convicted. Jun Lin was born in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. He had only been living in Canada since 2011, realizing a long-standing dream by coming to Montreal. His family has said that Lin had a comfortable life working in IT at Microsoft's Beijing office, but had sought a move to Canada to study and to improve his life. At the time of his death, Lin was enrolled as a computer engineering student at Concordia University and worked as a part-time convenience store clerk in south-central Montreal.","Luka Magnotta, 32, admitted to the acts underlying the charges against him, but also pleaded not guilty to each charge .

"It is a phrase only too familiar to youngsters slaving away at their studies - and now 'practice makes perfect' has been revealed as the most influential saying. The expression topped a poll of words of wisdom Britons picked up in childhood and continue to use well into their older years. Other oft-repeated maxims include 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'good things come to those who wait'. 'Practise makes perfect' has been revealed as the nation's most influential saying by the new poll. (File image) The poll was put together by children's charity the NSPCC, which is launching a campaign to raise awareness of the importance pearls of wisdom can have in shaping a child's life. The survey of 2,000 people revealed that three-quarters of adults can recount a piece of advice given to them in their early years, while 80% of over-60s regularly refer back to these nuggets. Wordsmith Stephen Fry, chat show host Piers Morgan and Apprentice creator Lord Sugar - well known for his catchphrase 'You're fired!' - are all backing the campaign. The trio will join a host of celebrities who will this week be tweeting the pearls of wisdom that shaped their lives, using the hashtag childhoodwisdom. Of all the words of wisdom, 'treat others how you'd like to be treated' (62%) and 'if at first you don't succeed try, try and try again' (54%) were among the most common. A few old wives' tales appeared on the list, with 'eat your crusts, they'll make your hair curly' (26%) and 'eating carrots will help you see in the dark' (30%) sneaking in. According to the research, parents are the biggest source of childhood wisdom (85%), with grandparents (49%) and teachers (28%) also cited as sources of sage words. The study found 81% of mothers and 72% of fathers are recounting pearls of wisdom to their own children. 'Two wrongs don't make a right' (20%) is the most commonly recited phrase by parents today, followed by 'it's not the winning, it's the taking part that counts' (17%). Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: 'We're entering a fresh phase in the NSPCC's 130-year history - abuse robs children of a happy childhood but it doesn't have to be that way. 'We want to show how actions that all of us can take help ensure children's experiences are positive and one way of doing this is to impart words of wisdom. Chat show host Piers Morgan (left) and Apprentice creator Lord Sugar (right) - well known for his catchphrase 'You're fired!' - are backing the campaign . 'We want to remind everyone that child abuse can be prevented with their help and are calling on people to spread the message by sharing words of wisdom from their own childhoods using #childhoodwisdom to show they agree with us that every childhood is worth fighting for.' When it comes to words of wisdom, men and women live their lives by different maxims. Women appeared more likely to practice patience, with a quarter of those polled saying they live by the phrase 'good things come to those who wait', compared with 14% of men.","'Practice makes perfect' revealed as most influential saying .

"President Vladimir Putin is not known for speaking out about matters of the heart. But today the Russian leader said he believes in the power of love, adding that it is the whole meaning of life. Mr Putin made the comments while giving a speech at the Russian Geographical Society on the same day it was claimed a Russian army convoy of 32 tanks crossed into the Ukraine despite the Kremlin vowing to keep a fragile truce. Scroll down for video . Speaking to students in Moscow, Vladimir Putin said Stalin was justified in splitting Poland with the Nazis - as the Poles had earlier agreed to do the same thing with Czechoslovakia following the Munich Agreement . Kiev's army spokesman Andriy Lysenko said 'enemy fighters from the Russian Federation are continuing'. Pictured: Pro-Russian tanks near the town of Krasnyi Luch near Luhansk early last week . Crossing the border: A Russian army convoy with 32 tanks has entered Ukraine despite a ceasefire, Ukraine's military claimed today. Pictured: A tank being used by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine on October 28 . Addressing the gathered audience, he started speaking about love saying it is at the heart of his philosophy. According to the Washington Post, he said: 'The meaning of our whole life and existence is love. 'It is love to the family, to the children, to the motherland. This phenomenon is complicated, it lies at heart of any of our behaviours.' But despite talking about matters of the heart, Ukraine's military has today claimed that a fleet of Russian tanks including 16 howitzer artillery systems and 30 trucks containing ammunition and fighters crossed the border. If true it is the latest blow to a truce between pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine's military which has already been broken several times. Putin was visiting Museum of Modern Russian History in Moscow, pictured, when he made the comments . Kiev's army spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing the incursion happened yesterday, adding: 'The deployment continues of military equipment and Russian mercenaries to the front lines. 'Supplies of military equipment and enemy fighters from the Russian Federation are continuing'. Meanwhile earlier, Mr Putin had also explained that there was nothing wrong with Stalin's deal with Hitler to divide up Poland in 1939 because the Poles did the same thing with the Czech Republic in 1938. Putin met with students and history teachers at the Museum of Modern Russian History in Moscow to discuss a range of issues concerning the First and Second World Wars. He also addressed the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. He said it was important that Russian academics were involved in attempts to re-write the history of the 20th century so the impact of the Soviet Union was not forgotten. Commenting on the weeks leading up to World War Two, Putin said: 'But I completely agree with you that we need to fully study this period, as well as others. Why? That period is also interesting. Putin urged Russian academics to get involved in attempts to rewrite the history of the 20th century so the impact of the Soviet Union is not forgotten or underplayed by western historians and academics . 'Because before that, we had the so-called Munich Agreement in 1938. And what is it? Incidentally, your colleagues in western nations hush it up. 'Chamberlain arrived, shook his paper and said, “I brought you peace” when he returned to London after the talks. To which Churchill, I believe, in private, stated, “Well, now the war is inevitable.” 'Because appeasement of the aggressor, which Nazi Germany was, would clearly lead to a major future military conflict, and some people understood that. There should be a deep multilateral study of what was happening before World War II.' Putin attempted to claim there was a difference between the Munich Agreement and the non-aggression deal between the Soviet Union and Germany. Putin said that Joseph Stalin, left, needed time to rearm before he could successfully fight Adolf Hitler, right . He said: 'For example, there are still arguments about the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and the Soviet Union is blamed for dividing Poland. But what did Poland itself do, when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia? It took part of Czechoslovakia. It did this itself. And then, in turn, the same thing happened to Poland. 'I do not want to blame anyone here, but serious studies should show that these were the foreign policy methods at the time. The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression agreement with Germany. They say, “Oh, how bad.” But what is so bad about it, if the Soviet Union did not want to fight? What is so bad?' Putin said: 'We cannot deny the enormous input of our allies into the victory over Nazi Germany. But we must compare the victims sacrificed at the altar of this common victory, the efforts and significance. 'And to do this, we simply need to restore some information: how many German divisions were on the Eastern Front, and how many fought on the Western Front? Simply the number of tanks, artillery, planes on the Eastern Front and the Western Front. Everything immediately becomes clear. We simply need to talk about this, to repeat it again, to count. But to do this, of course, we must work in the archives.' He also said it was necessary to compare the 25 million victims in the Soviet Union to the combined allied losses. Putin said it was important that history properly recorded the sacrifice of the Russian people during conflict . Putin claimed that even Western historians acknowledge that without Russia in 1914, Paris would have fallen . Addressing the First World War, Putin suggests that Russian intervention into the conflict saved Paris. He said: 'It is very interesting to show the real events of World War I. This is exceedingly important in understanding the relationship between nations, peoples and governments. After all, the allies were playing the game, they were competing against one another, but they also helped one another. 'For example, at the time, everyone knew and said, and nobody denies it today, that Russia saved Paris with its offense. 'We must give credit to the allies that in 1915, when the Russian army suffered a defeat, the allies gathered and began offensive actions at the cost of enormous losses – granted, they did not achieve a result, but they did it. And all of this ought to be discussed, but in order to discuss it, it must be researched.'","Vladimir Putin spoke out saying that he believes in the power of love .

"An elderly woman who fell from a bridge into a river below was heroically rescued by two passers-by who used a shirt as a rope to help pull her to safety. The woman was seen falling into the River Taff during Cardiff's rush hour from the bridge between Wood Street and Tudor Street, which is flanked by a stretch of waste ground. In a lucky twist, one of the two men who rushed to her aid yesterday evening was an off-duty train conductor who knew first aid and had the keys to the gate giving access to the fenced off wasteland. The drama unfolded at about 6.25pm when the woman, believed to be in her 60s, was spotted falling into the water. The two men raced down the steep riverbank after they saw the woman fall from the bridge above . As they try to guide her out of the water, one of the men begins taking off his shirt . He then uses it as a makeshift rope which the woman uses to pull herself towards the riverbank . Once she reaches the two rescuers, the man who took off his shirt helps haul her to safety . The second rescuer happened to be off duty train conductor Peter Brook (left), who used his access keys for the adjacent wasteland to get her into a waiting ambulance . She was heard to scream as her bag, containing her house keys and mobile phone, sunk in the water and she immediately began swimming. 'I saw her fall from the side of the bridge and she just went straight down and started to cry out,' said Helen Spanou, 43, from Cyprus, who was in town visiting her daughter. 'She was swimming a bit and then two men got over the fence and called to her to swim over.' One of the two men then removed his shirt and used it as a guide rope to pull her to safety. She said the woman was crying and appeared to be trembling from the cold. Peter Brook, 35, an off-duty conductor with Arriva Trains, said he helped the other man, who did not wish to be named, to pull the woman to safety. 'She must have been in the water a good 10 minutes by the time we pulled her out. 'She had started to swim towards the train viaduct and I was worried she would go under it,' said Mr Brook, who lives at the nearby Century Court flats complex. 'Once we had her safe I checked that she wasn't taking any medication or had drunk anything and we tried to get her into warm clothes. 'The moment she fell I got on the phone to the emergency services and someone was on the scene quite quickly.' Mr Brook, pictured left, said the woman was in the water for 'a good 10 minutes' before she made it out . While tending to her, he also sent his partner David Jones, 37, to their flat to get his work keys which gave them access to the gate closing off the wasteland. It meant that when paramedics arrived they were able to take her away to be checked over without having to climb the fence. Mr Jones added: 'We only got back to Cardiff today from a two week holiday in Orlando  and were walking back from Tesco after buying a few things to eat. 'The woman seemed to be quite well-to-do and had a nice bag apparently containing her house keys and mobile phone. That went under soon after she fell in. 'It's such a shame.' A spokesman for South Wales Police said officers had received a report of a woman falling into the River Taff from a city centre bridge at 6.23pm. 'A passerby had managed to get her out of the water by the time we were on the scene. She was wet and in shock and was conveyed to the University Hospital of Wales by ambulance. He added: 'She was assessed as being uninjured.'","Two men saw and heard elderly woman fall from a bridge into the River Taff .

"This is the emotional moment a U.S. Marine who spent 214 days languishing in a Mexican jail after 'accidentally' crossing the border with three loaded guns was reunited with his mother. Retired sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, was set free from a facility in Tecate, a border town just south of California, on Friday night after a Mexican judge decided to drop the case. He had been imprisoned for nearly seven months after getting lost on the freeway with three weapons in his pick-up truck and finding himself with no way back into the United States. Donning a dark green jacket, he was quickly processed through immigration, before boarding a private jet to a South Florida airport, where he was met on the tarmac by his beaming mother, Jill. Scroll down for video . EmotionaLl: Retired sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, is reunited with his mother, Jill, after spending 214 days languishing in a Mexican jail for crossing the border with three loaded guns in his pick-up truck . Return: Tahmooressi was set free from a facility in Tecate, a border town just south of California, on Friday night after a Mexican judge decided to drop the case. Abovem he is pictured (fourth left) with family members . Serviceman: The retired sergeant had been imprisoned for more than eight months after getting lost on the freeway with three weapons in his pick-up truck and finding himself with no way back into the U.S. The pair were captured flinging their arms around each other in joy following the plane's arrival at 6am on Saturday. They are now resting and catching up at the family home in suburban Weston. 'He was happy. He was smiling. He's looking good. His spirits are high,'  Bill Richardson, ex-governor of New Mexico, who made a strong diplomatic push for Tahmooressi's release, told Fox News. Speaking on Friday night, a family spokesman said: 'It is with an overwhelming and humbling feeling of relief that we confirm that Andrew was released today after spending 214 days in Mexican Jail.' The Marine, an American veteran of the war in Afghanistan who left the U.S. Marines in 2012, is now expected to undergo treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. In good spirits: Tahmooressi waves at cameras after arriving at a South Florida airport at 6am on Saturday . Marine veteran: Tahmooressi, pictured left following his release, was arrested on March 31 by custom agents at the San Ysidro border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana after arriving there in his truck . Release: Tahmooressi (second left) talks to a Mexican immigration officer (right) at the border crossing on the day of his release. He is now resting and catching up with relatives at the family home in suburban Weston . Tahmooressi was arrested on March 31 by custom agents at the San Ysidro border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana after arriving there in his truck. He was charged with weapons offenses. Had he been convicted for violating Mexican gun laws he could have faced 21 years behind bars. Tahmooressi's long detention brought calls for his freedom from U.S. politicians, veterans groups and social media campaigns. American lawmakers even took the unusual step of scheduling a House of Representatives hearing during a congressional recess in the hope of putting pressure on Mexico and on President Barack Obama's administration to intervene more urgently in the case. Held: Tahmooressi, pictured here in a facility in Tecate, near Tijuana, was let go by a Mexican judge . Cuffed: Tahmooressi, pictured left and right at a courthouse in Tijuana, spent nearly eight months in captivity . Mrs Tahmooressi said her son's time in jail was worse than his two tours of Afghanistan. She added the veteranhad  left Florida for San Diego in January to get help after dropping out of college, unable to concentrate or sleep. In Mexico, possession of weapons restricted for use by the Army is a federal crime, and the country has been tightening border checks to stop the flow of U.S. weapons  used by drug cartels. Tahmooressi's attorney, Fernando Benitez, said he had the loaded guns with him because the weapons, which were bought legally in the U.S., make him feel safer. He is often distracted, which could have contributed to him becoming lost, Benitez said. Locked away: Tahmooressi, pictured here in May, faced as long as 21 years in jail if he was convicted of breaching Mexican gun laws . Concerned family: The veteran's mother, Jill Tahmooressi, right, is pictured with his Mexican attorney Fernando Benitez, left, at a July press conference . But Mexican prosecutors insist Tahmooressi broke the law, and have denied claims that he was held for about eight hours without a translator before authorities notified the U.S. Consulate. A psychiatrist hired by Mexican prosecutors to examine the Afghanistan veteran agreed with the defense that he should get PTSD treatment in the United States, noting in a September 30 report that Tahmooressi, who now serves in the Marine reserve, feels constantly in danger. Tahmooressi did not admit wrongdoing, and maintains his innocence. The judge freed him without deciding whether or not he had committed a crime. The release followed a meeting between Mr Richardson  and Reps. Ed Royce and Matt Salmon with Mexico's Attorney General and Ambassador to the U.S. Protests: American veterans, pictured outside the White House last week, took to the streets demanding the released of Sgt Tahmooressi . U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., was among those to applaud Tahmooressi's release. 'As a mother, my heart is with Jill Tahmooressi tonight and I can only imagine the many emotions she must be experiencing,' she said on Friday. 'Namely the relief in knowing her son is coming home and that they will soon be reunited without prison bars, without handlers and without unnecessary travel.'","Andrew Tahmooressi arrived at airport in Florida on Saturday morning .

"A tiny 10-month-old pet dog had a miracle escape after she plunged 100ft down a cliff and survived. Molly, a Norfolk terrier, was being walked off her lead when she bounded off excitedly to explore Old Harry Rocks along Dorset's Jurassic Coast and tumbled off the edge. The dog landed on a small patch of shale at the bottom of the cliff and was left stranded, swimming through a cave to a small remote section of beach. Here she was only able to be rescued by sea. Ian Brown (left) and Brian Cracker from Swanage Coastguards are pictured on the beach after rescuing Molly . A spokesman for Swanage coastguard said: 'The dog had fallen about 100ft but thankfully landed softly. Rescuers were called and were about to lower a man down the cliff on a rope to rescue Molly when a lifeboat crew arrived. A lifeboatman swam out to get the dog, bringing her back to the safety of the boat. More than 100 people gathered at the top of the ancient cliffs near Poole to try to help spot Molly after she disappeared over the top of the cliff. 'The patrol deployed some cliff equipment whilst Poole inshore lifeboat was tasked from another incident to Old Harry. Molly had been off her lead when she fell and rescuers had planned to go  down the cliff on a rope to rescue her . Molly had been exploring the coastline when she tumbled 100ft down Great Harry Rocks on the Jurassic Coast . 'The lifeboat soon arrived and located Molly and safely recovered the dog to the boat.

Rescuers were called to the cliffs at around 3pm on Saturday. Molly after she was rescued following 100ft cliff fall . Ed Davies, a helmsman for Poole lifeboat, said when they arrived at Old Harry rocks they saw a large crowd had gathered and that rescuers were about to lower a man down on a rope to get to the animal. He said: 'We proceeded to the bottom of the cliff and volunteer crewman Pete Smith got out of the boat and made his way to the beach on the north side of Old Harry. 'He then caught sight of a brown dog - it was Molly. She immediately ran towards him and was very pleased to meet him. 'Pete scooped her up and returned to the lifeboat where the crew gave her a check over and a reassuring stroke. 'Thankfully, Molly seemed fine and none the worse for wear after her dramatic 100ft drop and afternoon dip in the sea below.' Mr Davies said Mollie had swam through the cave to get to part of the beach where rescuers could reach her. He added:  'She is a lucky dog - it was really good for the crew to reunite her with her owner.'","Molly had been exploring Old Harry Rocks when she tumbled over edge .

"When Chip the chihuahua-dachshund cross was born, he looked the same as his two siblings. But while they grew up and were sold off to new owners, he stayed the same size, measuring just over five inches tall. Now dog breeder Emma Robson, 24, has adopted him as her own and takes him for walks on a lead designed for budgies. At just under 2lb, the petite pet weighs less than a bag of sugar, and is dwarfed by even everyday items such as a tin of hot dogs. Scroll down for video . Chip the chihuahua-dachshund cross measures six inches from paw to back, weighs less than a bag of sugar and is dwarfed by everyday items such as a tin of hot dogs . Emma Robson, 24, sold his two siblings but kept Chip for herself after he failed to grow. She now walks him using a lead designed for a budgie (right) Emma said: 'He's brilliant and he's tiny. There were two others in his litter but while they grew he's just stayed the same size at around three inches tall to the shoulder. 'He was so cute I just couldn't bring myself to sell him so he's stayed with us. He gets on with all the other dogs, he's very brave and loves his food and playing with a tennis ball. 'His mum is a Dachshund and his dad a Chihuahua - neither of them are particularly small. 'He eats plenty of scrambled eggs and pasta so we don't know why he's stayed so small. He's a fantastic dog with a big personality. 'He's a definite Dachshund - totally laid back and ready to do anything you want. He's incredibly sociable and loves meeting other dogs.' Emma says Chip loves food, including scrambled eggs and pasta, and cannot understand why he hasn't grown . Chip lives with seven other dogs - Bea, a rescue greyhound, Sky, a border collie, Ruby the cardigan corgi and four other sausage dogs called Nelly, JJ, Coco and Dolly. Three-month-old Chip lives with dog rescuer Emma and partner Mark Sawyer, 45, a lorry driver, as well as seven other hounds in Tibshelf, Derbys. Emma added: 'Chip can be reluctant on walks - because of his size everything is a bit daunting to him. Small blades of grass for him must just seem massive. 'We have to take him out on a cockatiel lead called a feather tether which is supposed to be used for budgies. 'I've also fashioned him a little t-shirt out of a sleeve to act as a harness for him. 'Luckily he's not got stuck anywhere or been accidentally trodden on yet, but we have baby gates for the dogs which he manages to squeeze through and we worry he'll get lodged between the bars."" Emma says Chip has already become a local favourite because of his size and personality. She said: 'Everyone in the village loves him. Everywhere we go people stop us to take pictures of him and ask why he's so small. Emma says people are amazed by how small Chip is, being not much longer than a hot dog, as this bun shows . Emma said Chip has not encountered any problems because of his size yet, but fears he may get stuck somewhere or squashed by someone not paying attention . Emma says one man offered to buy Chip while she was out walking him but she rejected the offer . 'I think people find him a bit of a novelty especially because he's a sausage dog. One man even came up to me once asking how much he was - I had to tell him my dogs aren't for sale."" Emma and Mark also look after seven other dogs - Bea, a rescue greyhound, border collie Sky, Ruby the cardigan corgi and four other sausage dogs called Nelly, JJ, Coco and Dolly. The dog-lover added: 'Dachshunds are great pets - I love them because of their chilled out temperament and they're so loving. 'I'm a stay-at-home mum to the dogs but I rescue Dachshunds in my spare time and make sure they're re-homed to loving owners.'","Chip was born along with two other puppies but they quickly outgrew him .

"Gangster Darren Bowling who has been jailed after masterminding a £1million drug smuggling racket . A gangster nicknamed the 'Dodgy Don' has been jailed for 11-and-a-half years after masterminding a £1million international drug smuggling racket from a quiet Lancashire village. Darren Bowling, 48, appeared to be a successful businessman who lived in a £500,000 former converted barn fitted with all mod cons in Barrowford, Lancashire. He also owned a villa with a swimming pool in Marbella worth £1.2 million and drove a Lotus and a Porsche Cayenne with a personalised number plate. But despite the wardrobe of Hugo Boss designer clothes and fancy holidays, police suspected he had never done an honest day's work. Instead he used his storage company, car sales business and a share in a trendy wine bar as a front to import high purity cocaine and cannabis from Spain. At Preston Crown Court, Bowling admitted conspiracy to supply a class A controlled drug, conspiracy to supply a class B controlled drug and money laundering. He now faces having his 'significant property portfolio' across Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and southern Spain seized under Proceeds of Crime laws. Detectives acting on a tip off discovered Bowling had based his operations in the former textile village of Barrowford to peddle the imported drugs across the UK. They began monitoring Bowling’s activities, which included him frequently heading to his properties in Spain to arrange for cocaine to be imported to the UK. He would then meet up and talk with his co-conspirators to organise deals. Officers eventually raided a number of properties connected with Bowling in January and seized more than two kilos of cocaine, 15 kilos of amphetamine, cannabis and £200,000 in cash. Three other men were jailed for a total of 23 years whilst a fifth man fled to South Africa via Dubai and is still being hunted. The village of Barrowford in Lancashire, where Bowling masterminded his £1million drugs smuggling racket . When police raided a number of properties connected with Bowling, they seized £200,000 in cash. Pictured is the £90,000 police found hidden at Bowling's Castle Packers warehouse in January . In addition, police also seized £50,000 in cash from the back of his VW Golf as well as cocaine, cannabis and amphetamine . Today police said the break-up of the gang represented a ‘massive dent’ in the importation and selling of class A and B drugs in the UK. Detective Inspector Martin Kane of Lancashire Police Serious and Organised Crime Unit who led the year-long investigation, said: 'In my experience of investigating organised crime, Darren Bowling was certainly one of those individuals that lived a fantastic luxury lifestyle from the proceeds of crime. 'From our investigation, we know that he owns property in Spain and Bulgaria and has a converted barn-style house and drove around in a Porsche. But we never saw him do a hard day’s work, despite him owning all these things. Paul Bell, who worked with Bowling, was also jailed for his part in the drugs racket . 'There is no doubt Bowling has become a very wealthy man over the years from importing and supplying cocaine into the United Kingdom and Lancashire. 'Drugs like cocaine cause misery to communities. The amount of cocaine and the scale of the supply of it on the streets of Lancashire can never be underestimated. 'We are now continuing to investigate the properties and wealth Bowling has amassed over the years to support proceeds of crime proceedings later this year.' One of Bowling's neighbours added: 'Everyone knew he was a drug dealer for years and you’d always see him out on town. His house is really smart and apparently he spent £40,000 on his kitchen with all the latest mod cons. 'He used to have loads of parties. He would go to bed and let people party on. He had a jacuzzi outside. He drove a black 4x4 Porche that had a private number plate with ‘BOW’. 'He always used to change his cars. He used to have designer clothes like Hugo Boss and he was always in and out of Marbella. 'He was nicknamed Dodgy Darren or the Dodgy Don. We’re just amazed he wasn’t caught sooner.' The racket began after Bowling teamed up with Paul Bell, 49, who had just been freed from a 20 year prison sentence imposed for his involvement in another drugs plot. Police mounted Operation Victor and watched Bowling as he cruised around in his Porsche. Officers said Bowling worked with Bell and another man Michael Donnelly, to set up an underground drugs business. Robert Wright, left, and Stephen Barton, right, were also jailed after both admitted conspiracy to supply drugs . The investigation, which began in April 2013, looked into the importation and supply of cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis and money laundering across the North West. The four were arrested in January after cross-county raids were carried out in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and southern Spain. Bell, of Cheadle, Manchester, was jailed for 12 years and eight months after he admitted conspiracy to supply a class A controlled drug and conspiracy to supply a class B controlled drug. Builder Stephen Barton, 42, of Blackburn, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply class B drugs and was jailed for four years and nine months. During a police raid, they found cocaine and mixing agent within a yellow storage container at a yard on the M60 used by Robert Wright . Robert Wright, 49, a self-employed landscaper, of Sale, Greater Manchester was jailed for five years and three months after he admitted conspiracy to supply a class A controlled drug and possession of cocaine with intent to supply. Meanwhile Michael Donnelly, 42, previously of Barrowford is believed to have fled to South Africa via Dubai on a flight from Manchester on September 22, 2013. He is currently being hunted and is believed to be in the run in Cape Town. Robert Smith, senior crown prosecutor for the North West Complex Casework Unit said: 'This gang ran a well organised and extremely lucrative drugs supply operation throughout the North West of England. Some of the cocaine seized from a drug deal by Wright, who admitted conspiracy to suplly a class A controlled drug and possession of cocaine with intent to supply . 'They were responsible for supplying significant quantities of cocaine and other controlled drugs and attempting to hide away from the authorities the large amounts of money they made from their criminal enterprise. 'I would like to reassure the public that the Crown Prosecution Service and police are dedicated to tackling drug and gang crime and will continue to target all those who wish to blight our communities with such criminality.' In October 2013, Shaun McDonald, 37, of Manchester, a courier for Bell was jailed for three years and four months for possession drugs with intent and money laundering. A seventh man, Mark Waring, 39 of Blackburn a courier for Donnelly, was jailed for seven years in December 2013 after pleading guilty to possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and producing cannabis.","Darren Bowling lived in a £500,000 house in village of Barrowford, Lancs .

"A lorry driver in Austria ended up creating a real soda stream when he crashed his vehicle, spilling 26,000 litres of carbonated liquid into a river. The accident - which completely destroyed the heavy goods vehicle  - left soda flowing into the River Gurk close to the city of Klagenfurt, making the water so frothy that it resembled fizzy pop. The driver of the lorry, 35-year-old Bosnian Braslav Bosanac, had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel before leaving the road and was taken to hospital with serious but non life threatening injuries. Crash: The accident - which completely destroyed the heavy goods vehicle - left soda flowing into the River Gurk close to the city of Klagenfurt, making the water so frothy that it resembled fizzy pop. Leak: For a short time after the crash, a steady stream of soda flowed out of the partially submerged tanker, causing the river to froth as it mixed with the carbonated liquid . Bubbles: The Bosnian lorry driver spilled 26,000 litres of soda into the water (left). The froth created by the accident made it look as if Austria's River Gurk had been through a real-life SodaStream (right) machine . The crash that sent thousands of litres of soda pouring in to the River Gurk occurred when Mr Bosanac fell asleep while driving along the rural Krappfeld Landesstrasse road between the small villages of Unterpassering and Polling. Police spokesman Erik Maier said: 'The lorry left the road during a sharp right term on the Krappfeld Landesstrasse near Klagenfurt and ended up in the river.' He confirmed that the cause of the crash was Mr Bosanac falling asleep at the wheel. For a short time after the crash, a steady stream of soda flowed out of the partially submerged tanker, causing the river to froth as it mixed with the carbonated liquid. Rescue: The driver of the lorry, 35-year-old Bosnian Braslav Bosanac, had apparently fallen asleep at the wheel before leaving the road and was taken to hospital with serious but non life threatening injuries . Partially submerged: It is likely to be several days before the lorry can be removed from the water, as a special 350 tonne crane needs to be bought in and made secure before any recovery can be made . The injured driver was taken to hospital in the city of Klagenfurt, in southern Austria's Carinthia state, where his condition was described as serious but not critical. Firefighters unsure about the environmental impact of the soda flooding into the stream called environmental experts and chemists who concluded that it is unlikely to cause a significant problem. They warned however that the diesel in the engine was more of a problem - and firemen treated removing the cab as a priority. Despite this it is likely to be several days before the lorry can be removed from the water, as a special 350 tonne crane needs to be bought in and made secure before any recovery can be made. Worries: Firefighters unsure about the environmental impact of the soda flooding into the stream called environmental experts and chemists who concluded that it is unlikely to cause a significant problem . Police spokesman Erik Maier  confirmed that the crash was caused by Mr Bosanac falling asleep at the wheel .

"The campaign for Catalan independence has been temporarily suspended, the regional government said today. The halt in the official fight comes after Spain's central government filed a legal block on the vote on Tuesday. The news came as hundreds of people gathered in Barcelona, the ‘capital’ of Catalonia, to protest at the Constitutional Court ruling, demanding the right to a referendum. Scroll down for video . Battle: Pro-independence supporters clash with anti-riot police during a protest against suspension of planned independence vote in Barcelona, Spain . Spain's central government argues that the vote, called by Catalan leader Artur Mas for November 9th, would breach the country's rule of law because it would be held in Catalonia alone, rather than in the whole of Spain. Last night, thousands of Catalans turned out in towns and cities across the region to protest, local media reports. ‘We just want to vote, yes or no, to know how many people are in favour and how many against,’ said Barcelona resident Isabel Redondo, who joined crowds in the Barcelona's central Sant Jaume square. Protesters gathered in the rain outside the city’s town call, draping their umbrellas in Catalan flags and holding banners with pro-independence motifs. Others waved giant cardboard ballot boxes as they chanted, ‘Yes, yes, yes, we will vote.’ Anger: Hundreds gathered in Barcelona, the 'capital' of Catalonia, to protest at the Spanish government's legal block of the referendum on independence . Freedom: protesters braved the chilly rain in Barcelona, draped in Catalan flags and carrying pro-independence banners . Fight for independence: The vote on Catalan independence was set to have taken place in five weeks time, on November 9, but the campaign has now been suspended . The Constitutional Court suspended the planned referendum on Monday after the government filed its legal appeal, a move Catalan officials now want to try and overturn. The legal suspension of Catalonia's plans had been expected for months, although Mas defied Madrid by calling the vote anyway, and is still pushing for ways for it to go ahead. ‘In the next few hours we will file our arguments to overturn the suspension of the vote,’ Francesc Homs, spokesman for the Catalan government, told reporters on Tuesday. ‘Although we have withdrawn our campaign, we are not pulling out.’ Some pro-independence campaigners want politicians to try and hold the non-binding vote in November regardless of its legality. Hundreds met up in Barcelona, pictured, while thousands were said to have been protesting across the entire region on Tuesday . Law and order: Anti-riot police control the crowd protesting outside the town hall in central Barcelona . Together for a split: As the official campaign has been suspended, it is likely that grassroots movements will take centre stage . Hundreds of thousands of people had already filled the streets of Barcelona on September 11, the region's national day, calling for the right to vote on a potential split from Spain. That fervour was boosted by a Scottish referendum on independence - even though it ended in a 'No' vote. With the Catalonia referendum plans now moving into a grey area, some political analysts expect Mas to call early local elections. A large majority of people in Catalonia, a region with its own widely spoken language and distinct culture, agree that they want to hold a referendum on independence, polls show. And support for independence has been rising - although not to the point where it is clear that the region would vote to break away from Spain.","Catalan referendum campaign suspended after government legal block .

"Pregnant women who are overweight should be sent to slimming classes to help tackle the childhood obesity epidemic, politicians say. Doctors should challenge the ‘fallacy’ that eating for two will produce a fit and healthy child. An all-party group of MPs and peers called for GPs and midwives to be trained in ‘body weight levels for pregnant women’. Running in the family: MPs said obesity was a 'family affair and it starts early' (picture posed by models) According to NHS guidelines, most women are expected to gain between 22 and 26lb during pregnancy. But the report recommends that those who are too heavy when they become pregnant should be referred to Weight Watchers or Slimming World, saying: ‘GPs and midwives should offer pregnant women funded referral to lifestyle weight management programmes.’ It said action was needed as soon as a woman becomes pregnant, as children of obese parents are more likely to be overweight themselves, adding: ‘Obesity is a family affair and it starts early.’ The new advice is contained in a report by the all-party Parliamentary group on a fit and healthy childhood, which says Britain faces a ‘child obesity epidemic of intractable nature’. The report said a Cabinet-level minister should be responsible for tackling the potentially ‘devastating’ problem. Peckish: It is a long-held idea that pregnant women should eat for two (pictured posed by model) Under the proposals, parents would receive ‘healthy eating and lifestyle advice’ for their toddlers, and family liaison workers based in schools would help encourage children to exercise, eat nutritious food and spend less time in front of the computer or TV. The report also said that breastfeeding should become the ‘desirable norm’ in the UK, pointing out that in Europe, television advertisements about breastfeeding are ‘perfectly acceptable’. It claimed that mothers could be persuaded to avoid fattening formula milk if there were more places to feed children in workplaces, shops and leisure facilities. The group called on local authorities to provide better outdoor play facilities so children don’t spend all day in front of computers. And it suggested that councils should carry out fitness checks in schools. Former Play School presenter Baroness Floella Benjamin, who led the all-party Parliamentary group, said: ‘It is now widely acknowledged that the nation is in the grip of a child obesity epidemic. This report will help families and the professionals who support them to turn the tide and establish new and healthy patterns of living for all our children.’ Slimming World spokesman Jenny Caven praised the report, saying: ‘If we don’t take steps now to do something to support families to adopt healthier patterns, our children will die before us.’ But Mark Littlewood, from think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘This is the nanny state in the most literal sense, with the Government peering over parents’ shoulders at every turn. ‘The all-party group seems set on hectoring the public from the cradle to the grave. ‘Their intrusive and expensive policy proposals are unlikely to achieve anything other than making parents feel patronised and spied upon.’","All-party group of MPs and peers calls for new guidance from midwives .

"Police have made five arrests in connection with the death of three teenage girls who were killed by a hit-and-run driver while trick-or-treating. Twins Lexi Perez and Alexandra Perez and Andrea Gonzalez, all aged 13, were in Santa Ana for Halloween when they were hit by a truck while crossing the road. Officers made arrests on Sunday morning during the search for two suspects who are believed to have fled the scene in the aftermath, dumping their damaged SUV before escaping on foot. Authorities would not release any information about those in custody or being questioned. Scroll down for video . Victims: Twins Lexi Perez and Alexandra Perez, 13, were run down and killed by a hit-and-run driver while out trick-or-treating in Santa Ana, Southern California, on Friday night . Tragic: Andrea Gonzalez, also 13, was killed as she tried to cross the road with their friends . Police are still searching for the two suspects in the car at the time the three girls, including the twins (pictured) were hit. They were said to be in costume and carrying candy bags at the time . A witness told the Los Angeles Times the girls were wearing costumes with black leggings and dark clothing when they were hit in a crosswalk near an elementary school about 6:45 p.m. Friday. Magaly Huerta, the twins' aunt, says her family is in complete shock. She told ABC 7 : They killed what we love the most. Why couldn't they stop the car when they saw my nieces? Why they couldn't do anything? I know God will punish them sooner or later.' The girl's mother said: 'I cannot believe this.' The Alexandra and Lexi Perez Huerta Memorial Fund Facebook page was created Saturday and asked for donations for the girls' funeral expenses. Family, friends and residents left flowers and lit candles for the trio following the tragic incident. Some remained at the memorial site all day as they tried to come to terms with the loss. A 2001 Honda CRV, the vehicle which is believed to have been driven into them, was found nearby after officers said the suspects sped off and headed north. Sharon Stewart, who cuts hair at a nearby barber shop, told the Times that she was eating outside when she heard what sounded like a terrible crash and screaming. She said she turned around and saw a car leaving and people yelling, so she got in her car and followed.

She last saw them at school Friday, she said. 'I can't believe it happened,' Ramirez said of the deaths of her friends, while she gathered late Friday night on the sidewalk with dozens of onlookers. 'They were fun, good girls.' Jeff Evans, who was trick-or-treating with his eight-year-old daughter nearby at the time said he heard squealing tires, looked over and saw the gruseome scene.

"A jilted boyfriend who broke into his ex-girlfriend's flat and set it on fire in a bid to kill himself has been jailed. Dillon Irwin, 20, forced his way into former girlfriend Samantha Milliken's home in Burnley, Lancashire, through a skylight and threatened her with violence before she fled in terror. He then set about wrecking the flat before starting a fire and barricading himself in as a newborn baby slept next door. Irwin was only saved when police forced their way into the burning property and found him unconscious on a landing before carrying him to safety. Dillon Irwin, left, who broke into ex-girlfriend Samantha Milliken's, right flat and barricaded himself in before setting it on fire . Later when questioned he claimed he was drunk and wanted to kill himself and didn't know how he had started the fire. Although nobody was killed in the blaze it killed Miss Milliken's cat, leaving her distraught. At Burnley Crown Court yesterday, Irwin of Burnley, admitted arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered and was jailed for four years and eight months, . Prosecutor Joseph Allman told the court that Miss Milliken was the proprietor of Posh Paws Tattoos in the town and had rented the flat above. On July 14 or 15 of this year, Irwin called Miss Milliken wanting to borrow her keys to go into her flat, but she refused to give them to him. The court heard that Irwin, pictured, gained access to Miss Milliken's flat through a skylight window and threatened her before wrecking the property . He then called her a short time later telling her that he had managed to get inside the property. Miss Milliken then called a friend asking them to go and remove Irwin from her flat, after he had gained access through a skylight window, which he broke. The court heard it was unclear if Irwin was taken out by the friend or left of his own accord. He then texted Miss Milliken saying he loved her but she replied saying she wanted to move on and she deleted him from her Facebook profile. However, in the early hours of July 19, Irwin then text Miss Milliken again at 5am when she was in bed, saying that he loved her and that he was on his way to the flat. She replied telling him not to come but shortly after, he arrived banging on the front door. The court was told how Miss Milliken knew he was drunk, so she told him she was calling his mother to collect him. Irwin then started climbing towards the roof, while Miss Milliken ran upstairs towards the boarded-up skylight, . The 20-year-old then took the boarding off the window and threatened the victim before he gained access to the property and began to chase her. Miss Milliken then locked a steel gate at the bottom of the stairs to stop Irwin from following her but he tried to shake it open. The court was then told that at that point, the defendant's mother arrived at the flat, which prompted him to throw a television on the floor. The two women then retreated outside and then watched as he then threw a kitchen unit through a second floor window and then climbed down a drainpipe. Miss Miliken and Irwin's mother then went to wait inside a car before the defendant picked up a brick and hurled it at the car and banged on the bonnet. His mother then called the police as Irwin ran back into the flat. Soon after, smoke could be seen coming out of an open second floor bedroom window. Mr Allman told the hearing that by the time officers arrived at the flat, Irwin had barricaded himself in by stacking furniture behind a secure gate. A police officer then entered the flat using a ladder then used an fire extinguisher to put out a burning sofa. At the same time, another officer managed to breach the barricade and ran up the stairs where they found Irwin collapsed on the floor. At Burnley Crown Court, pictured, Irwin was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison after admitting arson and endangering life . He was then dragged from the property by several other officers. Mr Allman said the fire brigade then arrived and put out the blaze and the defendant was taken to hospital to be treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. He explained: 'Officers were banging on doors of neighbouring houses until all of the occupants had been accounted for. A couple with a newborn baby emerged from an adjoining flat. Mr Allman added the second floor of the flat, owned by a single mother, was extensively damaged, to the tune of about £30,000. The prosecutor continued: 'The defendant had little recollection. He said he had been drinking in Burnley town centre. He admitted going into the flat. He said he wanted to kill himself and he didn’t recall how he started the fire.'","Dillon Irwin turned up at Samantha Milliken's flat after he had been drinking .

"Apple CEO Tim Cook has boasted that over a million people  signed up to Apple Pay in the first week . Apple CEO Tim Cook has hit back at two major retailers who blocked the firm's new mobile phone payment system Apple Pay, claiming over a million users have signed up to the service in the first week. Drugstore chains CVS and Rite Aid both last week stopped customers using the new service which lets users pay for goods by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal. But Mr Cook said there were plenty of other retailers around the world signing up, claiming Apple Pay already totes up more transactions than all other 'contactless' payment methods combined. Such services have failed . to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google . Inc and other influential players. News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had . opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly . 50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for . in-house use. 'We've got a lot more merchants to sign up, we've got a lot . of banks to sign up and we've got the rest of the world,' Cook . told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the . company's most extensive comments on the blockade so far. In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in . more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall . utility. Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming thefirst widely used payments feature on smartphones. Scroll down for video . New tech: Apple Pay allows iPhone owners to  pay for goods by holding their smartphones close to a specially designed terminal . Blocked: Drugstore chains CVS and Rite Aid have stopped users from using the new system last week . CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move. But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile . payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees . to card companies like Visa and Mastercard, . analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of . costs per transaction. Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 . stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company was . evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies. CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit . to two of its stores showed that the NFC (Near Field . Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used had been . deactivated. It remains to be seen, despite early signs of success, . whether mobile payments will become widely adopted. Cook argued on Monday that Apple Pay offered better security . and privacy than competing services, and that retailers risked . alienating customers by limiting choices at checkout. 'It's a skirmish,' Cook said in response to a question about . the retailers' moves. 'Merchants have different objectives sometimes. But in the . long arc of time, you only are relevant as a retailer or . merchant if your customers love you.'","Drugstore chains CVS and Rite Aid stopped customers using the service .

"John Boyett, 24, was arrested for assault, theft and harassment in Greenwood Village, Denver on Wednesday . A drunk former former football player headbutted a cab driver, stole a shovel and tried to hide in mulch before repeatedly telling cops trying to arrest him to call his boss. John Boyett was arrested in Greenwood Village on Wednesday - and dropped from the Denver Broncos practice squad the following day. The 24-year-old had been drinking at the Sports Book Bar & Grill, where a bartender and customers said he was very drunk and making threats. Boyett, who had tried to take food off another person's plate, was soon asked to leave. He then threatened to punch a bartender and refused to pay his tab. Two police officers arrived and called a cab for him - but five minutes later, the driver called to report he had been assaulted by Boyett. After he allegedly punched the cab driver, Boyett fled to a nearby construction site, took a shovel, and tried to hide by covering himself in mulch. He then told officers arresting him to call his boss, John Elway, the General Manager of the Broncos, before slamming his head repeatedly on the patrol car's window and spitting. He has been charged with third-degree assault, theft and harassment. The Broncos released him from the team following the arrest - Boyett's second in just over a year. The team tweeted yesterday: 'The Denver #Broncos have released safety John Boyett from their practice squad.' John Boyett, pictured left playing for the Denver Broncos, repeatedly told cops to call his boss John Elway, right . The team told The Denver Post they were 'disappointed' to learn of his arrest and behavior. Last season, the Indianapolis Colts released Boyett after he was arrested. He was charged with disorderly conduct, public intoxication and resisting law enforcement. Boyett had been a sixth-round draft pick from the University of Oregon but he was dropped soon after his arrest. Boyett had become aggressive with a bouncer and cops on a night out after he was refused entry into an Indianapolis night club because he was too drunk.

"Hillary Clinton ruffled feathers when she described herself and husband Bill Clinton as 'dead broke' after they left the White House following his presidency in an interview while on tour for her book Hard Choices earlier in the year. There followed faux outrage from Conservative pundits at Clinton's claim, seeking to paint Clinton as out of touch and focus attention on the fortune the couple has amassed in the years since, largely due to speaking engagements and book sales. Now, a Las Vegas newspaper has unearthed documents relating to a speaking engagement Hillary Clinton will undertake at a University of Nevada Las Vegas Foundation fundraiser that detail her travel requirements. Sought after public speaker: Hillary Clinton seen with her chief of staff Huma Abedin in East Hampton on Saturday August 16 . The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that Clinton will receive $225,000 to speak at the fundraiser and requires transport on a private jet and accommodations including a 'presidential suite' for herself and rooms for her staff. She also requested a stenographer to record her speech but does not want to be filmed. The foundation expects up to 1,000 people to attend the dinner. Table tickets can cost up to $20,000 each. It has raised more than $1 billion for the university since its 1989 inception. Meanwhile, . Republicans quietly vetoed a key requirement that members of Congress . disclose which lobbyists pay for their lavish all-expenses-paid junkets . around the world in July. The . Republican-controlled House of Representatives changed the 30-year-old . rule just as reports emerged that Congress took more free trips last . year than any year since 2007 when travel rules were tightened. The . National Journal reports that lawmakers and their staff took a combined . 1,887 free trips last year at a cost of almost $6 million. Travels in style: Clinton greets a fan as she signs copies of her book Hard Choices at BookHampton in East Hampton, New York on Saturday . Clinton left her post at the top of the U.S. State Department on February 1, 2013, but the federal government spent more than $55,000 on travel expenses related to her book tour last month, procurement documents show. First ladies have historically enjoyed Secret Service protection for life after they leave the White House. 'On . a foreign trip like that, State Department sometimes pays the original . bill and Secret Service might reimburse it later,' said Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan. The expenses included a $3,668 charge for her to enjoy a single night's lodging in a suite at the posh Four Seasons George V hotel in Paris. That rate corresponds to the cost of a suite with a 'large and superbly appointed marble bathroom,' a 'deep soaking tub,' 'sparkling chandeliers' and 'elegant period furniture,' according to the Four Seasons website. Double-whammy: Taxpayers forked over thousands for Mrs. Clinton to stay in the lap of luxury while she promoted her book overseas .

Only the finest: The Four Seasons in Paris boasts rooms that start at about $1,400 per night .

"Lisa Palmer, 41, is urging women not to neglect their vaginas . When she started dating younger men after the breakdown of her marriage Lisa Palmer was keen to maintain a glow of youth. The 41–year-old from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, spent a fortune on make up, facials and clothes to stay looking young. But it was, she says, a big mistake to ignore her nether regions, which she says looked wrinkly and old by comparison. Lisa now wants other women wanting to date younger men to follow her example, and has even devised a DIY beauty regime to help. After deciding against vaginal cosmetic surgery, Lisa embarked on a quest to find a natural way of turning back the years downstairs. Drawing on techniques from the Far East, Ms Palmer says she found the perfect way to improve the appearance and feel of her vagina and claims younger lovers have told her she now has a vagina age of 25. Lisa said: ‘I can’t believe I neglected that area for so many years whilst married. Now my vagina hasn’t felt or looked so good in years. ‘The real proof in the pudding is the reaction I’ve had from guys that say I have the vagina of a 25 year old.’ Ms Palmer started dating younger men after the collapse of her long marriage. But while she paid lots of attention to her make up and clothes she couldn’t help feeling self-conscious about the appearance of her vagina. Scroll down for video . She says: ‘ We tend to forget our nether regions, thinking a Brazilian wax is enough. But when I was dating my first younger man I looked downstairs to realise it was a bit wrinkly and dry compared to when I was younger.’ At first self-confessed cougar Lisa considered cosmetic surgery to rejuvenate her vagina. But was put off by the cost and possible risks associated with such intimate surgery. So instead she began to research natural remedies and discovered that women in the Far East had been using natural methods to take care of and improve their vaginas for centuries. Drawing on techniques from the Far East, Ms Palmer says she found the perfect way to improve the appearance and feel of her vagina using a natural remedy and steaming . Techniques like vaginal steaming and vaginal facials had been used to improve sexual health and well-being, easing periods pains and improving sex. Lisa began experimenting at home to create her own version using ingredients from the kitchen and bathroom cupboards before discovering what she calls the perfect recipe. She said: ‘ It felt weird at first because I wasn’t used to paying such close attention to that area but you get used to it and now I actually enjoy the experience of pampering my nether regions.’ She claims since she started performing the vagina facial at home she’s managed to recapture a youthful glow and improve dryness, tightness and elasticity. Dating expert Lisa says that older women should no longer think that a Brazilian wax is enough . She said: ‘ As we age and especially during the onset on the menopause, oestragen production slows and then eventually stops, where the vagina can become dry and thinner.’ Lisa claims the response she’s had from lovers has led her to encourage other women to start performing the DIY facials at home. She runs a dating website called Cubs and Cougars offering dating advice and coaching services to other women wanting to date younger men and now instructs all her clients to perform the vagina facial at home every week. Lisa also advises clients to follow vaginal exercises to help combat any looseness caused by childbirth or ageing. She said: ‘Childbirth and age can often leave us feeling loose so that is why it is important to regularly exercise the pelvic floor muscles if you want to date younger men.’ Now with an estimated one third of British women over 40 wanting to date a toy boy in their twenties, Lisa says the vagina is one area that simply cannot be ignored anymore. Mix in a plastic bowl: . Heat the mix in a microwave for 20 seconds and then apply to the vagina following a vaginal steam. Leave in place for 15 minutes and remove mix using rose water. Lisa suggests performing the facial every day for seven days to begin with and then once a week with a combination of pelvic floor exercises.","Lisa began dating younger men after the break-down of her marriage .

"Shares in airlines and travel companies fell today amid the latest development in the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. It came after a Spanish nurse contracted the disease in the first known transmission outside west Africa. British Airways owner International Airlines Group - which also owns Spain’s Iberia and Vueling - fell by as much as 7 per cent, knocking £500million off its market value. Big drop: British Airways owner International Airlines Group - which also owns Spain’s Iberia and Vueling - fell by as much as 7 per cent, knocking £500million off its market value . Low-cost airline: easyJet was down 5 per cent today, with the majority of its fall coming shortly after opening . Sinking: Cruise ship operator Carnival dropped 6 per cent, with the falls were likely to have been prompted by fears that the disease’s spread could cause major travel disruption . Low-cost rival easyJet was down 5 per cent while cruise ship operator Carnival fell 6 per cent, with travel agent TUI Travel down 4 per cent and Thomas Cook falling 5 per cent. The falls were likely to have been prompted by fears that the disease’s spread could cause major travel disruption. But the wider market was already on the back foot amid disappointing data. Traders may also have been looking for a trigger to take profits after airline shares were boosted in recent days following a profit expectation upgrade from easyJet and falling oil prices. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde said the ‘volatile’ air stocks were always the first to be hit by this type of scare though there was no certainty of the outcome. Also falling: Travel agent TUI Travel was down 4 per cent. The wider travel market was already on the back foot today amid disappointing data . Travelling down: Thomas Cook fell 5 per cent. Health officials revealed today that there were no plans to screen travellers entering the UK for the Ebola virus . On the move: A team of scientists in Boston used air travel information to predict where the virus could reach in the next three weeks . He said: ‘You could be looking at worst case scenario major travel disruption, long haul and short haul. My view is that that looks unlikely but there is obviously concern in the market today.’ Keith Bowman, of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the scare did seem to have provoked some nervousness in the travel sector. But he added: ‘There does seem to have been a view that in the first-world countries the spread of the disease shouldn’t happen to any great degree given the sort of medical facilities we have got.’ Health officials revealed today that there were no plans to screen travellers entering the UK for the virus, as more than 100 Army medics prepared to travel to Sierra Leone to help tackle the epidemic. Public Health England (PHE) said the overall risk of the virus to the UK remains ‘low’ and the country has ‘robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases’. Training: A medical exercise takes place by 22 Field Hospital at the Army Medical Services Training Centre near York,  before more than 100 Army medics are sent to Sierra Leone to help tackle the Ebola crisis . Preparing: Blood samples being tested during a medical exercise which took place by 22 Field Hospital today . Protection: Masks pictured during a medical exercise by 22 Field Hospital. The medics will staff a field hospital set up specifically to treat medics who have caught the disease, not members of the general public . Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said: ‘UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases. Three more people are under quarantine for possible Ebola at a Madrid hospital after a Spanish nursing assistant became infected there. More than 50 other people are being monitored as experts try to understand why Spain's anti-infection practices failed. Health authorities are investigating how the nursing assistant, part of a special team that cared for a Spanish priest who died of Ebola last month, became infected. She was the first case of Ebola being transmitted outside of West Africa. Her case highlighted the dangers health care workers face while caring for Ebola patients - more than 370 health care workers in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have died. ‘If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated.’ Personnel from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, are expected to sent on their humanitarian operation to west Africa within the next few weeks. They will staff a field hospital set up specifically to treat medics who have caught the disease, not members of the general public, and will operate a 12-bed facility. The unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, and become an escalating concern to the rest of the world. British nurse William Pooley, who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, survived after he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review after a Spanish nurse contracted Ebola, and three others were placed under quarantine, at a Madrid hospital.","British Airways owner falls by 7% - knocking £500million off market value .

"Rose McGowan apologized Wednesday on Twitter for making generalizations about the gay community but reaffirmed comments she made about misogyny among gay men last month. While a guest on author Bret Easton Ellis's podcast, McGowan spoke about her frustration with gay men not supporting feminists causes, with some comments drawing criticism from the gay community. 'Gay men are as misogynistic as straight men, if not more so,' the actor claimed. 'I have an indictment of the gay community right now, I’m actually really upset with them.' Scroll down for video . Attack: Rose McGowan criticized gay men for being misogynists, but apologized later for a 'dumb generalization' of gay activists . 'You wanna talk about the fact that I have heard nobody in the gay community, no gay males, standing up for women on any level?' she added. The comments were in response to a discussion of a boycott by gay rights groups of the Dorchester Collection, a luxury hotel operator owned by the Sultan of Brunei. Mic reports that activist groups such as Human Rights Campaign and celebrities including Stephen Fry boycotted the chain over the Sultan's proposed introduction of Sharia law to the Southeast Asian nation. Ellis, who identifies as gay, called the boycott a 'form of narcissistic, self-victimization, gay insanity' and said that criticism of the new laws was based on 'illusionary and tenuous' information about the codes. Under Sharia as it would be interpreted in Brunei, acts of sodomy and adultery criminal would be considered criminal and allows for punishment by death. McGowan, who held an anti-boycott party at the Dorchester's Beverly Hills Hotel over the summer, called activists boycotting the chain 'delusional idiots' and attacked them for not being critical of countries engaging in violence against women. Activist: McGowan says that she has not seen gay men support feminist causes the way that women support gay activist causes, and noticed misogyny in day-to-day conversations . 'There is Sharia law active in Saudi Arabia, there’s a woman who’s about to be stoned,' she said. 'I have not heard Cleve Jones,' an AIDS activist, 'discuss her, and nor will he.' 'Women, by-and-large, have very much helped the gay community get to where they are today,' she noted. 'What I would hope they would do is extend a hand to women.' 'I see now people who have basically fought for the right to stand on top of a float wearing an orange Speedo and take molly,' she said, according to the Advocate. In a follow-up editorial, McGowan, who has participated in pro-equality campaigns such as NOH8, called the generalization 'dumb,' but reiterated that misogyny was still a problem among gay men. She related an anecdote about a gay friend calling Blanche Deveraux from the TV series The Golden Girls a 'slut.' 'I asked why he'd say that so thoughtlessly. If I'm not supposed to say (and I don't) ""that's so gay,"" surely this man can start thinking about why it's acceptable to slut-shame. He thanked me for opening his eyes.'","McGowan made the claims about gay misogyny on author Bret Easton Ellis's podcast in October .

"Nigel Farage says it is an ‘outrage’ that he is banned from attending today’s Cenotaph ceremony, despite winning most votes in this year’s European elections. Traditionally, only the representatives of parties with at least six MPs can attend the event. Mr Farage is a Euro MP and although Ukip has one MP – Tory defector Douglas Carswell – that does not entitle Farage to join Cameron, Clegg, Miliband and leaders of a host of minor parties who will lay wreaths at the Cenotaph. Some have a fraction of the 4.4 million votes won by Ukip in the Euro elections, more than any other party. Scroll down for video . Seeing Red: But Nigel Farage, with Spitfire cufflinks, is furious Ukip will not be represented by Cenotaph today . ‘It is outrageous that Ukip supporters will not be represented at the Cenotaph,’ Mr Farage told The Mail on Sunday. He was speaking moments after being photographed close to tears at the Tower of London ceramic poppy field. In an interview during which his mood swung from his trademark bravado and cheek to fury and less-familiar self- doubt, he: . Farage, sporting Spitfire cufflinks, said he was ‘provoked’ into going to the poppy field by The Guardian newspaper which had attacked the ‘toothless and fake’ tribute. ‘They called it a “Ukip-style memorial” and I was so bloody cross, I thought “I’m jolly well going there.” Yes, the crowd did have a Ukip feel – decent, patriotic Brits of every colour and creed.’ Farage’s emotions about the First World War were stirred as a schoolboy when he learned how his grandfather Harry Farage was injured in a Mills bomb (early hand grenade) raid in 1915, with the Victoria Cross going to his grandad’s comrade, James Keyworth. Most of the 70 soldiers in the raid were killed or injured and Farage researched the heroics of Keyworth, who astonishingly lobbed 150 Mills bombs on his own. ‘They were so heavy they had to be bowled overarm like cricket balls, typically English, but damned dangerous. Keyworth had the VC pinned on him by George V at Buckingham Palace, went back to the trenches and was killed weeks later. Let The Guardian sneer at that.’ The Ukip leader, pictured here in Rochester, admits he is 'not steady enough' to be Prime Minister . When Farage learned Keyworth’s ‘dead man’s penny’ (a small memorial plaque issued to the next of kin of all those who died in the First World War) was on sale, he bought it. I wasn’t certain Farage would turn up. Two days earlier, The Mail on Sunday ran two articles about him guaranteed to ignite his short fuse, one about alleged ex-mistress Annabelle Fuller, another about his seedy political marriage of convenience with a ragbag of Euro racists, neo-Nazis and homophobes to get his hands on Euro grants. He forces me to put my pencil down to complain about the Fuller story, with dark mutterings of legal issues. What does he say to those who say Ukip is anti-immigrants and anti-black? Farage barks: ‘The most anti- black organisation I know is Brussels. They have destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of Africans with protectionist laws that make it impossible for them to sell produce to us.’ And his dodgy deals with racist Poles and Swedish neo- Nazis? ‘Have you made a fuss over the Greens at the European Parliament having people who supported paedophilia, the Conservatives teaming up with a man with a conviction for racism or that Labour is in a group with screaming homophobes from Croatia?’ Little Nigel Napoleon’s eyes nearly pop out with indignation (Farage is said to be descended from French Huguenots). He says the EU is close to being ‘taken over’ by the Germans but unlike Britain, they can never leave. ‘They have to back the EU because it shows they are decent human beings after their nasty past.’ He expects more Tory MP defectors – and one Labour – but refuses to give names. He doesn’t so much say the word ‘Cameron’ as spit it on the floor. Mr Farage believes Prince William (right) should be the next King, not 'pro-Green, pro-EU' Prince of Wales . ‘He has no chance of winning the Election. He’s beaten himself with windmills, more Europe, Green taxes.’ While he regrets not being at the Cenotaph, it will avoid a public spat with another posh boy he loathes – Prince Charles. Arch global-warming sceptic Farage refused to join a standing ovation when Charles called for action to curb climate change in a speech to the European Parliament. ‘It’s a good job I’m not having a brandy, or I’d tell you what I really think,’ he thunders. ‘He turned up to a foreign institution with far too much power over our country and told them they need more power to combat a problem that might not exist. If Charlie boy had been right, the ice caps would have gone by now. ‘I sat there thinking, “What is he on?” I’m glad I refused to join the ovation.’ Would Charles make a good King? ‘The younger generation are marvellous,’ he says with a wink. Skip Charles and give the crown to William? ‘Judge for yourself.’ He turns it into a joke. ‘These days, Downton Abbey types vote Green while the footmen, butler and kitchen maids vote Ukip. Mind you, the Queen Mother was more Ukip than Ukip!’ Because she liked a drink? ‘Ha!’ How about the Duke of Edinburgh and his ‘slitty eyes Chinese’-type gaffes? ‘Yes, he’d have to tone it down a bit to get in.’ But Jack the Lad Nigel bites his lip when asked about his own mum, Barbara, who posed in the buff for a charity calendar. ‘I was a bit surprised,’ is all he will say.

"Stalwart: Seldes poses at the Tony Awards in new York after winning her lifetime achievement award . Actress Marian Seldes, the Tony Award-winning star of 'A Delicate Balance' who was a teacher of Kevin Kline and Robin Williams, a muse to playwright Edward Albee and a Guinness Book of World Records holder for most consecutive performances, died Monday at age 86. She died peacefully at her home after an extended illness, her brother Timothy Seldes said. 'It is with deep sadness that I share the news that my dear sister Marian Seldes has died,' he said in a statement. 'She was an extraordinary woman whose great love of the theater, teaching and acting was surpassed only by her deep love for her family.' Marian Seldes made her Broadway debut in 1947 in a production of Medea, starring the versatile actress Judith Anderson, and later appeared in hits such as Equus and Deathtrap. Her most recent Broadway outing was in Terrence McNally's Deuce in 2007, starring opposite Angela Lansbury. Seldes was nominated for a Tony five times, for her performances in A Delicate Balance, Father's Day, Deathtrap, Ring Round the Moon and Dinner at Eight. She won in 1967 for A Delicate Balance and won her second Tony in 2010 for lifetime achievement. Her collaboration with Albee included Three Tall Women, which won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for drama, The Play About the Baby, Tiny Alice and Father's Day. 'I think I'm as ambitious as any actress can be, but I don't ask,' she told The Washington Times in 1995. 'I have a theory that it's better for me if I wait and either the director or playwright chooses. The best opportunities in my career have come that way, and all my opportunities with Edward Albee have come that way.' But she moved easily from role to role, from Chekhov's Ivanov to Peter Shaffer's Equus, from Ira Levin's Deathtrap to Tony Kushner's A Bright Room Called Day and Tina Howe's Painting Churches. Her off-Broadway credits also include The Ginger Man and Painting Churches. Seldes' reliability and professionalism sealed her place in the Guinness World Records for a time after playing every performance during the run of 'Deathtrap' from 1978 to 1982 - a total of 1,809 performances. Her record as most durable actress has since been broken by Catherine Russell, who logged 8,820 performances in the off-Broadway production of Perfect Crime. Seldes, the daughter of author and journalist Gilbert Seldes, was twice married, to novelist and playwright Julian Claman, a union that ended in divorce in 1961, and then to playwright Garson Kanin, who died in 1999. Long run: Seldes, pictured above in 2011 with her aide, clocked up thousands of Broadway performances . From 1969 to 1992 she served on the faculty of the Juilliard School, teaching the craft of acting to such pupils as Kline, Williams, Patti LuPone, Laura Linney, Mandy Patinkin and Christopher Reeve. Seldes also acted in film, in Mona Lisa Smile,Home Alone 3 and Celebrity. On television she appeared in Nurse Jackie and played Candice Bergen's aunt in Murphy Brown and Mr. Big's mother in Sex and the City. She also wrote two books: a memoir, The Bright Lights: A Theater Life, and a novel, Time Together. Seldes, a slim and elegant woman who often wore her hair pulled back, studied with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse and made her professional debut at age 17 in Robinson Jeffers' Medea, with Anderson. Her other Broadway credits include Crime and Punishment, The Chalk Garden, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore, Oliver Hailey's Father's Day, for which she won a Drama Desk Award, Arnold Wesker's The Merchant and Kanin's A Gift of Time. In 1995, she was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame, marking 50 years in the profession, but she missed the ceremony because - typically - she was on tour with Three Tall Women in Los Angeles.","Seldes died peacefully at home after a long illness .

"Labour health supremo Andy Burnham has clashed with Ed Miliband over a plan for ‘drunk tanks’ in Accident and Emergency units which would give priority to sober people with injuries. Burnham wants to pledge that a crackdown on drunks in A&E departments will be introduced if Labour wins next year’s Election. But the Labour leader has refused to let him announce the move for fear it could backfire. Last year, more than a million people were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries – double the number in 2002/3 . The friction between them comes amid growing reports that Burnham is favourite to succeed the embattled Opposition leader. Allies of Miliband have accused Burnham, 44, of running a covert campaign to promote his leadership credentials, including meetings with key Labour activists and union leaders who will have a big say in who succeeds Miliband. Health chiefs say waiting times for treatment in A&E units have been exacerbated by the growing number of drunk people who turn up demanding help. At present, hospitals treat all A&E patients equally, regardless of whether they are drunk or sober. It means elderly patients, children and others who need urgent care are forced to wait while a person whose injury is caused by their own drunkenness is treated first. If ‘drunk tanks’ are introduced, drunk people would join a separate queue, though there would be safeguards to protect those with life-threatening injuries. Labour supporters of the idea see it as a good way to counter Tory claims that if Miliband becomes Prime Minister, he would ‘throw money’ at the NHS – with much of it wasted. The call comes amid mounting concern over the rising cost of treating people under the influence. Health chiefs say waiting times for treatment in A&E units have been exacerbated by the growing number of drunk people who turn up demanding help . Last year, more than a million people were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries – double the number in 2002/3. Earlier this summer, Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, called for drunk tanks in hospitals where there are enough staff to make sure that those with head injuries were not left untreated. He said: ‘They say there was a time when this was a Friday or Saturday phenomenon but is now round-the-week. There’s hardly a time when there isn’t someone with an alcohol problem in an A&E department.’ Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb has called for drunk people to be forced to pay a fee for A&E treatment. Studies show one in three who go to A&E because of alcohol are admitted, costing about £3 billion a year.","Andy Burnham wants to pledge a crackdown on drunks in A&E if Labour wins election .

"The sovereign state of Brunei, perched on the north coast of Borneo, is described as the 'forgotten jewel of South East Asia'. It certainly was when I visited 30-odd years ago and was dropped by helicopter on to an unexplored ridge. Back then, at the age of 20, I was almost overcome by the primeval beauty of it all - particularly the lilting gibbon calls at dawn and range after range of majestic trees. Anyway, it was about time I went back to see how the little sultanate had fared - after all, the bulk of Borneo (the rest comprises Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island, and the two Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak) had, in the ensuing years, been widely abused, if not clear-felled. Heading back: Benedict Allen first visited Brunei 30 years ago - and was delighted to return to its rainforest . I was bracing myself. The country's vast oil reserves have led to it becoming one of the richest per capita on the planet, in sixth place. Britain comes in at only 22nd. Sure enough, things had changed. Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital, was no longer a backwater but a sleek, clean place of breathtaking mosques and balmy avenues. It says something about 21st Century Brunei that my guide, Tom, suggested I might like to experience - after a leisurely dusk river trip - the 'Harley-Davidson bike evening tour'. On our river trip, a boat whisked us into tranquil waterways, abode of salt-water crocodiles, flying foxes and monitor lizards. The sun dipped serenely over the mangroves while proboscis monkeys munched on leaves, kingfishers dipped, and egrets returned to their roosts. Then it was back to my gloriously immodest accommodation, the mighty Empire Hotel and Country Club. This featured a luxurious manmade beach - next to a luxurious natural beach. It was hard to imagine going anywhere more lavish - though we managed it at the Jame'Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque, whose gate railings are capped with 18-carat gold, sapphires and rubies. Everything you see turns to gold: Brunei's wealth is visible in the ornateness of some of its buildings, including its mosques (left); the Sultan of Brunei (right), who holds aopen-house event for his people every year . Next up was the Istana Nurul Iman, the royal palace. My visit coincided with the annual festival of Aidilfitri, when the Sultan extends a personal greeting to his people. It's the ultimate open-house party at the world's largest residential palace, which, at the last count, had 1,888 rooms and 290 bathrooms. I joined the throng of scrupulously turned out families to be conducted through ever grander halls. Finally, the 29th Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, the richest man in the world, was before us, there to shake hands with each male subject. In an adjoining chamber his consort greeted the women. The Sultan and his family greeted 73,000 visitors during the two-day festival. But I had come here for the jungle - encouraged by reports that 97 per cent of the primary forest was still pristine. So it was off into the Ulu Temburong National Park by longboat into the emerald interior. After a couple of hours we came upon the Ulu Ulu Resort - a peaceful retreat among the soaring trees with well appointed cabins constructed along a boardwalk. This means that without actually having to step into the vegetation, you may peer at frogs with sucker feet, observe a pygmy squirrel, or prod one of those engaging crickets that resemble a fallen leaf. We went off on a forest trek, which was utterly enchanting: a giant lizard striped like a zebra splayed itself on a stone; a bat snoozed under a leaf. Then the horned frog uttered its cry - the signal for a downpour - and we retreated. Monkey business: Benedict spotted proboscis monkeys and giant lizards in the rainforests of Brunei . But the highlight was the misty dawn - and those gibbons with their eerie early morning call. At Ulu Temburong the effect is magnified by a discreet walkway lately constructed right above the tree canopy. What a sight - spectacular and stirring. The forests here had endured. I don't think any visitor could forget that rather private experience of seeing the sun rise through an endless kingdom of orchid-laden trees. That, I thought to myself as we took the longboat downriver, is what travel is about: gathering what secret jewels we may along the way.

"Dangerous criminals nearing the end of their sentences who are released from prison for the day are to be fitted with new satellite tracking devices to ease public fears over safety. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is planning to introduce the new tags next month, The Mail on Sunday understands. The most serious offenders – including murderers, rapists and armed robbers – will be tagged first, but by the end of next year, Mr Grayling wants all of the 1,500 prisoners who are released on ‘temporary licence’ each day to be tagged. Scroll down for video . Fled: 'Skull Cracker' Michael Wheatley (left) committed an armed robbery while on the run from an open prison. Sabul Miah (right), a mugger serving two life sentences, escaped from Standford Hill prison, Kent, last month . Basic tags have been used by the prison system for the past 15 years, mainly for minor offenders who have been offered early release or a non-custodial sentence. They are linked to a ‘base station’ in their homes, only allowing the prison service to check whether they have obeyed a dusk-to-dawn curfew order. The new models are equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which means if offenders go on the run the police can find them immediately. The system, which has to be worn 24 hours a day – ‘bath, bed, everything’ according to a source – contains a battery that is recharged from the mains. The police are alerted if the tag runs out of charge. Mr Grayling is introducing the new devices after a spate of cases in which convicts have committed violent crimes after absconding from open prisons. Earlier this year Michael Wheatley – an armed robber known as the ‘Skull Cracker’ because he pistol-whipped his victims – committed an armed robbery at the same building society he had held up at gunpoint 13 years earlier after failing to return to Standford Hill open prison in Kent. It was the third time Wheatley, 55, who was sentenced to 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002, had absconded during his criminal career. He evaded capture for four days. The satnav tags will be gradually rolled out across the nation after Wheatley, pictured during an armed robbery, fled from jail . Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that Sabul Miah, a mugger who received two life sentences in 2003 for attacking pensioners with a knife, had escaped after also failing to return to Standford Hill. He was recaptured on Wednesday. Mr Grayling is also keen to ease the pressure on prison places. The current prison population of 85,786 in England and Wales is just 2,218 short of full capacity, and it costs the taxpayer more than £120,000 for each new prison place created. Each prisoner costs the state £40,000 a year. Release on temporary licence is used in an attempt to reintegrate offenders who have served lengthy prison sentences back into the community. A Justice Department source said: ‘When this new technology starts to come on stream, we’ll be able to track offenders on day release far more closely. The reality is, if you’ve got a tag around your ankle and “eyes in the sky” watching you, it’s going to make you think twice about going AWOL.’ Police are hunting a convicted burglar who has absconded from HMP Leyhill in Gloucestershire. He is the third inmate to go on the run from the prison inside a week. Avon and Somerset Police said Michael Dare – described as a risk to the public – was last seen at the prison at 5pm on Friday. The 29-year-old is serving a 20-month sentence for a burglary committed in 2010. He is believed to be in Birmingham. He is described as white, 5ft 11ins, of heavy build, with an angular face and receding brown hair. He speaks with an East Anglian accent and has a tattoo of a cross on his left arm. Police are already hunting convicted murderer Daniel Shankly, 30, and Daniel Wynne, 29, who are believed to have vanished together from HMP Leyhill on October 25.","Dangerous criminals on day release from prison will have satellite tags .

"Ed Miliband was accused of ‘total cynicism’ last night after he made two sharply contrasting speeches on immigration and race equality in just seven hours. During a visit to Rochester on Thursday, where Ukip is tipped for a by-election victory next month on an anti-immigration platform, the Labour leader pledged to crack down on immigration if he wins power next year. But at a meeting with ethnic minority activists in Croydon, South London, a few hours later, he pledged a crackdown on race inequality and consider ‘all-black shortlists’ to recruit more ethnic Labour MPs. Contrast: Extracts from Ed Miliband's two speeches today portray a very different message from the Labour leader . In Rochester he made no mention of race equality; in Croydon he made no mention of curbing immigration. This comes just weeks after Ed was lampooned for forgetting to mention the budget deficit in his speech to the Labour conference. Last night, Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘No one will object to cracking down on racial inequality. But it is totally cynical to say one thing to one audience and something else a few hours later to another. The message should have been consistent.’ Mr Miliband used his trip to Rochester to unveil a tough new stance on immigration, saying: ‘If I become Prime Minister I will bring in clear, credible and concrete measures to count all people going in and out of the UK.’ He would stop child benefit and tax credits being paid for children who live abroad, curb immigrants’ benefits, ban bosses using immigrant labour to undercut British workers and make sure more public sector workers can speak English.’ But he did not mention immigration when he addressed the Black and Ethnic Minority Forum meeting in Croydon which included many Labour supporters. He said if he became PM, one of his first acts would be to introduce new laws to promote racial equality. Warning: The Labour leader was told he faces a ‘catastrophic’ blow to his hopes of power after the resignation of his Scottish counterpart Johann Lamont . ‘I’m committing today, in front of you as my witnesses, to saying that if a Labour government is elected to power we will deliver a race equality strategy across every government department within a year. 'We would tackle police stop and search, which is disproportionately used on black people... and tackle the under-representation of black people in the judiciary and in public sector board rooms.’ He said Labour wanted more ethnic minority Whitehall mandarins, judges and company directors and would ‘guarantee’ jobs for unemployed black youngsters in London. ‘It is shocking that 44 per cent of black young people in London are without a job. We are going to guarantee them a job... You can hold me to that promise, after the General Election, unlike other politicians.’ Pressed by activists at the meeting to back ‘all-black shortlists’ to recruit more ethnic Labour MPs modelled on ‘all-women shortlists’, he said Labour ‘should debate the issue’. A Labour spokesman last night said it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest Mr Miliband had been inconsistent.","Leader pledges to crack down immigration in UKIP stronghold of Rochester .

"Michael Gove slammed the outgoing EU chief for demand . Michael Gove has taken a vicious sideswipe at outgoing EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso over the demand for Britain to pay more money to Brussels. He compared the £1.7 billion bill, which Downing Street blames on Mr Barroso, to the way Bill Clinton’s staff sabotaged computers when they left the White House in 2001. The Chief Whip fiercely criticised the EU Commission President, who steps down in the next few weeks, for failing to mention the issue when he visited Downing Street last week. ‘The timing just as the Commission are leaving is most surprising,’ Mr Gove told The Mail on Sunday. ‘It’s almost as though this Commission decided, as was the case when Clinton’s team left the White House, to deliberately sabotage computer keyboards for the incoming Bush team.’ When George W. Bush took office, his aides found that all the Ws had been removed from computer keyboards and the desk drawers were glued shut, among other ‘pranks’. David Cameron had a heated clash with Mr Barroso when the financial demand was discussed at an EU summit on Friday. The former Portuguese Prime Minister said Mr Cameron had ‘misunderstood’ the issue and that the payment, due on December 1, was in line with normal EU rules. Interrupting Mr Barroso, the Prime Minister said: ‘You have totally failed to understand the consequences of your actions. ‘It is no good you trying to claim this is some kind of public relations misunderstanding. It is not. This is £2 billion of British taxpayers’ money and I am not prepared to accept it.’ Last night, Mr Cameron faced another challenge to his plans to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU as German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to block his cap on immigration from within Europe. The outgoing European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said David Cameron had 'misunderstood' and that the payments were in line with normal EU rules . Bill Clinton's staff admitted to pulling 'a few pranks' on employees of George W. Bush before the latter moved into White House offices at the beginning of his term . Asked if they would ‘Vote for Ukip if I thought they could win the constituency I live in’, 31 per cent of those surveyed said they agreed. That figure was made up of 33 per cent of Tory voters, 25 per cent Lib Dem and 18 per cent Labour supporters. The Opinium / Observer survey put the Tories and Labour neck-and-neck on 33 per cent – a boost for the Tories who are up five points from a fortnight ago. But its findings on the popularity of Ukip will be alarming to the main three parties. She said: ‘Germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the EU’ – but added that she would help Mr Cameron’s efforts to tackle the abuse of benefits by migrants. The run-ins with the EU came as Mr Cameron was warned his leadership will be in trouble if, as expected, his party loses the Rochester by-election on November 20 to ex-Conservative Mark Reckless, who is now standing for Ukip. Eurosceptic MPs warned a defeat would provoke a full-scale Conservative crisis. Tory MP Andrew Percy said: ‘If we lose Rochester, there will be serious questions about the strategy at the top of the party.’ Defeat could spark a revolt by 100 Tory MPs over the Government’s decision to opt back in to the European Arrest Warrant. The Government has decided to opt out of more than 130 European criminal justice measures on December 1 – then immediately opt back in to 35 of them which it thinks are beneficial to Britain. Home Secretary Theresa May warned that failing to rejoin the warrant scheme would force Britain to release more than 500 inmates from jail, including rapists and murderers, and make it harder to force other EU nations to hand over terrorists for trial in Britain. Mrs May said ditching the arrest warrant would also lead to Britain becoming ‘a honeypot for all of Europe’s criminals on the run from justice’ and added: ‘British criminals would be able to hop on to the Eurostar or fly to Spain, safe in the knowledge we wouldn’t be able to get them back to prosecute them.’","Michael Gove blamed outgoing EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for the bill .

"A fraudster swindled nearly £2million from his in-laws and friends in a Ponzi-style sports betting scheme to fund his gambling addiction. David Gale, 51, admitted using bank and Betfair accounts in the name of his ex-wife Faye - and convinced her father and grandfather to part with cash in the failed scheme. The financial advisor told investors the scheme would pay 'dividends' if they signed up, but he conned his father-in-law out of £145,000, a court heard today. David Gale (right) and his ex-wife Faye (left) appeared at Guildford Crown Court today where he admitted using bank and Betfair accounts in her name to con people, including her father and grandfather, out of cash . Mrs Gale was 'swept off her feet' when she met her husband, who is 13 years his junior, at Royal Ascot in 2004 but the seven-year marriage ended when his scheming was uncovered in 2011. He immediately left the family home in Great Bookham, Surrey, where the couple lived with their two children and moved to Little London in Chichester, West Sussex. Mr Gale appeared at Guildford Crown Court today, carrying an overnight holdall, where he admitted three counts of fraud and two counts of unauthorised regulated activity. Prosecuting, Alison Clare said: 'They have two small children. Mrs Gale's father lost more than £100,000 and her grandfather lost money. 'It was all in her name and she has already been successfully sued by one investor who lost £300,000.' Mrs Gale, 37, appeared in the dock alongside her former husband charged with aiding and abetting him, but Judge Robert Fraser told her this would lie on file. David Gale, who is 13 years older than Faye, was pictured arriving at court today carrying a holdall . At an earlier hearing she was found liable for hundreds of thousands of pounds when family friend, Kathleen O'Neill sued for the £300,000 she had invested in her husband's scheme. In March last year, Judge David Donaldson QC cleared the London-based TV producer of any dishonesty but ruled that she would still have to cover the costs of Mr Gale's losses. Judge Donaldson expressed amazement that 'intelligent and level-headed' people could possibly have believed that any scheme involving betting on football could be risk-free. He explained the collapse came abruptly in 2011, adding: 'Mr Gale wrote to his investors to explain - falsely, as is now known - that, by oversight and clumsiness in making a single entry online, he had lost the entirety of the pool of money.' She took it to the Court of Appeal in December but three top judges ruled against her. In today's trial, the court heard that Gale's gambling addiction had led him to get caught up in the betting system and he convinced investors they would receive 'dividends' if they signed up. He admitted the charges at Guildford Crown Court today and is due to be sentenced on December 12 . He told his wife's friends, relatives and neighbours that the scheme was risk free and his ex-wife's grandfather was one of the first investors. Ms Clare told the court: 'The loss to the witnesses was in the region of £1.8 million.' Judge Fraser warned the former mortgage broker he faced jail and Gale was released on bail until December 12, when he will be sentenced.","David Gale, 51, admitted using bank and Betfair accounts in ex-wife's name .

Brooks Newmark (left) has announced he will step down at the next general election after a second woman revealed he had sent her explicit images, pictured with his wife Lucy . The second ‘sexting’ bombshell comes as a poll for today’s Mail on Sunday puts Ukip on a record 25 per cent – just six points behind the Tories and Labour, both on 31 per cent. If repeated in a General Election, it would see Ukip win a staggering 128 seats, taking more than 100 from the Conservatives, and leaving Nigel Farage holding the balance of power. When he quit as Charities Minister last month after admitting sending obscene photos to ‘Sophie Wittams’, who he thought was a twentysomething Tory PR girl, Braintree MP Mr Newmark vowed to hold on to his Essex seat. However, his latest humiliation has forced to him to quit politics altogether. In an astonishing and emotional public confession in today’s Mail on Sunday, he writes: ‘In response to what seems to be a new text-and-tell story I am standing down as an MP at the next Election. He was forced to resign as a minister last month after admitting sending obscene photos to ‘Sophie Wittams’, who he thought was a  Tory PR girl . ‘I was the man who had everything... Now my political career is in ruins. ‘I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues. Many will regard me as a failure. And it is true: behind the outward facade of success and achievement, I have been battling demons – and losing to them.’ In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, the 56-year-old married father of five said: ‘The continued media intrusion into past episodes in my personal life is placing an intolerable burden on my family. I have therefore decided to stand down at the General Election. ‘I will continue to serve my constituents to the best of my abilities until that time. I again appeal to the media to respect my family’s privacy and to give me a chance to try to heal the hurt I have caused them.’ His first humiliating resignation as a Minister coincided with the defection of Tory MP Mark Reckless to Ukip and overshadowed the start of the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Today’s Survation poll will shake Downing Street, which is gearing up for a brutal fight in next month’s Rochester by-election caused by Mr Reckless’s defection. The most astonishing mea culpa you will ever read, by Brooks Newmark . I was the man who had everything. I made a fortune, married a beautiful wife, had five children, and then fulfilled my lifelong ambition. Ever since my school days I wanted to be a politician. My election to represent my Essex constituency of Braintree in 2005 was one of the proudest moments of my life. So too was joining the Government as Minister for Civil Society. The MP said: 'Now my political career is in ruins. I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues. Many will regard me as a failure' Now my political career is in ruins. I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues. Many will regard me as a failure. And it is true: behind the outward facade of success and achievement, I have been battling demons – and losing to them. I craved adrenaline and risk. Stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour. My friends warned me that I was cracking up. I ignored them. Late at night, I began a series of flirtations in response to approaches from women on social media. Deep inside, I knew I was playing with fire. Now it has consumed me and my family. When a newspaper exposed one of these episodes – involving a male freelance reporter using stolen pictures to impersonate a young female Conservative Party activist – I stood down as a Minister. Now, in response to what seems to be a new text-and-tell story, I am standing down as an MP at the next Election. I want to concentrate on slaying those demons – making me, I hope, a better husband and father, and giving me a chance to contribute in some way to the country in future. True, I made big sacrifices for my career, leaving a highly paid job in finance to dedicate myself to the day-to-day concerns of my constituents in Braintree. Many of my counterparts from Harvard and Oxford days mocked me for this. I tried to explain to them that I wanted to give back: using my privilege and education to help people solve their daily problems – helping them navigate the bureaucratic maze on issues such as welfare and housing, and ensuring that Braintree had its own community hospital. What is the point of making millions when you can change the lives of thousands? But a far greater price was paid by my family. All too often I was an absent dad, arriving home late at night when the children were in bed. I missed family meals, holidays and vital moments in their lives. I will never get those back. Worse, I was emotionally absent, seeking the buzz of achievement when I should have been dealing with the concerns of those nearest and dearest to me: my wife above all. The illusion of success in the Westminster bubble blinded me to reality. Exchanging flirty pictures online is no substitute for the love and companionship that a real marriage offers. I still look back with pride on my campaign to reduce youth unemployment, setting up an education charity in Rwanda and my efforts to encourage women into public life. Amid the wreckage of my political career, it is some comfort to know that this work was not in vain. These causes will remain close to my heart and I will do what I can to further them even when I am no longer in Parliament. Mr Newmark meeting President Bashar Assad of Syria. The MP admitted that stress at work drove him to increasingly erratic behaviour and he began a series of flirtations online . I will continue to represent my constituents until the General Election in May. But I am seeking help now. I will be beginning residential psychiatric treatment for the next few weeks in the hope that professional help will enable me to salvage my life and my family. I would like to use this terrible moment in my life to appeal to others who are ashamed of their mental ill-health to seek help before it is too late. I have long argued in Parliament against the stigma which we too often attach to mental illness. But I did not practise what I preached. I talked about my anorexia as a teenager, yet I was never brave enough to admit first that I was suffering from depression, or that I was lapsing into episodes of behaviour that any normal person would regard as bizarre and abhorrent. I realise now – too late – that I need treatment. Many of my friends have advised me to ‘tough this out’. After all, they say, I have not broken any law. I have not stolen any money. Many other politicians have done far worse things to their families – and their careers have survived and even flourished. I have received countless messages of support – from all political quarters and none – along these lines in recent days, and I am profoundly grateful for them. But for me that is not the point. I do not want to be a battle-scarred veteran of Westminster politics. I want to be a person who brings happiness to those around me – and thus to myself. That can come only if I change. I do not blame the media for my downfall. It is for others to judge their behaviour and their ethics. The fault is mine alone. If I had sought help earlier, none of this would have happened. But I do hope that the media will leave me and my family alone as we try to rebuild our lives.","Brooks Newmark resigned after he was caught sending an explicit photo .

"One of Britain’s most shocking hospital scandals in which dementia patients died after cruel abuse by nurses is exposed today. Elderly patients at an NHS hospital were left covered in faeces, injured themselves crawling on urine covered floors and were physically restrained with tables and chairs. Nurses threatened and swore at them, left them naked and taunted them about their past love lives. Hospital chiefs ignored repeated protests by relatives but were forced to act after a recording on a mobile phone camera smuggled into the hospital proved they were telling the truth. Elderly patients at an NHS hospital were left covered in faeces, injured themselves crawling on urine covered floors and were physically restrained with tables and chairs (File photo) The recording – the explosive contents of which have been obtained by this newspaper following an in-depth investigation – shows that nurses at a patient care meeting: . An independent report into the scandal, including extracts from the recording, has been sent to police, health chiefs and Government Ministers. One senior figure who has seen it said: ‘It is the most shocking document I have ever read.’ The report says there was ‘institutional abuse’ and suggests a number of patients died as a direct result. Relatives’ harrowing accounts of the horrific maltreatment of loved ones were backed up by NHS whistleblowers who witnessed the abuse but had been too scared to speak out, until now. The new scandal centres on the Tawel Fan dementia ward of the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales. The ward was closed last year, when patients were transferred and some staff suspended. The Ablett unit which houses the Tawel Fan ward has been shut and is now under police investigation . An independent inquiry was ordered by the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) which runs the hospital, and as a result of that, police were called in earlier this month to investigate. The BCUHB said it was ‘truly sorry to have let patients and their families down so badly.’ Chairman Peter Higson said the ‘deeply disturbing allegations’ would be ‘thoroughly investigated.’ Det Insp Lisa Surridge of North Wales police said they would study ‘documents and other material to establish evidence of criminality’. Under new laws announced after the Mid-Staffordshire care scandal, doctors and nurses found guilty of ‘wilful neglect’ face a prison sentence of up to five years. Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb last night called on the Labour-run Welsh Government, which runs hospitals in the Principality to ‘get a grip’. He said: ‘I am shocked and appalled that this should have been going on in an NHS hospital in Wales. The scale of neglect and unprofessionalism uncovered is deeply troubling. ‘The Welsh Health Minister in Cardiff needs to get a grip on this and ensure that failings like this simply cannot happen again in Wales. The people of Wales deserve the very best of the NHS.’ The expose is the latest in a series of scandals concerning the appalling treatment of dementia patients in which clandestine recordings have been used to reveal the truth. Until now, most have involved care homes, some of which are run privately. The Glan Clwyd scandal is the first major dementia expose in an NHS hospital where a hidden camera has been involved. It comes a week after health watchdogs the Care Quality Commission said nine in ten care homes and hospitals in the UK fail dementia patients. A separate CQC report on Friday said that four in ten NHS hospitals were unsafe. The new scandal centres on the Tawel Fan dementia ward of the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales . A long-term Mail on Sunday investigation into Glan Clwyd provides new, and arguably the most graphic evidence of the appalling – and in some cases fatal – abuse of vulnerable elderly people in the NHS. Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb last night called on the Labour-run Welsh Government, which runs hospitals in the Principality to ‘get a grip' The key role played by the mobile phone recording will intensify a growing debate about the use of hidden cameras to protect people in hospitals and old people’s homes. The CQC said last week it plans guidelines for relatives who want to use them spy on NHS staff. The Glan Clwyd camera, smuggled in after complaints of abuse had been brushed aside, recorded a nurses’ shift ‘handover’ meeting, where the new shift is briefed on patients, and developments or incidents. The secret recording shows foul-mouthed nurses treating patients and relatives with contempt. One shouted: ‘Don’t you f***ing dare’ at an agitated elderly man. Others referred to a patient having a ‘f*** of a bruise’ and his ‘whole a*** cheek’ being swollen. Another said a patient’s wife ‘doesn’t give two f***s. I spent hours managing [her husband’s] pain.’ One female nurse talked of ‘shagging’. The independent report says the recording shows staff displayed a ‘lack of compassionate care, used coarse language extensively and were completely unprofessional in their attitude to and description of vulnerable patients.’ Saying ‘don’t you f***ing dare’ to a patient was unjustified aggression. When the nurses found out about the secret recording, they glibly expressed their outrage on open Facebook pages and in text messages, claiming their ‘human rights’ had been breached. The report says one male patient had ‘a painful and swollen elbow due to constantly crawling on dirty floors where other patients had urinated and had their bowels opened.’ Nurses laughed at the daughter of that patient when he choked on ice cream. The daughter says in the report: ‘I said, “Oh my god, he’s choking.” The response was, “Don’t be so bloody silly, tell your daughter she’s being stupid.” The patient was moved to a nursing home but the report suggests the hospital’s failure to treat his problem with swallowing, or tell the nursing home about it, may have been fatal. He died shortly after arriving in the home and the death is the subject of an investigation. A grief-stricken relative said: ‘It’s too late for our brother, but while I have breath in my body I will fight to stop anyone else suffering the way he did on that ward.’ Many relatives complained patients were covered in urine and faeces – and that staff refused to wash them. One said: ‘I told a senior nurse staff were mopping up urine off the floor with patients’ own towels. She said she’d come and speak to me, but she didn’t.’ Relatives of an incontinent woman said: ‘She was frequently very smelly – we constantly asked why wasn’t she bathed daily – they said they were too busy.’ Another family said the smell of their relative was ‘so horrendous we couldn’t sit by him. We asked them to wash him and they brought him back with faeces down his leg. We had to get baby wipes and do it ourselves.’ The British Medical Association warned last month that the NHS in Wales faced ‘imminent meltdown’ Two daughters were horrified to find their father naked on the floor, having slipped on a pool of urine. A daughter was shocked to find her father with his ‘head cut and a flap of skin hanging down.’ She said: ‘I was told it had been caused by dad banging his head against a wall with his glasses on.’ One visitor reported a patient ‘wandering around the garden with her bottom on display,’ adding: ‘When I informed two nurses sitting in the TV lounge, they did not look at me or speak.’ Another relative said: ‘As the number of patients went up, fractures, black and blue faces, arms and legs went up.’ A nurse recalls seeing a patient ‘slapped’ by a colleague – as other staff turned a blind eye. Senior medics tried to cover it up. An NHS whistleblower said a senior doctor barked at her: ‘I don’t want any more complaints landing on the desk, you know what I mean?” After a heated row, the whistleblower made a formal complaint – and was accused of ‘overreacting.’ The report concludes: ‘The culture on the ward resulted in institutional abuse.' BMA: NHS in Wales faces ‘meltdown’ The British Medical Association (BMA) warned last month that the NHS in Wales faced ‘imminent meltdown’ costing patients’ lives, with waiting times at record levels, death rates outstripping the rest of the UK and ambulance and GP services in crisis. The health service in Wales is separate from NHS England and is run by the Labour-controlled Welsh Assembly, which has been accused of making cuts of £500million. The BMA called for an urgent independent inquiry after it emerged that the service has failed to meet A&E waiting targets for the last five years, while waiting times for cancer treatment are far longer than in England. In August, more than 1,000 patients had to wait at least 12 hours to be seen by a doctor in A&E, up 25 per cent in a month. The BMA’s Dr Phil Banfield said: ‘The NHS in Wales is facing imminent meltdown. It is time for an urgent independent review.’ A Welsh Assembly spokesman denied the ‘meltdown’ claim and said: ‘The majority of people receive excellent care.’","Elderly patients at an NHS hospital in Rhyl were left covered in faeces .

"Ed Miliband was criticised last night for failing to stop a ‘petty and spiteful’ bid by Labour chiefs to sack veteran MP Ann Clwyd after she spoke out against the Labour-run Welsh health service. Party officials secretly decided last week to force 75-year-old Ms Clwyd to take part in a ‘Labour beauty contest’ merely to win the right to stand at next year’s General Election in the South Wales seat she has held for 30 years. The move follows Labour anger with Ms Clwyd for demanding reform to the NHS in Wales, controlled by the Labour-dominated Welsh Assembly. Ann Clwyd pictured with her husband Owen. He died in a Cardiff hospital in 2012, with Ms Clwyd claiming he was 'left to die like a battery hen' She claimed her husband was left ‘to die like a battery hen’ in a Cardiff hospital in 2012. Ms Clwyd announced in February, following an illness, that she intended to stand down as Cynon Valley MP. Labour chiefs imposed an all-women shortlist, provoking fury in her local party which threatened to ‘go on strike’ and refuse to pick a successor. After recovering from her illness, and being urged locally to stay on, Ms Clwyd said in July she had changed her mind and planned to carry on as an MP. It was expected she would be allowed to contest her seat like other sitting MPs – without facing a challenge. But Labour’s ruling national executive decided last week that she will have to enter an all-women selection contest – just like a novice candidate. Labour leader Ed Miliband has been criticised for failing to stop Ms Clwyd for having to face a contest to merely win the right to stand at the next election . A fellow MP said: ‘This has the hallmarks of a petty and spiteful act and it is hard to imagine it is not connected to Ann’s courageous stand on the NHS in Wales. 'Senior figures are annoyed because they wanted the all-women shortlist to get a new young Labour woman candidate.’ Ms Clwyd said nurses showed ‘resentment, indifference and even contempt’ towards her husband Owen Roberts, who died of hospital-acquired pneumonia in 2012, aged 73. But her calls to improve the Welsh NHS prompted a fierce counter-attack from her party. Labour last night denied she was being punished, saying: ‘Everybody in Labour has great respect for Ann. 'Nevertheless, established procedures dictate that the selection will go ahead as an all-women shortlist.’","MP Ann Clywd spoke out against the Labour-run Welsh health service .

"Until 12 days before the referendum, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg were all convinced victory for the Union was a foregone conclusion. With good reason, it appeared. Historically, breaking from the UK has rarely been supported by much more than a third of people in Scotland. Even as the debate hotted up this year, for all Alex Salmond’s bluster he did not seem to be gaining much ground. Scroll down for video . The YouGov poll was published by The Sunday Times, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch who tweeted that the survey showed 'everything [was] up for grabs' in the independence referendum . In nearly 100 opinion polls conducted from January to the day of the referendum, only three showed a lead for the ‘Yes’ camp. The organisers of two admitted to unintended errors. The third, conducted by influential pollsters YouGov on September 6, and published by The Sunday Times, owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, caused a sensation. It claimed the ‘Yes’ camp had surged into the lead on 51, with ‘No’ on 49, a two-point lead. Gleeful Mr Murdoch seized on it to pile pressure on Cameron and Miliband, boasting on Twitter that his ‘reliable independence poll will shock Britain and more – everything up for grabs’. He also tweeted: ‘Scottish independence means huge black eye for Cameron and Miliband.’ YouGov’s two-point lead for Scottish nationalists convinced the SNP that they were on the verge of a historic breakthrough – and caused a nervous breakdown in Westminster. Cameron, Miliband and Clegg had seen support for independence creep up in the last few weeks of the campaign, but believed it was too little too late. The poll turned all that upside down. The three party leaders were gripped with terror that the unthinkable was about to happen: the UK was about to be broken up. They would all probably resign in shame and a place would be found in the history books for Cameron next to Lord North – PM when Britain lost America. So they did what politicians do in a crisis – panicked and threw money at it. Dave and Red Ed called off their weekly joust in Prime Minister’s Questions and, Clegg in tow, scurried north to rally the pro-Union vote. Just three days before D-Day they vowed to extend the Barnett formula, whereby Scots get £1,600 per head more from taxpayers than people in England, worth £4.5 billion a year, or £45 billion over the next decade. So much for ‘austerity Britain’. And for good measure they promised more home rule for Scotland – without bothering to consult anybody. Cynics called it a bribe. The three party leaders rushed to Scotland to give speeches after the shock poll, including Ed Miliband who was hounded out of a shopping centre . Yet, when the referendum result was announced, it appeared they needn’t have worried after all. If the ‘No’ camp had won by a whisker, Cameron and co could have claimed their last-minute offer made all the difference. Instead the ‘No’ camp won by an overwhelming ten-point margin, a 12-point turnaround from the YouGov poll 12 days earlier. It led some to ask if it was a ‘rogue poll’. One day before the referendum a YouGov poll showed the ‘No’ camp back in the lead by two points. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by YouGov. All opinion polls are subject to a margin of error and, unlike for general elections, polling companies did not have past results to help refine their results. YouGov president Peter Kellner defended the survey which showed the ‘Yes’ camp ahead by two. ‘It was not a rogue poll,’ he said. ‘There was a whole series of polls following ours showing it was neck and neck, 50-50 plus or minus one.'","YouGov poll for The Sunday Times put 'Yes' campaign two points ahead .

"Ed Miliband faced embarrassment on the first day of the Labour conference when the roof fell in on his pledge to solve Britain’s housing crisis. The Labour leader vowed to ensure 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020 if he becomes Prime Minister. But Jennie Formby, the political director of Britain’s biggest union Unite, appeared to suggest it could be a con. Anyone who assumed it meant a million homes would be built from 2015 to 2020 could be disappointed, she warned, . Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband delivering his keynote speech at the Labour party conference, where he vowed to ensure 200,00 new homes a year would be built by 2020 if elected . ‘It’s not actually a promise to build a million homes,’ she said. ‘It’s a promise to be building 200,000 homes a year by the end of the government, which means it could be five or ten homes a year and then 200,000 in the last year.’ Ms Formby – revealed last year as the mother of Unite leader Len McCluskey’s love child – said her union needed to flex its muscles to make sure Mr Miliband delivered on such promises. She made the remarks at the Trades Union Congress earlier this month. At the fringe meeting, she boasted about the growing stranglehold unions have over Mr Miliband. Ms Formby, 54, a member of Labour’s ruling national executive who earns £75,000 a year from Unite – whose members include construction workers – said the Labour leader should give in to a ‘whole list of demands and things we need to have’ if he wanted to win the next Election. She also: . Mr McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, was married when Ms Formby had his son in 1991. Although their relationship did not endure, she now works as his right-hand woman. Ms Formby told a fringe meeting at the TUC Conference: ‘If Labour forms the next government, our strength [and] influence is going to increase.’ The union would force Mr Miliband to back a ‘radical’ economic policy, she added, saying: ‘We’re not going to win an Election by saying to people “we’re going to deliver on austerity in a slightly nicer way than the Tories.”’ Jennie Formby, from the Unite union, who suggested Mr Miliband's pledge could be a con . Of Mr Miliband, she said: ‘For all his faults, and perhaps the way he comes over sometimes, he is not Tony Blair. He’s absolutely not Tony Blair. He’s someone we feel we can work with.’ And she appeared to cast doubt on whether the party intended to carry out some of its policy pledges, saying: ‘If you look at a lot of Labour’s commitments, if they’re genuine [and] we deliver them,’ adding witheringly, ‘perhaps I should say if we deliver them... ‘If we’re going to deliver a Labour government with solid backing from trade unions… there’s a whole list of demands and things we need to have. Len’s set out his vision on many occasions.’ Unite helped Mr Miliband become Labour leader in 2010 and has since given the party more than £8 million. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Even Ed Miliband’s trade union bosses think his house building gimmick is nothing but another empty promise. Labour has no long-term plan for Britain’s future. ‘Labour’s trade union barons have steamrolled over Ed Miliband. They pick the policies, choose the candidates and bought the leader.’ A Unite spokesman said: ‘Nothing said at that meeting is out of kilter with the views of the majority of families in the UK today who are demanding new homes, secure employment, and better living standards. ‘That is what we support, that is what Ed Milliband is offering and that is what we believe the voters of the country will chose in May.’ A spokesman for Mr Miliband declined to comment.","Labour leader vowed to ensure 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020 .

"John Bercow is to fly out on a £6,000 taxpayer-funded trip to Australia, where he is expected to have secret talks with his controversial choice as the new Commons chief. The disclosure came as the Commons Speaker faced a growing all-party revolt over his plan to appoint Australian parliament official Carol Mills as the £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk, responsible for vital constitutional matters. Defiant Mr Bercow will have crisis talks with Commons Leader William Hague tomorrow after returning from holiday in Turkey, then make an emergency statement to Parliament on the issue. Scroll down for video . Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercowis at the centre of an increasing row over his determination to appoint an Australian to the important post of Commons Clerk . He is expected to fly to Australia in the middle of next month. Senior MPs claim Mrs Mills, dubbed ‘the Canberra caterer’ because her responsibilities at the Australian senate include managing kitchens and cleaning, is too inexperienced, and say Mr Bercow plans to use her appointment to grab more power for himself. He has been warned by close allies that he could be ejected from the Speaker’s chair if he refuses to back down and scrap the proposal. Mrs Mills has made it clear that she has no intention of withdrawing from her proposed £200,000-a-year job . Well-placed sources say Mrs Mills has made it clear that she has no intention of withdrawing from her proposed job. MPs have backed a demand by Tory grandee Bernard Jenkin, the chairman of the powerful Public Administration Committee, to quiz Mrs Mills before her appointment is approved by No 10 and Buckingham Palace. Initially, Mr Bercow dismissed the revolt as the latest attempt by his Tory critics to unseat him. But the rebels have gained strong support from senior Labour figures including Jack Straw, Margaret Beckett, David Blunkett and Natascha Engel, the chairman of the influential Backbench Business Committee, as well as Lib Dem elder statesman Sir Alan Beith and former Speaker Baroness Boothroyd. Equally damaging, it is understood all three Deputy Speakers – Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo and Tory Eleanor Laing – are against Mrs Mills’s appointment. Mr Bercow has tried to defuse the row by suggesting the Commons Clerk’s job be split, with Mrs Mills becoming chief executive in a managerial role, and the Clerk’s job handed to a parliamentary expert. But critics have said he has no right to change the Clerk’s job without MPs’ permission – and say the extra £200,000-a-year salary would be a waste of public money. A spokesman for the Speaker tried to play down the row saying: ‘The Speaker is keen to listen to the views of MPs.’ She said his visit to Australia was planned a year ago and that Commonwealth visits to meet other Speakers were ‘an important element’ of his job. He will be accompanied by an aide. Think again, Mr Speaker. Your Aussie is patently not up to it says JESSE NORMAN, Tory MP . A disagreement over a new Clerk of the House of Commons? You might think politics doesn’t get any more petty or irrelevant than that. What could matter less when there is so much sickness and suffering in the world today? You would be wrong. The role of the Clerk dates back to the 14th Century and combines two crucial functions. The Clerk is, first and foremost, the principal constitutional and procedural adviser to the House of Commons, available to be consulted by any MP on any such matter, great or small. Parliamentary procedure is very complex; issues in the Commons often require an immediate decision, and such decisions affect everything from the air we breathe to peace and war. So it is obviously vital for MPs to have authoritative advice right on hand. As Parliament has expanded, so too has the Clerk’s job. Today the Clerk has a Management Board which runs an organisation of some 2,000 people, with a budget of £245 million. Black Rod David Leakey (left), outgoing Clerk Robert Rogers (centre) and Speaker John Bercow (right) But the constitutional role is primary. Sometimes the Clerk’s advice is unpalatable to governments or to Speakers, and so the Clerkship is protected by letters patent from the Monarch. Only Parliament itself can remove a Clerk. Ten days ago it became clear that a panel chaired by the Speaker, John Bercow, was proposing as a new Clerk someone who was patently not qualified for the job. The candidate, Carol Mills, is a senior official in the Australian Parliament. She may be an extremely effective administrator, but she has little or no expertise in British constitutional law and procedure. In the delicate words of Dr Rosemary Laing, the Clerk of the Australian Senate, ‘Carol comes from the state public service. It is not simple to move to serving Parliament if there is a lack of understanding of Parliament’. Yet the letter of nomination for Mrs Mills had already gone to Downing Street. Without rapid action it would be forwarded to Buckingham Palace, and approval would automatically follow. Last Wednesday I submitted a motion requiring MPs to be given the opportunity to scrutinise the appointment, co-sponsored by the Labour MP Natascha Engel. It has been signed by 84 MPs from across the political spectrum, including three former foreign secretaries, a former deputy leader of the Labour Party and six former ministers. It is framed in simple, neutral language: ‘The recommendation of Ms Carol Mills to be Clerk of this House should be subject to, and contingent upon, a pre-appointment hearing and report by a select committee.’ The motion was designed to be non-partisan, yet the reaction has been highly surprising. So far there has not been any indication that Parliament will be given a say on this matter. Nor has the appointment of Ms Mills been withdrawn. Instead, it has been proposed that the role of Clerk should be split and a new Chief Executive (presumably Mrs Mills) be appointed as well. This effectively concedes that Mrs Mills is not qualified to be Clerk. But instead of dropping her and starting again, it puts the cart before the horse and proposes an on-the-hoof restructuring of the House, all, it seems, in order to accommodate her appointment. Not only that – it proposes a new role of Chief Executive at a probable cost of £150,000-£200,000. But the issues go beyond Mrs Mills herself, or the creation of a Chief Executive role. The whole appointment process has been seriously flawed. Key people, such as the Deputy Speaker, Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle, were not included. The process was delayed by internal disagreements, and but for the intervention of MPs last week, would have been completed when MPs were on holiday. Headhunters were used for the first time – doubtless at some cost – yet selected a candidate who did not even meet the basic job description set out in the original advertisement. And it is far from clear how they could have recommended a candidate who was, and remains, under investigation in Australia for maladministration. But there is still a deeper issue. Mr Bercow was elected after his predecessor Michael Martin lost a vote of no confidence – an extraordinarily rare and damaging event for the Speaker. If it is allowed to drag on, the appointment of Ms Mills has the potential to cause new damage to the office of Speaker, and so to the House of Commons. Tomorrow Mr Bercow is to make a statement in the Commons on this issue. We must hope he will move swiftly to end that appointment, reaffirm the importance of due process in the selection of public officials, and put the wider issue of the Clerkship before a special committee elected by MPs.","John Bercow will meet Commons leader William Hague tomorrow to discuss the crisis .

"Plans to strip British jihadis of their UK citizenship will be unveiled by David Cameron tomorrow . Draconian plans to strip British jihadis of their UK citizenship will be unveiled by David Cameron tomorrow. He will ban them from entering the UK, forcing them to stay in Iraq, Syria or other countries such as Turkey, from where many fly back to Britain. The Prime Minister will argue that they must be stripped of their passports – and their right to come back to the UK – because they could be plotting terrorist attacks. The move could land the Government in trouble with human rights judges, however. It is against international law to make an individual stateless – they can be stripped of their citizenship only if they have dual nationality. The Prime Minister intends to get round this by claiming the ban is temporary – and justified following a warning by intelligence chiefs that the risk of a major terrorist attack on the UK mainland is ‘severe.’ The tough response from No 10 comes a week after former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis and Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, called for similar action. Writing in The Mail on Sunday a week ago, Mr Davis poured scorn on Home Secretary Theresa May’s ‘limp’ plan to use anti-social behaviour orders to curb the risk posed by British jihadis. ‘Asbos for terrorists? It is hard to imagine ISIS killers quaking in their boots,’ he said. His comments were echoed by Lord Carey who, in a separate article, said Britons pursuing jihad in Iraq and Syria should be forced to give up their passports. London Mayor Boris Johnson and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe demanded similar measures. British intelligence officers believe at least 500 British citizens have travelled to Iraq and Syria to wage jihad. About half are thought to have returned, and some experts believe the number of British jihadis could be far higher. Turned away: Mr Cameron will ban them from entering the UK, forcing them to stay in Iraq, Syria or other countries such as Turkey. The move could land the Government in trouble with human rights judges, however . Mr Cameron has said he is determined to avoid ‘knee-jerk’ measures. However, he will also announce new plans to stop more young British Muslims joining IS by beefing up powers to strip them of their passports. Rules brought in by the Coalition last year have resulted in only 23 passports being removed. Downing Street sources have denied that there is a rift between Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who has resisted similar measures in the past on the grounds that they infringe civil liberties.

"Royal officials were accused of ‘insulting the war dead’ yesterday after installing a portable lavatory at a war memorial where a wreath from Prince Charles is on display. The ugly temporary lavatory and workmen’s canteen at the Commonwealth Memorial Gates – 100 yards from Buckingham Palace – provoked complaints from families who went there to pay their respects to family members who died in two world wars. The structure was put there by Royal Parks chiefs who say it is needed while repairs are carried out to the memorial – but they could not explain why the Armadillo portable lavatory was not placed a discreet distance away. The temporary toilet block has been placed beside the Commonwealth Memorial Gates in London . Wreaths from Prince Charles and other VIPs were laid at the memorial on Commonwealth Day earlier this year, and thousands of people from Commonwealth countries have visited the site in recent weeks to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. The memorial in Constitution Hill, by Hyde Park Corner, was unveiled by the Queen in 2002. Yesterday, Indian-born Baroness Shreela Flather – a friend of Margaret Thatcher – who led the campaign to raise the £2.5 million to build the memorial, said: ‘To put an eyesore on this memorial is an insult to the brave men and women from the Commonwealth who died for this country. ‘It is beyond belief that anyone should do this at any time, let alone so close to the commemoration of the First World War when this matter is so close to everyone’s hearts. It should be moved away where it does not desecrate this sacred and beautiful monument. I’m sure the Queen would be horrified if she knew about it.’ A Royal Parks spokesperson said they were conducted work at the site in advance of Remembrance Sunday . One Commonwealth visitor to the memorial told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I was very disappointed to see a portable toilet at the memorial. It is very disrespectful. I tried to complain about it but could not get through on the phone.’ Another said: ‘I just don’t understand why anyone would build a wonderful memorial like this and then spoil it so thoughtlessly. There is plenty of grass in the park to the side of the memorial. If they had a little sensitivity, they would have put it there. It’s the product of the jobsworth mentality.’ Hours after The Mail on Sunday contacted the Royal Parks, officials made an apology and a team of workmen was sent to ‘smarten up’ the temporary fixture. A Royal Parks spokesman said yesterday: ‘We are sorry and are trying to make the works more in keeping with the park and memorial. There are workmen down at the site at the moment making sure that the repairs are more in keeping with the memorial.’ The spokesman said the repairs were needed to make the site ‘look its best’ for Remembrance Sunday celebrations in November. The Memorial Gates commemorate the five million people from the former British Empire, including the Indian subcontinent, Africa and the Caribbean, who fought for Britain in the two world wars. It lists the names of the 74 Commonwealth volunteers who were awarded the Victoria Cross or George Cross in the conflicts.","The toilet has been situated just 100 yards from Buckingham Palace .

"A man has been charged with religiously aggravated assault after an attack that left outspoken MP George Galloway with a broken rib. The Respect Party MP also suffered a badly bruised face after he was assaulted in the street by a man who appeared to have taken exception to his controversial comments about Israel. Writing in The Mail on Sunday, the politician said he feared for his life when he was attacked in Notting Hill, West London, in broad daylight on Friday. And he called for police protection in future. A man has been charged with religiously aggravated assault after an attack that left outspoken MP George Galloway with a broken rib. Right, Neil Masterson as seen on Facebook and, left, Mr Galloway after the assault . Neil Masterson, 39, of Campden Hill, West London, will appear at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court tomorrow charged with attacking Mr Galloway and a man in his 40s who came to the MP’s aid. Last night, it emerged that a man of the same name made threats about Mr Galloway on Facebook hours before the incident. An account in that name carries a series of comments and abusive remarks about Muslims as well as claims that Galloway is anti-Semitic. The account holder ‘shared’ a picture of the politician, branding him a ‘snake’ and captioned: ‘Galloway is a Hamas and IRA supporter.’ Scene of the crime: Mr Galloway was attacked in Golborne Road (pictured) in Notting Hill, West London . The account holder commented, just hours before the attack: ‘I’d cut his throat myself if I’d dare stoop to the required level.’ He added: ‘Virulent antisemite of the worst kind. Doesn’t even have the gut [sic] to admit it. Drone’ Mr Galloway was posing for photographs when his attacker rushed across the street and assaulted him, swearing and shouting about the Holocaust. Tweet: The Respect Party tweeted this with the picture of a battered and bruised Mr  Galloway after the assault . The Bradford West MP received treatment at nearby St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. Mr Galloway was interviewed under caution by police earlier this month after he said in a speech that Bradford had been ‘declared an Israel-free zone’ and urged people to reject all Israeli goods, services, academics and tourists. 'I crashed to the ground thinking... this man is going to kick me to death': George Galloway reveals his terror after attack in Notting Hill - and how he led police to suspect . By GEORGE GALLOWAY . I was walking down the street in Notting Hill in broad daylight and getting into my car when two Moroccan guys approached me. One of them said he was leaving Britain the next day and would love a photo with me for his cafe back home. I stood in the road shaking hands with him as his friend took a picture. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a man powering towards me like a bat out of hell. Politician: George Galloway was left with a broken rib and bruising when he was assaulted by a man in street . He laid into me and was effing and blinding about the Holocaust. He looked like the type who works out and moved very fast. He punched me so many times I kept thinking, ‘When is this going to stop?’ But it didn’t. I went into what boxers call ‘peekaboo style’ like American heavyweight Floyd Patterson when he fought Muhammad Ali, covering my face and eyes. He got frustrated his punches weren’t getting through and kicked me back towards the kerb. I lost my footing and staggered backwards, crashing into a grille on a Moroccan delicatessen I had eaten at a few hours earlier. I was on the ground thinking ‘this man is going to kick me to death’. He was so enraged he got on top of me and eventually landed a haymaker right on my jaw. I felt a terrible crack and sickening thud. It went on for about three minutes – a long time when punches are raining down on you. Luckily, the two Moroccan guys pulled him off. My attacker calmly walked across the road and I drove up the road behind him. I was in a bad way but I was determined he wouldn’t get away with it. I called 999 and described him to police. He knew I was behind him. I slowed down and the police told me to stop following him. I pulled the car over and saw him go down a side street. While I was talking to the police, he reappeared and walked over to a bus stop. At this point a police van hurtled round the corner with four police officers in it. Three were women. It was like Cagney and Lacey. I shouted, ‘He is getting on the No 23 bus’ and the police drove into the middle of the road to stop it. Street: The Respect Party MP said he has 'no idea' why the attack in Golborne Road (pictured) took place . The policewomen bravely piled on to the bus, and brought a man out with handcuffs on. I have no idea why it happened, though I suspect my attacker was a thug from an extreme Right-wing group. Regardless of his motives, I have no regrets about speaking out on issues like Israel and the Middle East. We live in a democracy, and as someone who has been elected as an MP on six occasions, I have a right to voice my opinions. And like other politicians who have suffered similar threats and attacks, I am entitled to receive a degree of protection from the State so I can continue to do so. Even though I have just turned 60 years old, I am slightly ashamed to admit that I didn’t land a single blow. But I am not ready to stop fighting for what I believe in yet.

"The Prime Minister was yesterday accused of preventing his deputy from cracking down on moves to open pubs on motorways. Nick Clegg is backing a move by Liberal Democrat Home Office Minister Norman Baker to close a loophole in the law which allows pubs on some major routes. But Lib Dem sources say David Cameron is vetoing the measure – even though Home Secretary Theresa May and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin have given it the green light. David Cameron has been accused of blocking moves to stop pubs from opening on major routes, like the Weatherspoon pub on the M40 in Buckinghamshire . JD Wetherspoon opened the first motorway pub at Beaconsfield services on the M40 in Buckinghamshire in January and it is believed more are planned by other companies. As the Minister responsible for alcohol, Mr Baker is determined to stop them, but Lib Dem sources say No 10 has indicated it will veto the plan. Mr Baker told The Mail on Sunday yesterday: ‘We have made good strides over the years in tackling drink- driving, but we can’t afford  to send out a message that implies drinking and driving is in any way acceptable. ‘Legislation introduced in 2003 was meant to ban pubs on the motorway network, but it doesn’t affect private land. ‘This anomaly was highlighted by the heavily criticised decision of JD Wetherspoon to open a pub on the M40. I am keen to close this loophole, but it is being blocked by Conservatives at the centre of Government.’ A Lib Dem source said: ‘It has been made clear to us that Cameron will not allow this. Liberal Democrat Home Office Minister Norman Baker wants to close a loophole in the law which allows pubs to open on major routes . ‘His intervention seems extraordinary after neither May nor McLoughlin ex-pressed any opposition. ‘It is well known that the drinks companies have been long-time supporters and donors to the Conservative Party. Road safety is far  more important.’ JD Wetherspoon’s decision to open the Hope and Champion pub was attacked by road safety charity Brake. It said motorway pubs were a ‘dangerous temptation’ for drivers, while the RAC claims surveys show motorists are against them. However, others said it was no different from pubs on main roads. Last month, the prospect of a network of motorway pubs appeared to move closer when roadside services chain Roadchef, which runs services at 20 sites, said it was considering launching its own pub. A spokesman for JD Wetherspoon said that although sales at the Hope and Champion were strong, alcohol accounted for less than 20 per cent of takings. He added there were no current plans to open more. In April, the Prime Minister over-ruled Mr Baker’s plan to refuse to let pubs stay open late so drinkers could watch England’s World Cup match against Italy.","David Cameron's move has been described as 'extraordinary'

"Commons speaker John Bercow, right, with his wife Sally has been criticised over his plan to appoint Carol Mills as £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk . The man who led John Bercow’s campaign to be Speaker has warned him he could lose his job over his controversial plan to give Parliament’s top job to an inexperienced Australian woman. Senior Conservative MP Charles Walker told Mr Bercow he must give in to demands for MPs to quiz Australian official Carol Mills about allegations of misconduct before she is given the £200,000-a-year job of Commons Clerk. The move is a serious blow to Mr Bercow’s hopes of surviving the row. Mr Walker is a close personal and political ally of Mr Bercow and performed the traditional role of ‘dragging’ him to the Speaker’s chair when he was elected in 2009. The disclosure came as Mr Bercow launched a desperate attempt to save his career yesterday by promising to slash the powers of Ms Mills – before she has even started work. He said he would split the Commons Clerk into two, with a clerk in charge of advising MPs on constitutional and legal issues and a new chief executive role to take charge of parliamentary administration. It would pave the way for Ms Mills to become Commons chief executive – and keep her out of the Commons chamber. But senior MPs said it was ‘too little too late’, would saddle taxpayers with another six-figure salary – and vowed to carry on their campaign to defeat him and block Ms Mills. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This is a grubby compromise to get the Speaker out of a hole and it won’t wash.’ And Tory grandee Bernard Jenkin, who has led criticism of Mr Bercow over the issue, dismissed the job split plan, saying: ‘It does not clear the way for Ms Mills to be appointed Clerk – it just adds to the confusion and concern. The appointment process should be stopped and must go back to the drawing board.’ Mr Jenkin said if Mr Bercow refuses to back down, David Cameron should refuse to send Ms Mills’s appointment to Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s necessary approval. And Mr Jenkin insisted his powerful Public Affairs Administration Committee must have the right to interrogate Ms Mills, who is involved in an investigation into ‘spying’ at the Australian Senate in Canberra where she is head of the Department of Parliamentary Services. Last week's Mail on Sunday reported on the row behind John Bercow's attempted parliamentary power grab . Her role, which includes responsibility for catering and cleaning, has led to her being dubbed the ‘Canberra caterer’ by Westminster wags. The row over her appointment intensified last night after claims that a warning was ignored about ‘problems’ in Ms Mills’s record in Australia was ignored by the committee of MPs – headed by Bercow – that chose her. The warning is understood to have been flagged up in a report to MPs by a firm of headhunters dealing with the appointment. But an attempt by one MP to ask the headhunters – Saxton Bampfylde – for more details was brushed aside, a source said. He added: ‘It was obvious there was something in her background that needed to be checked thoroughly. Two members of the panel asked for the information but were told there wasn’t time and it wasn’t relevant. It would appear Bercow had decided he wanted Mills and did not want to hear anything against her. John Bercow wanted to appoint Australian Carol Mills, pictured to the £200,000-a-year Parliamentary post . ‘If the panel had asked for the details, they would have heard the full story over investigations into Ms Mills at the Australian Senate – and she would probably have been ruled out.’ Mr Bercow’s critics say Ms Mills is unfit to perform the Commons Clerk role because she has no experience of parliamentary procedure. Some claim he wants to take advantage of her lack of qualifications to grab more power for himself. The Speaker’s credibility took another knock with reports that all three of his Deputy Speakers, Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo and Tory Eleanor Laing, oppose Ms Mills’s appointment. Last night Bercow allies denied the headhunters’ advice was ignored and insisted Ms Mills herself had mentioned the two Senate inquiries.","John Bercow has been threatened with losing his job unless he backs down .

"It is the elite gentleman’s establishment whose members have included Beau Brummell, Winston Churchill and innumerable politicians and aristocrats. Now the historic Boodle’s Club is at the centre of an intrigue that has embroiled Ukip leader Nigel Farage, scandal-hit Tory MP Brooks Newmark and a peer accused of being a Government spy. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Mr Newmark, who resigned from the Commons last weekend for sending X-rated pictures of himself, met Mr Farage for lunch at Boodle’s in early July – at a time when the Ukip leader was trying to woo disaffected Tory MPs to his party. Scroll down for video . Food for thought: Brooks Newmark, left, and Nigel Farage, right, who met for lunch at Boodle's Club in early July . Despite the discreet venue, the pair were being watched: Mr Newmark, a Boodle’s member, had barely finished his meal at the 250-year-old club in St James’s, Central London, when he received a call from David Cameron’s Chief of Staff, Old Etonian Ed Llewellyn. Mr Llewellyn growled: ‘Brooks, you are very unwise to have lunch with Farage so close to a reshuffle.’ The nature of Mr Newmark’s exchanges with Mr Farage and Mr Llewellyn has remained private. But it was followed by a sudden – if short-lived – turnaround in Mr Newmark’s political fortunes. Just two weeks after they dined, Mr Newmark, a previously rebellious malcontent who was sacked from the Whips’ Office last year, received a surprise promotion to Minister for Civil Society. A number of disaffected Tory MPs suspected of ‘flirting’ with Ukip have been subject to a No 10 charm offensive, including offers of career advancement designed to stop them from joining Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless in defecting. Last night Mr Farage declined to reveal the content of his discussion with Mr Newmark. He said: ‘I meet a lot of MPs.’ So how did No 10 find out about the Newmark-Farage summit? Boodle's Gentleman's club in St James, central London, is now at the centre of the scandal involving Farage . Friends of Mr Newmark accused the moustachioed Tory peer Lord Lexden, who was also dining at Boodle’s that day, of ‘grassing him up’ to Downing Street. Lord Lexden, 69, a veteran Tory fixer and official historian of the Conservative Party, is a long-term ally of Mr Llewellyn. Last night the peer admitted: ‘It was indeed brought to my attention that Mr Farage and Mr Newmark were having lunch together across the room. But I am an old-fashioned gentleman who doesn’t carry a mobile phone, so it would have been impossible for me to have tipped off Downing Street within that timeframe. ‘I do know Mr Llewellyn, or rather Ed as I prefer to call him, but I didn’t tell him about the lunch. Not guilty!’ Boodle’s was founded in 1762 by the future Prime Minister Lord Shelburne and named after original head waiter Edward Boodle. It was the model for ‘Blades’ in the James Bond books, written by club member Ian Fleming, while other members have included economist Adam Smith, anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce and actor David Niven. Mr Newmark, 56, was handed his new ministerial responsibility on July 15; the day before he made the catastrophic decision to send a semi-naked self-portrait, while clad in Paisley pyjamas, to an undercover male reporter posing as a blonde PR girl. When the story emerged on the first day of last month’s Conservative Party Conference – the same day as Mr Reckless’s defection – Mr Newmark resigned his ministerial post. Last weekend he announced that he would also be quitting the Commons at the next Election after it emerged that he had sent other naked ‘selfies’ to a woman with whom he had been having an affair. He wrote in The Mail on Sunday of ‘battling demons’. Ukip will target Mr Newmark’s Braintree seat, in its Essex heartland, hoping that the scandalous nature of the MP’s downfall will swell the party’s support. Mr Newmark declined to comment last night.","250-year-old Boodle's Club - elite gentleman's club - is at centre of intrigue .

"Former Culture Secretary Maria Miller said more needed to be done to tackle the 'epidemic' of consensual 'sexting' between children . A law banning 'revenge porn' should be accompanied by a crackdown on teenagers trading naked pictures, former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller has said. She welcomed plans to make the malicious distribution of private sexual images a specific offence for the first time – but said more needed to be done to tackle the 'epidemic' of consensual 'sexting' between children as young as ten. Approximately four in ten children regularly swap sexual images on services such as Snapchat and Whatsapp. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will today announce that under new rules in the Criminal Justice Bill going through the House of Lords, those who share images of 'people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way'– without their consent – will face up to two years in prison. However, the new rules will not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. Mrs Miller, who resigned as Culture Secretary earlier this year, said schools could be obliged to raise the issue in class. She said: 'We need to ram home the message to young people that it is illegal, and should not be regarded as normal behaviour.' It was claimed yesterday that thousands of nude Snapchat messages had been hacked and posted online. Half of Snapchat users are between 13 and 17, and many of the leaked images could be of underage children. Mr Grayling's move on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions. The vast majority of victims are female, such as Hannah Thompson, who was labelled a 'whore' on naked pictures placed on the Tumblr site by an ex-lover. The popstar Tulisa Contostavlos was also burned by the spiteful craze when a former boyfriend released a video of her performing a sex act. Mr Grayling said: 'We want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side and will do everything we can to bring offenders to justice.'

"Taxpayers are having to foot a £36,000 bill from the headhunters who secured the services of incoming BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead, it has emerged. The money was paid to executive search firm Saxton Bampfylde – which employs the wife of the BBC’s Director-General, Tony Hall – to ‘define the scope of the role and identify the best candidates’. The bill, which represents just under a third of the £110,000 salary Mrs Fairhead will be paid for a three- to four-day week, was described last night by one MP on the Commons Media Select Committee as a ‘ridiculous waste of money’. £36,000 was paid to executive search firm Saxton Bampfylde – which employs the wife of the BBC’s Director-General, Tony Hall – to headhunt the BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead (right) Mrs Fairhead was grilled by the committee last week, during which MPs quizzed her on her controversial business career, including the role she performed at HSBC when the bank faced a Mexican money-laundering scandal. She was also asked about her ownership of £5million of shares in Pearson, which has a long-standing contract with a BBC-owned company to produce educational products including books. She said she would sell the shares if there was perceived to be a conflict of interest. Separately, Government sources have told The Mail on Sunday they are ‘confident’ Mrs Fairhead will ‘address the problem of the BBC’s ingrained, institutional bias to the left’. With just eight months until the Election, it is understood that Mrs Fairhead has given private assurances that she both ‘understands the importance of impartiality and the perception of impartiality’. Mrs Fairhead will also lead the hugely sensitive negotiations over the renewal of the BBC’s Charter in 2016, while dealing with Government demands to reduce the Corporation’s reliance on the licence fee. MPs quizzed Rona Fairhead on her controversial business career, including the role she performed at HSBC when the bank faced a Mexican money-laundering scandal . Lord Hall’s wife Cynthia earns a six-figure salary at headhunters Saxton Bampfylde, which were also used by Speaker John Bercow as part of his controversial decision – currently stalled – to appoint Australian Carol Mills as the new Clerk of the Commons. Lord Hall, previously chief executive of the Royal Opera House, became Director-General in April 2013 on £450,000 a year. His wife is the former head of private girls’ school Wycombe Abbey and joined Saxton Bampfylde’s 18-strong team last year. The couple have two grown-up children. Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Media Select Committee, said: ‘This is a ridiculous waste of public money. Anyone who really wanted to apply for this job and who was suitable for it would have been aware of the vacancy anyway or would have seen it advertised in the newspaper and applied for it. ‘There only are a limited number of suitable candidates for a post like this. I can’t understand why it’s necessary to hire headhunters – and certainly not a firm which the BBC Director-General’s wife works for.’ A spokesman for the Culture Department said: ‘The Head of the BBC Trust needs to be a high- calibre and experienced person and specialist recruitment agencies help to select the very best candidates for the job.’ The department denies that the appointment of the headhunters risked a conflict of interest, saying Lady Hall was not involved in the recruitment of Mrs Fairhead.

"Allies of Vince Cable reacted furiously last night over a Liberal Democrat ‘whispering campaign’ suggesting that he is on the brink  of walking out of the Coalition. The Mail on Sunday has been told by two well-placed sources within the party that the 71-year-old Business Secretary is considering leaving the Cabinet immediately after the party’s autumn conference. One source close to leader Nick Clegg insisted: ‘He wants to step aside from the grind of office and take up an Election campaigning role in which he would woo back disaffected Lib Dems. Scroll down for video . 'Mischief': Vince Cable denies he is stepping down in October despite claims from within Clegg's party . ‘He would be replaced either by [Chief Secretary to the Treasury] Danny Alexander or [Scottish Secretary] Alistair Carmichael with [Employment Minister] Jo Swinson taking the remaining open Cabinet slot.’ The other source said: ‘He has just had enough. The fight has gone out of him.’ However, last night Mr Cable denounced the claims as ‘nonsense’ and insisted he would stick with  the Coalition right up to next year’s General Election. His spokeswoman said: ‘Vince  has already been reselected to  fight his Twickenham seat in May 2015 and he fully intends to serve out his term in Government as Business Secretary.’ However, Mr Clegg’s inner circle believe Mr Cable will step aside when the Deputy PM reshuffles his team in October – and might even drop plans to contest his seat. Doing a Hague? Many claim Cable will follow William Hague's example and step down in the next reshuffle . It has been billed as ‘doing a Hague’, after William Hague’s surprise move in the Tory reshuffle last month from Foreign Secretary to the lower-profile role of Commons Leader. Last night a former Lib Dem MP added to the reports by claiming even ‘friends’ of Mr Cable were suggesting he would stand down before the Election. The ex MP said: ‘The rumour that Vince may go is definitely circulating.’ An announcement is expected at October’s Glasgow conference that Mr Alexander will be the party’s economic spokesman next year – a move likely to anger Mr Cable, who performed the role during the last Election. The Business Secretary, still seen by some as a potential replacement for Mr Clegg, has had a famously fractious relationship with his leader. Just four months ago, Clegg loyalists were furious when long- time Cable ally Lord Oakeshott commissioned an opinion poll suggesting the party would pick  up votes in marginal seats if Mr Cable replaced Mr Clegg. And at last year’s party conference, Mr Cable infuriated the high command by suggesting it was ‘certainly possible’ the Coalition could break up before 2015 and by defying the leader’s calls to back the Government’s economic policy. But Mr Cable’s allies angrily blamed the reports on a ‘whispering campaign’ designed to undermine the Business Secretary. One said: ‘There has been no mention  of Vince packing it in. Whoever’s putting this around is simply out to make mischief.’ Another said: ‘He’s already been reselected to fight Twickenham and there’s no suggestion at all  that he won’t.’ Mr Clegg’s office also denied any suggestion that Mr Cable would quit. The row comes with the Lib Dems polling under ten per cent in one recent survey and facing a huge battle to hold on to many of their  57 seats next year.","Well-placed sources revealed 71-year-old Business Secretary plans exit .

"David Cameron today issues a passionate call for households around the UK to fly the Scottish flag to show their backing for a No vote in Thursday’s historic referendum. With just four days to go until the crunch vote – and with the polls neck and neck – the Prime Minister called on families across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to put the Saltire in their windows in support of the Union. Mr Cameron’s rallying cry came as a new poll published yesterday put the No vote eight points ahead. According to Survation, in a poll commissioned by the Union camp, the No vote is running at 54 per cent while Yes is on 46 per cent. Scroll down for video . Getting passionate: With just four days until the crunch vote, David Cameron is calling for people to show public support for the union . However, former Chancellor Alistair Darling, the leader of the pro-union campaign, reminded nervous supporters that more than 500,000 people who were eligible to cast their ballot had not yet made up their minds. Mr Darling said: ‘The situation is fluid. If we vote to leave by one vote there is no going back. We will have bought a one-way ticket.’ His warning seemed prescient last night as Downing Street was shaken by an ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph which put Yes on 54 per cent and No on 46 – though polling experts warned that the small survey size of 700 meant that it was vulnerable to a ‘sampling error’. An Opinium poll for The Observer put No on 53 and Yes on 47. In his interview, Mr Cameron said the vote was ‘going down to the wire’ and he hoped a final lovebombing from around the UK could persuade the undecideds to vote No. Describing the contest as ‘nerve-racking’, he said: ‘There are lots of things [people could do] whether it is using social media, tweeting and blogging your support for the UK; whether it is phoning a friend, talking to relations or work colleagues who live in Scotland and have a vote. He wants families across England, Wales and Northern Ireland to put the Saltire in their windows . ‘Or whether it is more visual demonstrations – hoisting the Saltire over buildings, putting a flag in your window – there are any number of things people should do.’ However, as Mr Cameron was urging support for the union, a Mail On Sunday poll of voters south of the border was pointing to a growing backlash against the idea of granting extra powers to the Scots to persuade them to vote No. The ‘devo-max’ cross-party deal, including scope for Scotland to set its own taxes, was hastily brokered by Gordon Brown last week after a poll put the Yes camp ahead. The new poll found that 43 per cent of English and Welsh think the move was a ‘panic measure’, while 61 per cent object to the fact that Scotland already receives the highest level of per-head public spending in the UK. Just 12 per cent think that Westminster should bail out an independent Scotland if it runs into financial trouble. The knife-edge final days of the campaign have contributed to party turmoil for both Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband. One senior Tory MP confided to this newspaper that a ‘clear majority’ of Conservative MPs expected Mr Cameron to resign if the Scots vote for separation, and that his leadership could still be in trouble if the pro-union camp prevails on Thursday. The MP, who holds an executive position on the party’s powerful backbench 1922 Committee, said the rushed agreement to give the Scots greater devolution even if they voted to stay had annoyed rank and file MPs. He said: ‘More than 50 per cent of the Parliamentary party think the PM should go if he loses. But there is also an iceberg contingent who will be restless if we win, because we have promised too much – and let Gordon Brown lead the way.’ He explained: ‘A few MPs are very visibly complaining, but an awful lot more are grumbling out of sight.’ Mr Miliband is facing internal ructions over Mr Brown’s promise of enhanced devolution powers, with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls complaining during a tumultuous Shadow Cabinet meeting that he was ‘out of the loop’ on the offer – and warned it could prevent a future Labour Government from ever passing a Westminster Budget if Scottish MPs were barred from voting. The Mail on Sunday poll highlights how much is at stake for the Labour leader. Survation found that across the UK, Labour’s support is running at 35 per cent – a lead of four per cent over the Conservatives – enough to give Mr Milband a Commons majority of 44 if a General Election was held tomorrow. If Scotland was excluded, Labour would be one point ahead, on 34 per cent, and Mr Miliband’s majority would be slashed to just nine seats. During his interview, Mr Cameron insisted that the devo max plan in the aftermath of a No vote would be the final ‘resting place’ of devolution, and it would put an end to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond’s campaign. The PM said: ‘The UK is not indifferent, you hear lots of concerns about what it means for them, what it means for our standing, what the consequences would be. More than anything else from the rest of the UK you get arguments of passion rather than arguments about detail, which I hope shows everybody knows how much we care about the UK. 'Scratch an Englishman and you don’t have to go very deep until you find an absolute passionate Briton and someone who believes in the UK.’ The Mail on Sunday poll also found that the referendum campaign has stimulated support for an English Parliament, with 47 per cent backing the measure and just nine per cent opposed. It also showed strong support for a guarded border between England and Scotland if Mr Salmond signed up to the Schengen agreement, the EU’s open-borders programme. The Prime Minister will try to push home the No camp’s advantage tomorrow with a major speech in which he is expected to pay tribute to Scotland as ‘a proud, strong, successful nation’ and hail ‘the patriotic vision of a strong Scottish nation allied to the rest of the UK.’ Responding to the eight-point poll lead for the No camp, Mr Salmond said: ‘I think it is wrong because I think there is huge movement – and the movement is towards Yes. ‘We’ve had over the last week panic, heeby-jeebies from Downing Street. The Yes campaign is going to win this campaign, and win it well.’ Balls: Brown’s transfer of tax-raising powers would be a nightmare . Taxing question: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls . Ed Balls has raised fears that handing massive new tax-raising powers to Scotland – as suggested by Gordon Brown – could mean big trouble for a future Labour government. The Shadow Chancellor privately warned that Scottish Labour MPs might have to be banned from voting on budgets for England and Wales if Edinburgh gained control of income tax North of the border.And that could leave a Labour government at Westminster unable to pass finance legislation for the rest of the UK. Mr Balls’s concerns came amid predictions that Labour leader Ed Miliband will be ‘fatally wounded’ if Labour supporters in Scotland vote ‘yes’ on Thursday. A rapid timetable to hand Scotland sweeping new powers over income tax rates and finance in the event of a ‘no’ vote was unveiled by ex-Prime Minister Mr Brown last week in a surprise bid to reduce the likelihood of an independent Scotland. But at a behind-closed-doors meeting of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet held the following day, Mr Balls warned of grave implications for an incoming Labour government if Mr Brown’s plan went ahead. Mr Balls said: ‘If we give away the whole tax-raising power to the Scottish Parliament, how can Scottish Labour MPs then vote for a Labour Budget in England?’ Currently, 40 of the 59 Scottish MPs are Labour, with pollsters predicting Mr Miliband will need a sizeable Scottish contingent at Westminster to form a government with a workable Commons majority after the General Election next May. A witness at the meeting said: ‘It was clear what Balls was saying. ‘He was wondering out loud how we would get Budgets passed at Westminster without Scottish Labour votes. It’d be a nightmare.’ Mr Miliband had no answer to his Shadow Chancellor’s concerns, according to reports. Last night, senior Labour figures said there was mounting anger over Mr Miliband’s ‘failure’ to energise the vital Scottish Labour vote to come out against independence. One said: ‘If Miliband’s been unable to deliver Labour voters in Scotland – and the figures point to that – it’s another nail in the coffin for the party as a whole. ‘There would be a major debate about the leadership of our party.’","David Cameron said  'nerve-racking' vote was 'going down to the wire'

"Energy Secretary Ed Davey is dodging his own green taxes – by switching his gas and electricity supplier to a company exempt from the charges slapped on domestic bills. The Cabinet Minister is now spared from paying the average £112-a-year ‘green duty’ added to most domestic bills after he moved his account to a firm that does not have to pay it. Last night, a senior Tory MP accused Lib Dem Mr Davey of ‘tax avoidance’ by ‘finding a way’ to escape the levies. Ed Davey is now spared from paying the average £112-a-year ‘green duty’ added to most domestic bills after he moved his account to a firm that does not have to pay it . The Mail on Sunday has highlighted the rocketing cost of the UK’s green commitments, which include cutting the power industry’s CO2 emissions by 90 per cent by 2030 and tripling the proportion of power generated from wind, solar and ‘biomass’ sources. Experts say the plan will cost in excess of £100 billion – all funded by a tariff on domestic and business consumers. Mr Davey recently changed from Sainsbury’s Energy to Green Star Energy to supply gas and electricity to his Kingston constituency home. Green Star – which, despite its name, is not an eco-certified company – does not have to pay green taxes because it is a new firm with fewer than 250,000 customers. Its average household bill is just over £1,009 a year, compared with Sainsbury’s average of £1,264 – meaning Mr Davey could potentially save about £255 annually. The average standard bill across all energy suppliers is around £1,346. Green sceptic Peter Lilley, a Tory member of the energy and climate change committee, said last night: ‘He is paying less than most people as he is not being hit with those levies, it is as simple as that. He has found a way to avoid this unfair burden on families which his own department is inflicting. It is a form of tax avoidance.’ Smaller firms also do not have to pay for the Energy Company Obligation, which costs customers about £47 a year towards the cost of funding insulation for low-income households. Mr Davey has saved around £255 by switching from Sainsbury's to Green Star Energy . And they are exempt from the Warm Homes Scheme, which offers extra support to anyone struggling to afford their energy bills, such as the elderly. However, if Mr Davey’s decision encourages enough other customers to switch to Green Star and the firm passes the 250,000 threshold, it too will be liable for the green levies. Last week it was revealed more than 900 onshore and offshore wind turbines were built in the past year, with the annual bill for green subsidies topping £3billion. Of that, an estimated £765 million went to onshore wind farms; £935 million to offshore wind farms; £800 million to biomass plants; £500 million to solar plants and £100 million to hydroelectric power. Wind power produced nine per cent of the nation’s electricity, up from six per cent in 2012. Energy firms complain that, as a result, some gas plants are left barely running, further pushing up electricity bills. The Energy Secretary made his account switch through Big Deal Energy. Mr Davey said the figures showed ‘that the Government’s investment in renewable energy is paying off’. His spokesman added: ‘Everyone knows the major energy companies got away with murder under Labour. The number of smaller players competing with the big firms has nearly trebled since 2010 and it’s right they don’t have the obligation put on them until they grow to a certain size.’","Ed Davey recently changed from Sainsbury’s Energy to Green Star Energy to supply gas and electricity to his Kingston constituency home .

"New clerk: Carol Mills, who runs the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra Australia, was headhunted for the UK role . David Cameron is being urged by MPs to block the appointment of an Australian woman as the next ‘chief executive’ of the Commons. Carol Mills, who currently runs the Department of Parliamentary Services in Canberra, has won the battle to become the new £200,000 Clerk of the Commons – despite claims that her selection amounts to nothing more than ‘political correctness’ by Speaker John Bercow. Ms Mills – privately dubbed ‘Waltzing Matilda’ by critics of her selection – was chosen by a panel chaired by Mr Bercow after being tapped up by headhunters and flown to the UK at taxpayers’ expense. Under normal circumstances it would now be a formality for the Prime Minister to formally recommend her to the Queen as the next Clerk. But Tory MPs, who complain that the ‘best candidate’ for the job, the current deputy clerk David Natzler, has been unfairly passed over, have urged Mr Cameron to ‘pause’ the process. Last night Tory MP Simon Burns said: ‘Given that there was an in-house candidate who was eminently qualified to do the job, this is bizarre. ‘If this is Bercow’s idea of political correctness – to have a woman – then it’s absolutely staggering.’ He was backed by fellow Tory MP Rob Wilson, who said: ‘Ms Mills undoubtedly has her merits and I have no reason to doubt she has performed her very different role as head of the staff of the Australian Parliament in an exemplary way. ‘But I know my colleagues are very concerned that the role of the Clerk of Commons, one of the most important and powerful officials in Parliament, should not be pushed through without the proper consultation and scrutiny of MPs.’ Mr Wilson added: ‘I believe the Prime Minister might wish to at least pause the process while the House of Commons isn’t in session so that he can hear the views and concerns of MPs from across the House before fundamental and probably irreversible changes are made. 'Politically correct': Some Tory MPs implied that Ms Mills was chosen instead of the UK favourite because she is a woman . ‘It is important that any notable reform is made with the widest possible consent.’ Ms Mills, who will replace the popular bewhiskered figure of Sir Robert Rogers as Clerk, is also entitled to a five-bedroom grace-and-favour house in Westminster as part of her employment package. One Commons source said: ‘She is a radical break with the past, a proper chief executive figure who enjoys hard rock and modern art – not playing the church organ in Herefordshire like Sir Robert.’ The Speaker’s office last night declined to comment. But a source close to Mr Bercow insisted the decision was taken by the whole panel, saying: ‘It was a consensus decision.’","Carol Mills, who runs a Parliamentary department in Canberra, won job .

"Sheffield United fans chanted their support for Ched Evans yesterday after he was released from prison having served half his sentence for rape. Some sections of the United supporters chanted: ‘Super Ched, Super Ched. He can do what he wants’ as the League One team visited Bradford. The fans’ show of support follows reports Evans was to be offered a two-year £500,000 contract by his former club – although United insist they have made no such decision. Sheffield United fans chanted in support of the disgraced footballer who was convicted of raping a 19-year-old girl . Judy Finnigan’s comments on Evans’s case led to the trolling of her daughter Chloe. Sky Sports News presenter Charlie Webster said she would quit her role as a ‘patron’ of Sheffield United if the club were to re-sign Evans. Webster told Radio 5 Live: ‘You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name.’ West Ham vice-chairman and Apprentice star Karren Brady agreed, saying there is ‘no place anywhere in football’ for Evans. Former Welsh international Evans, 25, was released last week after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. Following the abuse of Chloe Madeley at the hands of internet trolls - many thought to be fans of the footballer - the Justice Secretary announced a change in sentencing which quadruples the maximum penalty for offenders.

"Nigel Farage’s wife has got another job working for Ukip – after being banned from working for her husband. Party leader Mr Farage confessed earlier this year that he was paying his wife £27,000 a year from his parliamentary allowances, funded by the taxpayer, to work as his secretary – despite declaring in 2004 that ‘Ukip MEPs will not employ wives’ and ‘there will be no exceptions’. Now, after the EU introduced new rules banning the employment of family members, his wife Kirsten has been forced to look elsewhere for work – and has found it with another Ukip MEP. Scroll down for video . Employed: Nigel Farage and his wife - and former secretary Kirsten, who is newly employed by his close ally . German-born Kirsten – the second Mrs Farage – is now employed by MEP Ray Finch, a close friend and ally of the party leader, although he lives in Winchester, Hampshire, 80 miles from the Farage family home in Kent. The move is likely to attract gibes that Mr and Mrs Farage are still managing to ‘ride the Brussels gravy train’. Kirsten, a bond broker whom Mr Farage met during a trip to Frankfurt in 1996, has defended her role as his former taxpayer-funded secretary, saying she often worked late, and that Mr Farage was virtually computer illiterate. She said: ‘I sit at my computer in my nightie and am very dutiful. ‘He has a steam-powered telephone, he can send and receive texts and that’s it. 'If I sit him down, and there is something for him to read, he can scroll up and down, he has learned that, but that is pretty much it. Ally: Ray Finch, a close friend of the Ukip leader, has taken on Kirsten, keeping her 'on the Brussels gravy train' Further controversy: Bill Etheridge MEP told youth members to copy Adolf Hitler's 'magnetic' rhetoric . ‘He honestly doesn’t know how to [use a computer] and he has missed the boat, I don’t think he ever will now.’ When asked earlier this year what would happen when the ban on employing family members came in, she claimed: ‘We have not really had time to discuss it. I think the job carries on but I just won’t get paid for it.’ Mr Farage ran into more controversy earlier this year when a former Ukip MEP accused him of also putting his ‘mistress’ on his Brussels payroll. The Ukip leader vigorously denied any relationship with Annabelle Fuller, a party spin doctor, who also refuted the claims.","Kirsten Farage forced to look for work after EU banned family employees .

"Ed Miliband is coming under intense pressure from his MPs to sack Ed Balls to boost Labour’s prospects in next year’s General Election. The whispering campaign against the Shadow Chancellor has started as Mr Balls fights an increasingly open battle with health spokesman Andy Burnham over their manifesto policies. The group, who are largely affiliated to the unions, are swinging behind Mr Burnham’s call for the party to back a ring-fenced tax to boost funding for the NHS – a move that Mr Balls categorically ruled out yesterday. Under pressure: Ed Miliband (left) is coming under intense pressure from his MPs to sack Ed Balls (right) The MPs resent Mr Balls’s refusal to pledge extra money to the NHS in case the Tories cite it as an example of Labour’s profligacy. The MPs have grown concerned by the party’s failure to open up a commanding opinion poll lead over the Conservatives, with some recent surveys showing a gap down to just two per cent. No opposition party in recent political history has won Downing Street from such a weak electoral position. With just ten months until the Election, most of the MPs accept that a direct challenge to Mr Miliband is now unlikely, and so many have instead started calling for Mr Balls’s head as part of a wider Shadow Cabinet reshuffle which would promote Mr Burnham and see a return for former Chancellor Alistair Darling and ex-Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Battle: Mr Balls is fighting an increasingly open battle with health spokesman Andy Burnham (pictured) over their manifesto policies . The tension between Mr Burnham and Mr Balls erupted yesterday when Mr Balls slapped down the idea of either a 15 per cent ‘death tax’ levy on all estates to pay for social care of the elderly or an extra 1p on National Insurance as an ‘NHS tax’, both of which are understood to have the support of Mr Burnham. ‘People feel they are paying too much tax already,’ said Mr Balls. ‘We have to get the balance right between balancing the budget and making sure the NHS continues to deliver.’ Mr Miliband has promised a ‘summer offensive’ of major speeches by his frontbench team to build momentum into the autumn conference season. But many of his MPs were mortified when he used a speech last month to draw attention  to his supposed resemblance to Wallace from the Wallace and Gromit series, saying he was ‘not from central casting’. Last night, Labour MP Graham Stringer led calls for a wide-ranging frontbench reshuffle after next month’s Scottish referendum. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There needs to be a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle before the Labour party conference. After Scotland votes No to independence he [Miliband] should bring back Alistair Darling, who led the anti-independence campaign, and [former Home Secretary] Alan Johnson. Both of them have bags of experience, which our frontbench lacks. We also need to match the Tories’ new- found focus and drive.’ Mr Stringer added: ‘I cannot bear all this angst about jawlines and Wallace and Gromit. The public don’t want self-absorption. They want a focus on tough, clear policies that are relevant to their lives. ‘My view that things need to change is shared throughout the party. The only division is between those who think the debate should take place in private and the few of us who want it to take place in public.’ Refusal: Mr Burnham has called for the Labour party to back a ring-fenced tax to boost funding for the NHS ¿ a move that Mr Balls categorically ruled out yesterday. Above, Mr Balls is pictured on The Andrew Marr Show . And Grahame Morris, Labour MP for Easington, who is understood to support the sacking of Mr Balls, said: ‘I want to see Labour adopting bold policies to tackle the cost of living crisis, reverse the privatisation of the NHS and be ambitious in building a million affordable homes.’ Asked whether he thought  Mr Balls should be sacked, Mr Morris said: ‘The choice of the Shadow Cabinet is a matter  for the leader.’","A whispering campaign against Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has started .

"Stephen Fry publicly criticised Operation Yewtree . Stephen Fry left an audience in shocked silence at a Labour fundraiser attended by Ed Miliband by publicly criticising the Operation Yewtree investigation into historic sex abuse. The Labour-supporting actor, who was hosting the event, complained that fewer than 50 per cent of those people held under Yewtree have been found guilty and that those who make false accusations should be prosecuted. But last night Mr Miliband’s office issued a rebuke to Fry by insisting that the party fully supported Yewtree and making clear that Mr Miliband’s ‘thoughts were with  the victims’. Fry singled out for criticism Sir Keir Starmer, the former Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP),  who was present at the gala dinner last Wednesday. Sir Keir was the architect of the successful prosecutions under Yewtree – the Scotland Yard operation spawned by the Sir Jimmy Savile abuse scandal – of entertainer Rolf Harris, publicist Max Clifford and TV presenter Stuart Hall. But Yewtree has also led to failed prosecutions against entertainers including Coronation Street star William Roache. And cases were dropped against comedians Freddie Starr, Jim Davidson and Jimmy  Tarbuck after months of destructive publicity. Fry’s friend, the BBC DJ  Paul Gambaccini, was arrested in October as part of Operation Yewtree on suspicion of historical sexual offences, but was released on bail and has never been charged with any offence. Fry, 56, is understood to be infuriated that the failure to charge Gambaccini has received significantly less publicity than his arrest, leaving an unfair stain on his character. The Blackadder and QI star, who hosted the event at  London’s Roundhouse – with tables of nine costing up to £15,000 – stunned the crowd by referring to the growing political storm at Westminster over allegations of an establishment cover-up over a supposed child sex abuse ring. Fry, who has a reputation for standing up for human rights, urged the crowd to remember some of ‘the essential values which the Labour Party stands for’, including that ‘people are innocent until proven guilty’. After citing Magna Carta, the 799-year-old foundation of British constitutional rights, Fry said that ‘fewer than half’ of the people held under Yewtree had been found guilty – before identifying  Sir Keir in the audience. Fry singled out for criticism Sir Keir Starmer, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, who was present at the gala dinner . The actor then launched into what one guest described as a ‘rant’ about how the law should be toughened up to deter people from inventing claims about sex abuse. ‘It was all a bit awkward,’ the guest told The Mail on Sunday. ‘There was a smattering of applause, but mostly there was this deadly silence.  And Ed looked as if he had swallowed a wasp.’ However, Scotland Yard has faced criticism from a variety of quarters over its handling of high profile investigations such as its £30million inquiries into phone hacking,  and allegations that journalists bribed public officials, broke into computers and were guilty of other privacy breaches. least 30 journalists remain on bail, some of whom have been in that position – unable to resume their careers – for more than two years. Last night, a source close to Sir Keir, who left his office last November and is believed to be  considering a career as a Labour politician, said: ‘The silence  was pretty profound when Fry went off on one. It was a strange moment. I think he was falsely equating the failure to mount a successful prosecution with malicious accusations. ‘If accusations are faked then there is the crime of perverting  the cause of justice, in which case the accusers do lose their right to anonymity. What Yewtree and the prosecutions has achieved was help and publicity for a previously unprotected group of victims, who felt that their abusers had been unfairly ring-fenced.’ A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ‘Ed Miliband fully supports  the work of Operation Yewtree and has made clear all along that  our thoughts should be with the victims. The Labour Party gala dinner was a hugely successful event and we are very grateful to Stephen Fry for hosting it.’ Last night Fry did not comment.","Host Stephen Fry left audience at Labour fundraiser in shocked silence .

"Ms Brady's appointment to the upper house comes just five months after she was awarded a CBE for services to entrepreneurship . The Apprentice star Karren Brady has been hired by David Cameron – as a member of the House of Lords. Ms Brady, 44, who is an  aide to Lord Sugar on the hit BBC television programme, will be handed a Conservative peerage by the Prime Minister later this month, The Mail on Sunday understands. Mr Cameron hopes  that Ms Brady, who was appointed managing director of Birmingham City Football Club at the age of 23 by the porn baron David Sullivan, and is now vice-chairman of West Ham United, will burnish his credentials among female voters and the business community in the run-up  to the Election. It will lead to speculation that she could even be handed a junior ministerial position  in time for next May’s poll. Her appointment to the upper house comes just five months after she was awarded a CBE by Prince William at Buckingham Palace for services to entrepreneurship, and less than a year after she became a Government business ambassador. Ms Brady will be among about two dozen new peers  to be announced within the next fortnight. The names of some of the other potential candidates could lead to fresh claims of ‘cash for peerages’ after it was reported yesterday that multi-millionaire Tory donors, including former Marks & Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose and commodities magnate Michael Farmer, were also in line for elevation. Sir Stuart, 65, was knighted in 2008. He quit M&S in 2011. He has attended numerous Tory fundraising events and was tasked by Mr Cameron earlier this year to carry out  a review of ‘culture and performance’ within the NHS. Sir Stuart immediately angered doctors by saying that GP surgeries should be open at weekends. In 2009 it was claimed that Mr Cameron’s wife Samantha had asked Sir Stuart, then chief executive of M&S, to secure a £65 limited-edition polka-dot dress sold by the company which had sold out. After ordering staff to search the company’s 600 UK stores for one of the elusive dresses, he found one that was two sizes too big – but had it tailored to fit and sent to her in time for her to wear it at  the Tory Party conference. Mr Farmer, 69, is believed to be Mr Cameron’s biggest individual financial backer, estimated to have given more than £5 million to the party. He made his fortune in the international metal markets, earning the nickname ‘Mr Copper’. He became Tory  co-treasurer alongside Stanley Fink in 2012 after Peter Cruddas resigned in the ‘cash-for-access’ scandal. The committed Christian’s fortune has been estimated at around £120 million, and he has said that he donates to the Tories because of their views on ‘the family’. He has three children with wife Jenny. Son George was  a member of Oxford University’s notorious Bullingdon Club. Scroll down for video .

"Neil Warnock needs to learn when to keep his mouth shut is the message from Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish. The Eagles manager was fined £9,000 earlier this month after claiming that referee Craig Pawson had been influenced by Chelsea players during the home defeat against the Premier League leaders in October. Pawson had sent off Damien Delaney at Selhurst Park, with Warnock inferring that there were double standards at play after John Terry didn’t receive similar treatment. And, while Warnock admitted to his faults three weeks ago, Parish has reiterated that he must bite his tongue more in future. Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has been warned to keep quiet about referees by Steve Parish . Parish, pictured with Mark Bright, doesn't believe Warnock's complaints help the club with matches . ‘I don’t think Neil should complain about referees,’ Parish told the Evening Standard. ‘I’ve told him that. I don’t think it helps us with matches. ‘I don’t think a manager should do anything other than try to help his club.’ While Warnock’s conduct has been an important recent issue, so too have performances under his stewardship. That, however, took a turn for the better on Sunday with the 3-1 demolition of Liverpool. It has the enthusiastic Parish dreaming of Europe. Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak (second left) celebrates scoring in Sunday's 3-1 win over Liverpool . ‘There’s no reason why Palace can’t cement itself as a Europa League challenging club. The Champions League is really difficult for any club outside the top four or five. ‘You might get the odd wild card. The next level down - right down to ninth - is very flat now.’ And he doesn’t see a problem in bridging the gap between Palace and those who consistently occupy the European places in the top flight. ‘Everton probably have about £10-11million more non-TV income than us, that’s it,’ he added. ‘So it’s not like the old days when their gate money was a significant differentiator in the ability to spend and compete.’","Steve Parish has warned Neil Warnock to keep quiet about referees .

"FAI chief executive John Delaney has been forced to apologise after being caught singing a pro-IRA song in a Dublin bar last week. The video, during which the 47-year-old joined in with the song Joe McDonnell, was posted online after Ireland's win against Jurgen Klinsmann's USA. Delaney was forced to defend his actions when talking to radio station 2FM on Tuesday morning, but did express disappointed that it had been shot in a 'sly way'. FAI chief executive John Delaney (right) apologised after being caught singing a pro-IRA song in a Dublin bar . The timing is embarrassing given that the Republic of Ireland are due to host England in March and Roy Hodgson having apologised last week for England fans singing 'No Surrender' during the match against Scotland and Celtic Park. The song was written to honour the memory of McDonnell, a member of the Provisional IRA to die on hunger striker in 1981. 'Joe McDonnell was a song that sang in my presence and I chipped in with on a number of occasions in the past,' Delaney, who was singing in the Bath pub near Ireland's Aviva Stadium, said. 'I'm not someone who supports violence at all. In fact over a large number of years I have been working closely with cross-border initiatives in football to break down barriers. Delaney was filmed joining in with the song Joe McDonnell, written in honour of IRA member who died in 1981 . 'I'm not a violent person. My grand-father fought in the Civil War and he also fought in the War of Independence. I have always said I have a nationalist background. 'When you sing a song like that you don't believe in every word that is in the song. 'I sing a large number of songs and it's normally done in a private way when there is a sing-song. It's a typically Irish thing we do, we sing songs amongst a group and you expect that to be kept within the group. 'Unfortunately on occasions people use camera phones in a sly way when they are not in your company and then they try to make something bigger out of it. 'If the song offends anyone of course I'm sorry, it's not in my nature to want to offend people.' The video of Delaney was posted online after Ireland beat the USA 4-1 in an international friendly this month . Delaney said that the Ireland team have often joined in singing of similar songs going back to Jack Charlton's time in charge, such as 'Sean South from Garryowen' which is about another IRA member. He added: 'I'll give you an example. Sean South from Garryowen has been sung on the Irish team bus for years, from the Jack Charlton era, right up to the current era. 'If people want to tape these things in what I would call a sly way, and then try to make them public, it is wrong. But I do accept that if I have upset anybody here, I'm sorry. 'Many of us have a nationalist background but are non-violent and sing songs but don't believe in all of the lyrics.'","FAI chief executive John Delaney was caught on camera singing the song Joe McDonnell in a Dublin bar .

"In the first of Sportsmail's reviews of the candidates for William Hill's Sports Book of the Year award for 2014, JACK GAUGHAN looks at Matt Dickinson's biography of England's World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore. Look out for the others in the running thoughout next week. Football is a sport to offer parallels like no other; none more heartbreakingly so than on the afternoon of April 29, 1972, as Bobby Moore's international career began drastically free-falling against the very enemy he had conquered at Wembley six years previously. There he stood - England captain, England's rock for so long - completely shattered during a European Championship quarter-final against the brilliance of West Germany and Gerd Muller. Moore looked bereft, out of ideas. He was a man on the slide. Months later - not helped by an ageing national side which was a shadow of its past glories - the first true ball-playing central defender found himself humiliated against Poland and Sir Alf Ramsey's side failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup. Bobby Moore leads his team out  in 1972 - the England skipper looked out of ideas against West Germany . Moore brings down Siggi Held to concede a penalty during West Germany's 3-1 European Championship win . Matt Dickinson's 'Bobby Moore - The Man in Full' reminds us the England captain was just like everybody else . Author: Matt Dickinson . Publisher: Yellow Jersey Press, 2014 . Sportsmail rating: 4/5 . The game froze. So immaculate was Moore's previous 11 seasons moulding himself as a pristine great, marked by the admirable refusal to hoick balls clear and stand for what he believed in, that this was scarcely believable. His nadir, for both club and country, came on deciding to turn back into Poland striker Wlodzimierz Lubanski in a bid to move clear in midfield, gifting possession and ultimately the second goal during a chastening defeat. In the fascinatingly meticulous Bobby Moore - The Man in Full, Matt Dickinson succinctly pens of that moment: 'The ball is stolen, the king deposed.' And that, rather tragically, was that. Moore, who was never awarded a knighthood despite the joy he gave English football, played one more international and found maintaining his usual impeccable standards extremely difficult after the 1970 World Cup in Mexico where - but for costly injuries and questionable Ramsey management - they felt a justifiable case for retaining the biggest prize in sport. Moore poses with Brazil defender Carlos Alberto at the 1970 World Cup prior to England's 1-0 defeat . Prefacing that tournament had been the theft scandal undermining their preparations. Moore was accused of stealing a bracelet close to the team's hotel in the warm-up and spent four days under house arrest in Bogota. Having spoken to countless subjects close to the case, Dickinson moves to quash any lingering suggestions that Moore had anything to do with it as much as possible - backed up by eye-witness evidence. What mustn’t be taken away from his story is that Moore became the first English superstar on the global sporting map - modest and a gentleman with it. That should never be forgotten. But, reading the biography, you cannot remove yourself from the fact that he was an individual whose life was troubled. The divorce to childhood sweetheart Tina is covered, as are Moore's failed business ventures, links with the East End underworld and his secret battle with testicular cancer at just 23. Moore divorced his childhood sweetheart Tina (left) in 1986 after 24 years of marriage . There are accounts of Moore’s association with the infamous Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel - scene of George Cornell’s murder by Ronnie Kray - as well as the crippling losses he had to front almost alone after sinking thousands into the lavish Woolston Hall, a financial black hole to nearly finish him. It might have been very different had he been granted the moves to Tottenham Hotspur and then Brian Clough’s Derby County he so desperately craved. The most revealing aspect of a personal life so rarely dissected is his relationship with drink. After that ghastly mistake against the Poles, Dickinson wrote: 'There was only one way to find relief and that was in a beer can.' Tales of boozing - most strikingly the night before an FA Cup tie in Blackpool, after which West Ham boss Ron Greenwood wanted to sack his skipper - are a common theme and cannot be ignored. 'Sometimes he'd come in with his bow tie and dinner jacket on where he'd come back from a function, been out all night somewhere,' Harry Redknapp, team-mate at Upton Park says. On a Sunday morning Moore would turn up at the ground, throw on a boiler suit and trudge around the perimeter of the pitch, allowing the drink to seep out. The book delves deep into the icon's complex personality and sparks debate whether football failed him . This is a book which delves deep into the icon’s complex personality - very few of the tens of interviewees claim to have truly known him - and sparks debate whether football failed one of its very few real legends. The reader is left to make up their own mind, but the answer seems obvious; Moore ended up struggling as manager of Oxford City in the Isthmian Premier League in front of tiny crowds and then Southend United. Happy memories should not be forgotten. Moore’s second wife Stephanie recounts the joyous times they shared together. After the obvious turmoil post-retirement, she is said to have come as a relief. Moore was reborn. He was taken too soon by misdiagnosed bowel cancer in 1993, typically retaining his quiet dignity to the last. Bobby Moore will rightly be forever remembered as the champion of his era, the most serenely masterful footballer ever to have hailed from these shores; ‘The Man in Full’, not shying away from human fallacies, serves as a reminder that he was the same as every one of us.","Matt Dickinson's 'Bobby Moore - The Man in Full' reviewed by Sportsmail .

"It took a special goal from Oscar and an Eden Hazard penalty for Premier League leaders Chelsea to claim three points from west London rivals QPR at Stamford Bridge. Diego Costa returned from injury after four games out but it was Oscar's stunner that gave the hosts the lead in the 32nd minute. QPR equalised via a clever  Charlie Austin finish threatening a draw in Jose Mourinho's first derby against QPR, but Hazard was on hand to secure the win in the 75th minute. Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan was at Stamford Bridge and rates the players' performances. Oscar was the main man for Chelsea with a stunning strike and continues to improve with each appearance . CHELSEA . Thibaut Courtois - 6.5 . Very, very little to do, but questionable whether he should have punched for the QPR equaliser. Other than that, caught well, organised the back four and was quick to distribute. Branislav Ivanovic - 7 . Guilty of missing an early sitter, but was solid defensively. Junior Hoilett didn’t get any change out of the Serbian and wasn’t able to affect proceedings. John Terry - 7 . Strong in the air and - as ever - assured when coming out of the back four. Helped that QPR only opted for one up front, but you can only dominate what’s put in front of you. Branislav Ivanovic (left) missed an earlier sitter but didn't allow  QPR's Junior Hoilett (right) any joy . Gary Cahill - 7 . See Terry. Calm and assured but for one moment in the first half when Charlie Austin headed over the top. Filipe Luis - 7 . Eduardo Vargas is a tricky customer but he stood up to him with varying success. Doesn’t look like someone who has played in a Champions League final, though. Nemanja Matic - 8 . Peerless, yet again. Isn’t handed the plaudits the flair players are for obvious reasons, but there isn’t a better midfielder ahead of a back four in the Premier League. Nemanja Matic was immense again in the Chelsea midfield . Cesc Fabregas - 7.5 . Knits, threads and gives the Blues an impetus they lacked last season. Consistent in his performances and seems to register an assist every week. Willian - 7.5 . Becoming a devilish to play against. Happy to flit inside off his wing to influence the game but is equally adept at beating a man at the byline as he managed to great effect. Oscar - 8.5 . Absolutely marvellous finish for the first goal, curling an effort with the outside of his foot beyond Rob Green from 18 yards. Gets better each week. Slick and consistent Cesc Fabregas (left) skips away from QPR's Mauricio Isla (right) Eden Hazard - 7.5 . Hasn’t come under fire for his form this season as such, but Hazard is yet to hit the heights of last year. Good here, jinking and weaving on the edge of the box. Won and then scored the penalty. Diego Costa - 7 . His mere presence is enough to strike fear among visiting defenders. Hold-up play was its usual bustling brilliant. Subs . Didier Drogba (for Willian, 64mins): Back to his normal self, haring around the Bridge. 6 . Andre Schurrle (for Costa, 78mins): Had one stinging effort well saved by Green. 6.5 . Ramires (for Hazard, 90mins): Timewasting substitution. QPR . Rob Green - 7 . Made a number of smart saves. No fumbles and kicked well. Has had to up his game with the emergence of Alex McCarthy. Mauricio Isla - 6.5 . Faced his toughest direct test since joining the club in Eden Hazard and - although the South American was dumbfound on occasion - stuck to his guns. Steven Caulker - 6 . The clamour for an England call-up seems like a lifetime ago now. May be good enough to keep the Rs in the division but up against Diego Costa? Not quite there. Richard Dunne - 6.5 . Surprisingly, Harry Redknapp didn’t have his back four stationed deep. That was potentially a recipe for disaster for Dunne, but the captain performed admirably. QPR captain Richard Dunne (left) performed admirably up against  Diego Costa (right) returning from injury . Yun Suk-Young - 5 . Given a torrid time at left back; Willian ran him ragged and he looked out of his depth. Began to get forward more after half-time. Eduardo Vargas - 7 . Could be the man to keep QPR in this division. Has that driving ability with the ball you need to worry defenders. Just a shame that he was stuck out on the right here and it’s not in his nature to help defensively. Slightly unfortunate in conceding the penalty. Eduardo Vargas was unfortunate to concede the penalty for the winner and was stuck out on the right . Karl Henry - 7 . Chelsea did have a lot of the ball, but Henry kept his discipline well throughout. Always showing for the ball. Sandro - 6 . Fairly anonymous but for a deflected second half effor, which is no bad thing for a man sitting. Failed to utilise his range of passing effectively - all the more galling given the speed of Rangers’ wide men. Leroy Fer - 7 . Big strong runs from the middle of the park as he tried to offer support to Charlie Austin. Junior Hoilett - 5.5 . Barely got a kick up against Ivanovic and tends to hide when things aren’t going his way. Charlie Austin - 7.5 . Thankless task up there on his own. Tried his best to ruffle the feathers of Cahill and Terry and linked up nicely in spells. Excellently-improvised flicked finish for the equaliser. Charlie Austin jumps in celebration after scoring the equaliser for QPR in the 62nd minute . Subs . Bobby Zamora (for Hoilett, 60mins): Wins almost every header and offers Redknapp an out-ball, particularly when they’re chasing games. 6.5 . Armand Traore (for Fer, 84mins): Tried to give Rangers extra width in search of a late equaliser. 6 .

"Jota cut inside, not an awful lot was on, and let fly. We had crept into the 92nd minute at Griffin Park and this frantic night looked destined to end all-square. Call Dan Burn’s deflection into his own net unfortunate, but Brentford will argue you make your own luck. The place went wild. Facing their bitter rivals for the first time in the league since 1998, this was more than just three points. If they weren’t already, Mark Warburton’s side are firmly in the Championship mix. And they know it. A snapshot of the table flashed up just after the final whistle. ‘Just look at that,’ beamed one fan. The Bees find themselves fourth in a division which includes Leeds United, Derby County and, of course, the Cottagers. Harlee Dean of Brentford scores to make it 1-1 in the final 10 minutes to electrify Griffin Park .

Brentford (4-1-4-1): Button, Odubajo, Dean, Craig, Bidwell, Douglas, Diagouraga (Jota, 75), Pritchard, Judge, Toral (Dallas, 66), Gray (Proschwitz, 84) Subs (not used): Saunders,  Bonham, Smith, Tarkowski .

Subs (not used): Kiraly, Hutchinson, Roberts, Woodrow, Dembele, Hyndman . Goals: Rodallega (57) Bookings: Burn, Zverotic . Referee: David Coote (Nottinghamshire) Harlee Dean’s calamitous slip had looked to gift the visitors all three points, but they rallied brilliantly to turn this on its head. The villain Dean equalised - sufficiently redeeming himself - and then Jota sealed what is their biggest win of an encouraging season. ‘It’s tremendous for all of us and so important for the supporters,’ Warburton said. ‘It was a packed house and a great place to be. ‘They deserve to be there.’ This was Brentford’s opportunity to show they mean business in English football’s second tier and nobody came away disappointed on a night Fulham were shaken. These have been long, tortuous years for the Bees and Friday night under the lights felt very much like the outpouring of 16 seasons of frustration. Simply put, Warburton’s side were superb. They buzzed, pressed and provided real moments of quality to suggest they are at home in the top six. ‘I’m disappointed to say the least,’ Fulham boss Kit Symons said. ‘We were poor first half but stayed in the game - weathered the storm. We got our noses in front and it’s galling to come away with nothing.’ Brentford are now making those who had previously sneered at them for being a gentle, harmless club sit up and take notice. Whether they would have enjoyed the same impact under Uwe Rosler is up for debate, but what these supporters know is that Warburton has put them back on the map. Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli pulls off a great save to deny Brentford taking the lead on Friday . Bettinelli kept Fulham in the Championship match with a series of saves to deny Brentford on Friday . The accusation levelled at Rosler - here and during his ultimately doomed spell at Wigan - is that he never took enough risks. The same can’t be said of his replacement. During a frantic start he had the foresight to switch wingers Alan Judge and Alex Pritchard, and that move almost paid off immediately. Andre Gray was tenacious in unsettling the gangly Dan Burn out wide, surging beyond the central defender before clipping a ball to Pritchard. The away supporters behind that goal sensed the danger, wincing as the sea parted for the on-loan Spurs man, and were indebted to the brilliance of right back Elsad Zverotic who courageously threw himself at the goalbound effort to deflect wide. If there were any suggestions Brentford would find themselves overawed by the evening, that move dispelled them. It was they who enjoyed the majority of possession, pinging the ball about as if it was they who had mixed it in the top flight years previously. Tony Craig watched his chance palmed over the bar by Marcus Bettinelli while Jan Toral’s diving header was tipped wide and Jonathan Douglas fluffed his lines six yards out. Make no mistake, Symons’ men were flustered. But for a blocked Ross McCormack shot, they had barely ventured into the home third. Rodallega rises to meet the ball and head it towards goal as Fulham looked to take the lead in the match . The best chances came for Brentford despite the efforts of Rodallega (left) and Ross McCormark (right) The intense Warburton has his players following. They press all over the pitch, but none more so than Gray, who skipped away from halfway after a Fulham to dangerously cross again. This time the ball fell to holding midfielder Toumani Diagouraga bounding from his holding station, whose side-footed strike was superbly beaten away by Bettinelli before he saved superbly from a Judge free-kick. This might’ve been over by the break if it wasn’t for the goalkeeper. And then a reminder of Fulham’s undoubted menace. McCormack scampered down the left and found Rodallega free eight yards out, but Button admirably pushed clear his header. The Colombian might’ve done better. McCormack’s rasping drive was well saved as the visitors showed flickers. But the best chances came at the other end. Gray was thwarted by Bettinelli, having a night to remember before what seemed a sucker punch. The unchallenged Dean looked to play a ball up to halfway but slipped on impact, gifting possession to George Williams. Now the hosts were stretched. Dean’s parter Craig was left exposed, McCormack finding the unmarked Rodallega and this time he made no mistake. ‘It happens. We encourage the players to be brave,’ Warburton reasoned. ‘I don’t mind a mistake.’ Perhaps the single line tells you all you need to know about his team. Warburton must have been annoyed had they not found the net beforehand given their dominance. Brentford had wasted their earlier chances before Dean’s vicious strike slammed its way past Bettinelli. Then bedlam. Substitute Jota cut in from the right and saw his rather weak effort deflect beyond Bettinelli to send this pocket of the city absolutely potty. ‘They deserved the points,’ McCormack said. Never a truer word spoken. Hugo Rodallega scores Fulham's first and only goal against Brentford, who went on to turn it all around .

"On a night Brentford opted to celebrate their 125th anniversary, they again showed why supporters continue to flock to Griffin Park. It is their first season back in the second tier since 1992 and they plan to savour it. The attacking brand of football Mark Warburton wants to play may not always yield results, but is reason enough to continue to turn up. More than 10,000 were packed into the tight Griffin Park on Tuesday night as this club keeps growing. They may not always see results that their dominance deserves - notably at Wigan last weekend - but provide value for money.

The Owls' Kieran Lee (centre) is fouled by Alan Judge as he advances into Brentford territory . What the Bees do have are a raft of exciting players going forward. Moses Odubjao - a £1million summer signing from Leyton Orient - is threatening on the right, while Jota on the other side is devlish in possession. They saw a bullet Jonathan Douglas header cleared off the line and Andre Gray strike correctly disallowed for offside before he fluffed his lines in front of goal after the break. The breaks didn’t appear to be with the hosts. Warburton said: 'Both sides had chances, you won't see a better 0-0 draw. They posed a real threat. We've got to be more clinical. 'We played some good football tonight.' Stuart Gray's Sheffield Wednesday are reborn and potent themselves, too, and bossed this for large parts. The Yorkshire side - who play slightly more direct with the two tenacious strikers Atdhe Nihiu and Stevie May in their midst - have goals in their side too.

Brentford: Button 7; McCormack 6; Dean 7; Craig 6; Bidwell 6; Douglas 7; Pritchard 6.5; Odubajo 6; Judge 6 (Diagouraga, 77 - 6); Jota 6.5 (Proschwitz, 76 - 6); Gray 6.5 (Toral, 84 - 6) Subs not used: Bonham, Toral, Alves Coelho, Yennaris, Moore . Booked: McCormack . Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood 6; Palmer 6; Lees 7; Loovens 6.5; Mattock 6; Maguire 6.5; Semedo 6; Lee 7 (Madine, 73); Helan 7; Nuhiu 6.5; May 7.5 (Drenthe, 84) Subs not used: Coke, Maghoma, Hope, Dielna, Kirkland . Booked: Mattock, May . Nerves kicked in as the final third approached. Jeremy Helan somehow conspired to trip over when offered a very presentable opportunity just nine yards out, while Alex Pritchard was incapable of finding the final ball to unlock the Wednesday back four. Tackles flew in, tempers flared and the intensity remained high. Neither side opted to sit in as both continued to commit plenty of bodies forward. Pritchard buzzed and Gray schemed - only denied by a last-gasp Glenn Loovens tackle. Brentford did look the more likely after the arrival of lanky striker Nick Proschwitz - giving them an added dimension, but Wednesday almost caught the Bees cold as Helan tried to atone for his earlier stumble. He wasn’t, however, able to skip by Jack Bidwell. Not even former Real Madrid star Royston Drenthe entering the fray late on could steal all three for Gray. It was another night when it was apparent that new-thinking Brentford belong at this level, although it would have been so much more had Proschwitz connected at the back post in the 89th minute with goal gaping. Gray said: 'Brentford put us under a lot of pressure, credit to them. Not many teams will come here and get a clean sheet like we have. 'How it ended up goalless I don't know. We need that goalscorer.'","Brentford's attacking brand of football under Mark Warburton shows why fans can't get enough .

"Read his verdict on Flower's Boy Scouts . And on 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior . And the day Jonathan Trott told Prior to 'f*** off' Kevin Pietersen strenuously denies texting South African players tactical information on how to get Andrew Strauss out in the Textgate storm to have engulfed English cricket in 2012. The scandal began Pietersen’s downfall as an England international and, he says, was a direct consequence of Strauss obnoxiously ignoring him after scoring a century. Pietersen – whose explosive autobiography will ruffle feathers at the heart of the ECB – alleges that Strauss didn't acknowledge him after hitting 149 during the second Test in South Africa two years ago. Kevin Pietersen has denied sending text messages on how to dismiss Andrew Strauss to friends in the South African team during the 'Textgate' scandal that engulfed English cricket in 2012 . Pietersen alleges that Strauss didn't acknowledge him after hitting 149 against South Africa at Headingley . That led to a friend in the South African side BlackBerry Messaging the batsman asking what his captain’s problem was. ‘He asked me, what was Strauss’ problem? He totally ignored the both of us. Made a point of it,’ Pietersen wrote. ‘I have never and would never give any tactical information about any teammates.’ He went on to brand that assertion as ‘b*******’. The former England captain, who resigned after three Tests in 2009, also moves to set the record straight on the term ‘doos’ – thought to be Afrikaan for ‘c***’. He wrote that the friend called Strauss a ‘doos’, meaning a ‘d***’ or ‘idiot’, sentiments the 34-year-old agreed with. Pietersen labels the episode as ‘bizarre’ and that it was leaked ‘drop by poisonous drop’ by an organisation to use the furore as an excuse to get shut of their leading run scorer. He says that the ECB attempted to set him up, trying to coerce a denial before later moving to discredit and wield the axe, but did admit to making mistakes: 'I see now how it looked.' Strauss’ relationship with Pietersen is said to have taken a drastic turn for the worse just days into his captaincy. Described as ‘my buddy’ before the switch, Strauss’ refusal to allow time off to go home ‘at a really tough time in my life’ during a tour of the Caribbean saw the connection break down.

"Brendan Rodgers has the perfect opportunity to reinvigorate his ailing side during the international break after it emerged a selection of star names are still training with Liverpool. Ten of their Premier League squad – including Mario Balotelli, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard - have remained at Melwood for varying reasons this week. It provides Rodgers with the quality time he needs to arrest an alarming slide so far this season which has seen Liverpool lose three Barclays Premier League games and one in the Champions League at Basle. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Oh my god! Hart has no chance as Henderson smashes one in . Brendan Rodgers will enjoy some added time with Mario Balotelli during the international break . Glen Johnson (centre) has also remained with Liverpool after not being called up by England . Top of his agenda ought to be integrating Balotelli – not called up by Italy again – into his system alongside Sturridge, who is coming back from injury. Balotelli is yet to score domestically and his form is of growing concern. Liverpool are already nine points behind league leaders Chelsea, who only have three players available to train. Jose Mourinho is off on holiday while the majority of his squad are away with their national sides. Only Didier Drogba, John Terry and Mark Schwarzer would be available for mornings at Cobham. Louis van Gaal could probably afford a holiday too after Sportsmail’s research – which takes into account the 25-man squads (which don’t include players under 21) published last month – revealed Juan Mata, Rafael and Antonio Valencia are the only first-team regulars available at Carrington. Juan Mata (dashing clear of Leighton Baines) is still with Manchester United this week . Four Arsenal stars are still with the club, but the Gunners are nursing them back from injuries. Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Olivier Giroud and Mathieu Debuchy remain on the treatment table, with Mikel Arteta, Abou Diaby and Per Mertesacker training. The findings also shine a light on the difficulties facing Queens Park Rangers this season. Although the majority of their 25 named players are seasoned international players, just three have been called up by their respective countries. Leroy Fer, Eduardo Vargas and Mauricio Isla have escaped west London with Harry Redknapp’s side propping up the division. Leroy Fer (smiling centre) is one of only three Queens Park Rangers players to be called up by their country . The manager has complained about the fitness levels of his team this season and will doubtless work them hard over the break. That is a chance afforded to Sean Dyche at Burnley – who has 22 available – as well as Leicester boss Nigel Pearson (18). Large swathes of the squads assembled at both West Brom and Southampton have jetted off, which could come as a worry – particularly to Ronald Koeman. Although they lost at Tottenham on Sunday, Saints will be disappointed this break comes at a time in which they were generating momentum at the division’s summit. Koeman has just five players available - including two reserve goalkeepers - and will be concerned that some of his 13 internationals may pick up knocks on duty.

"Manuel Pellegrini insists Yaya Toure never wanted to leave Manchester City in the summer and maintains his slow start to the season is down to personal problems. The 31-year-old scored City’s opener as they beat Aston Villa on Saturday night - his first Premier League goal since May. There have been serious questions raised over Toure’s lack of consistency for the champions, but Pellegrini believes that is due to the death of his brother Ibrahim earlier this year rather than angling for a move away. Yaya Toure celebrates his first goal of the season for Manchester City after copping criticism in recent weeks . Toure weaves his shot through the Aston Villa defence to score the opener in City's 2-0 win at Villa Park . Toure is swamped by his team-mates after breaking the deadlock after 82 minutes against stoic Villa . Asked about a situation whereby the Ivorian complained about the lack of club a birthday cake and appeared to make it clear his future lay elsewhere, the manager said: ‘I’ve spoken with him about that - it was a misunderstanding of some words. He didn’t have any problem with the club. He had things with his private life but didn’t want to go anywhere. ‘He’s an experienced player. He has been criticised over the last two weeks but I know the way he thinks and can play. 'Yaya last season also played bad games. He scored so many goals that everybody talked about that. I have no concerns about him.’ Manuel Pellegrini says early season talk that Toure wanted to leave City was a 'misunderstanding of words' Pellegrini says his has no concerns over the form of his at times phenomenal midfielder . Toure showed glimpses that he could be somewhere close to his best soon. ‘It’s amazing to score my first goal,' the midfielder said. 'The most important thing for me is to do my best and help the team. 'It’s not so easy because I have to play every three days. People have to understand I am not a machine - I am a man. ‘It’s fantastic to win after the draw against Roma in midweek as it was difficult for us to come back.’","Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City beat Aston Villa 2-0 on Saturday .

"Aston Villa finally wilted to the star power of Manchester City as Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero's late strikes kept the Premier League holders in touch with leaders Chelsea. After coming close throughout the match, it appeared Villa would pull off a miraculous draw but Toure's delicate left-footed finish in the 82nd minutes set them on their way for the away win. Aguero put the result beyond doubt six minutes later with an emphatic blast passed Villa keeper Brad Guzan. Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan was at Villa Park and assesses all the players' performances.

Composed goalkeeper who is always talking to his back four. 8 . Villa's American keeper Brad Guzan dives in vain as a City shot clatters into the post . Alan Hutton - Absolutely abysmal in possession. Failed to find a claret shirt all night. Perhaps a one-off, because Hutton has started the season relatively well. 5 . Philippe Senderos - Big brute of a centre-half and gave Edin Dzeko a real game. Strong in the air and wasn’t turned on too many occasions. 6.5 . Nathan Baker - Superb early block on Toure - always puts his body on the line for the cause. Did so again when Dzeko bore down on goal with a stunning last ditch tackle. 7 . Aly Cissokho - Got forward to decent effect and got tight to James Milner on City’s right. One of his better games for Villa. 6.5 . Charles N’Zogbia - Has his old swagger back, encapsulated with a 50-yard drive through midfield before firing wide just outside the box. 6.5 . Villa's Charles N'Zogbia (left) had his swagger back and proved a handful for City . Fabian Delph - Busy, as ever. Puts himself about - exactly what Villa need - and is a real driving force. Change of pace in midfield urged the hosts on. 7 . Ashley Westwood - Game rather passed Westwood by. Sitting in front of the back four, he could only watch as Aguero, Silva and the rest found too much space in the area he patrolled. 5 . Villa and England's Fabian Delph times his tackle on Fernandinho to perfection . Tom Cleverley - Was quoted in Saturday’s papers saying he’s enjoying his football again, but needs to start performing regularly. Quickness of thought hasn’t come back yet. 5.5 . Kieran Richardson - Very narrow to begin with - obviously a ploy by the hosts - and got involved to good effect. Should have scored just after half-time. 7 . Former Manchester United midfielder Cleverley battles with Dzeko . Andreas Weimann - A late replacement for Gabby Agbonlahor, who was taken ill in the warm-up, and led the line alone. Couldn’t manufacture any meaningful opportunities. 6 . Substitutes .

Pablo Zabaleta - Was unusually subdued in leaving his station at right back but is ever dependable going the other way. 6.5 . Pablo Zabaleta makes a desperate lunge as Villa's Kieran Richardson shapes to shoot . Aleksandar Kolarov - Fierce effort smashed the post in the opening 10 minutes. Wicked delivery from the left as ever and almost crossed for Aguero to score. 7 . Vincent Kompany - Caught out by Delph out on the right which almost gave Villa the lead. Won his headers and stood firm, as you’d expect. 6.5 . City skipper Vincent Kompany plays the ball out from the back . Eliaquim Mangala - Perhaps not his fault, but the central defender has an air of nervousness around him when on the ball. Did nothing wrong, which will come as a huge relief after Hull. 7 . James Milner - Failed to really get at Cissokho as he should have done. A couple of whipped crosses to spark danger. 6.5 . Tenacious as ever, James Milner (left) tries to get position on Ashley Westwood . Fernandinho - Laboured performance. Pellegrini needs to sort out who’s going to play alongside Toure. 5.5 . Yaya Toure - Another strange one. Looked alive in flashes but then failed to deliver... All before a storming run and finish set City on their way to three points. 7 . David Silva - Electric around the box. Jinking magician. Didn’t have much help in opening Villa up but was a constant threat. 7 . David Silva is first to the ball as Westwood gets in tight - the Spaniard was electric around the box . Edin Dzeko - Often wasteful in front of goal and flashed a presentable opportunity wide. Didn’t look himself. 6 . Sergio Aguero - Struck a post just after the break when he ought to have opened the scoring, but a constant threat in behind. Fabulous effort in the dying moments that zipped past Guzan. 7.5 . Sergio Aguero was a constant threat and got his reward with City's second goal with an emphatic finish . Substitutes . Frank Lampard (on for Fernandinho after 56 minutes) - Added urgency into the City midfield and is proving to be a very shrewd piece of business by the champions. 6.5 . Fernando (on for Dzeko after 64 minutes) - Came on in order to push both Lampard and Toure further forward. Solid enough. 6 .

"Slaven Bilic knew the importance of his No 9. When Demba Ba's late penalty nestled into Hugo Lloris' net, the Besiktas manager span, roared at the home dugout and celebrated with his staff. 'I don't want to sound big-headed but not many teams come here and get a draw. Nobody are favourites except Tottenham,' was the manager's assessment. Once Ba trudged off after the final whistle of a game the visitors really ought to have won, Bilic was the first to embrace the striker with a man hug.

Stuck with Mario Balotelli for £16million, Ba cost Besiktas half that amount. Did Liverpool miss a trick in letting Ba leave England? West Ham . Another potential return that could have seen Sam Allardyce go a long way to keeping his promise of more attractive football. Everton . Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o from Chelsea to Everton have proved successful buys so far, and Ba could have been the third. By Kieran Gill . Back in England for the second time since leaving Chelsea in the summer, the 29-year-old played as if he had something to prove. To himself, possibly. To the Premier League, definitely. He strutted around White Hart Lane as if there was only one man to settle this game. Only a string of Lloris saves stopped Bilic and Ba would have been leaving with three precious points, almost sealing their qualification from the group in turn already. In the end, it was left for the Senegalese to grab a point. On an evening he stood above the rest, that finale seemed fitting. The 2,800 travelling supporters went wild - a solitary flare was let off - as Besiktas, knowing the Europa League is a gateway to Champions League qualification for first time this season, earned the least they deserved. Bilic, when referencing the swell of support in the South West corner, joked afterwards that he wished there were as many fans in Istanbul as there are in London. Tricky to blame him given the noise projected from that area of the ground well before kick-off. They had been allowed in particularly early on Thursday night - a wise move after the scenes around the Emirates the night before - and it filled up rather quickly. With an hour to go there were at least 1,500 already out in their seats chanting away. That would give any team a lift. There they were, hollered on to their warm up - similarly so when the XI came out half-an-hour later. Ba thrived and meant business.

Tottenham were nowhere near touching their best - not surprising given the manager had made 10 changes - and, but for Lloris, might have come away with nothing. They missed something going forward, often lackadaisical in their approach and didn't have a focal point to hit. Harry Kane offered when dropping deeper into the No 10 but the consistent beige produced by Roberto Soldado must continue to concern. Pochettino said afterwards that he had 'all the information' needed on the players in his squad after three months working with them.

"Manchester United's shocking demise has become even more stark as Sportsmail can reveal that a whopping six of the side to beat Arsenal 8-2 three years ago starting in the troubling draw away at Sunderland last week. Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Ashley Young, Tom Cleverley, Wayne Rooney and David de Gea all lined up at the Stadium of Light on Sunday ahead of another afternoon to lay bare the problems facing the club after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure. The Scot has been heavily criticised for the way in which he spent money towards the end of his tenure - Jones, Smalling, Anderson, Nani and Young have all been pinned up as poster boys for a flailing transfer policy. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal say a new team is not built in a month . Those were better times! Manchester United beat Arsenal 8-2 three years ago this weekend . Spot the difference! There were just five changes between the game against Arsenal and Sunderland last week . Three and easy! Wayne Rooney netted a hat-trick against Arsenal at Old Trafford three years ago . How times change: The newly-appointed England captain (left) cut a frustrated figure away at Sunderland . Tricky business: New manager Louis van Gaal knows all about the problems he faces . Tens of millions were splashed out on the quartet, among others, as Ferguson set about building what he thought would be an empire for the decade to come. That, with the power of hindsight, hasn’t exactly materialised - all too apparent on Wearside and during the opening day defeat by Swansea before it. Since the Scot’s retirement in 2013, United’s fortunes have taken a complete nosedive. David Moyes came and went in less than 12 months while Louis van Gaal is struggling to get to grips with a largely incompetent squad. It was a scandalous seventh-place finish under Moyes last season, with no European football, that led to the overwhelming need for change and the feeling that this is a club in need of a mammoth overhaul. Moyes knew it; Van Gaal is all too aware. Anderson is ready to be shipped out of Old Trafford should a suitor be willing to pay his wages, while Nani is at Sporting Lisbon and question marks still loom large over Young. But do not forget that this pair also played in the thumping win against Arsenal. Danny Welbeck played up front in each. Javier Hernandez was a substitute, too. Then and now: Phil Jones played against Arsenal in 2011 (left) and away at Sunderland this season (right) Trouble: David Moyes wasn't afforded the opportunity to sign big names during his time at the club . And then the problems began: Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement rocked United to their core . And those six starters were all on Van Gaal's teamsheet as they stumbled to a 1-1 draw at Sunderland last weekend. That shines a rather bright light on the remarkable change in fortunes around Carrington and poses questions as to what has actually happened. The players Ferguson spent huge sums on – and those youngsters he placed faith in from their teens – were the ones to demolish Arsene Wenger’s side 36 months ago. Rooney netted a hat-trick, Young got two, Welbeck opened the scoring and even Nani notched. That was a team at the peak of its powers. Admittedly this was a dismal Arsene outfit – their lowest point during Wenger’s reign – but Ferguson’s young guns still finished them off. Robin van Persie, Theo Walcott and Laurent Koscielny could only stand and watch. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page. Whipped: Ashley Young scored a stunning goal against Arsenal to put the champions two ahead . A happier time: Young's stock has fallen dramatically over the course of the last three seasons . The old saying is that players do not become bad ones overnight. Cleverley is being chased by Valencia, who know a good ball player when they see one, while Nani has been deemed good enough for the Champions League this term. Fatal for United is that they stood still, perhaps even became complacent, with Ferguson in charge – trophies were still being won, there appeared no end to their dominance – and they’ve been unable to deal with clear deficiencies since. Cleverley and Anderson had both gone backwards, through injury and loss of confidence, but Moyes suffered at the hands of Ed Woodward's incompetence in going out and failing to sign a quality central midfielder. They wanted Cesc Fabregas and failed, ending up with the overpriced Marouane Fellaini who – putting it mildly - has flattered to deceive.

It really is hard to believe that most of the same players to shrink on Wearside beat everything put in front of them three years ago; Ferguson's spending wasn't to blame, it's what was done with them after that was the main problem.

"Tottenham Hotspur have not yet asked West Ham United permission to use the Olympic Stadium, but Karren Brady said they'd be barking up the wrong tree regardless. Daniel Levy’s Spurs face relocating during the 2017/18 season and there remains uncertainty where they will be playing, with both stadium:mk and Wembley also mooted. The Hammers - who are due to move out of Upton Park in 2016 - have a veto as to who can be housed in Stratford, with vice-chairman Brady scoffing at suggestions their London rivals could share. West Ham showed off the newly-decorated Olympic Stadium on their official website on Tuesday . An overground view of West Ham's  new stadium located in the heart of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park .

West Ham fans may get a decent view out of the East Stand 'Kop' window from the Arnold Hills . West Ham's gallery included this photograph of the new Reservation Centre at Stratford . 'In reality they probably could – but only with our permission,' she said when asked if another club could move in. 'No-one has asked us for our permission and if they did we would probably say no, depending on who it is – if you get my drift. Sam Allardyce's side have been awarded a 99-year lease to become tenants of the London 2012 venue and are set to leave Upton Park for the 54,000-seater stadium in August 2016. Spurs face moving for 12 months, with a number of venues being mooted - including stadium:mk in Milton Keynes. Brady also confirmed that the club would not receive any money from external events such as pop concerts, while next year's rugby World Cup's fixtures will not be used as dress rehearsals for the following year. 'There will be lots of issues with that stadium. It'll be a shell of a stadium and won't be the finished article,' she added. Karren Brady (centre) admits it is unlikely Tottenham would be allowed to share the Olympic Stadium . Tottenham will move from White Hart Lane in an effort to compete financially with the big European clubs . Brady said: 'We would probably say no dependent on who it was if you catch my drift' West Ham are trying to build a squad capable of European football for manager Sam Allardyce . West Ham's main objective is to become a team capable of consistently finishing in the Premier League's top six and there is a belief that the revenue from the new stadium will help the manager create a side capable of challenging for European qualification. Brady was talking at the launch of West Ham's new members' club - 'Club London' which offers fans the chance to experience what Brady labelled as an 'unrivalled hospitality experience'. Season ticket holders and members will soon be able to visit the new Reservation Centre at Westfield Stratford City to hand-pick their new seats at the Olympic Stadium.","Brady says in reality it would be possible to groundshare with Tottenham .

"Chelsea supporters were the victims of two unprovoked attacks around an Istanbul bar on Tuesday night, with an eye-witness claiming the assailants were using bottles and knives. The fans were a part of two separate incidents the day before the Blues' trip to Galatasaray - the same area where two Leeds fans were attacked and killed in 2000, ahead of a UEFA Cup semi-final. Neither of the Chelsea fans were thought to be seriously hurt - one has a wound on the hand - and neither required hospital attention. The club were made aware of the incident. Worry: Two Chelsea fans have reportedly been stamped in Istanbul ahead of Chelsea vs Galatasaray . A 57-year-old fan, who preferred not to be named, was among those attacked and said: 'About 30 of them attacked a group of ten of us in the main street off Taksim Square. 'There were a few of them out looking for Chelsea. There were guys with bumps and bruises. 'I think tonight (Wednesday) will be worse.' Seb Owens, 22 from Putney, said: 'We were walking down the main drag looking for a pub when a huge group of them attacked us with bottles and knives. We had to split up to get away so I don't know how many were hurt.' The club's security experts will spend Wednesday investigating the incidents and speaking to fans in order to gather more information. Around 1,300 are expected at the ground for the last-16 clash. Tricky place to go: Galatasaray fans always make sure the atmosphere for visitors is forever hostile . Chelsea have to provide a report to UEFA, although it is up to the local police to deal with the issue primarily. Dave Johnstone, spokesman for the . Chelsea fanzine cfcuk, said: 'I'd say 99.9 per cent of people we have . met in Istanbul have been really nice and friendly. You can go to any . city in the world and find yourself in trouble. There is probably more . violence in parts of London. 'I . don't want to generalise about all Galatasaray or Turkish football . fans. There will always be the minority of people looking for trouble. My advice to those fans coming out today would be to be on your toes, be . wary. Don't go looking for trouble. Be friendly.' Johnstone . reports that he heard that a small group of Chelsea fans were 'rushed' and by locals purporting to be Galatasaray fans. He saw one fan who had . been stabbed in the buttock, one with a black eye and another who had . been beaten up. He described them as 'walking woundedere . Trouble: A Chelsea fan in Istanbul said that as many as 30 supporters attacked them on Tuesday . The Blues - who always have a Met police officer with them on European trips - had offered advice to travelling supporters on their website earlier this week. 'While Istanbul is generally a safe city and the police have not given any specific areas to be avoided (other than the Metro to the stadium on match day), supporters should be aware of pickpockets, petty theft and bag snatchers in crowded places,' it read. 'Care should be taken to keep bags and cameras secure and not to keep on show any other valuables. Supporters are advised to leave their passports in the hotel safe and use another form of photographic ID.' They routinely carry out an advance inspection of all European venues with a club official in advance of games. The Foreign Office confirmed it was investigating reports of the incidents which took place around Taksim Square. 'We are looking into reports,' said a spokeswoman. 'We have had no confirmation of an incident. If confirmed we stand ready to provide consular assistance.' Written in the stars: Petr Cech, training on Tuesday, knew he would face his old pal Didier Drogba . Best foot forward: Drogba (centre) leads team-mates in training before he faces the club where he is a legend . Meanwhile, Chelsea goalkeeper Petr . Cech said he saw this tie against Galatasaray coming. ‘It was written in . the stars,’ said Cech as he prepared to face Didier Drogba for the . first time since his friend left the club two years ago. They have not been on the same pitch since winning the Champions League in Munich. Cech saved three Bayern Munich . penalties that night in May 2012; Drogba headed a late equaliser, gave . away a penalty and struck the winning shoot-out spot-kick. ‘Didier is . one of those guys you would always want him beside you,’ said Cech. ‘He likes the challenge, he likes taking the responsibility and he is a winner. ‘By fighting for every inch you can bring the people with you and that’s what Didier did. ‘He loves the game. He plays with emotion and he could always bring people together with his emotions and his will to win.’ Iconic: Cech has a face of pure ecstasy as he celebrates Drogba's Champions League-winning penalty .

"Britain's biggest opera star, Bryn Terfel, is dating a married blonde virtuoso 20 years his junior. The Welsh bass-baritone is said to be on holiday in Spain with 27-year-old Hannah Stone, the Prince of Wales’s official harpist. Friends have told The Mail on Sunday that the couple are ‘very happy’ and planning a future together after they were spotted attending each other’s concerts and the relationship became known in classical music circles. Scroll down for audio . Hannah Stone, 27, is the official harpist for the Prince of Wales and as been spotted attending Terfel's concerts . Ms Stone is understood to have separated from her husband of two years, Gary Griffiths, a young Welsh singer, ironically dubbed ‘the next Bryn Terfel’. A source close to the harpist said: ‘Yes, they are seeing each other. Hannah’s in Spain with him [Terfel] at the moment.’ The millionaire star, 48, who tours the world performing repertoire from Wagner to Rogers and Hammerstein, divorced his wife of 30 years in 2012 after she left him for a younger man. But he is thought to have become close to Ms Stone after the pair performed together and she featured in a TV special hosted by Mr Terfel last Christmas. Last month he was seen with Ms Stone at the Fishguard Music Festival in South Wales, where she was performing. Ms Stone's husband, baritone Gary Griffiths (right) pictured with her new lover and opera star  Bryn Terfel (left) The Prince of Wales speaks with his official harpist Hannah Stone during a reception at his Welsh farm . Fan Trevor McCrory tweeted a picture of Mr Terfel helping her load her harp into the back of a car after the concert was over, and another of the couple saying goodbye to friends as they left the event together. When The Mail on Sunday suggested to Ms Stone’s friend and booking agent Gillian Green that the couple were not making a secret of the affair, she said: ‘Yes, I have spent an afternoon with them. Bryn was not playing at the concert, but he came along to it.’ Bryn Terfel divorced his wife of 25 years in 2012 after she left him for an unemployed father-of-one . Fishguard Festival manager Geraint Hodges said: ‘It’s not any great secret in music circles that they are a couple.’ Ms Stones, from Mumbles, South Wales, was appointed by Prince Charles in 2011 and regularly performs for royalty and at other high-profile occasions. She married Mr Griffiths in 2012, and until recently they seemed happy. Last October she tweeted: . ‘Really enjoyed Mid Wales Opera’s Albert Herring!! Me and @Gary-Griffiths chuckled all the way through it!’ Two months later she re-tweeted a message from her publicity agent, Harlequin – which also represents Mr Terfel – that she was to appear on a Christmas special with the star. Then just a few days before the show, Mr Terfel tweeted a picture showing Ms Stone gazing into her dressing room mirror, saying: ‘Hannah Stone, our beautiful royal harpist, getting ready for her solo.’ Mr Griffiths, a baritone who last week was performing in Cardiff at the UEFA Super Cup Final, has made no mention of the split from his wife on his Twitter account, but he has left the marital home, a luxury flat in the Cardiff bay area of the city. When The Mail on Sunday approached Mr Griffith’s father, Trevor, at the family home near Llanelli, South Wales, he said: ‘It’s rather personal and I would prefer to make no comment whatsoever.’ Mr Terfel divorced his wife of 25 years, Lesley, 48, in 2012 after she left him for an unemployed father of one, Ian Pleming, 27. The settlement reportedly cost him £8 million. Terfel and Stone’s agent was unavailable for comment.","It is understood Terfel is currently on holiday with Hannah Stone in Spain .

"A racing driver tipped as the next Lewis Hamilton is suing his GP for more than £300,0000 for allegedly missing his cancer and delaying his bid to become a Formula 1 champion. Three years ago, Dean Stoneman had won the Formula 2 world title and, at 20, was poised to enter Formula 1 racing having tested for Williams. But instead he was given the devastating news he had advanced testicular cancer after visiting his GP’s surgery for almost 18 months with symptoms of the aggressive disease. Victim: Formula 2 winner Dean Stoneman (pictured with Damon Hill) Lawsuit: Mr Stoneman is claiming compensation for pain, suffering and loss of earnings arising from an allegedly negligent consultation . Now Mr Stoneman, 23, is claiming compensation for pain, suffering and loss of earnings arising from an allegedly negligent consultation he had with Dr Paul Hemming in May 2010, when he was 19. According to papers lodged at London’s High Court, Mr Stoneman went to see Dr Hemming, complaining of enlarged breasts and sore nipples and pain and discomfort in his testicles. Mr Stoneman claims Dr Hemming said his symptoms were due to a ‘temporary hormone imbalance’, and failed to examine his testicles. In January 2011, Mr Stoneman saw a different GP who immediately referred him to a surgeon who diagnosed stage IV testicular cancer which had spread to his lungs and abdomen, giving him a 50 per cent chance  of survival. Mr Stoneman’s agent, Anthony Shaw, said: ‘Dean is in remission, but suffers from side effects of the intense chemo, including lack of feeling in his feet. But he is back driving for the GP3 series.’ Dr Hemming’s lawyers declined to comment last night.

"Businessman Ronald Stocker is not the first man to ‘trade his wife in’ for a younger model. But the multi-millionaire’s ex-wife – the mother of his 13-year-old son – opted for a decidedly 21st Century revenge. Instead of giving away the 63-year-old property developer’s favourite claret or chopping up his suits, Nicola Stocker took to the social media website Facebook to provide her rival with a devastating critique of him. Devastating critique: Nicola Stocker posted messages on the Facebook page of her ex-husband's new partner Deborah Bligh which accused him of trying to strangle her. Miss Bligh subsequently ended the relationship . After finding Deborah Bligh’s online page, the 46-year-old equestrian posted a series of damning messages – visible to all Miss Bligh’s Facebook friends – in which she said her ex-husband had tried to strangle her and was a love cheat. ‘I hear you have been together 2 years?’ she wrote. ‘If so u might like to ask him who he was in bed with the last time he was arrested. ‘Wouldn’t bring it up. Last time I accused him of cheating he spent a night in the cells, tried to strangle me. Police don’t take too kindly to finding your wife with your hand prints round her neck.’ In a barbed sign-off, she added: ‘But don’t worry, you will get a nice watch for Christmas!’ The withering messages were read in horror by Miss Bligh, a divorced mother of two. Court action: Ronald Stocker has, in response, issued a £150,000 writ for libel in the High Court against his ex-wife, which she intends to defend . But Ms Stocker – who had never met the younger woman – had more to say. She emailed Miss Bligh’s ex-husband too, saying she believed Mr Stocker had ‘deep psychological problems and anger management issues’. She also wrote: ‘He likes to watch porn and leaves the television on all night.’ This, apparently, proved the final straw for Miss Bligh, who walked out on Mr Stocker. As a result, the businessman has issued a £150,000 writ for libel in the High Court against his former wife, which she intends to defend. Mr Stocker, who lives in a £2 million detached house in Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, admits that his 2012 divorce – after 14 years of marriage – was ‘acrimonious’. His ex-wife, a professional event rider who runs her own stables, lives 20 minutes away, in her own £2.5 million detached property. She is currently being treated for breast cancer. Mr Stocker admits in the writ that, since May 2011, before his divorce, he had been in a relationship with Miss Bligh. But he claims that the email sent to Miss Bligh’s ex-husband last year implied that he was ‘a dangerous and thoroughly disreputable man’ as well as being ‘a vile, angry misogynist, who was psychologically unwell and unfit to look after children’. Ms Stocker, however, stands by her accusations and, according to her lawyer, vigorously contests her ex’s counter-claims. Mr Stocker is also seeking aggravated . damages due to ‘the gratuitous nature of her communications with Deborah . Bligh’. The posts were apparently widely read, causing Mr Stocker . ‘embarrassment and stress’. Miss Stocker's £2.5million Buckinghamshire home: Her ex-husband's claim is on hold while she battles cancer . A close friend of Mr Stocker said: ‘Ronald offered Nicola the chance to apologise and withdraw the comments. Ronald has now split up with Deborah because of all this. The incident that Nicola brought up was over 12 years ago. They were having an argument and Ronald put his hand over her mouth to stop her shouting because he thought it would wake their baby son Joshua up.’ David Price QC, representing Ms Stocker, said: ‘The court has ordered the claim to be put on hold as my client is receiving treatment for breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy on Wednesday. ‘But for this delay my client would either have applied to  strike out the claim or served a defence which would have set out her case.’","Ronald Stocker's ex-wife Nicola told his new lover that he was a love cheat .

"With the return of the Premier League this weekend, fans around the country got a chance to see their new signings in action for the first time. Whether they were playing their first game in English football or returning to their former club to play for a new side, the debutants carried a weight of expectation into the opening day of the season. From first goals to early injuries, Sportsmail's reporters pass their judgement on the new signings. Arsenal . By Jack Gaughan . Mathieu Debuchy - The Frenchman was slow to get forward down the right for the Gunners. Needs time to show what he can do in an Arsenal shirt to minimise the damage from Bacary Sagna’s move away. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mauricio Pochettino: Eric Dier was Tottenham's hero today . Slow start: Mathieu Debuchy was solid enough defensively but didn't offer Arsenal enough going forward . More to come: Alexis Sanchez did little to justify his price-tag on debut, but there is plenty of time to improve . Calum Chambers - Picked up a silly booking for hauling Fraizer Campbell down, but a solid and composed debut. Doesn’t look overawed whatsoever. Alexis Sanchez - A case of trying too hard, Sanchez looked bright but very little came off and the Chilean needs to play centrally. Excellent clipped delivery for Laurent Koscielny’s equaliser. Aston Villa . By Joe Bernstein . Aly Cissokho – Played better than anything he showed during his loan spell at Liverpool last season. Philippe Senderos – He always looks ungainly but the Swiss defender did stop a goal by clearing up after Brad Guzan’s spill from Phil Bardsley. Kieran Richardson – The pick of the Villa debutants. Thrived in a central role and set up an easy chance for Gabriel Agbonlahor that was fluffed. Impressive: Cissoko looked assured at left back, which will calm the nerves of Villa fans who saw him last year . Excellent: Kieran Richardson put in an impressive display on debut for Villa, running hard and creating chances . Crystal Palace . By Jack Gaughan . Martin Kelly - Didn’t have a man to mark directly but kept his concentration and marauded down the right with purpose. Brede Hangeland - Classy glanced header put Palace ahead, but he was then guilty of losing Koscielny for the equaliser. Rising high: Hangeland escapes Koscielny to head in Palace's goal but he lost the same man for the equaliser . Fraizer Campbell - Found himself isolated on occasion, but did well to hold the ball up in tricky circumstances and it was important that the visitors had a focal point. Hull City . By Sami Mokbel . Drifter: Tom Ince showed flashes of his undoubted talent but will need to get into games more . Andrew Robertson - Looks a shrewd acquisition by Steve Bruce. Patrolled the left side with boundless energy. Robert Snodgrass - Fitted comfortably into midfield for Hull before a knee injury forced him off in the 40th minute. Tom Ince - Drifted in and out of the game. A lot more to come from the talented youngster. Leicester City . By Nick Harris . Leanardo Ulloa - Leicester paid a club £8m for the Argentinian striker and he notched a debut Premier League goal  to start repaying it. Promising. Joy: Ulloa scored 22 minutes into his Leicester career as he looks to pay back their significant investment . Liverpool . By Dominic King . Dejan Lovren - Some fine cross field passing, a few thumping challenges but also some less refined moments of play. Brendan Rodgers called him excellent. Javier Manquillo - Could have found things difficult after he was booked early on but the right-back defended well and showed enough good moments going forward for a satisfying debut. Rickie Lambert - Came on as a late substitute and his presence appeared to unsettle Southampton’s defence, leading to Liverpool’s winning goal. Assured: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers described Dejan Lovren's as excellent following Sunday's win . Presence: Rickie Lambert came on from the bench and unsettled the Southampton backline at Anfield . VIDEO New signings excellent - Rogers . Manchester United . By Rob Draper . Tyler Blackett - No better, no worse than his more experienced colleagues but in truth the United defence looked as vulnerable as ever and a centre half must be their top priority in the transfer market. Booked on 83 minutes. Jesse Lingard - Desperately disappointing: a bruising encounter with Ashley Williams ended his debut after just 24 minutes. Not out of place: Blackett looked no worse than his fellow defenders but United were shaky at the back . A cut above: Despite a lack of movement around him Herrera made a good impression on his United debut . Ander Herrera - Passes the ball beautifully and looks an improvement to United’s midfield. The problem was there was so little dynamism about his team-mates, so it was hard to judge just how effective he might be long term. Queens Park Rangers . By Sami Mokbel . Steven Caulker - Promising debut from the centre back. No reason why he can’t break back into the England fold. Rio Ferdinand - Deployed as a sweeper in QPR’s new-look 3-5-2 system, but marking let him down for Hull opener. Sweeping up: Rio Ferdinand had a pivotal role in Harry Redknapp's defensive system, but it did not go to plan . At fault: Ferdinand allows Hull's James Chester to escape him and head in the game's only goal . Jordon Mutch - Showed brilliant energy in the Rangers midfield. Looks to be an excellent signing by Redknapp. Southampton . By Dominic King . Fraser Forster - Beaten twice but could do nothing about either goal. Never had a shot to save. When he had to handle, he did so with confidence. Ryan Bertrand - Got up and down the left flank with great frequency, he and Southampton will benefit from him playing regular games. Head over heels: Fraser Forster gave a confident display in the Southampton goal against Liverpool . Graziano Pelle - Found everything happening a bit too quickly and never had enjoy from Lovren and Martin Skrtel. Dusan Tadic - A threat from early on, passed the ball well and created chances most notably when his sweet back heel sent Nathaniel Clyne through for the equaliser. Shane Long - Could have been a hero on his debut but somehow managed to head wide when the goal was at his mercy following Schneiderlin’s shot. Horror miss: New Saints striker Shane Long holds his head in his hands after heading wide from close range . Stoke City . By Joe Bernstein . Phil Bardsley – Dependable, as you’d expect the ex-Sunderland full-back to be. Had one shot parried by Guzan. Bojan Krkic – Pleasing on the eye with his quick feet but not enough end product. Biram Mame Diouf – Ran hard and fast but didn’t get in the penalty area often enough for a centre forward. Robust: Bardsley made, as expected, a solid start to life at Stoke City, and should suit them . Potential: Ex-Barcelona striker Bojan has bags of potential but needs to find a bit more cutting edge . Sunderland . By Craig Hope . Patrick van Aanholt – Combative and energetic, the Dutch left back slotted straight in to the Sunderland backline and laid on Seb Larsson's late equaliser. He looks an assured addition. Jack Rodwell – He's only played seven Premier League games in two years and Manchester City and it showed. He was off the pace and subdued and it came as no surprise when he was replaced in the second half. Off the pace: Jack Rodwell needs regular game time if he is to recapture the form that led Man City to sign him . Swansea City . By Rob Draper . Lukasz Fabianski - Looked solid enough. No sign of the ‘flappy hands’ that earned him his Arsenal nickname. Made some good saves and seems like a decent addition. Jefferson Montero - Only had 25 minutes but provided the key cross which led to Swansea’s second goal. Showed good pace. As such, the Ecuadorian appears to be unfazed by the initial transition to the Premier League. Impact: Gylfi Sigurdsson, on his return to the Swansea team, smashed home the winner at Old Trafford . Bright start: Despite only being on the pitch for a short while Bafetimbi Gomis showed encouraging signs . Bafetimbi Gomis - Only had 13 minutes, but holds the ball up really well and almost combined with Sigurdsson to create a third, only Phil Jones crunching challenge saving the day for United. Gylfi Sigurdsson - Not a debut as such, but a return to Swansea. And he has been missed. Given free rein behind the striker, Sigurdsson is a good player and on Saturday he excelled in the space he was granted. Tottenham . By Matt Barlow . Eric Dier - What a way to endear yourself to Spurs fans, with a coolly taken last-minute winner at West Ham. Dier started at centre half and switch to right back after Spurs were reduced to 10 men after 30 minutes. He looked composed in both positons. Dream debut: Eric Dier rounds Adrian to score the stoppage time winner for Spurs at Upton Park . Love at first sight: The goal, along with Dier's solid defense display, will have pleased the Spurs fans . West Brom . By Craig Hope . Andre Wisdom – Suspect in possession on occasions but athletic nonetheless and kept Adam Johnson quiet. Craig Gardner – Came close to a debut goal against his former club and was typically busy and involved throughout. He provided the cross for his side's second goal and could prove a shrewd acquisition. Sebastien Pocognoli – He's got a thunderous left boot and that showed on the occasions he did take aim at Sunderland's goal. He looks ready-made for the Premier League. West Ham . By Matt Barlow . Aaron Cresswell - Solid at left back and not intimidated on his Premier League debut after a summer move from Ipswich. Defended well early on and made good decisions on when and where to join the attack. Could not stop Eric Dier scoring the late winner. Promising start: Cresswell defended well after making the step up from the Championship . Chiekhou Kouyate - Senegal midfielder from Belgian football. Athletic, strong and full of running. Diving header fizzed wide in the first half. Less influential after the break. Booked.","Alexis Sanchez makes his first appearance in the Premier League after joining Arsenal from Barcelona .

"Vodafone has come last in a series of checks by evaluators RootMetrics, who named it the provider most likely to cut you off . If you can’t make a personal appearance on Mother’s Day, it’s usually best to at least accompany your flowers with a phone call. But you may want to avoid Vodafone, which a major national analysis has named as the network most likely to cut you off. The most reliable was EE, which was also named the best all-round operator. Network evaluators RootMetrics conducted 840,000 checks and ranked the four main operators across a range of categories – overall performance, call performance, mobile internet, texting, network reliability and network speed. Vodafone came last in all categories other than network speed, where it came second-last ahead of Three. While EE performed best across all categories, Three was a close second in terms of reliability during the six-month study conducted last year. The network also came second in terms of mobile internet and text services. O2 came second in the call performance and network speed categories, but its reliability was better only than Vodafone’s. Overall, EE was top on 84.6 per cent, Three second on 73.5 per cent, O2 third on 66.5 per cent and Vodafone last on 52.4 per cent. Three said the study was ‘carried out prior to our launch of 4G at no extra cost, so is not up to speed with our current performance’. RootMetrics chief executive  Bill Moore said the testing was designed to get as close to consumer experience as possible. ‘It is all  very well to test speeds, but if you can’t get on the network, the speed is irrelevant.’ He added that the UK networks’ failure rate, at two per cent, was four times higher than in the US. A Vodafone spokeswoman said: ‘The testing does not appear to follow standard industry practices or be fully impartial, while it also incorporates data some of which  may well be over six months old.’ Overall, EE was top on 84.6 per cent, Three second on 73.5 per cent and O2 third on 66.5 per cent .","Network evaluators RootMetrics did 850,000 checks on top four operators .

"So close: Jack wowed the crowd on BGT's grand finale, but lost out to Hungarian theatre group Attraction . Britain's Got Talent star Jack Carroll was getting tips on comedy from disgraced comedian Jason Manford to perpare for his act on last night's final. Despite the words of wisdom given to 14-year-old Jack in the lead up to the finale show, he lost out on the top prize to Hungarian theatre group Attraction. After losing out on the top spot, the teenage comedian took his defeat in good humour. The schoolboy, who has cerebral palsy, struck up a friendship with stand-up Jason Manford when he appeared on The One Show in 2010, just before Manford resigned from the BBC programme after admitting sending sexual messages to female fans on Twitter. Huddersfield-born Jack said: ‘We’ve always kept in touch and Jason has been helping me out with my act. 'Over . the past week I have been talking to him on the phone every night. Jason is helping me polish up my act and making it more professional. He’s been brilliant.’ Jack has also been taking career advice from Britain’s Got Talent judge David Walliams. ‘David . is my favourite judge – hopefully he will one day be a colleague in the . industry,’ he said. ‘I love watching his TV series. We’ve talked about . agents and who  I should get to represent me. ‘But he said I had a long career ahead of me, so I don’t need to rush in. I would like to work with David in the future – Little Britain was one of the inspirations for my act.’ Jack went into the final as second favourite, behind Hungarian shadow theatre group Attraction. In stitches: 14-year-old Jack had hosts Ant and Dec laughing. He had received words of advice from comedians Jason Manford, Peter Kay and BGT judge David Walliams . Before the verdict: Jack and the members of Attraction were left to battle it out for the title of BGT winner . In good humour: Jack Carroll continued to joke around once he heard he was the runner-up . He became an overnight success when he appeared in the audition and told Simon Cowell he was ‘a professional gymnast’. He said: ‘It has all got a bit crazy since I first appeared. People certainly recognise me, which feels a bit odd. 'Girls come up to me and ask for my photo in the street. Who knows?

"It's one of the best-known hits of his remarkable, 50-year career. And the words to Do Ya Think I’m Sexy may well have been running through Penny Lancaster’s head as she performed a raunchy, impromptu pole-dance for Rod Stewart on their holiday yacht. The 68-year-old rocker couldn’t take his eyes off his 42-year-old model wife as, in cropped pink top and black jeans and with blonde hair flying, she cavorted in front of him. Penny, the mother of two of Rod’s eight children, giggled as she gyrated round a deck post on the yacht during the Stewart family break in St Tropez in the South of France last week.

All at sea: Penny limbers up as her besotted husband watches from the deck of their holiday yacht . Moments earlier, the pair looked more like honeymooners than a married couple when they embraced for a smoochy dance. Then Penny limbered up in front of Rod before discarding her pink sweater and throwing herself into action. It’s possible that Penny was secretly hoping Rod would remember a few of her professional-looking dance moves – after he was spotted earlier in the holiday performing a bizarre routine of his own. During a shore break with friends, Rod broke into a sequence of strange, robotic-type moves as he strolled along the quayside. Dressed in white shirt and trousers accompanied by a cricket-style cardigan, orange-and-white shoes and rock star shades, he had his companions in stitches as he walked along swinging his arms out to his sides and above his head. Rod and his clan were clearly in high spirits during their Mediterranean break – but then he has had plenty to celebrate.

Rod’s new album Time, his first collection of self-penned songs for 20 years, hit the top of the charts last month. And he has revealed that one of the tracks on it was inspired by the pain of a two-week separation from Penny after she walked out on him. They enjoyed a subsequent reunion and are now clearly closer than ever. During their break the couple visited the beach with their two children, seven-year-old Alastair and Aiden, three. At the beach, Penny displayed her sun-tanned physique to perfection when she bounced enthusiastically on a trampoline in a sporty kit of white shirt and matching shorts. As the couple basked in the sunshine on the deck of their yacht, Rod, whose other hits include the worldwide No 1 Sailing, tweeted a picture of himself with his feet up, under the heading ‘Putting me sea legs to work’. Penny is Rod’s third wife. He was married to model Rachel Hunter for 16 years until 2006, and to actress Alana Hamilton for five years until 1984.","Rocker and wife Penny Lancaster holidaying in South of France .

"She said she had quit competitive showjumping for the sake of her unborn baby. But yesterday – to the surprise of a few early morning spectators and photographers – pregnant Zara Phillips was back in the saddle at a professional event. Zara, 32, was playing the role of ‘guinea pig’ for the dressage at the Festival of British Eventing at Gatcombe Park. Zara Phillips, showing a hint of her growing baby bump, was back in the saddle today shortly after her announcement that she was quitting competitive riding while pregnant . With her baby bump clearly showing, . Zara did the test-run for the judges to help them decide how to mark the . official riders at Gatcombe, the Gloucestershire home of her mother the . Princess Royal. Riding her horse High Kingdom, she looked happy and relaxed as she performed the dressage sequence. Zara, a keen three-day eventer, . originally said she would continue riding professionally for as long as . possible – a decision that sparked worldwide debate. But last month she changed her mind, saying she would quit all competitions. The Queen's granddaughter was not competing in the Festival of British Eventing, however, but doing a 'guinea pig' trial to help judges decide how to mark riders . Zara and her husband Mike Tindall, 34, . the former England rugby captain, announced they were having their . first child last month and the baby is due early in the new year. Despite giving up competitive riding, Zara has made it clear she still intends to ride privately as her horses need exercising. Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge lifted the . lid on his first days of fatherhood as he made his first public . appearance since the birth of Prince George at a charity polo match . admitting he would be picking up nappies on his way home. William . took a break from parenting duties to play in the Audi Polo Challenge . at Coworth Park, Ascot, Berkshire alongside brother Harry today. The . 31-year-old, who scored the winning goal for his team, was presented . with a mini polo stick for Prince George by Audi UK director Martin . Sander after the match. The Duke of Cambridge made his first public appearance since introducing his newborn son to the world at the Audi Polo Challenge today . William jokingly asked if it was nappies, quipping: 'I've got to pick some up on my way home.' The royal admitted it was 'good to get out of the house' for an afternoon. Meeting guests afterwards, he added: 'I've got to make sure I'm not too late back.' Of . his performance on the pitch, William admitted: 'I was in baby mode out . there, thinking about nappies, I wasn't really in the zone.' William was joined by his brother Harry for the annual charity event, held at the Coworth Polo Club in Ascot . Harry, left, and William, right, joined the four-man Audi Quattro for today's match . Onlookers said that pregnant Zara looked 'very fit and well' as she performed a dressage trial in the parade ring at Gatcombe . A handful of spectators and photographers were at Princess Anne's country estate to see Zara perform the guinea pig trial ahead of today's events . Zara, wearing her usual competition riding gear, will not compete again until after her baby is born . And asked about son George, who was . born on July 22, he said: 'He likes to move around a lot, he wriggles a . lot, he keeps on our toes.' The . Audi Polo Challenge is held each year and this year was in aid of . charities SkillForce and The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, of which . William is patron and president respectively. Kate . attended last year's match, along with the couple's puppy Lupo, to . support William and Harry, but there was no sign of her today. She is thought to be at her parents' home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, with Prince George. Yesterday . Kensington Palace announced that the birth of the third-in-line to the . throne had been formally registered after a registrar from Westminster . City Council visited the palace. William, . 31, signed the birth register entry for his son, listing his and wife . Kate's jobs as prince and princess of the United Kingdom. William wore a polo jersey with the logos of SkillForce and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity, of which he is patron and president respectively . Harry has joked that the birth of his nephew Prince George had taken the pressure of him to settle down . The RAF search and rescue pilot is currently on paternity leave but is expected to return to work at some point next week. His next official public engagement will be to visit the Anglesey Show later this month. An announcement on his future plans is expected within the next fee months. William . and Harry, 28, who yesterday joked about how his nephew's birth had . taken the pressure off him to settle down, both played on the four-man . Audi Quattro team as they took on the opposition Audi Ultra team. The royals were watched by guests including former England rugby player Matt Dawson. Harry and William are regular supporters of the annual event at the Coworth Polo Club in Ascot, Berkshire . Peter Cross, chief executive of . SkillForce, an education charity which helps hard-to-reach children, who . was in the crowd, said: 'This is fantastic. It is the third time that . Audi have had SkillForce as one of the sponsored charities for the royal . polo and we are really grateful for that. 'It's . fantastic that the Duke of Cambridge's first public outing since the . birth of his child is playing polo and SkillForce is a beneficiary of . that. 'It's interesting that his last public engagement before his wedding was with SkillForce as well. 'It is a very close relationship, he is a wonderful royal patrol and he takes a very close interest.

'The duke and duchess have been enormously generous with their support for us.' 'I am so happy that they have their son now and their support, from both of them, is amazing.' She . said the huge attention drawn by the William and Kate and their son . meant the hospital would also be able to draw more attention to its work . to find better ways to treat and diagnose patients. Today's . event was the 11th annual Audi Polo Challenge - its first included both . William and Harry as well as their father the Prince of Wales. Support: Wellwishers made a banner for Prince Charles visist which read 'Hi Grampa' Meanwhile, The Prince of Wales received baby gifts from wellwishers during a visit to the world's smallest Highland games competition today. Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, attended the Mey Games in Caithness in his role as chieftain of the event. Charles drove to the event himself and emerged from his car wearing a Rothesay tartan kilt and carrying a traditional shepherd's crook.

A banner was draped from a nearby building featuring a stork carrying a bundle with a baby and crown, and the words: 'Hi grampa.' He was given baby gifts and a card from wellwishers, and was seen to be in good spirits with locals despite some torrential downpours. Charles judged the Highland games competition and officiated at a tug of war. The games have been held annually for more than 40 years and are organised by the Royal British Legion. Charles is continuing a tradition by visiting the games as his grandmother used to attend annually before her death in 2002. The Queen Mother had close links with Caithness after buying the Castle of Mey in 1952 and became patron of the games soon after. The Prince of Wales laughs as a tug of war team member falls over while he judges the competition . The Prince of Wales enjoys himself at the games where he was given a bouquet of flowers . Charles watches a martial arts display during his visit to the Mey Games in Caithness, Scotland . Organiser Stuart Webster said: 'It's the only Highland games apart from Braemar that enjoys royal patronage, and that's always an attraction for people. 'The Duke is the games chieftain and has attended all the events since the Queen Mother passed away. She was there every year and he stepped in after her death and has attended ever since. He certainly seems to enjoy it - he keeps coming back so it can't be that bad.' The Prince of Wales judges the Tug of War as Chieftain of the Mey Highland Games (right) during his visit to the Mey Games in Caithness . Mr Webster has been involved in organising the event for more than a decade as part of the British Legion. 'I haven't been at a smaller games,' he said. 'I used to compete across the Highlands and I've been to a fair few games and this has the title of the smallest Highland games anywhere. I guess it makes it more friendly.' He added: 'The weather doesn't matter - we've held it in lashing rain many times.' Prince Philip, 92, will be back in public next Monday for the first time since going into hospital in June. He will be in Scotland to present medals to Royal Society of Edinburgh fellows.","The Queen's granddaughter has quit competitions during her pregnancy .

"A British holidaymaker has allegedly been raped in her hotel room by a security guard at the popular Egyptian resort where she was staying. The guard had been escorting the lone woman back to a five-star hotel in Sharm-el-Sheikh when it is believed he pulled her into her bedroom and subjected her to the brutal assault. The alleged victim, a businesswoman in her 40s, was given emergency help by the British Consulate in the Red Sea resort. A British businesswoman, believed to be in her 40s, was allegedly raped by a security guard walked her back to her room in a five-star hotel in Sharm-el-Sheikh . The attack comes as the Foreign Office warns about a rise in cases of sexual assault against Britons in Egypt  since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, including in hotels. The victim has been flown back to Britain, and Hampshire Police are now leading the investigation. She has been interviewed by detectives but may have to return to Egypt. It is understood she is recovering at home with the help of friends and relations. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are aware of an incident involving a British national. We are providing assistance.’ Its website warns British tourists about a rise in crime. It goes on to say: ‘Reports of cases of sexual assault against British nationals have increased during and since the unrest of early 2011. ‘In 2012, the FCO handled  23 cases of sexual assault and six cases of rape. ‘Some assaults were against minors. Many occurred in what were considered to be safe places such as hotels. ‘Assaults have occurred in taxis and on microbuses. The Egyptian resort was attacked by terrorists before but has remained popular with British sun-seekers . ‘If you are travelling on a microbus, avoid being the last passenger left on the bus. Women should take extra care when travelling alone.’ According to figures from the Egyptian government, there have been three rapes in Sharm-el-Sheikh over the past two years and numerous incidents in which tourists have been sexually harassed by hotel staff. The resort has also been subjected to a number of terrorist attacks and in 2005 11 Britons were among  88 people killed by bombs. Last month, Germany evacuated the resort of its nationals amid new terror threats, though the Foreign Office said it was not advocating similar action. However, the resort has remained hugely popular with British holidaymakers as a destination for winter sun.

"Zara Phillips has said she wants to compete in the World Eventing Championship next August after giving birth . Zara Phillips's pregnancy came as a complete ‘shock’ to her – disrupting her eventing schedule and forcing her out of the saddle. The revelation came from her husband Mike Tindall during the couple’s first joint interview about  the pregnancy. Interviewed by Australian Women’s Weekly, Mike said with a laugh: ‘It probably happened quicker than we thought – bit of a shock, really.’ But he admitted that once the surprise had worn off, they realised the timing was perfect.With the child due in January, it means Zara, 32, will still be on track to train for major eventing competitions next year. Zara was heavily criticised during the summer for continuing to ride during the early stages of her pregnancy. Despite making it clear she would not yield to pressure from her critics, she has now  given up riding – and has taken  up baking instead. The 2012 Olympic silver medal winner said: ‘I have been riding, but it’s so uncomfortable. So, yes, I’m baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.’ But the Queen’s granddaughter insisted she will be back in the saddle after the birth. She even hopes to compete in the World Eventing Championship next August and will take her baby with her on the eventing circuit – which is what her mother Princess Anne did after Zara was born. The couple do not know if the baby is a boy or a girl and Mike, 35, said: ‘We want it to be a surprise. I’m really looking forward to it, but I’m not sure how I’ve prepared. We’ve been pretty relaxed. We’ve not sorted a nursery yet. ‘We have ordered some stuff, but we haven’t gone further than  that. I think we’re both quite  well-balanced and laid-back as a couple, so hopefully he or she will pick up on that.’ Zarah, granddaughter to the Queen, says pregnancy came much quicker than she expected and has disrupted her eventing schedule . Zara added: ‘I hope we’re going to make good parents – that’s the plan.’ The couple also talked about the time Mike bought a racehorse, Monbeg Dude, at an auction five years ago for £12,000, without  Zara knowing anything about it. After the sale, Zara described  him as an ‘idiot’ and she told the magazine: ‘I thought it was a stupid idea. But he got lucky and it’s worked out well.’ The horse is now worth more than £200,000. Mike, the son of a social worker, has come to appreciate the racing world through his wife. The rugby star said: ‘Before I met Zara,  I didn’t go to meets. I used to work at them on a fish and chip van at York races. But I like getting dressed up. It’s a fun day out.’","The Queen's granddaughter has said pregnancy came as a surprise .

"When David Beckham spoke last year of how he gets up to cook breakfast for his children, it was hailed as a fine example of hands-on parenting. But it seems that when it comes to the truth, no one bends it like Beckham. His wife Victoria, 38, has now rubbished his version of events – saying that it is she who gets up to cook while David, 37, lies in bed – and jokingly labelled her husband a ‘liar’ in an interview with Elle, the same magazine that carried David’s initial claims. Contradiction: David Beckham previously claimed that he woke at 6:45am on an average day to make his children breakfast. But his wife Victoria contradicted him and said that she often takes no the job . Last summer, David said that on a typical day he would wake up at 6.45am, before his children, to ensure ‘breakfast is all ready for them, cooked by me’. He added: ‘My oldest son, Brooklyn, likes these croissants with jam on. My middle son, Romeo, he loves fruit, he loves mango and pineapple. 'Cruz loves Nutella on a croissant. And I have any scraps that are left over.’ But describing her typical day this week, Victoria tells how she gets dressed, checks her emails then ‘makes the kids’ breakfast’. When told that her husband said last year that he makes the children’s breakfast, she said: ‘Well, he lied. He lied. 'Let me tell you now, he is not the . one. I’m always like, “Go and shake Daddy and get him out of bed, tell . him that he has to take you to school.” ’ Get him up: Victoria jokingly called her husband a 'liar' and said she often tells her children to 'Go and shake Daddy and get him out of bed' Children: Victoria, seen here with sons Cruz and Romeo, described a typical day, saying she gets dressed, checks her emails then 'makes the kids' breakfast' The couple have four children, Brooklyn, 13, Romeo, 10, Cruz, seven, and one-year-old Harper. The businesswoman whose fashion label is now renowned throughout the world said she never switches off. She claimed she has not had a holiday for four years: 'A lot of people don’t have holidays.

"Disgraced former Minister Chris Huhne has been caught breaking the traffic laws yet again, by driving the wrong way up a one-way street. Pictured in his Toyota Prius, he edged out of a narrow side road and, risking yet another three points on his licence, turned right instead of left. Even allowing for Huhne’s famed hubris, the timing of his latest transgression, revealed for the first time today, is remarkable. Against the tide: Chris Huhne illegally turns right out of Eagle Court, on to one-way St John's Lane, his blue Toyota Prius travelling the wrong way . Mid-manoeuvre: The one-way sign clearly shows Mr Huhne has been breaking the law as he exits St John's Lane, turning right on to St John's Street . It happened just four weeks before his trial, at which he admitted asking his former wife Vicky Pryce to take speeding points for him in 2003. In other words, it was at a time when one might expect him to have exercised granny-like caution behind the wheel. But as the events of the past few weeks have demonstrated, Huhne’s regard for the rules of the road – and the laws of the land in general – can be decidedly casual. Along with Miss Pryce, he now faces a prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. The one-way infraction happened on January 11 on a street two minutes from Mr Huhne’s £1.25 million home in London’s fashionable Clerkenwell. He left his flat and headed for Eagle Court, a narrow road which he used to cut through to St John’s Lane, where he executed the illegal right turn. Four days later, his lawyers were in court battling without success to get the speeding points case thrown out. Then, just as the trial was due to start, Huhne changed his plea to guilty. Mission accomplished: But is that a guilty look on Mr Huhne's face as he drives off into the London traffic? Uneasy rider: Chris Huhne can be seen cycling on the pavement near Waterloo, London, left, and making a right turn while ignoring a traffic sign on the same day he was pictured driving the wrong way down a one-way road . Drivers in his London borough who break the one-way rule face a £130 fixed penalty fine on the spot, if caught on camera, reduced to £65 if they pay within 14 days. However, if caught by a police officer, they can face a charge of careless driving and the possibility of three penalty points. If Huhne, 58, had been lost in an unfamiliar city, his behaviour might have drawn some sympathy. But having lived in Clerkenwell for more than a year with new partner, Carina Trimingham, he is thought to be familiar with the streets in his vicinity. Especially as he often cycles in the area. Not that he is necessarily any safer on two wheels. On the same day he was pictured driving his car the wrong way along a one-way street, he had earlier ignored a no-right-turn sign while cycling in the Waterloo area, in breach of the Highway Code. And last year he was also photographed cycling the wrong way along a one-way road. In his defence, when Mr Huhne committed his latest driving offence there were no signs in Eagle Court warning him not to turn right. Nor was there a sign opposite the Eagle Court entrance indicating he should turn left into  St John’s Lane. New signs have been put up since the incident, however. And here he does it again, this time on a bike: Mr Huhne is pictured cycling the wrong way down a on-way road near his home last February . Disrespect for the law: The disgraced former MP Chris Huhne has admitted asking his former wife Vicky Pryce, pictured right, to take speeding points for him in 2003 . The seeds of Huhne’s recent downfall . were sown in 2003 when a speed camera caught his BMW doing 69mph on a . 50mph stretch of the M11. With nine points already on his licence, he . asked Pryce to claim she had been driving. She . eventually agreed. But he still got a ban. Just 16 days later, he was . caught using his mobile telephone while driving, and disqualified for . six months. Two years later, after he was appointed Lib Dem environment . spokesman, he traded in his cherished BMW for a ‘greener’ Toyota Prius. Pryce, 60, was last week found guilty of perverting the course of . justice by taking speeding points on Huhne’s behalf. The judge warned . the pair faced jail. Last . night Mr Huhne said there wasn’t a ‘no right turn sign’ in Eagle Court . at the time of the incident. ‘I suggest there was no offence,’ he said, . adding: ‘I haven’t obviously turned right there since the sign was put . up.’ But on January 11, there were two one-way signs at either end of St John’s Lane. And Islington Council has confirmed St John’s Lane has been a one-way street for years. Mr Huhne added: ‘Until that right turn sign was erected, it [making an illegal right turn] was a very common thing for residents to do because apart from anything else they couldn’t get through [nearby] Cowcross Street.’ His comment suggests that if he had turned left, his path would have been blocked, but it would only have meant him taking a longer route. Hearing: Vicky Pryce (left) and her the . ex-husband, Britain's former energy secretary Chris Huhne (right), will . be sentenced together for perverting the course of justice on Monday afternoon - and probably face jail .","Infraction happened on a street two minutes from the former minister's £1.25 million home in .

"Veteran war correspondent Marie Colvin inserted a clause into her will expressly designed to stop her former husband benefiting from her £1.1 million estate,The Mail on Sunday has learned. Journalist and author Patrick Bishop was ‘mystified and upset’ last night to find she had gone to such lengths. Friends were equally baffled as the pair were apparently on good terms. Bishop said he would never have challenged the will, nor did he expect to inherit any part of 56-year-old Colvin’s estate. Indeed, having remarried two years before the document was drawn up, he would have been legally unable to do so. Fiery: Marie Colvin, left, may have been upset with her former husband Patrick Bishop, right, when she wrote the will, say friends . Both he and Colvin had remarried since their divorce nearly 20 years ago, but had apparently remained good friends until she was killed by Syrian army shelling in the besieged city of Homs last February, while on assignment for The Sunday Times. Despite their closeness, however, she went out of her way to specify that he should not be among the beneficiaries of her will. The document, drawn up in 2010, stated: ‘I wish to make it known that Patrick Bishop, my former spouse, is deliberately not named in my last will and testament. I do not wish him to inherit from it, and I make this clause expressly known should he attempt to contest it.’ A legal source confirmed that under the 1975 Inheritance Act, former spouses or civil partners can contest a will only if they have not themselves remarried. Shocked Bishop, 60, said last night: ‘I didn’t know what was in the will and it’s rather upsetting to hear.’ Ms Colvin gives an address at St. Bride's Church in November 2010, saying: 'We always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story' He insisted he never had any intention of contesting the will, adding: ‘Nothing could be further from my mind. I don’t know what is behind it. We were on good terms and it’s a complete mystery to me.’ The pair married in 1989 but had  a tempestuous relationship and divorced in the early Nineties. US-born Colvin’s second marriage, in 1996 to a Bolivian journalist, was even briefer. One old friend of Colvin was last night equally baffled by the will’s contents, but suggested the famously fiery journalist might have been temporarily upset with Bishop when she wrote it. ‘As far as I know they were on pretty good terms when she died,’ said the friend, who declined to be named. ‘I’m sure there was no deep animosity between them. ‘More likely is that she was miffed at something he’d said or written at the time she drew up the will, and in a fit of pique just decided to add a clause which said “**** you, Bishop!” and probably would have forgotten about it the following day. ‘It’s a shame, really, because few people were there for her as much as Patrick – he may well have saved her life in Chechnya.’ After their divorce, Colvin and Bishop were reunited in 2000 in the most dramatic fashion when she was reporting on the war between Chechnya and Russia. Foreign correspondent Marie Colvin was killed by a Syrian shell in the besieged city of Homs last year . She became trapped with rebel fighters as the Russians surrounded their position, leaving only a treacherous 12,000ft mountain pass to Georgia as their escape. In an  eight-day midwinter journey, she waded through chest-high snow and braved altitude sickness, hunger and exposure. Bishop, also a foreign correspondent, heard of her predicament and set off from Paris to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. There, together with her colleague Jon Swain, he helped to organise  a helicopter from the US Embassy to pluck her off the mountainside  to safety. As Colvin wrote: ‘I was never happier to have an American passport.’ Similarly, in 2001, when she was badly injured and lost an eye from a grenade explosion in Sri Lanka, it was Bishop she turned to, describing him as her ‘nurse’. Bishop is now a successful author of books such as Bomber Boys, about the Second World War pilots of Bomber Command, and Follow Me Home and 3 Para, which both chart the British Army’s bloody campaign in Helmand Province. In 2008 he married writer Henrietta Miers and they live in West London with their young daughter. He paid fulsome tribute to Colvin after she and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed by Syrian forces at a makeshift press centre in Homs. It was believed they were deliberately targeted.

"The British Army is embroiled in a damaging row after the first Sikh soldier allowed to wear a turban rather than a bearskin on ceremonial duties suffered abuse from his colleagues. Guardsman Jatinderpal Singh Bhullar, 25, who joined the Scots guards this year, has been given permission to wear a turban outside Buckingham Palace, breaking hundreds of years of tradition. The decision by Army bosses has proved controversial with Bhullar's fellow soldiers. The Army's Sikh chaplian has told The Mail on Sunday that Bhullar has endured taunts about his turban and his refusal to cut his hair and his beard. Making a point: Guardsman Bhullar, pictured here in a video taken during his airborne training, will be the first Sikh soldier to guard the Palace without a bearskin . Comrades in arms: Simranjit Singh and Sarvjit Singh are two Sikh soldiers in the Army . Bhullar is based at Wellington Barracks in Birdcage Walk. The base is used by soldiers from the Scots Guards' F Compan, who at present are responsible for public duties and guarding the Queen. According to military sources, Bhullar, who is from Birmingha, is expected to parade for the first time next week. When he marches with his colleagues he will become the first guardsman not wear a bearskin. Traditionalists in the Scots Guard say the allowances made for Bhullar will make the whole company look ridiculous to tourists and onlookers. The regiment traces its origins back to 1642 and its soldiers have worn bearskins on parade since 1832. The Mail on Sunday was initially approached by serving non-commissioned officers based at Wellington Barracks, who were angry that the MoD had compromised centuries of history for the sake of one soldier. The argument presented by Bhullar's colleagues was backed by senior members of the Scots Guards' regimental association. Unlike serving personnel, these retired officers are allowed to speak publicly. Tradition: Scots Guardsmen have worn bearskins since 1832 . David Cuthill, chairman of the Dundee . branch, said today: 'It should be regiment first and religion second. A . guardsman is not a guardsman if he's not wearing his bearskin. 'Hundreds . of years of tradition should be protected. I appreciate his . predicament, but if all the other guardsmen are in bearskins and he is . in a turban, it is going to look ridiculous.' As a devout Sikh, it is mandatory for Bhullar to wear a turban. It is intended to protect his hair, when he never cuts, and to keep it clean. For centuries, Skihs have worn turbans in battle and fought as part of the British Army - including Bhullar's grandfather, who served in the Second World War. Bhullar's father has spoken of his pride and condemned the bullies. Surinder Bhullar, 47, from Slough, Berkshire, said: 'He deserves respect and he will stay strong. That includes wearing his turban instead of a bearskin, no matter what other soldiers say. He is observing his religion.' Bhullar was a bricklayer before joining the Army. His first choice was The Parachute Regiment and in and online video he declared his ambition to be the first Sikh Para. But he dropped out of airborne training and joined the Scots Guards. He passed out last month. Bhullar has confided in chaplain Mandeep Kaur. She said: 'He had problems telling (his colleagues) why he has to wear the turban and why it means so much to him. 'It was ignorance and verbals but he did not call it bullying. 'He was determined to come through everything to explain his religion, the significance of the turban and why it is more important to him than a bearskin. 'He is one of only 20 to 25 British-born Sikhs in the British Army.' A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'The Army takes great pride in its diversity. Discussions are underway between this unit, the Sikh community and the MoD. The individual will have the full support of the Army and his colleagues.'","Jatinderpal Singh Bhullar, 25, has been allowed to break hundreds of years of tradition to observe his religion by the Scots Guards .

"An Afghan farmer is suing the Ministry of Defence for £300,000 after accusing British soldiers of beating him during his arrest and handing him over to the Afghan authorities to be tortured. It is believed to be the first time an Afghan citizen has taken legal action against British soldiers and, if successful, could open the floodgates to further civil claims costing taxpayers millions of pounds. According to papers lodged at the High Court in London, father-of-two Serdar Mohammed, 24, was irrigating his crops in Helmand province in April 2010 when a helicopter carrying British soldiers landed in a nearby field. Ambushed: Serdar Mohammed was irrigating his crops when a helicopter with British troops landed nearby (stock image) He claims the soldiers handcuffed and blindfolded him before  frog-marching him to a spot a short distance away where there were rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and an RPG launcher. After telling the soldiers the weaponry was not his, Mr Mohammed was punched on his head and back, according to the court papers. In July that year, British forces transferred him to a detention centre in Helmand where he was allegedly beaten. Mr Mohammed claims he was then moved to a detention centre in Kabul, where he was tortured into confessing he was part of the Taliban. The writ states that in a court case seven months after his arrest, without a lawyer present, he was found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in jail, reduced to ten years on appeal. When the helicopter landed, Serdar Mohammed was irrigating his crops in Helmand province. He claims he was then handcuffed and blindfolded by British troops (stock image) Rosa Curling, of Leigh Day  & Co, which is representing Mr Mohammed, said: ‘The abuse our client has suffered must not be allowed to happen to anyone else.’ The MoD said: ‘The UK works hard to monitor the treatment of all UK-captured detainees transferred to Afghan custody.’","Serdar Mohammed, 24, claims he was handcuffed and blindfolded by British soldiers .

"Close: Lana Marks, pictured with Princess Diana in 1996, above, says the content of tapes are similar to sentiments Diana expressed before her death . Tapes allegedly made by Princess Diana for Prince William echo sentiments she expressed just months before her death, a close friend said yesterday. Reports from America claim Diana made the recordings for William and his future wife because she feared for her life. Yesterday, one of her closest confidantes said the content bore an uncanny resemblance to what she and the Princess had discussed about William. Businesswoman Lana Marks, who designed handbags for the Princess, gasped when the tapes’ content was read to her, and said: ‘Oh my God, I know her choice of words, the way she would say things and this sounds exactly like her. ‘I knew Diana very well during the last 18 months of her life. Diana discussed with me in great detail what she wanted for William in terms of a wife, children – what she wanted for his future. 'When I hear the contents of the tape, they echo what she discussed with me in great detail. It is uncanny.’ The existence of the tapes was revealed by US magazine Globe. In them, she is said to urge her oldest son and his future wife: ‘Cherish your children for me. Let them know I’ll love them and watch over them.’ According to the magazine, she imagined William’s bride would be ‘beautiful, smart and independent’. It reported the voice on the tape stated: ‘I know I’d adore you and we’d be fast friends. You’d have to be someone truly special. If you weren’t, you wouldn’t be William’s wife.’ Speaking directly to her daughter-in-law, Diana reportedly advised her to work at her marriage to survive the pressures of public life and warned her that being a future queen makes marriage harder. Future: The tapes allegedly contain intimate details of Diana's hopes for William, pictured as a baby above, who she knew would one day be king . Record: Diana was said to want to document her feelings about the young Princes, pictured above, in the months before her death as she became increasingly concerned for her safety . Los Angeles-based Mrs Marks added: ‘Kate is absolutely everything Diana wanted. She even said William’s wife would have dark hair. ‘Diana wanted someone down-to-earth for William, with a close family unit so he could enjoy a normal family life. She wanted a future queen of the people for the people.’ Last night Kensington Palace declined to comment.","Mystery tapes are said to echo Diana's feelings in 'great detail'

"This is the makeshift barracks where thousands of troops will live while on guard duty at the Olympics. The complex at Hainault, Essex, looks more like a prisoner-of-war camp than a military base. Work on the grey metal accommodation blocks started four months ago. Now almost complete, they provide spartan living space, with washing and toilet facilities, for 3,000 Armed Forces personnel, some of whom have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. From sand to soil: Troops arrive at the Olympic Army camp at Hainault Forest in Essex . Home sweet home: Tents at the camp which will house catering staff and supplies . Tents on the site house a catering area and a recreational centre where the soldiers can relax when off-duty. Alongside the temporary portable homes is the more comfortable-looking Snoozebox Hotel, a larger unit comprising single and double rooms for 1,000 G4S support workers and civilian personnel. The camp is protected by a wire mesh fence with white sheeting stretched across it for privacy. Troops based on the G4S-controlled site are due to man X-ray machines, search visitors and monitor CCTV  at the Olympic Park. High-tech: A Rapier missile battery is deployed at Blackheath, South-East London . New walls, please: Anti-terrorism fencing and security is erected at the All England Tennis Club in Wimbledon . But despite the Games beginning in less than two weeks, the camp  in the 250-acre Hainault Forest  Country Park looked far from finished yesterday. One employee said construction had fallen behind schedule because of the poor weather, and work had been going on through the night. About a quarter of the dormitory accommodation for troops is still to be completed. Vast vessel: The Royal Navy's largest ship has been carefully manoeuvred into position on the Thames, where it will be used during the Olympic Games as a base for helicopters and military personnel . In action: The pair will be two of thousands who will be in Britain aiming to ensure that London 2012 is safe from terror attacks . Logistics: The men look across the London skyline and consider what faces them over the coming weeks . As HMS Ocean turns in to the Thames 150 sailors and aircrew recreate the Olympic Rings on the flight deck to mark the start of the ship's Olympic deployment . The wet summer has turned the area into a quagmire, but one soldier said: ‘We’re used to this. Some of us have been to Afghanistan and it can be really wet and muddy out there.’ Elsewhere, the All England Tennis Club’s complex at Wimbledon was receiving a security makeover, while a Rapier missile defence battery was deployed in Blackheath, London, near the site of the equestrian events. Troops on duty for the Olympics should get the same £500 bonus being given to London Tube drivers, Labour demanded last night. Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy called on the Coalition and disgraced security firm G4S to foot an £8.5 million bill to give the troops an extra Olympic payment. He said all troops on Olympics duty – including the 3,500 being drafted in because of G4S’s failure to recruit enough civilian staff – should receive the same £500 bonus won by Underground drivers. Demands: Troops on duty for the Olympics should get the same £500 bonus being given to London Tube drivers, MPs claimed . Work: Men continue to file in with items to prepare and install the missile launcher . Bus drivers have a similar deal for working through the Olympics after going on strike for the extra payments. Mr Murphy said: ‘Just because our troops can’t strike, it doesn’t mean they should be ignored. Londoners and people across Britain won’t accept our forces being treated less fairly than Tube and bus drivers.’ Ministry of Defence sources said the department was looking at measures to recognise the Armed Forces’ Olympic role, but one said it would be ‘strange’ to pay troops extra for their Olympic work while their colleagues were on the frontline in Afghanistan. The MoD has said that the thousands of additional servicemen and women being drafted in will be compensated for any expenses such as cancelled holidays.","Complex has been described as looking more like a prisoner-of-war camp than a military base .

"Britain’s Armed Forces Minister told MPs not to believe a disabled Afghan war hero’s account of how he was callously bullied by his regimental sergeant major. Just days after the Ministry of Defence apologised to Corporal Tom Neathway, 30, over his appalling three-year ordeal, it has emerged that the Minister, Anna Soubry, described accounts of his allegations as ‘misleading’ in a private letter to MPs. Last night Cpl Neathway, who lost both legs and an arm fighting the Taliban, said Ms Soubry had unfairly branded him a liar and demanded her resignation. Armed Forces Minister Anna Soubry, right, said MPs should not believe that Corporal Tom Neathway, left, who lost three limbs while in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, was also bullied by his Regimental Sergeant Major . He said: ‘I suffered horrendous treatment and the Army has acknowledged that. But she called me a liar and she should go. She’s not right for the Armed Forces job.’ Ms Soubry is leading the Army’s latest anti-bullying drive and is responsible for overhauling the Services’ complaints process. Last night, members of the House of Commons’ Defence Select Committee said she should be stripped of these roles, describing her as ‘tainted’. Last week, a military Service Complaint Panel finally acknowledged that Cpl Neathway had suffered a campaign of bullying by his sergeant major, Alistair Hutcheson, who whispered in the triple amputee’s ear that, as a result of his injuries, he ‘wasn’t much of a paratrooper any more’. Cpl Neathway, who remained hugely proud that he belonged to the Parachute Regiment, described his ordeal for the first time in an interview with this newspaper in February. The following month, The Mail on Sunday revealed that RSM Hutcheson was quitting the Army. A number of MPs wrote to Ms Soubry in her capacity as Armed Forces Minister following these articles to pass on the concerns of their constituents. In her written response, she cast doubt over Cpl Neathway’s story by telling MPs the stories were ‘inaccurate’ and ‘misleading’. Army authorities apologised to Cpl Neathway after Sergeant Major Alastair Hutchenson, pictured told him 'he wasn't much of a paratrooper anymore' after he lost three limbs while fighting in Afghanistan . Ms Soubry wrote to an MP that they should not 'believe everything they read or see' in the media . She said: ‘While I recognise that members of the public receive much of their information from the media, and this helps to form their views on issues such as this, I would counsel them to not to believe everything they read or see. ‘I would like to assure you and your constituents that all three Services have a zero tolerance of bullying and harassment and all allegations are taken very seriously and are thoroughly investigated, as has happened in this case.’ In fact, in the three years after Cpl Neathway lodged his complaint, a clique of Army officers conspired to block its progress. The disabled soldier was given an ultimatum: Drop the claim or leave the military base that had been specially adapted to allow him to work there. There were also attempts to discredit Army and civilian personnel who had provided witness statements backing Cpl Neathway’s legal action. Last week, Ms Soubry, who has been fast-tracked into ministerial office by David Cameron, tried to shift the blame for her letter on to defence officials. When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, she said: ‘I only go, as you know, on what they [officials] tell me. I make sure that my team write letters on the basis of what I am told. It doesn’t mean to say that I personally asserted anything other than what they told me.’ Just minutes later, an official contacted this newspaper and suggested that Ms Soubry had issued a stern rebuke. Last year, when she was serving as a junior Minister in the Department of Health, she was criticised for suggesting she could tell somebody’s social background by whether or not they were fat. Yesterday, the MPs Jeffrey Donaldson, Gisela Stuart and Sir Bob Russell, who sit on the Commons’ defence committee, questioned Ms Soubry’s suitability to lead the Army’s anti-bullying drive. Sir Bob said: ‘She is tainted by what she has written and her impartiality has to be questioned. ‘Cpl Neathway’s treatment by some elements of the Army was an absolute disgrace. ‘Ms Soubry’s involvement in this case is such that this part [the anti-bullying drive] of her portfolio should be handled by another Minister. The Ministry of Defence remains the Government’s least open department.’ Ms Soubry issued a statement saying: ‘Bullying and harassment have no place in the Army. ‘Our personnel can have confidence in the complaints system, which we are improving further to add a powerful, independent voice to the process.’ Last night Ms Soubry reacted with ‘surprise’ to calls for her resignation. She said: ‘I am surprised and disappointed as I take these issues very seriously, which is why I’m pleased to be guiding the draft legislation through Parliament.’ Though he has left the Army, RSM Hutcheson still faces disciplinary action.","Lance Corporal Tom Neathway lost three limbs fighting in Afghanistan .

Roshida Kahnom, Senior Personal Care Analyst at Mintel, said: 'As stars from shows such as The Only Way is Essex popularise self-tans, and even in some cases launch their own ranges, self-tanning remains fashionable for young people. 'High usage of self-tanning products amongst young men suggests that they may be aspiring to recreate looks inspired by celebrities such as Mark Wright.

One in ten have used pre-tan accelerator, while the same number have used tanning oil or lotion without SPF. 'With self-tanning products traditionally associated with unnatural results, older people may be less willing to try it. 'Additionally, self-tanning products can be tricky to apply, which may make it difficult for older people who tend to have looser and less hydrated skin.

"In disgrace: Commander Sarah West, 41, was dramatically removed from the frigate HMS Portland amid claims she was having an affair . Royal Navy top brass were last night accused by women MPs of ‘disgraceful’ sexual prejudice over their treatment of a female warship captain stripped of her command after allegations of an affair with a male officer. Commander Sarah West, 41, was dramatically removed from the frigate HMS Portland and flown back to Britain in disgrace after reports emerged that she was having a relationship with a male subordinate officer. West – the first woman to captain a frontline warship in the Navy’s 500-year history – was hauled off her ship amid claims she breached the military’s strict codes of social conduct. She was also accused of letting down women in the services for allegedly getting involved with a married colleague, Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 37, while on operations. While the MoD has confirmed that Cmdr West has been removed from her command, they have refused to say what action, if any, Lieut Cmdr Gray will face. Two female Labour MPs questioned if a man would have been subjected to such swift military justice or similar public humiliation. Gisela Stuart, a member of the Commons Defence Select Committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am wondering that if she had been a man and it had been the other way around whether the [military] machinery would have managed to move with such speed. 'It is all rather sad. I think she has probably been judged more harshly than a man in a similar position would have been. There is a lack of clarity over what has been proved and what the consequences are for those involved.’ Madeleine Moon, another committee member, said West’s treatment by the Navy had been ‘disgraceful’. She added: ‘The treatment of Sarah West gives out a message that women who achieve her rank and seniority will be punished in a way that is more rigorous and more public than if it were a man.’ However the longest-serving woman in Royal Navy history came to the service’s defence. Warrant Officer First Class Susan Morgan, who retired from active service in 2012 after a 34-year career, said: ‘The public need not worry about the outcome of this situation. It will be treated with the same sense of equality as with a male commander.’ 'Sexism': MPs question whether the same punishment would have been levelled at a man . Sarah West was considered a rising star among her generation of officers. She is now set to be given a lower-profile position in the Navy. A new, and as yet unnamed, captain has been appointed to HMS Portland, which returned to Britain last weekend after a seven-month deployment around the coastlines of Africa, the Falkland Islands, South America and the Caribbean. She docked at Plymouth with her second-in-command, Lieut Cmdr Rob Brann, at the helm. Also on board was Lieut Cmdr Gray, who married his second wife in December 2013, just a month before the ship set sail.","Commander Sarah West, 41, removed from HMS Portland amid affair claims .

"A lowly insurance clerk passed himself off as a Royal Marine and lived at a top-security military base just yards from Buckingham Palace for two years, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Office worker Anthony Phillips, 42, convinced soldiers at Wellington Barracks – where troops who guard the Queen are based – that he was an elite commando. In fact, he was a pen-pusher who was living a fantasy life inside the base. Father-of-three Phillips was so convincing that soldiers from the Coldstream Guards who were living there nicknamed him ‘Tony the Marine’ and shared classified details about protecting the Royals and conducting ceremonial duties. Scroll down for video . Convincing: Anthony Phillips passed himself off as a member of the Armed Forces and got to live at Wellington Barracks . Phillips, who wore a Royal Marines tie and a lapel button embossed with the Corps’ globe and laurel insignia, first appeared at the barracks, on Birdcage Walk, in the run-up to the London Olympics in July 2012. At a time when the UK was on high alert against a terror attack, Phillips convinced senior soldiers he was a commando sent to London to work at the Ministry of Defence (MoD). While a telephone call to the Royal Marines would have revealed Phillips was bogus, he was given his own room with a bathroom in a soldiers’ accommodation block, which he lived in until March this year. Phillips became a familiar face at the barracks, where he built up his reputation as a tough Royal Marine who did physical training with other soldiers and socialised with them in their bars on the base. Aerial view of Buckingham Palace showing the proxomity to Wellington Barracks, London where Phillips lived after passing himself off as a Marine . In fact, Phillips was a clerk working at the MoD in Whitehall whose job was to calculate the cost of insuring soldiers on exercises and missions. He had undergone low-level security checks but had no right to live on the base. MoD personnel like Phillips would normally be escorted whenever they visited a high-security military base, but he could come and go as he pleased. The Pub Landlord and the Marine: Neither Al Murray nor Anthony Phillips is a real pub landlord or a genuine Royal Marine but Phillips did manage to con soldiers at Wellington Barracks . Last night, an MP on the defence select committee demanded an urgent inquiry into the security breach. Labour’s Gisela Stuart said: ‘This case is a wake-up call for the new Defence Secretary who should look closely at what happened, because the implications of the case are very serious. ‘If you consider the heightened vulnerability of London since the 7/7 attacks in 2005, and the fact that he moved in at the time of the 2012 Olympics when everyone was supposed to be on their guard, how he got in and was able to stay inside the base is very worrying. ‘The MoD must look again at its gate-keepers, its vetting and levels of access.’ HM the Queen inspects the guards during a ceremony to present new colours to the 1st Battalion and No. 7 Company the Coldstream Guards at Windsor Castle . The MoD has refused to explain how Phillips tricked his way into the barracks, but The Mail on Sunday has established that a sergeant major who left the Coldstream Guards last year was recently called back to answer questions during an investigation into the scandal. A family source close to Phillips said he was exposed when checks were carried out after a noisy party. Phillips was booted off the barracks and resigned from the Civil Service, avoiding a disciplinary hearing. And while defence sources say he defrauded the taxpayer by living there for free, there are no plans to force him to pay accommodation charges. His current whereabouts are unknown. Impersonating a member of the Armed Forces is no longer an offence, but those who pass themselves off as members of the Armed Forces for financial gain can be charged with fraud. Phillips has not been accused of any criminal offence. Family sources suggested last night that Phillips may have been motivated by his father Wilfred, who served as a commando in the Second World War, and died in 1985. Last night an MoD spokesman said: ‘When it became clear that there was no entitlement to accommodation, this individual was asked to leave Wellington Barracks. ‘It is wrong and misleading to suggest this was a security breach. The individual in question was an MoD employee with the correct security clearances and passes to allow entry to any MoD establishment.’","Insurance clerk Anthony Phillips, 42, conned Coldstream Guards .

"A former paratrooper who  witnessed the unlawful Bloody  Sunday killings is set to tell police investigating the shootings how he saw a British soldier ‘lose the plot’ and fire indiscriminately in a residential area. The retired Para, who is to be interviewed as part of a criminal inquiry into the deaths of 14 civil rights protesters, will describe how a soldier rattled off 20 rounds as he fired from the hip towards a block of flats before being ordered to ‘cease fire’. The ex-Para, who cannot be named for security reasons, will be among the first Bloody Sunday veterans to provide testimony as part of a criminal investigation into the events of January 30, 1972. The interview will take place next month at a secret location in Britain. The anonymous former member of the Parachute Regiment said he saw soldiers 'shooting from the hip' but only after they were fired upon by the IRA . The investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has been widely criticised as politically motivated and against the public interest. It comes four years after the £250 million Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday produced  its findings. Following the report, the decision whether to prosecute any individual soldier was left to the PSNI.The soldiers now facing questions have long since retired and are in their 60s and 70s. The investigation comes after it emerged that convicted IRA terrorists received Royal pardons and letters from the Government assuring them that they will not face further legal action. Up to 200 former soldiers face being formally questioned by police for alleged murder, attempted murder or criminal injury. A British solider detains a protester during the civil rights march where 14 unarmed civilians were shot dead . The ex-Para told last night how two or three soldiers ‘lost the plot’ on the day, but he insisted that troops reacted only after IRA  members fired sub-machine guns at them first. He said: ‘I will give the police an entirely unbiased account of what I saw, including the incident of the soldier rattling off 20 rounds from his magazine towards a block of flats. He was shooting indiscriminately. Fortunately nobody was injured or killed by his actions. ‘I will tell the police how, before any British soldiers opened fire, the IRA fired at us and that, unquestionably, there was a genuine threat to our lives. Lord Saville’s report painted an unfair picture of the Parachute Regiment because the conclusions were so dismissive of the active role played by the IRA that day. They were firing Thompson sub-machine guns.’ The ex-Para has agreed to meet  PSNI officers next month. Fearful that his identity could be leaked to Republican terrorists, the veteran has insisted that police officers do not visit him at his home. The un-named former Para said he saw one soldier 'rattling off 20 rounds' towards a block of flats 'shooting indiscriminately' He said PSNI detectives have indicated that they are ‘looking for prosecutions’. But in building cases against UK soldiers they cannot  use evidence given to the Saville Inquiry – because its aim was not to accuse individuals or institutions such as the Army. Instead, the PSNI must obtain fresh witness statements from soldiers who were present that day.Last year the Ministry of Defence began hiring lawyers to represent Paras interviewed under caution  or charged with criminal offences. Paras who engaged with protesters could be found guilty of  murder based on the evidence of anonymous witnesses. It will be left up to courts to decide whether witnesses such as the veteran who spoke to The Mail on Sunday can remain anonymous. The PSNI was unavailable for comment. The MoD said: ‘It is for the PSNI to decide whether to look into these allegations.

"The Army reservist son of Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott was at the centre of a military police inquiry after an alleged attempt to oust the commanding officer of his unit. In an apparent precursor to his father’s botched bid to remove Nick Clegg as Lib Dem party leader last week, part-time soldier Luke Oakeshott has been implicated in an alleged behind-the-scenes plot to undermine his Army commander. Following a series of disputes between Army colleagues, Oakeshott, 28, who holds the rank of signaller, was thought to have written anonymous letters to military chiefs and the Defence Secretary, raising concerns about how his Army unit was run. Denial: Lord Oakeshott's 28-year-old son Luke (pictured) was caught up in allegations over anonymous letters . These letters, sent last year, included complaints about ill-discipline and a lack of leadership in the Army’s Media Operations Group (the MOG) – a unit set up to generate positive publicity. At the time, Oakeshott was seconded to the MOG from his parent regiment, the Inns of Court & City Yeomanry. The letters triggered an external inquiry into the MOG, which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rosie Stone. While Oakeshott was widely suspected of being involved in writing the letters, investigating Army officers were unable to determine the identity of the author. The claims raised in the letters were also dismissed and Lieut Col Stone was cleared of any alleged failures in command. Botched bid: Lord Oakeshott quit the Lib Dems after commissioning polls which slated party leader Nick Clegg . Last night Oakeshott denied ‘any knowledge of the letters’ which apparently were written just days after he was the victim of a brutal attack by a colleague, during which he sustained facial injuries. The MoD confirmed the assault on Signaller Oakeshott by another member of the MOG remains the subject of a separate investigation by military police, expected to conclude later this month. Friends of Oakeshott described him as ‘colourful’. He lives near his father, in South London. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are aware of some anonymous letters concerning the MOG. The substance of these allegations was investigated and the unit retains the full trust of the Army.’","Reservist Luke Oakeshott denies knowledge of complaint letters last year .

"Trail of blunders: Martynas Kupstys, shown with wife Sandra, tried to tell staff of their mistake but was still escorted from HMP Lincoln . A murder suspect was released from a high-security prison by mistake – as he waited in line to be taken to trial. Bungling prison officers handed Martynas Kupstys his clothes and belongings and, despite his protests, said he had to leave. The 25-year-old pleaded with HMP Lincoln that he should be joining inmates who were being escorted towards the prison bus to Lincoln Crown Court. But his pleas were ignored and he was shown the door. It was only when the van reached court, and officials found Kupstys missing from the defendants that the astonishing error came to light. A full-scale investigation was launched with police searching frantically for the prisoner. Meanwhile, confused Kupstys had sat unnoticed at a bus stop outside the prison following his release. He remained there for three hours before being found and returned to custody. His release led to the collapse of his murder trial, which had been hearing evidence for three weeks, at a cost to the taxpayer of an estimated £3,000 a day. Last night the Ministry of Justice confirmed an urgent security review was under way at HMP Lincoln, a prison which has been heavily criticised as ‘unsafe’ by Government inspectors who raised concerns about overcrowding and staffing issues. Last night, Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, told The  Mail on Sunday: ‘It is ridiculous and dangerous that a murder suspect was released during his trial. ‘I’ve never heard of this  happening before and I am deeply concerned. We should be relieved that Kupstys simply sat at a bus stop wondering why he had been pushed out the door. Thankfully nobody was hurt. ‘This error was expensive, because a lot of court time has been wasted. ‘This shocking incident is indicative of the fact that Britain’s prisons are in meltdown. ‘Across the country prison staffing levels have been cut and many of the remaining staff are overstretched and inexperienced.’ Married . Lithuanian factory worker Kupstys, 25, and his brother-in-law Andrus . Giedraitis, 29, were charged with murder earlier this year after Latvian . Ivans Zdanovics, 24, was found dead at his home in Gainsborough, . Lincolnshire, in January 2014. Police said he died from smoke . inhalation. While being held . on remand at HMP Lincoln, Kupstys and Giedraitis, made a series of . appearances before local magistrates and pleaded not guilty. Their trial . began at Lincoln Crown Court on July 21. The . precise details of how he came to be released in error remain . undisclosed but The Mail on Sunday understands that at around 8.30am on . August 8 he was moved from his cell to a holding area where inmates are . segregated according to whether they are going to court or being . released because they have completed their sentences. The confused prisoner waited at this bus stop opposite the jail for three hours while police officers searched for him . Due . to an apparent mix-up with another inmate who had served his time, . Kupstys was handed his possessions and led towards the front door. At . the time he tried to explain to prison officers that he should  be . joining those prisoners, including his co-accused Giedraitis, who  were . being escorted towards the prison bus. His . pleas were ignored and he was shown the door. Meanwhile Giedraitis and . other remand prisoners boarded the bus at about 9am. The bus arrived at . Lincoln Crown Court, without Kupstys, at about 9.30am.  Concerned court . officials called the prison where officers realised their embarrassing . error. The presiding judge, . His Honour Michael Heath was informed that Kupstys had been released in . error and the judge passed this information to the jury after they were . sworn in at around 11am. The case was then adjourned in Kupstys’s . absence and Giedraitis was driven back to HMP Lincoln. Kupstys was found at the bus stop by prison officers at around 12.30pm and was returned to his cell. The . jury in the case was discharged by Judge Heath on August 12 for legal . reasons and the case will now return to court in March next year. Kupstys’ release is another blow for HMP Lincoln which was criticised by . inspectors in 2012. They declared the prison unsafe after finding . overcrowding at a rate of 50 per cent. A new governor was appointed and . the prison received a more favourable report last year. Last . night, the governor Peter Wright admitted that Kupstys’s release was a . ‘grave error, a fundamental breach of what we’re here to do’. A . Ministry of Justice spokesman added: ‘A prisoner from Lincoln was . released in error on 8 August. The police were notified immediately and . he was arrested within hours. An investigation by a senior governor has . been launched. ‘We take public protection extremely seriously and this type of incident is a very rare but regrettable occurrence.’ The Mail on Sunday won a legal victory to report this shocking breach of prison security. On Friday this newspaper persuaded His Honour Judge Heath, pictured, to lift reporting restrictions which would have meant Kupstys’s release remained a state secret until at least March 2015. We argued the freeing of a prisoner standing trial for murder was a matter of ‘overwhelming public interest’ which should be exposed now. Judge Heath agreed, dismissing objections by Kupstys’s legal representatives and the  CPS. Prosecution Service.

"regular troops are forbidden to play an active role in political organisations .

Peace UK founder Ben Griffin, 36, refused to name  the troops because . they would face disciplinary action if their identities were known. Mr . Griffin, who resigned from the Special Air Service (SAS) in protest over . its role in secret US operations in Iraq, said: 'While retired troops . are free to declare their membership, those in uniform are not. They . would almost certainly face official sanction, and perhaps personal . reprisals that may threaten their safety. 'These men have taken the . brave step of joining us because they have come to the conclusion that . war is not the answer to our problems. 'Given the issue with Queen's .

"A high-flying Ministry of Defence mandarin has quit his £200,000 post during an inquiry into whether he had an inappropriate relationship with his chief of staff. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Andrew Manley, 57, a married father of two, resigned before the conclusion of the MoD probe into his relationship with Laura Clare, 32. The investigation by defence chiefs also examined his expenses, which included 47 nights spent in a luxury hotel and spa. Write caption here . Mr Manley submitted a £5,542 bill after staying at the 800-year-old New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, where rooms can cost £155 a night. He confirmed last night that he had quit and, when asked whether he had an affair with Ms Clare, said: ‘No comment.’ This newspaper understands that the MoD’s investigation was nearing its end when Mr Manley stepped down from his position as chief executive of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, a department responsible for managing land and properties worth billions of pounds. The internal inquiry, which was not intended to be made public, was triggered by his expense claims, which reached £13,743, and by internal emails sent by Mr Manley. Last night, sources close to Mr Manley disclosed that the senior civil servant intends to mount a number of legal actions against his former employers. Mr Manley spent 30 years at the oil company Shell before joining the MoD as a commercial director in charge of procurement. He was later promoted to head the newly formed DIO. He lives in a £1.5million home on a private estate in Cobham, Surrey, with his wife Pauline and their children. In 2011 Ms Clare joined the DIO as his private secretary before being rapidly promoted to become his chief of staff on a salary of as much as £59,535. Luxurious: Mr Manley claims £5,542 for stays at the 800-year-old New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands . She is said to be highly regarded by her bosses and continues to work for the DIO. Although she is understood to have been questioned by the inquiry, she was not under investigation herself. The probe into the relationship between Mr Manley and Ms Clare began in January this year. At the time he was suspended on full pay. The MoD says that Mr Manley left his post on March 20. It was unclear last night whether Mr Manley will retain any pension entitlements. Last night an MoD spokesman said: ‘Following an internal investigation we can confirm that Andrew Manley decided to repudiate his contract with the department on March 20. He is no longer employed by the MoD.’ Ms Clare, who lives in a flat in Putney, South-West London, yesterday declined to comment on the  latest developments. Earlier this year it emerged that Mr Manley had already offered his resignation to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond over a bungled Information Technology project. Mr Manley told colleagues that delays in a new computer system would cost about £20million and that he had offered his resignation as a result. In a recording leaked to the media, Mr Manley said: ‘I have said to the Secretary of State, “If you feel that this is significantly bad and you want me to step down, I am happy to do it because in the world I came from, the chief executive would probably have been fired for what has gone wrong.” ’ In the past four years, defence chiefs have spent £180million of taxpayers’ money on car hire and hotels on business trips in the UK alone, according to the latest figures. The total bill for hotels over that period was £3 million. The MoD also paid almost £3,000 for a Sky Sports contract for one small unit in Northwood, Hertfordshire, so it could monitor ‘global 24-hour news feeds’. Another big spender was the MoD’s Chief of Defence Materiel Bernard Gray, who racked up a £23,000 bill for 106 overnight stays in London and Bristol – even though his home is just a 60-mile drive from both cities and he has an official car and driver.","Andrew Manley, 57, resigned from his £200,000-a-year post during inquiry .

"The first woman to captain a Royal Navy warship could be facing the sack over claims she had an affair with a male subordinate. Commander Sarah West, 42, has been flown back to the UK in disgrace following the claims of a sexual relationship with a member of her crew on HMS Portland. And as an intense military investigation is launched into Cdr West’s conduct, the former head of the Navy said that if the claims were true, the trailblazing commander would have let down all female officers – and provided fuel for those who argue against women being on active service. Commander Sarah West (pictured on duty before the allegations surfaced) could be facing the sack over claims she had an affair with a male subordinate . Admiral Lord West, who is not related to the captain, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The rules are very clear and if she has had a relationship with someone under her command then she’s rather let down other women in the Royal Navy, because there are people who will jump on this and  say this is why women shouldn’t be on ship – which is total nonsense.’ Cdr West, who is divorced from a Navy helicopter pilot, is the first woman to command a frontline warship in the Navy’s 500-year history. Her 5,000-ton Type 23 frigate was conducting anti-narcotics patrols  in the Caribbean when the claims of misconduct emerged, and she was flown back to Britain. Navy sources said she had left HMS Portland for ‘personal reasons’ and is now on annual leave. Meanwhile the frigate is sailing back to Britain and is expected to dock in Plymouth this week, having left San Juan, Puerto Rico, on July 19. The ship’s officers and crew are being questioned by military investigators over the alleged affair. Cdr West, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, is alleged to have broken strict Royal Navy rules that forbid any relationships which could undermine trust or the ship’s operational effectiveness. If the claims are proven, she could face a formal warning, reassignment or even termination of her service. The male officer, whose identity is unknown, may also face disciplinary action. Last night the Ministry of Defence refused to disclose whether he has retained his responsibilities aboard HMS Portland or if he, too, has been removed from the ship. Cdr West, 42, has been flown back to the UK in disgrace following the claims of a sexual relationship with a member of her crew on HMS Portland (pictured) In Cdr West’s absence her deputy, Lieutenant Commander Rob Brann, has taken charge. Last night Lord West added: ‘This incident is very sad. If the allegations are true I doubt Commander West will continue in her post or  be given another ship to command. There are so many excellent officers coming through that she won’t get the chance. ‘Without any doubt, women must continue to lead in the Royal Navy as they have proved themselves  in an array of demanding jobs. The truth is we wouldn’t have enough sailors in the Royal Navy if you removed the women. They are a key part of what we do. Admiral Lord West, who is not related to the captain, said that if the claims were true, the trailblazing commander would have let down all female officers - and provided fuel for those who argue against women being on active service . ‘There were not any women aboard when I was commanding ships but  I was aware of men having sex with each other and they were disciplined. Indeed, early in my career  it was illegal. ‘As ship’s captain you must set  an example through your conduct and be beyond reproach. The  rules banning relationships in the chain of command exist for a very good reason.’ In the past, Cdr West has revealed how being at sea has made it difficult to maintain a relationship. She married pilot Andrew Whitlum in 1998 but they later separated. In a newspaper interview, she said: ‘Lots of women in the services  have challenging roles. There are drawbacks, though. Years at sea probably explains why I’m single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.’ She became a commander in January 2012 and assumed command of HMS Portland in May that year. The frigate sailed from Plymouth in January this year on a seven-month deployment to promote UK interests in Europe, Africa, South and North America. The warship visited the Falkland Islands in early June before sailing north. On June 30, Cdr West joined Foreign Office Minister Hugo Swire at a reception in Cartagena, Colombia, to mark Armed Forces Day. On July 10, the Royal Navy released a photograph on HMS Portland’s Twitter account of Cdr West standing on the deck of her ship surrounded by all her crew. Allegations of her affair are believed to have surfaced just days later, and according to Naval sources she left the vessel in ‘mid-July’. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘We are aware of an allegation of a breach of the Code  of Social Conduct on board HMS Portland, which we are treating seriously. Anyone who is found to fall short of the Royal Navy’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action. It would be inappropriate  to comment further.’","Commander Sarah West has been flown back to UK following claims of affair .

"Royal Marines who agreed to cover up the murder of a badly wounded Taliban captive have been cleared to continue their careers without any sanction. The Marines watched as their commander Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, shot a defenceless prisoner at close range and told him to: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, it’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’ Moments later, Sgt Blackman agreed a secret pact with his colleagues not to tell anyone about the shooting because it breached the Geneva Convention. Pact: The Marines watched as their commander Sergeant Alexander Blackman (pictured) shot a defenceless prisoner at close range and told him to: 'Shuffle off this mortal coil, it's nothing you wouldn't do to us' As a result, the incident in September 2011 was not investigated until the following year, when military police found footage of the shooting recorded by Cpl Christopher Watson, 31, on a helmet-mounted camera. In 2012, Sgt Blackman, Cpl Watson and Marine Jack Hammond were charged with murder and appeared at a court martial the following year. Two other Marines were also accused of murder but their charges were dropped before the hearing. While Cpl Watson and Marine Hammond were cleared of murder, Sgt Blackman was found guilty and received a ten-year prison sentence, reduced to eight years after an appeal last week. Deal: Sergeant Blackman (pictured) agreed a secret pact with his colleagues not to tell anyone about the shooting because it breached the Geneva Convention . It had been expected that Cpl Watson and Marine Hammond would face administrative action.

"Phillip Hughes’ family, team mates and mentors gathered at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the hours after his shattering death to comfort each other and remember their mate. It was just over 48 hours after the 25-year-old sustained his catastrophic injury at the crease, when he suffered a vertebral artery dissection whilst batting for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield clash against New South Wales. But that pitch was also the site of many triumphs and thrilling moments for the young player, a batsman with a bright future that will tragically go unplayed. Such moments included his debut for NSW in 2007 at the age of 18. At the end of that season, he returned to the SCG and became the youngest player to score a century in a Sheffield Shield final to help NSW claim victory over Victoria. It was a fitting place to come together, as his family explained that Phillip Hughes 'lived for cricket' in a statement read by Australian captain Michael Clarke at a media conference on Thursday evening.

Hughes' parents, Greg and Virginia, along with sister Megan were seen leaving hand-in-hand after they were joined by members of the close-knit cricketing community, including teammates of the fallen batsman. Sporting legends Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee were joined by David Warner, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle, Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch who all looked sombre as they walked into the cricket headquarters. Dual international, cricket and football player Ellyse Perry was also in attendance. Brett Lee and fast bowler Mitchell Johnson embraced warmly as they greeted each other. Two hours later, Lee was seen leaving Cricket NSW alone looking downcast, looking up only to nod thanks to well wishers. Clearly distressed, David Warner and Matthew Wade were both supported by their partners. A man that has shown incredible strength and composure throughout the two days that followed Hughes' accident, Australian team doctor Dr Peter Brukner, told Daily Mail Australia that he is 'okay' but explained with a tired smile that it had been 'a long day'. On the grounds where the fatal blow was delivered, friends took turns standing at the crease to commemorate Hughes. Close friend Michael Clarke stood in solitude at the wickets for 45 minutes until the sun set over the pitch, Sky News reported.

"Some privates in the Army fighting in Afghanistan are earning less than the National Minimum Wage (NMW), a new report claims. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body found the long hours worked by troops, whose pay starts at £17,767 a year, means they may earn less than the £6.31 an hour NMW for those over 21 and £5.03 an hour for those over 18. The report says: ‘It is possible for those on the lowest pay level to be earning below NMW levels if they work over 55 hours per week, for those aged 21 or over, or more than 68 hours per week if they are aged between 18 and 20. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body found the long hours worked by troops, whose pay starts at £17,767 a year, means they may earn less than the £6.31 an hour National Minimum Wage. File picture . 'As the average number of hours worked is much higher for those personnel on overseas operations or at sea, the more time someone spends in these locations the greater the chance of breaching NMW thresholds.’ The body has recommended a series of measures to improve pay in the military, including a one per cent increase in base pay and an increase in certain allowances, such as the Unpleasant Living Allowance, which compensates service men and women when living conditions fall below a minimum standard. But an MoD spokesman said: ‘We have worked hard to ensure that the sacrifices and dedication of our personnel is recognised, which is why they have continued to receive pay rises and also qualify for other benefits including subsidised accommodation, generous non-contributory pensions and substantial periods of paid leave. 'It is therefore entirely misleading to suggest that personnel earn less than the minimum wage.' The MoD says the findings of the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body are 'misleading'. File picture . In 1998 the armed forces were excluded from the minimum wage, when ministers claimed it was hard to calculate hourly earnings as servicemen are always available for duty. Meanwhile, shortages in the . Armed Forces have triggered a rise in ‘Golden Hello’ one-off payments . for personnel to stay in service. On . top of their salaries, military nurses are being offered £20,000 and . weapons engineers aboard submarines £50,000 to sign-on for an extra five . years. On the Golden Hello payments, the spokesman added: . ‘As is common practice among commercial organisations, we use financial . retention incentives to ensure we retain essential skills and experience . within the Armed Forces.’ The news comes as Nato's secretary general called for increased defence spending in a bid to curb Russian military aggression. Anders Fogh Rasmussen said member states must modernise their armed forces to check Moscow's intervention in the Crimea. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Every ally needs to invest the necessary resources in the right capabilities. 'That means modern equipment, intensive training for our forces, and closer cooperation among Nato allies and with our partners.'","Long hours worked by troops means they may earn less than £6.31 an hour .

"Shot through the eye by an arrow, he died at the hands of four Norman knights brutally dismembering his body - or so almost 950 years of history dictates. But archaeologists are now claiming King Harold may have survived the Battle of Hastings, and lived out his years before quietly dying of old age. The alternative version of events, put forward in a 12th century document housed in the British Museum, discounts the Normans' portrayal of his death in the Bayeux Tapestry. According to the Bayeux Tapestry, King Harold was killed by four Norman knights after being shot through the eye with an arrow at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 (pictured) Excavators will carry out a scan of the grounds of Waltham Abbey Church in Essex (pictured) where King Harold is thought to be buried . The artwork, long considered an accurate depiction of the 1066 Battle of Hastings, shows King Harold clutching at an arrow in his eye as four Norman knights hack at his body. But now a team of historians, who discovered the remains of Richard III in a municipal car park in Leicester in 2012,  are eager to dispel the long-accepted story. Oval Film and Stratascan, whose efforts were applauded around the world for the discovery, will carry out an underground scan of Abbey Gardens at Waltham Abbey Church in Essex, the supposed site of King Harold's tomb, to look for his remains. King Harold is thought to have been killed in the 1066 battle . 'We have the Norman story put through the Bayeux Tapestry – the English story is a different one,' said Peter Burke, a historian in Waltham Abbey. 'You put things together and it begins to build a picture that is quite solid. If everything backs you up in history, you should look at it. 'You shouldn't just leave it,' the 64-year-old told the Independent. 'I am convinced Harold survived the Battle of Hastings. 'If we find the complete remains of an old man in his late 70's with scarring to his temple from a battle wound then we need to do a DNA test. 'Our understanding of this particular period of English history would have to change.' Fronting £2,000 for the project, Mr Burke will oversee a scan of the church's grounds on Tuesday roughly 15 yards from his alleged tomb at the High Altar. If anything is picked up by the scan, English Heritage will have to apply to the Secretary of State for permission to excavate the site. However members of the Waltham Abbey Historical Society think it is unlikely they will find anything of interest as the site has been disturbed by building works over the years. The remains of Richard III were found in a car park in Leicester in 2012. It was the site of the lost Grey Friars church where the royal had been buried following his death in the Battle of Bosworth Field.

"The Nato medal awarded to marines during their daring anti-pirate missions . Hundreds of Royal Marines who tackled gangs of gun-toting Somali pirates on the high seas have been barred from wearing their medals after defence chiefs ruled that their missions were not risky enough. The Marines confronted pirates armed with AK-47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades in a series of daring engagements, blowing up their boats and seizing lethal weapons. The brave squaddies spent months on patrol before returning to the UK, where they received a Nato medal recognising the success of their counter-piracy operations. But top brass have ruled they cannot wear the gong on their uniforms. When they complained, the Marines were shocked to learn their battles fell foul of the ‘Risk and Rigour Principle’ which states the risk to life and limb should exceed what might normally be expected of UK Service personnel. Last night, furious Lance Corporal Arron Welch, of the Royal Marines’ Fleet Contingency Troop, said: ‘I believe that boarding a dhow [pirate ship] harbouring pirates who have been seen with weapons and have refused to stop even after we’ve fired at them constitutes a risk. ‘This case does not just concern me and my group of 30 [Marines] but a large number of Service personnel who have worked to protect innocent people and the world’s economy from piracy. 'At a time when morale in the Forces is low and with even more cuts to come, this ruling is another instance of the efforts of our Forces being overlooked and under-appreciated.’ More than 250 Royal Marines, members of the Special Boat Service (SBS) and the crew of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Fort Victoria served for three months at a time on Operational Capri, a multinational mission to defeat pirates sailing off Somalia. From 2009 to 2013 the Marines faced heavily armed Somalis. UK forces captured 108 pirates and destroyed 17 vessels. Royal Navy sailors and SBS troopers also secured the release of 43 seafarers taken hostage  – yet they are barred from displaying the Nato medal they were awarded. The authors connected the rise of piracy and maritime violence in Somalia to battles over fishing rights. Pictured is a 'skiff', a small boat frequently used by pirates, off the Somalia coast . The Nato medal, cast in bronze with a blue and white ribbon  and the clasp ‘Africa’, was also awarded to troops from the US, the Netherlands, Canada and Italy. They are entitled to wear the medal. An MoD spokesman said: ‘It is only right the highest standards are set when medals are awarded to recognise the risk and rigour our people face on operations. 'That the Nato medal has not been approved for wear does not detract from the importance of these counter-piracy operations.’","Hundreds of marines confronted Somali pirates - armed with AK-47s .

"Doctors at St Vincent's Hospital spent almost an hour in surgery trying to reduce swelling on Australian cricketer Phil Hughes' brain after he was struck with a cricket ball. The hospital's spokesman David Faktor likened Hughes' condition to someone who had been 'king hit'. Hughes was severely injured during day one of the Sheffield Shield at Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Phil Hughes was severely injured during day one of the Sheffield Shield at Sydney Cricket Grounds on Tuesday . '[The cricketer] is still in a very, very critical condition,' Mr Faktor said. 'The operation was quick, less than an hour to alleviate swelling on the brain. 'It's really similar to a king hit situation where you have bleeding on the brain, what's called a subdural haematoma. 'In the case of a king hit, it's the pavement you often fall back and sustain a fracture on the skull. St Vincent's Hospital spokesman David Faktor likened Hughes' condition to someone who had been 'king hit' 'Depending on the damage that does or what it hits - a nerve or a vessel - there's a real range of injury severity.' Mr Faktor said medical officers intubated Hughes at the scene and he was also placed in an induced coma. Intubation involves a tube being inserted into a patient's trachea to help them breathe easier. 'Now it's just a waiting game as surgeons wait for the swelling on his brain to go down,' Mr Faktor said. It could be 24 to 48 hours before the extent of Hughes' injuries are known. In photographs, a cricket ball is seen hitting Hughes in the back of the head, which is not covered by his helmet. Mr Faktor said Hughes had bleeding on the brain and now . Australasian College of Emergency Medicine president Anthony Cross said being hit by a cricket ball at high speeds could leave someone with a range of injuries, including those that ended in a concussion. He said injuries caused by a cricket ball were uncommon because of helmets like the one Hughes was wearing. Dr Cross said the concern did not lie with a ball causing external injuries but with it fracturing the skull, which protects the brain inside and prevent internal injuries. He said this could cause mild or severe injuries as well as bruising the brain and the sooner it was treated the better, saying 'time is of the essence'. 'At the other end of the spectrum the thing people will be worried about is bleeds on the brain,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'If there is any major bleeding inside the brain you have the issue of the build-up of blood within the skull, and that blood causes pressure on the brain which can cause further injury. 'Basically you are squeezing the cells, but that increased pressure also prevents the oxygenated blood getting into the brain, and the venous blood from flowing out.' Injuries of this nature are more commonly a result of road accidents or at times alcohol-related violence.","Surgeons spent almost an hour reducing swelling on Phil Hughes' brain .

"Claim: WPC Kelly Jones, 33, has launched the health and safety claim against the owner of the station in Thetford, Norfolk, where she tripped on a 6in kerb . A policewoman who answered a midnight call to a suspected burglary is suing the man who dialled 999 – because she tripped over a kerbstone. WPC Kelly Jones is seeking a potential five-figure payout after claiming the owner of a petrol station failed to keep her safe as she investigated the possible break-in. Her claim that the 999 call exposed her to ‘an unnecessary risk of injury’ raises new questions about the extent of Britain’s compensation culture, and has wide-reaching implications for anyone who calls the emergency services to their property. WPC Jones, 33, has hired a top firm of London solicitors specialising in personal injury lawsuits – but her health-and-safety claim has shocked MPs, who have branded the lawsuit ‘bizarre’. Petrol station owner Steve Jones is enraged by the WPC’s action against him, saying: ‘I am incredulous that I am being sued by a police officer whose duty is to protect the public. ‘How can anyone feel safe calling the cops if they size you up for compensation while they’re fighting crime? 'Surely policing has elements of both public service and risk. Isn’t that what officers sign up for when they put on the uniform – chasing villains and keeping us safe?’ WPC Jones tripped on a 6in kerb as she was checking the petrol station in Thetford, Norfolk, with the owner. He said: ‘I thought nothing of it – other than she must have been a bit embarrassed – and I helped her up. Then we carried on with the search.’ Mr Jones, 50, had called 999 after the alarm went off at Nuns’ Bridges Service Station on August 25 last year. He had put the incident out of his mind – until he received a  three-page letter from WPC Jones’s lawyers Pattinson Brewer last week. Incident: Steve Jones called 999 after the alarm was triggered at Nuns' Bridges Service Station, where the policewoman tripped on the 6in kerb (pictured) In good spirits: WPC Jones pictured on Saturday. She appeared in good health, carrying bags of shopping, but refused to answer questions about the case . The document made a total of 11 allegations against him – including that he failed to turn the lights on or warn her of the kerb. She says she injured her left leg and her right wrist in the fall – although she was well enough to continue the search of the garage at the time. Mr Jones is accused of ‘failing to ensure [WPC Jones] was reasonably safe in using the premises for which she was permitted/invited by you to be there’ and of a ‘failure to carry out any and/or adequate risk assessment’. The letter concludes the 999 call-out ‘exposed our client to an unnecessary risk of injury’. Keith Vaz, chairman of the powerful Home Affairs Committee, is now demanding urgent Home Office guidelines on the issue. He said: ‘This civil claim will have huge implications for every citizen if they call police out to their premises to help them in an emergency. Part one: The letter that Mr Jones received from WPC Jones's lawyers Pattinson Brewer last week . ‘It is in the public interest to know where exactly people stand in  circumstances like this. If there  are going to be cases like this, then  people will feel reluctant to call the police in case they are sued. ‘I do not think in such circumstances the public would feel they had a responsibility for health and safety issues, in the middle of the night while apparently facing danger. 'It’s a bizarre case and we need some urgent guidelines from the Home Office.’ Norfolk MP Norman Lamb added that any successful lawsuit would ‘set an extraordinary precedent’. He added: ‘I think most people would regard it as quite bizarre that an officer acting in the course of their duties would pursue a claim against a member of the public who has legitimately called them out. 'It is preposterous to imagine that it is appropriate; it is the police doing the job they are employed to do.’ Part two: In the letter, the petrol station owner is accused of exposing the policewoman 'to an unnecessary risk of injury' His thoughts were, understandably, echoed by garage owner Mr Jones, whose business had previously been targeted by a professional gang of thieves. He said: ‘If an officer can now sue you because they’ve tripped over on your property what does that mean for the average homeowner? ‘If you hear a burglar downstairs, do you have to nail down your stair carpet, close the windows and put the lights on before you dial 999? 'This is the health and safety culture at work, the fallacy that someone is to blame for any and every accident and that compensation is free.’ When The Mail on Sunday traced WPC Jones to her semi-detached home in Thetford, she declined to answer questions about the case. The mother of two appeared in good health, carrying bags of shopping from her 4x4 into her house and laughing and joking. Injuries: WPC Jones claims she injured her left leg and her right wrist in the fall ¿ although she was well enough to continue the search of the garage at the time . Trip: The kerb upon which WPC Jones tripped in the station's jet wash area. The lawyers claim 'there was little to draw this raised section to our client's notice' She took the legal action without the knowledge of her employers at Norfolk Constabulary, who knew nothing about it until alerted by this paper on Friday. The force declined to say if WPC Jones had finished her shift on the night in question or if she had gone on sick leave and if so, whether she had returned to duty. Implications: Keith Vaz, chairman of the powerful Home Affairs Committee, said: 'This civil claim will have huge implications for every citizen if they call police' A spokeswoman said: ‘Norfolk Constabulary was unaware of this litigation and as it appears to be a private matter the officer has chosen to undertake, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’ The precise nature and extent of WPC’s Jones’s injuries are not known, although her claim states she went to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds for treatment. It does not specify if the treatment is ongoing. Pattinson Brewer said the case was instigated by employees’ body, the Police Federation. Spokesman Chris Theobald said: ‘In response to a recent request from the Police Federation we are representing their woman police officer member Kelly Jones. ‘The officer was attending a 999 call and she subsequently made certain allegations against the proprietors of a service station which have now been detailed to them in writing. 'The basis of any future claim will be determined by a court and a judge, who will make an independent determination of culpability and the award of any damages based solely on the evidence supplied by both parties.’ Pattinson Brewer’s website says compensation for a serious wrist injury can be as high as £30,500, with payouts for more minor injuries approaching £3,000. Compensation for a leg injury could reach £16,000 for a bad fracture, with a simple break being valued at £5,000. Paul Ridgway, chairman of the Norfolk Police Federation, told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘If officers get injured in an incident, it’s going to be for a court to decide whether someone is at fault or not, whether it be a health and safety issue or otherwise.’ A spokesman for the Police Federation, the 'union' for rank-and-file officers, said: 'The vast majority of police officers undertake their duties with public protection as their top priority, with the potential risk to themselves as a secondary consideration, if at all. 'However, on occasion private prosecutions and civil claims are made by police officers – and they must be treated each on their own merits. 'However, we share the public view that policing is a job that carries with it a reasonable amount of risk, at times much higher than that. 'The Constables Central Committee is funding this particular case and the decision making for this lies with them. We are unable to discuss the details of this case further.' Private matter: She took the legal action without the knowledge of her employers at Norfolk Constabulary. They described it as a 'private matter'","WPC Kelly Jones, 33, tripped on 6in kerb while checking station in Thetford .

"Michael Clarke has always been a rock for his teammates during tough times but never has the Australian cricket captain been tested so hard in the days leading up to the death of close friend Phillip Hughes. When Hughes was struck by a ball during day one of the Sheffield Shield at Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday, the skipper was one of the first people by the fallen cricketer's bedside at St Vincent's Hospital. Since then, Clarke had maintain a near-constant presence at the Darlinghurst hospital - in Sydney's inner-city - for the past two days alongside the batsman's distraught family, hoping for a change in his condition. Scroll down for video . Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke read a statement on behalf of Phillip Hughes' family after the shattering death of the 25-year-old cricket player . Australian team doctor Peter Brukner singled out Clarke for praise, saying he had been a rock of support for Hughes' parents - Greg and Virginia - as well as siblings Megan and Jason. The 33-year-old Clarke helped guide left-hander Hughes, eight year his junior, into the New South Wales and Test teams over the years. 'It's been a very difficult few days and we appreciate the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the general public. 'Cricket was Phillip's life, and we as a family shared that love of the game. 'We would like to thank all the medical and nursing staff at St Vincent's Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip. - we love you.' It was Clarke who read a statement by the devastated family to a packed press conference at the hospital late Thursday, before having to walk away as emotion overcame him. Dr Brukner then fought back tears as he credited the captain for providing strength and loving support desperately required in a time of need and sadness. 'Phillip has always been a little brother to Michael,' Dr Brukner said. 'Michael's efforts over the last 48 hours to support the family; the family was obviously going through a difficult time but I'm not sure they would have coped without Michael's assistance. 'I was just enormously impressed at the work he did and the genuine care and love he gave to the Hughes family.' A distraught Michael Clarke showed incredible strength reading a statement of behalf of the Hughes family, following the batsman's tragic death on Thursday afternoon. Michael Clarke finished the statement with the simple yet powerful words, 'we love you' Clarke was the first player at Hughes' bedside after his catastrophic accident and barely left his 'little brother's' bedside . Choking back tears, Brukner made a special tribute to Clarke in Thursday's hugely emotional press conference, remarking that 'Phillip's family was obviously going through a difficult time, but I'm not sure they could have coped without Michael's assistance' With his voice breaking and his head down, he read a tribute from the 25-year-old's family. 'We're devastated at the loss of our much loved son and brother, Phillip,' Clarke read bravely, not looking up from the family's statement in front of him. 'It's been a very difficult few days, we appreciate all the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the general public. 'Cricket was Phillip's life and we as a family shared that love of the game with him,' Clarke continued. 'We would like to thank all the nursing and medical staff at St Vincent's Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip.' Michael Clarke finished the statement with the simple yet powerful words: 'We love you.' Immediately Clarke rose and left the media conference to rejoin Hughes' friends, family and teammates. Michael Clarke leaves St Vincent's Hospital on Wednesday after visiting Phillip Hughes . Hughes and Clarke were close friends, with the cricket captain's wife Kyly calling Hughes their 'little brother' The Australian cricket captain had a bond with Phillip Hughes that went far beyond teammates. Clarke was the first player at Hughes' bedside after his catastrophic accident, suffered while the batsman played in a Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales. Clarke arrived at the hospital at 3.50pm on Tuesday afternoon, just 20 minutes after Hughes was taken into hospital in a critical condition, travelling by ambulance from SCG. The Australian captain barely left the hospital, leaving after midnight on Wednesday and Thursday, and returning later on both mornings.

"Parents are welcoming the return of their adult offspring back home as they admit living with their grown-up children can actually be a good thing. Rather than viewing the return of their children to the family home as a nuisance, more parents now admit there are mutual benefits to the boomerang generation. In a role reversal, parents confess their offspring are now available to provide a free taxi service as well as contribute to housework and pay their share of bills. Parents said the return of their adult offspring home because of money and relationship issues actually turns out better than they had expected, dispelling myths about the problems of the 'boomerang generation' Around 75 per cent of parents say their adult children now pay for their keep and 43 per cent say they like having their offspring back at home so they know they are eating properly, the survey by E.ON and Age UK found. Nine percent also confess they use their children as a taxi service. Four in ten parents say living together again with their children has actually worked out, compared to ten per cent who confess the experience has been worse than they feared. This will be welcome news to today's boomerang generation who are moving back home to be with their parents up to three times during their lives. Divorce and relationship breakdowns are the main reasons adults return, while almost a quarter move back temporarily while they save to buy their own home. The UK now has around 300,000 multi-generation households - up 20 per cent on pre-recession levels. The number of multi-generation houses have increased, with more adults moving back home with parents . Saving for a house, divorce and relationship breakdowns are the main reasons adults move back home . While 31 per cent have moved back home, 21 per cent confess to having done so on at least three occasions. And it would appear that grown up offspring are also happy with the arrangement, as 43 per cent enjoy going back to live with their parents and their home cooking. David Bird, Residential and Customer Operations Director at E.ON which did the study, said: 'There are a number of factors that have caused the Boomerang Generation trend - a major one being the rising cost of living. 'If there are suddenly more people under your roof, it's important to look at household utilities, including your energy bill, to see where you can make savings.' Parents say there are benefits to having their adult children back home, including a free taxi service . The latest report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that more than one in four 22 to 30-year-olds depend on their parents for somewhere to live. One of the main reason for this is that this age group were among the hardest hit during the recession - having been more likely to lose their jobs and suffer decreases in their incomes. The news that more returning offspring are now contributing to the family purse when they return home will also be welcome to parents, anxious about meeting the continuing costs of supporting them. In a survey last month, 44 per cent of parents said they were having to put off retiring because of the cost of funding their adult children, many of whom may have depended on them for extra funds after completing university. Gordon Morris, Managing Director at Age UK Enterprises, said: 'It's encouraging to see older parents and adult children are finding living together positive. 'It's important to be open and discuss factors such as bills and domestic chores when living under one roof; keeping an open dialogue helps ensure everyone is happy with the situation. 'It's equally important people in later life are aware of steps they can take to keep bills down regardless of whether their children have returned home to live with them.'","Four in ten parents say living with their children again has been good .

"Fourteen British troops are being investigated over the death of an Iraqi civilian on board a UK helicopter taking part in a top-secret mission. Tariq Sabri was carried unconscious from the Chinook aircraft and pronounced dead hours later on April 11, 2003. At the time he was being transported between what are described as ‘illegal prisons’ in the Iraq desert. The police investigation into Sabri¿s death comes just days after the International Criminal Court (ICC) launched a 'preliminary examination' into the alleged torture of Iraqi prisoners by UK troops . Sabri, an odd-job man, was buried without a post-mortem, making it hard to establish a cause of death. Now, The Mail on Sunday has been told how he made a lunge for British airmen aboard the helicopter and was knelt on for the remainder of the flight. The troops being questioned come from the RAF Regiment which last week was at the centre of a row over photos apparently showing airmen posing next to the dead bodies of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. The police investigation into Sabri’s . death comes just days after the International Criminal Court (ICC) launched a ‘preliminary examination’ into the alleged torture of Iraqi . prisoners by UK troops. The ICC probe, triggered by human rights . lawyer Phil Shiner, is controversial because the court usually . investigates Third World dictators who systematically maim and kill . civilians. On the night he died, Sabri was arrested . by Australian Special Forces on suspicion of being an insurgent and . handed over to airmen from No II Squadron, RAF Regiment for his transfer . to a detention centre. Fourteen soldiers from the No II RAF Regiment are being questioned over the incident in April 2003 . Sabri was led aboard the Chinook wearing a sandbag over his head and with his thumbs bound together with plastic-cuffs. Minutes after take-off, he stood up, ripped off his bindings and began swinging his arms aggressively. Fearing he would make a lunge for one of the machine guns stored on board, the airmen jumped on Sabri and pressed his body face-down against the floor. He was also allegedly punched and kicked. When the Chinook landed at the ‘secret prison’ Sabri was unresponsive. British airmen handed him over to US troops and his apparently lifeless body was dumped in the back of a Humvee truck. He received no first aid. UK personnel were later told he was dead. Last night a defence source said: ‘Mr Sabri’s death was a tragic accident, nothing more, nothing less. 'As the flight was over hostile territory, the Chinook was carrying a lot of weapons. When Sabri started behaving aggressively it was imperative that he was subdued. 'Sabri could have brought the Chinook down, killing everyone on board. Necessary force was used to restrain him, but nothing excessive.’ RAF Police are investigating why the . airmen failed to administer first aid and why a sandbag was placed over . his head – a method of restraining prisoners banned in the 1970s. On this occasion the airmen believe they were entitled to hood Sabri because the Chinook was a ‘sensitive environment’ and because the whereabouts of these ‘black ops’ jails was secret. At the time the RAF was responsible for transporting suspect insurgents between detention centres in flights so secretive that British Forces’ top lawyer in Iraq, Colonel Nicholas Mercer, was told nothing about them. Last night a Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ‘As the investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.’","Odd-job man Tariq Sabri died on board a UK helicopter in top-secret mission .

"Former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret (pictured) raped a 15-year-old girl together with Jimmy Savile, a court has hear . Jimmy Savile raped a 15-year-old girl with another DJ who told her afterwards, ‘You should be thanking us’, a court heard yesterday. The alleged victim said she was taken to a flat by former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret and ‘couldn’t believe it’ when she saw Savile was there. But the starstruck girl’s delight at meeting her hero turned to horror when Savile raped her, allegedly followed by Teret. Afterwards, Teret – known as Ugly Ray – is said to have told her that she should thank them for having taken her virginity. Teret, now 73, went on trial yesterday along with two other men for an alleged series of rapes and sexual offences involving 17 women over around 35 years. After Savile died in October 2011, he was found to have raped hundreds of boys and girls over several decades. Publicity surrounding the subsequent inquiry led to Teret’s alleged victims coming forward. He had already appeared in court in October 2013 charged with historical sex offences when the girl, now in her 60s, saw him on the television news. She had kept the alleged rape a secret from all except one person, but went to police after becoming enraged at the sight of him waving and smiling. Prosecutor Tim Evans told Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester that in his Sixties heyday, Teret was treated as royalty by schoolgirls at youth discos and clubs in Manchester where he DJed with Savile. Among them was the 15-year-old at an alcohol-free youth disco in 1963 or 1964 at Salford’s Higher Broughton Assembly Rooms. Jimmy Savile is pictured left next to former Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret in the 1970s . The youngster and her friend were wearing trendy Mary Quant dresses thanks to a relative in the fashion trade. While her friend was dancing, Teret – then in his early 20s, although he said he was 17 – sat beside her and took a cigarette out of his sock. Mr Evans said the girl, who had just left school, ‘thought that was cool’. He took her out in his bubble car, saying he needed to deliver some ‘fancy boots’ to a flat. When they arrived she saw Savile – already a famous DJ – and ‘couldn’t wait to tell her friends’, Mr Evans said. The girl, who was small for her age, was offered a Lucozade and told to sit on the bed, jurors heard. Mr Evans said: ‘Savile came and sat down next to her, told her she had lovely hair and began to stroke it.’ He told the court that she was about to explain how she had straightened it using an iron and brown paper when Savile pounced. The prosecutor said she later told police that he ‘put his hands up her skirt, pulled her knickers down and pushed her down on the bed’ as she cried: ‘What are you doing?’ Ray Teret leaving Manchester Minshull Crown Court today after the opening of his trial . The court heard he had met the girl in a club and then took her to a flat where Jimmy Savile was present . The court heard that one of the alleged rapes was committed between 1963 and 1964 'together with Jimmy Savile' (pictured) The alleged victim said she was wondering: ‘Why isn’t Ray stopping this?’ But she said that once Savile had finished and taken a pair of black boots out of the box, Teret pushed her back on the bed and raped her as well before making her perform a sex act on him. Then, in what Mr Evans said was the ‘callousness’ with which he treated his victims, Teret allegedly told her: ‘You should be thanking us because we have made it easier for the next person that goes there.’ She said Savile was taking a shower by then, so Teret gave her money for a bus home. But she threw it away, Mr Evans said, and went home where she only told her grandmother what had happened. He said the rape was a ‘joint enterprise’ in which Teret ‘selects the girl and lies about his age to get her to leave with him’ before taking her to the flat and ‘giving her’ to Savile. Ray Teret (pictured working as a DJ , is on trial charged with 18 rapes along with other offences . The court heard that Teret usually picked teenagers who looked young for their age and often brought them to flats for other men to abuse. One 14-year-old claims Teret kissed her while she was dancing at the Jimmy Savile Disc Club in Salford in 1962 before taking her to a bedsit and raping her. On another occasion she, too, was taken to a flat to meet Savile, she told police, and was starstruck as ‘DJs were a big deal – were royalty’. Teret’s alleged victims also included a 13-year-old who delivered newspapers in her school uniform. One day in 1967, he invited her in and raped her, the jury was told. After that, she visited often for sex, Mr Evans said, and was told to cough to ‘get rid of the little babies’. William Harper (pictured arriving at Minshull Street Court in Manchester) denies one count of attempted rape . Another who was 15 or 16 said Teret – who ‘copied Savile’s appearance and hung around Savile a lot’ – raped her after befriending her at a Manchester club called Beat City. Mr Evans told jurors not to be blinded by Savile’s notoriety, saying: ‘This is not guilt by association.’ Teret, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, denies 34 sexual offences including 18 rapes between 1962 and 1996 or 1997. William Harper, 66, of Stretford, Greater Manchester, denies the attempted rape of a girl under 16, while Alan Ledger, 63, of Altrincham, denies a serious sexual assault, two indecent assaults and one count of indecency with a child. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Court hears Ray Teret raped 15-year-old girl together with Jimmy Savile .

"The family of critically injured Phil Hughes were today at his bedside as the Australian cricketer fought for life after he was struck on the head by a cricket ball in an horrific accident at Sydney Cricket Ground. His family were joined by close friend Michael Clarke, who returned to St Vincent's Hospital at 7am this morning to be by Hughes' side. The Australian captain had left just hours before after spending seven hours in hospital supporting Hughes in the intensive care unit. Some of Hughes' team-mates also arrived at the hospital this morning, including Australian wicket keeper Brad Haddin. The New South Wales doctor John Orchard - who treated Hughes at the side of the pitch yesterday - went into the hospital about 8am. WARNING: Some pictures and video in this story may be distressing . This is the moment batsman Phillip Hughes collapsed and hit the ground face first at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday afternoon . Phil Hughes had copped a brutal bouncer to the head. New South Wales players rushed to help Phil Hughes after he fell onto the pitch . Hughes is currently in the Intensive Care Unit at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner suburbs. He is in an induced coma and in a critical condition . The moments leading up to Hughes' collapse shows the cricketer paused for a couple of moments before he hit the ground . The 25-year-old has been in an induced coma since he collapsed face first on the pitch on Tuesday when he was hit by a bouncer bowled by New South Wales' Sean Abbott during day one of the Sheffield Shield. He was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital - in Sydney's inner city suburb of Darlinghurst - for emergency surgery to reduce the swelling on his brain. It will be a tense wait for the South Australian batsman's family, who are from Macksville on the north coast of NSW. They released a statement late on Tuesday that said: 'The outcome of that surgery is unlikely to be known for the next 24 to 48 hours.' Horrified onlookers at the match watched as paramedics performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the batsman and treated him on the boundary for about 40 minutes. Hughes' mother and sister were in the stands at the time of the incident. The injured batsman was taken from the field on a medical transport vehicle. Players from both teams called for help after Hughes hit the ground on Tuesday afternoon . New South Wales players Sean Abbott (right) and Steve O'Keefe are pictured at the Sheffield Shield on Tuesday, when the tragic event occurred . The bouncer can be seen (left) just before it made contact with Hughes (left, right) Hughes (pictured) paused for a few moments before he dramatically sunk to the ground . He arrived at St Vincent's Hospital in an ambulance on life support before he underwent scans and was carted into the operating theatre, hospital spokesman David Faktor told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Faktor said the operation - similar to those performed on king-hit victims when they fall onto the pavement - took less than an hour. 'He's in the best of hands, he has loved ones here,' the spokesman said. Supportive messages are pouring in from the cricket community with Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland leading the charge. Mr Sutherland described how the cricket world was rallying behind the quiet achiever. 'He's a really popular guy, not just from Australia but from around the world,' Mr Sutherland said. 'His welfare is our highest priority.' The critically injured Hughes was carted by medical transport vehicle to a waiting ambulance as doctors worked to treat the batsman . Players and ambulance officers raised a white sheet to shield Hughes as he was loaded into a waiting vehicle . He was joined by a chorus of cricket legends including Kerry O'Keefe who told Radio 2GB: 'This is a bloke everybody likes. [Everybody] will be feeling the impact of this blow.' Former Australian cricketer Brett Lee told Channel Nine  the event was 'shocking', calling Hughes a ‘terrific guy from a beautiful family’ who has ‘his whole future ahead of him’. 'You just don’t think these things will happen in cricket,' Mr Lee said. 'You have guys that can bowl 150 kilometres per hour - the helmet isn't really a lot of protection.' Hughes' good friend David Warner issued this statement: 'He is a fighter and a champion and he will get through this' National coach Darren Lehmann described Hughes as a 'great fighter and a great young man' There has been a wave of support for Phil Hughes, with his family saying it may be 24 to 48 hours before we learn if his surgery was successful . More words of support from cricketer Dean Jones who also told Sean Abbott to 'stay strong' Craig McDermott shared his message on Twitter, saying his thoughts were with Hughes' family . Hughes' friend David Warner, who rode the medical transport vehicle with the injured cricketer off the pitch on Tuesday, described his friend as 'champion and a fighter'. 'He will get through this,' Warner wrote. Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne tweeted a message of support to Hughes and his family. 'Just heard the news about Phil Hughes, thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. Hang in there buddy, we are all fighting with u !!!' he wrote. Australian national coach Darren Lehmann tweeted: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with phil and his family! He is a great fighter and a great young man!' Test cricketer Peter Siddle was one of many others who sent messages of support, writing: 'Sad to hear about my little mate Hughsey. Thoughts go out to him and his family. Stay strong brother! X' While her husband was at hospital, Michael Clarke's partner Kyly - set to appear on television show Dancing With The Stars on Thursday night - urged her considerable number of followers on Instagram to say a prayer for Hughes. Media outside the Darlinghurst hospital on Tuesday night as Phil Hughes was treated inside . Visitors were seen coming in and out of the hospital throughout the afternoon and evening on Tuesday . Australian skipper Michael Clarke (pictured) was one of many who rushed to the hospital to be with Phil Hughes .

Commentator Dean Jones said: 'Feeling for Phil Hughes after being hit. He is not in a good way! Stay strong. Not your fault young man.' Cricketer Chris Lynn added: 'Thoughts are with little Huey. Absolute champion of a bloke! Fingers crossed your ok brother'. Many, including former Australian cricketer Nathan Bracken and coach Craig McDermott, said they were sending their thoughts to bowler Sean Abbott as well. Before the incident, Hughes had scored a composed 63 off 161 balls and looked to be in good form to claim Michael Clarke's vacant Test batting spot in next week's first Test against India. Loved ones, including his mother and sister, are with Phil Hughes at St Vincent's Hospital on Tuesday night . Hughes (pictured) suffered a nasty head injury at  day one of the Sheffield Shield clash . Hughes has played 26 Test matches for Australia and has scored three Test centuries. His injury prompted officials to call an early tea break with SA at 2-136 but play was then abandoned for the day. 'Clearly the priority is Phil's health and we want to keep his family fully informed,' a Cricket NSW spokesman said. Hughes was accompanied to hospital by NSW team doctor John Orchard. Cricket writer Peter Lalor tweeted earlier Hughes' may have left the grounds in a better state. 'Phil's condition improved before he was taken away in an ambulance,' he wrote. South Australian Cricket Association chief executive Keith Bradshaw said: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Phil and his family and friends. 'We are obviously very, very shocked with what's occurred and very upset.' Nine News reporter Will Dempsey was watching the match at the grounds when Phil Hughes was struck by the ball. 'I have still goosebumps. It was chilling,' Dempsey told Daily Mail Australia . 'There was this crack that echoed through the grounds. It was an eerie feeling, you knew something wasn't right. 'It didn't sound like leather hitting hard metal, it looked like a bouncer crept under his grill. 'Players ran to him as soon as he collapsed face first. 'Brad Haddin rolled Hughes onto his side and doctors were immediately at the grounds. 'Tom Cooper and David Warner stayed by his side for more than half an hour. They worked on Phil for around 45 minutes. 'There was dead silence at the grounds. No one in the stands spoke or move. No one left, unless they were moving closer to Hughes to help. 'Steve O'Keefe came off the ground crying. Hughes was loaded into one of two ambulances. It appeared that the helicopter landed at Paddington Barracks. 'Steve Smith came to the stands, visibly distressed. 'Speaking with Moises Henriques and Mark Waugh, Steve motioned to indicate that Phil had been hit underneath his jawline.. 'Sean Abbott, who had bowled to Hughes, was in the dressing room the entire time. Players were comforting each other, many were crying.' 'It was the second ball to hit a player in five overs. It was fast bowling but Abbott's ball to Hughes was a bit sharper than usual. 'The ambulance changed direction to avoid the crowds. People and guards were yelling at people who were trying to take photos of Phil as they loaded him into the ambulance. 'Umpires were shouting 'get away, get away' 'David Warner had been at Phil's side and walked up to his fiancé and daughter in the stands for a warm hug - he was really upset.'","Test hopeful Phil Hughes is in an induced coma following surgery at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital .

"Australian Test cricketer Ryan Harris says he and his teammates were given 'a bit of closure' following Phillip Hughes' funeral service. It came as the Australian Test squad touched down in Adelaide ahead of their first match since Hughes' death. Ryan Harris (centre) says he and his teammates were given 'a bit of closure' following Phillip Hughes' funeral service . Hughes, 25, died last Thursday after he was struck in the neck by a cricket ball. His funeral service was held on Wednesday . Harris said some of his teammates had not even thought about playing since Hughes' tragic death last Thursday after he was hit with a cricket ball in the neck. 'I know some guys have really struggled. Some haven't even picked up a bat or ball yet since it happened,' he wrote. 'They're just not going to know, until they pick a bat or ball up, whether or not they're going to be capable of playing.' Harris said Hughes' funeral service was a turning point for the group, describing it as 'a bit of milestone'. Players - including Chris Rogers (left) and Mitchell Johnson (right) - arrive ahead of Tuesday's Test match against India in Adelaide . The Australian Test squad landed in South Australia a day after attending the funeral service of Phillip Hughes . 'As well as to pay your respects, it gives you a bit of closure. Now it's done I think there are a few more guys determined to get back on the park - but there's still a couple who are really hurting,' he said. There has been a lot of speculation surrounding when young bowler Sean Abbott - the man who bowled the bouncer that struck Hughes - would return to action. Since the incident, the cricketing community have rallied behind Abbott who was reportedly not coping well with his role in felling the batsman in the freak accident. The young bowler was seen back at training on Friday but the NSW side will leave the decision about whether or not he will play against Queensland up to the 21-year-old, news.com.au reported. Harris said the importance of Australia playing against India on Tuesday only hit home while he and thousands of other cricketing stars, family and friends walked behind Hughes' hearse . In that moment of realisation, Harris said he tapped teammate Mitchell Johnson on the arm and said: 'Far out, this is why we've got to play next week' Sean Abbott (pictured on Wednesday) will decide whether or not he will be ready to play in round five of Tuesday's Sheffield Shield . If Abbott does decide to step up to the crease again also on Tuesday for round five of the Sheffield Shield, he will do so on the same field, Sydney Cricket Ground, where his bouncer struck Hughes last Tuesday. Harris said the importance of Australia playing against India on Tuesday only hit home while he and thousands of other cricketing stars, family and friends walked behind Hughes' hearse following the service at Macksville High School hall - on New South Wales' mid-north coast. He said seeing all the people lining the streets of the 2,600-strong town to farewell Hughes 'really struck a chord' with him. In that moment of realisation, Harris said he tapped teammate Mitchell Johnson on the arm and said: 'Far out, this is why we've got to play next week'. A series of staggered arrivals in Adelaide have started ahead of Tuesday's Test match against India. The Marsh brothers - Mitch and Shaun - landed in the South Australian capital along with Mitchell Johnson, Ryan Harris, Steve Smith and Chris Rogers on Thursday afternoon. Shaun Marsh was a late addition to the squad, covering for captain Michael Clarke who will not be playing because of a hamstring injury. Tragically, Hughes was tipped to replace his close friend in the lead up to the first Test match in Brisbane, which was cancelled following his death.","Australian Test cricketer Ryan Harris says Phillip Hughes' funeral got the squad thinking about the game again .

"We are constantly told how 'booking online' could save us a tidy amount on our hotels and holidays. But a new study has shown that other customers may still be getting a better deal - even when the search criteria is identical. And often it pays to be a member of the website you're buying from. There are a number of factors to consider when trying to get the best holiday and hotel deals . A study titled 'Measuring Price Discrimination and Steering on E-commerce Web Sites' by Northeastern University in Boston, US, has discovered that online price discrimination exists, and users are often 'price steered' according to recent bookings and browser history. It may not be news to some, and confirm what a lot of us have long believed to be true, but deals being dependent on what 'device' you're using to make a booking may surprise you. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Christo Wilson, who co-wrote the report, said: 'We found several instances of personalization on the travel sites. 'Cheapticket and Orbitz both give 'Members Only' deals on hotels to users who are logged-in. The discounts pop up on 5 per cent of hotels, and amount to $12/night off on average. Travelocity gives discounts to iPhone users: 5 per cent of hotels were marked down by $15/night on average. Searching on a mobile in different locations may be a good bet for best prices . 'Expedia and Hotels.com steer a small fraction of their users (less than 10 per cent) towards cheaper hotel rooms. These sites appear to be performing pricing experiments on their users using a technique called A/B testing. 'Users are randomly assigned to groups based on their cookie; two groups are shown average hotel prices of about $187/night, while the third group is shown hotels of about $170/night. 'There is mounting evidence that e-commerce companies are using personalization algorithms to implement price steering and discrimination.' The report, that focused on a wide-range of companies, used Cheaptickets, Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline and Travelocity for its travel analysis. The report has found that hotel and holiday prices can vary dependent on what device you are using to search . The study found that users are placed into different 'buckets' dependent on a number of factors, including browser trends. Cookies that store information about buying trends across the internet can help website tailor a set of results for the user. Expedia uses this method of steering on its hotel searches, although price discrimination was not found when using this website. Here are a few tips to help you get the best deal possible on hotel and holiday searches... Clear your cookies - websites use trends stored in these to tailor your search to different hotels - and this could be the more expensive ones. Delete your browser history. Be patient - Adding a selection to your basket doesn't mean you have to purchase immediately. Some retailers will continue to alter prices dependent on popularity and time-span, so it's often worth taking a risk and holding fire. Use different devices - Some companies will tailor results by what device and platform you are using, so it pays to carry out a few searches using different means. Location, location, location - If you are always on the move, try conducting a search from different parts of the country, or world. This has been found to influence search results. However on Cheaptickets and Orbitz, which are actually one company, the research found that users who were 'logged in' generally received a better deal than visitors. The report continues; 'First, although members-only prices may be an accepted practice, it still qualiﬁes as price discrimination.' Travelocity extended the results still further as research revealed prices differed depending on what device you were using to book hotels. 'Travelocity alters hotel search results for users who browse from iOS devices,' it continues. 'Users browsing with Safari on iOS  receives lightly different hotels, and in a much different order than users browsing from Chrome on Android, Safari on OS X or other desktop browsers.' Priceline alters hotel search results based on the user's history of clicks and purchases although there was no evidence of price discrimination. This kind of price discrimination is not illegal, demonstrated of when it can prove advantageous for the customer, an example being when you have printed off a money-off voucher for goods. There are ways to keep ahead of the game and be in the best position to get the best deals however: search when signed in, then when not, clear the cookies on your browser, and use different devices when conducting a search.

"A stampede of Chinese and Russian investors is snapping up British homes aimed at families and first-time buyers. Houses in South Wales, cottages in Weston-super-Mare, and flats in Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among properties offered at foreign investment fairs and on estate agents’ websites in China and Russia. Until now, wealthy overseas buyers have largely focused on mansions and exclusive riverside flats in London. Investment: Flats in Sheffield, advertised on a Chinese estate agent’s website. Some Chinese buyers who can pay in cash are touring northern towns to find investment opportunities . But an investigation by the Mail found investors keen to make a profit from the booming UK property market are purchasing homes across the country. Some Chinese buyers who can pay in cash are touring northern towns to find investment opportunities. Experts fear this trend will force up prices for ordinary families. The number of homes bought with cash rose by about a fifth over the past year, according to estate agents Savills, suggesting a surge in wealthy investors. Paula Higgins, of consumer group the HomeOwners Alliance, said: ‘The money from these buyers should be invested in businesses or the manufacturing industry not in family homes. ‘This pushes up prices out of reach of families. How are first-time buyers supposed to… compete with a foreign investor who can pay for a home up front with cash?’ Britain is in the grip of an intense housing shortage. An estimated 240,000 new homes are needed each year in England, but only around half this figure is being built. Although price rises are expected to slow next year, the average home costs nearly ten times average earnings at £262,823 – the biggest disparity since the housing boom peak in 2007. The South East has seen the greatest increases, with prices climbing by 10.9 per cent to an average £263,333 according to Halifax bank. Britain’s biggest buy-to-let landlords: Fergus and Judith Wilson (above), who are selling 1,000 properties, said they expect them to be sold to an investor in China, but have also received interest from Russian buyers . Prices in the North West and Yorkshire and Humber rose by around 8 per cent, driving the cost of the average home in these areas up to £137,295 and £130,206 respectively. In London, the top end of the housing market is being propped up by foreign buyers. Previous research revealed as much as 85 per cent of prime property purchases there are being made with foreign money. Estate agent network London Property Partners said just 15 per cent of its sales in the capital up until June 2013 were made by UK buyers. But property experts say that because prices have soared by 19 per cent in 18 months in London, many overseas investors are targeting homes further afield where prices are cheaper. Angliadom, a property firm in Russia, encourages buyers to consider towns outside London. The firm’s website advises that Swindon is one of the top places in Britain to buy property with prices that are up 20 or 30 per cent cheaper than similar towns. Another firm with offices in Moscow and St Petersburg, All European Estate, advertises 2,368 UK properties, including family homes in Wales, the North West and the home counties. Prices vary from £100,000 for smaller flats, up to £1million for large country retreats. Another site aimed at foreign buyers, lists two-bedroom flats in Manchester available in 2016, selling for £98,000. An estimated 63million Chinese people are wealthy enough to afford a property overseas, according to Chinese estate agents Juwai. Options: IP Global, in Hong Kong, said it is making its first foray into the Slough property market, and another Chinese firm is offering 'micro-apartments' in Sheffield and Manchester (pictured) Last month Britain’s biggest buy-to-let landlords Fergus and Judith Wilson, who are selling 1,000 properties, said they expect them to be sold to an investor in China, but have also received interest from Russian buyers. IP Global, in Hong Kong, said it is making its first foray into the Slough property market, and another Chinese firm is offering ‘micro-apartments’ in Sheffield and Manchester, promising rental returns of up to 8 per cent. Industry insiders say some British properties are offered in China weeks before they go on sale in the UK. Michael Sacks, of Sequre Property Investment, said foreign investors buying homes above their real value were ‘corrupting the market’. He said overseas investment had seen prices for two-bedroom apartments in Manchester go ‘through the roof’. ‘We know that Chinese investment companies are securing entire developments and then selling them to investors overseas for significantly more than they are actually worth, 25 to 35 per cent more in some cases,’ he said. Cheshire-based property firm Assetz said around a third of its British sales in August were to Chinese buyers. The British Property Federation’s Ian Fletcher said not all foreign investors who buy residential property are ‘looking to … make huge capital gains’ adding that ‘members have not found this to be a trend outside the capital’. But campaigners have called for the Government to help UK buyers. David King, of Priced Out, said: ‘Foreign investment is driving up prices, making it even harder for ordinary people to get a decent place to live.’","Foreign investors buying UK homes aimed at families and first-time buyers .

"Desperate house-hunters will be out in their thousands this weekend, hopeful of snagging their little piece of Australia, in what some property analysts predict could be the biggest Spring auction clear-out in many years. The auction boom comes after a recent flattening of the market in the country's major cities. SQM Research analyst Louis Christopher says this weekend is shaping as 'the crescendo of the season, with very large auction numbers'. Mr Christopher said that while many pundits were calling the east coast's market being over priced,  there are hidden gems to be found because of the real estate market's 'distressed properties'. A 27th floor luxury two-bedroom apartment in Surfers Paradise is a prime example of bargains to be had in 'distressed properties sales' An overseas owner is wanting to divest from the Enderley Avenue apartment in Surfers Paradise and the price is listed at $549,000 . He says there will be frantic buying this weekend. 'There are a massive 1750 auctions in Melbourne this weekend, 180 auctions in Brisbane and about 950 auctions in Sydney,' Mr Christopher told Daily Mail Australia. 'These are huge numbers and are up massively from the same weekend last year. In Melbourne, for instance, this time last year there was 1050 auctions.' In an often overheating Australian property market - Mr Christopher says there are prime pieces of real estate which are going for a song as owners are forced into quick sales. And the hot spot for such sales is undoubtedly south-east Queensland. In an often overheating Australian property market - Mr Christopher says there are prime pieces of real estate which are going for a song as owners are forced into quick sales and south-east Queensland is the hot-spot . He nominated a 27th floor luxury two-bedroom apartment in Surfers Paradise as a prime example.

"A mother-of-one who almost lost her arm in a horror car crash, has defied doctors to become a personal trainer who can lift half her body weight. Joan Steel's arm was left hanging by a thread after she was involved in a serious car crash, in her home town of Cape Town, South Africa. The talented concern pianist, 37, who now lives in London, was on her way to a show when the tyre burst, causing the car to roll five times and trap her arm in the process. Joan, pictured at a competition, almost lost her arm in a horror car crash but has defied doctors . Joan was told by medics at the scene in 1997 that she would need her arm amputated as it was so badly damaged in the crash. But doctors battled to save her arm and managed to reattach it by carrying out painful skin grafts and inserting a steel plate rod inside. But Joan was told she would never be able to use her arm in the same way again. However, she defied doctors and used weight training as an outlet for her frustrations and 17 years on is she's working as a personal trainer. She said: 'I can still remember looking down and seeing my arm just hanging on by a piece of skin. It was a very traumatic time and I was distraught at the thought of losing my arm, especially as I was a concert pianist at the time. 'The tyre burst and the car just skidded and rolled over. I must have fallen out of the car and my arm was ripped off. The medics told me I would lose it but I was determined to try and keep it.' Joan's arm was left hanging by a thread after she was involved in a serious car crash . Joan's arm was saved, but she was left with restricted movement . After endless surgery, Joan's arm was saved, but she was left with restricted movement and doctors told her she would never be able to use it again. Joan said: 'I was devastated and frustrated that I couldn't bend my arm, and it seemed alien to me.' After years of recovery, Joan and her seven-year-old daughter Leila moved to London, where she was determined to pursue a fitness career- despite her damaged arm. Joan said: 'I threw myself into fitness and weight training it was a way of me coping with what happened. Joan and her daughter Leila moved to London, where she was determined to pursue a fitness career . 'I found a competition called Miss Galaxy Universe and it inspired me to keep going. I have entered over the past few years and I was delighted to come 5th out of 90 in the fitness round. 'I was so proud of myself because I do have restriction in my arm, and I have worked hard to get my body strong and fit again.' Through sheer determination and careful training Joan can now bench press half her body weight - 32kg - and regularly trains with kettlebells, as well as working as a personal fitness instructor for others. She was determined to pursue a fitness career- despite her damaged arm . She found the Miss Galaxy Universe competition and it inspired her to keep going . Joan said: 'I want to promote the idea that strong is healthy and that a strong mind and body go hand in hand together. Joan is actively involved in the Miss Galaxy Universe competition, which happens twice a year and regularly inspires other entrants with her personal success story. She said: 'My goal is to help other people. I am single mum, and I truly believe in perseverance and a positive attitude. 'I still have nerve damage in my arm, but despite doctors telling me I would never use it again, I have worked hard to become strong and use my life experiences as an inspirational tool for others.'

"Australian property is now the most overvalued in the world as the Spring action season continues to break records with 80 per cent of properties under the hammer selling at a record rate. Property experts say the 'lack of supply' is driving up house prices to 'crazy levels' across the country. New research for Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has found that Australian home prices are higher than they typically have been when compared to rents and incomes. Scroll down for video . 9 Pyrl Road, Artamon in Sydney's north west was sold for $2,950,000, that was $350,000 above the reserve . One house that did very well at auction over the weekend was one sold by John McManus an agent for LJ Hooker Willoughby. It was 9 Pyrl Road, Artamon in north Sydney and it went for $350,000 above the reserve. Mr McManus told Daily Mail Australia: 'It was incredible, the neighbours could not believe it, it was fierce bidding and it broke all records in Artamon. 'It caught us all off guard, we thought it would go for $2.4million or $2.5million. 'It was just crazy and it went well above the reserve we set of $2.6million. Mr McManus for LJ Hooker Willoughby said: 'It caught us all off guard' The five bedroom home is very desirable with a swimming pool and is close to local schools . It also has two bathrooms and two car parking spaces . 'This is going to be one of the biggest seasons for property between September, October, November and I think it will go into December. 'All my buyers are saying we need to buy sooner rather than later and I am doing everything I can, but there is just not enough stock.' Another home that went well above the auction price was 60 Phillip Street, Birchgrove, near Balmain in Sydney's inner west. 60 Phillip Street, Birchgrove, Sydney sold for $1,227,000, that was $77,000 above the reserve price . Agent Monique Dower said: 'Buyers just need to keep looking' The house sold for $1,227,000 this weekend and it went $77,000 above the auction reserve. Agent Monique Dower for Belle Property in Balmain told Daily Mail Australia: 'There has been a lack of supply for a year and a half and it is busy with more buyer interest. 'We are telling buyers to be be patient and keep looking because this area is only going to continue to thrive. 'Buyers just need to keep looking. The Spring market has started a bit earlier this year and we were very surprised to see this house sell for so much, it's crazy. 'We need more of these kinds of two bedroom properties, there is a lot of demand for them. 'We will see more three and four bedroom homes coming onto the market in a few weeks. 'The reserve for this house was $115,000,000 so it went well above. 'The lack of supply and demand is causing the madness, any house with parking and a harbour view is going to be desirable.' The auction market is also very competitive in Melbourne with over 1000 homes a week being sold under the hammer. 13 Edro Avenue, Brighton East,  Victoria, south of Melbourne, was one of the country's top sales this weekend . The was one of the top homes sold by HockingsStuart in Melbourne . The five bedroom luxury home has three bathrooms and two parking spaces . Recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund, the BIS has found that Australian home prices are higher than they typically have been when compared to rents and incomes. Homes across Australia were 50 per cent higher than usual relative to rents, and around 40 per cent higher than usual when compared to incomes, according to ABC. The BIS has warned that overvalued markets are more likely to see prices slide in the future, especially in Australia where wages are not growing strongly. Queensland estate agent Jan Cower for Ray White Alderley told Daily Mail Australia it was 'very unusual' for auction homes to go way above their reserve. She said: 'The property market is slower up here than in Melbourne and Sydney.' This unit in Newmarket, of five flats was sold for $1.79million, $90,000 above its reserve price . Jan Cowan said the sale was 'very unusual' because it was a rare property . This unit in  North Street,Newmarket, north of Brisbane, sold for $1.79million, that was $90,000 above the reserve price. Robert Larocca, auction market expert for RP Data . Ms Cowan added: 'It was a rare kind of property and bidding was very good. There was a lot of interest with the block being just 4km from the city.' Robert Larocca, auction market spokesman for RP Data, told Daily Mail Australia: 'This is the best start to Spring we have had since 2010, it is very good. 'We have got a really strong Sydney market and a very healthy Melbourne market and that is where most of the examples are across Australia. 'The state of the market will be of no surprise to people who have been following it. 'The clearance rates we are seeing are not dissimilar to last year, 80 per cent is very strong and to see it continuing is a the sign of a very strong market. 'Sellers price expectations are being regularly exceeded, that will encourage more home-owners to put their homes on the market. 'Melbourne's auction market is not quite as strong as Sydney but we have around 1000 homes on the auctions this week and that is a good sign.'","Auction markets in Sydney and Melbourne strongest across the country .

"Tottenham has confirmed Paul Mitchell's move from Southampton to become the north London club's head of recruitment and analysis. Mitchell is hailed as a driving force in the successful scouting and hiring structure that has seen the Saints turn a troubled summer into a remarkable success with their improved squad coming at a profit of £37million. 'We are delighted to announce that Paul Mitchell has joined the Club as Head of Recruitment and Analysis,' Spurs announced on their website before outlining his background. Tottenham sold Gareth Bale to La Liga giants Real Madrid for £86million in 2013 . Paul Mitchell's task is to overhaul Tottenham's scouting system and have the success he did at Southampton . Tottenham technical director Franco Baldini could be heading for the White Hart Lane exit door . Roberto Soldado Spanish, 29, F, £26.4m . Verdict: Underwhelming. Six goals and six assists in 33 Premier League games is a costly return. Erik Lamela Argentinian, 22, AM, £25.7m . Verdict: Nearly-man. Lavish talent but no goals in 20 PL games. Paulinho Brazilian, 26, M, £17.4m . Verdict: Miss. Far from the best midfielder in north London, let alone Brazil. Etienne Capoue French, 26, M, £9.7m . Verdict: Jury out. Patchy form and injuries have disrupted his season. Christian Eriksen Danish, 22, M, £11.5m . Verdict: Mercurial. Brilliant last season, less so this. 10 PL goals, eight assists. Ben Davies Welsh, 21, D, £10m . Verdict: Miss. One PL game is a poor return. Vlad Chiriches Romanian, 25, D, £8.5m . Verdict: Middling at best. Solid early but unreliable. Federico Fazio Argentinian, 27, D £8m . Verdict: Miss. Error-prone, two red cards already. Nacer Chadli Belgian, 25, AM, £7.2m . Verdict: Hit. Best value of all, PL goals (seven) and assists (four). Eric Dier English, 20, D, £4m . Verdict: Promising. Early goals (two in PL) and shows potential. Ben Stambouli, French, 24, M, £4.7m . Verdict: Miss. Just one sub PL appearance. DeAndre Yedlin (US, 21, £2.5m) & Michel Vorm (Dutch, 31, £5m) Yedlin on loan. Vorm yet to play in PL. 'A former player with Wigan Athletic and MK Dons, Paul initially took up the role of community ambassador with the Dons when he retired from playing in 2009 at the age of 27. 'Following the appointment of Karl Robinson as manager in 2010, Paul was assigned to his back room staff as Head of Recruitment, recognising his aptitude for identifying player talent. 'He joined Southampton in January, 2012 to manage their Scouting and Recruitment department.' Southampton farewelled some of their biggest players, including Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert, along with coach Mauricio Pochettino to Spurs in the off-season. But they've rebuilt under Ronald Koeman and sit a lofty second on the Premier League ladder. The appointment could mean the end of Spurs’s technical director Franco Baldini's tenure at the club . Baldini, 54, has been in his job since summer last year and oversaw player departures including Spurs’ best player and talisman Gareth Bale for a world record £86m. Results have been mixed for the 13 faces brought in partly with the cash raised, from Paulinho to Roberto Soldado to Erik Lamela and, more recently, Federico Fazio and Ben Stambouli. ‘Franco is pretty relaxed about the situation but he knows in football that people come and go and that he’ll be moving on at some point, whenever that is,’ said a source. Mitchell, 33, follows Pochettino from St Mary's to White Hart Lane where Saints players including Jay Rodriguez and Morgan Schneiderlin are highly coveted. Pochettino is the fifth permanent manager in seven years since Juande Ramos joined in 2007 and the Argentine has been left a squad that isn't able to flourish under his high-tempo pressing system that so impressed in the south. Spurs had lost three of their four league games leading up to Sunday's unconvincing three points over Hull that required a 90th minute winner from Christian Eriksen. Paulinho and Roberto Soldado are among the players who have failed to impress since joining the club . Tottenham's Harry Kane has said his team-mates need time to adapt to Mauricio Pochettino's style . Pochettino's Spurs climbed from 12th to 10th with a last-ditch win over Hull on Sunday . Tottenham fan Martin Cloake, who wrote the book Taking Our Ball Back, says the staff merri-go-round at White Hart Lane is hurting the club. ‘It’s clear that there has been too much change in personnel recently,’ he says of Spurs’ dilemma. ‘There’s not much sense of team spirit evident when we play and no real leaders stand out. ‘There are lots of players with potential flair, perhaps fewer of the type who will dig in and help to hold a team together — therefore letting the flair players express themselves. ‘Off the pitch, the phrase ‘I’ve never felt so disconnected from the club I support’ keeps coming up. That’s partly because of the discontent with the top level of football in this country but it’s also because those running the club too often come across as aloof and as treating the fans as cash cows.'","Paul Mitchell move confirmed from Saints, where he's worked since 2012 .

Sinfield celebrate a momentous Challenge Cup triumph in the summer claiming a final win over Castleford after six previous defeats for the club since 2000.

"McDonald's has taken the unprecedented step of allowing cameras inside one of its secret food factory's for the first time in a bid to end the rumors and urban myths about how its Happy Meals and Big Macs are made. Hurt by years of bad publicity amid claims of 'pink slime' chicken nuggets and Frankenfood, the fast food giant is pulling back its veil of production line secrecy to bring more transparency to its customers. The dramatic move is all part McDonald's new campaign in which it will bravely invite members of the public to submit any questions they have always wanted to know the answers to about their food. Scroll down for videos . Fighting back: The world's biggest hamburger chain is confronting unappetizing questions as part of a U.S. campaign to beat back perceptions that it serves Frankenfood . Grant Imahara, from TV show Mythbusters, went behind the scenes. Throwing the doors wide open to their Fresno, California food plants, McDonald's invited in a news crew from Good Morning America as part of their 'Our Food. Your Questions' public relations drive. Inside the cameras witnessed how the fast food firm processes 400,000 pounds of meat per day and confirmed that their burger patties are in fact 100 percent pure beef. As part of the new campaign, a series of commercials will launch this week in which members of the public ask questions which are then answered on social media. 'We're starting on a journey called 'Our Food. Your Questions,' and we want to open up the doors and let our customers ask us any questions they have, and give them answers,' said company director of quality systems Rickette Collins to GMA. Mixture: A McDonald's representative has said this meat 'is what we call beef trim, and it comes from familiar cuts that you may know, like chuck and round and sirloin' Not the finished product! Meat that has not yet been ground into patties is seen on a factory conveyor belt . Transformation: McDonald's meat goes through a grinder . Grant Imahara (pictured center), from TV show Mythbusters, went behind the scenes at the meat plant with staff . While the nation has long wondered about the mass production of so much food in McDonald's 35,000 locations worldwide, the company has decided to finally provide the answers or proof for the doubters. 'This is being done to address the questions, the comments and the concerns of our customers,' said company chief brand manager Kevin Newell to GMA. 'It's not linked to the business performance at all. It's linked to making sure that our customers truly know the story about McDonald's food.' Amid much of the mythbusting are questions about why its burgers may not rot and that there are no worms in its beef, through its 'Our Food. Your Questions.' campaign. McDonald's website says it uses '100% pure beef' The world's biggest hamburger chain is confronting unappetizing questions as part of a U.S. campaign to beat back perceptions that it serves Frankenfood. The company has run similar campaigns in Canada and Australia and said Monday it's bringing the effort to its flagship market. For its latest campaign, among the first issues McDonald's addresses are widely circulated online images and videos that show its burgers staying in tact after several weeks or even years. On its webpage, McDonald's says that's likely because the food has dehydrated, and that food needs moisture to form mold. The company's responses to other questions such as 'Does McDonald's beef contain worms?' are more direct: 'No. Gross! End of story.' The company dismissed claims that it uses human meat on Twitter, telling a user '@seph725 that's gross and totally false.' On its website, the company denies that it uses 'pink slime' in chicken nuggets, saying  'No, our Chicken McNuggets do not contain what some people call 'pink slime' or 'pink goop.' 'We've seen the photo of 'pink goop' or 'pink slime' in association with McDonald's. Let's set the record straight: this image in connection with McDonald's is a myth. In fact, we don't know where it came from, but it's not our food. The photo is not a representation of how we create our Chicken McNuggets, or for that matter, any item on our menu.' However, elsewhere McDonald's admits on the site that 'We use a small amount of an anti-foaming agent, dimethylpolysiloxane, in the oil we use to cook our Chicken McNuggets.' Tasty: McDonald's says its beef doesn't contain preservatives . Ready to answer: The world's biggest hamburger chain new social media campaign is called 'Our Food. Your Questions.' Denial: McDonald's says that 'pink slime' is not used to make Chicken McNuggets . It also reveals that 'pink slime' was used in a seven-year period for burgers, and that the chemical azodicarbonamide - which is used in yoga mats - is an ingredient in buns and rolls. 'There are varied uses for azodicarbonamide, including in some non-food products, such as yoga mats. As a result, some people have suggested our food contains rubber or plastic, or that the ingredient is unsafe. It's simply not the case. Think of salt: the salt you use in your food at home is a variation of the salt you may use to de-ice your sidewalk. The same is true of ADA — it can be used in different ways.' McDonald's also confesses to using hormones on its website, saying 'Most of the cattle we get our beef from are treated with added hormones, a common practice in the U.S. that ranchers use to promote growth.' As part of its campaign, McDonald's let ABC News see how the beef is produced in a California factory. Director of Quality Systems Rickette Collins, while holding some meat, told reporter Gio Benitez 'This is what we call beef trim, and it comes from familiar cuts that you may know, like chuck and round and sirloin.' Up front: McDonald's published this infographic as part of its campaign to inform customers how its food is actually produced . Speaking about the quality of McDonald's food, she said it's 'Just like you get at the grocery store - you buy like an 80/20 blend.' The new push comes as McDonald's fights to boost its performance in the U.S., where sales slid 1.5 percent at established locations in the most recent quarter, following a 0.2 percent dip for last year. In addition to increased competition, McDonald's is trying to keep up with changing tastes, with places such as Chipotle marketing their food as more wholesome alternatives. To improve the image of its food, McDonald's recently rolled out chicken wraps with sliced cucumbers and the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches. It also plans to eventually let people swap out the french fries in value meals with options like salad or vegetables. Ben Stringfellow, vice president of communications for McDonald's USA, said in a phone interview with the Associated Press that the campaign is a new way of engaging with customers more directly. He noted people are demanding for more information about products across the board, not just from McDonald's. 'In many ways, it's the way the world is going,' he said. Uncovered: McDonald's has admitted 'pink slime' was used in a seven-year period for burgers . Not-so-secret ingredients: McDonald's has admitted to using a foaming agent in its Chicken McNuggets . National TV ads will begin airing Monday letting people know about the push. McDonald's says people can submit questions via social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. The company plans to respond to the most common questions with videos or other posts, as well as responding one-on-one to questions, Stringfellow said. Laura Ries, a marketing consultant based in Atlanta, noted McDonald's risks bringing up unappetizing thoughts some people may never have heard about. 'I didn't know people thought there were worms in its beef, or that they didn't use real chicken,' Ries said. Still, she agreed that companies have to be more responsive to questions from customers, especially at a time when people can amplify their concerns and criticisms to bigger audiences on social media.","McDonald's has allowed cameras inside one of its food plants for first time .

"A golfer has been killed by a crocodile while retrieving balls from a dam called Lake Panic at Kruger National Park in South Africa. Jacques van der Sandt, 29, was dragged under the water by a crocodile last night and his body was found this morning with teeth marks on his back and chest. Police said the crocodile attacked Mr van der Sandt as he stood waist-deep in the water, reaching below the surface to feel for golf balls on the bottom of the dam. Golfer Jacques van der Sandt, 29, was killed by a crocodile as he tried to retrieve balls from a dam called Lake Panic at Kruger National Park, South Africa . Mr van der Sandt is thought to have come into contact with crocodiles before as both of his parents worked at the park . It is understood Mr van der Sandt and a friend had been playing hole nine on Skukuza Golf Club's course, which is played across Lake Panic at the park. Skukuza Police spokesman Oubass Coetzer said: 'One guy challenged the other to see who can retrieve the most golf balls.' A statement from Kruger National Park said: 'It is understood that a group of youngsters were hanging around after a game of golf when the incident happened. 'Apparently the crocodile surprised the group and snatched the victim, then disappeared under water.' It is understood that the park will carry out an internal investigation into the death. Local reports suggested that Mr van der Sandt was attacked at around 10pm last night. Mr van der Sandt's body was found this morning with teeth marks on his chest and back but he had not been 'mutilated' The crocodiles at the park have just come out of hibernation and were hunting for food, a park official said.

Dr Danny Govender, South African National Parks disease ecologist, told News24: 'These animals are not in good condition as they have just come out of hibernation. 'The animal was doing what naturally comes to them; hunting for food and unfortunately a life was lost in the process.' The victim was the son of park workers Schalk and Lorretha van der Sandt. The couple had been working in the park since 1992, although Schalk is now retired.","Golfer Jacques van der Sandt, 29, was killed by a crocodile last night .

"They've tested gourmet burgers and table service and even tried to bust the myths behind their food production. Now, McDonald's has turned to the trend of pop-up restaurants to try and sell their latest products. The fast food chain launched its latest promotion the Big Lunchbox on Wednesday, which will see an enormous lunchbox transform into a pop-up store and travel the country. McDonald's is using the demonstration as a means to promote their new menu which includes rump steak that they claim is '100% Aussie rump steak that has been marinated, slow cooked and finished off on the grill'. A McDonald's spokesman said customer feedback about their new menus has been positive. 'Customer feedback on our new Create Your Taste range, and our table service has been fantastic,' he said. But is it enough to keep the restaurant chain on top of the fast food market? Scroll down for video . McDonald's launched it's travelling pop-up store in Melbourne's Federation square on Wednesday . The global net income of the major food supplier has recorded a  profit drop of 30 per cent in the last quarter ending September 30. The company saw its total net income fall to $1.07 billion or $1.09 per share. As competition against other fast-food suppliers rises, and a food scandal in China damaging the company's reputation in Asia, McDonald's has tried to redeem themselves through a number of campaigns that promote it as a healthy, classy option. Rob Moodie, a professor of public health at the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia that he believes this continues to remain far from the truth. The demonstration is being used as a means to promote their new menu which includes rump steak . McDonald's claims the ingredient is made of '100% Aussie rump steak that has been marinated, slow cooked and finished off on the grill' 'One would hope these changes are because we as consumers are more discerning and demanding of healthy food, because that's the only way that we would ever receive a change in McDonald's rather than through government regulation,' Professor Mooide said. 'They are the masters of marketing, they don't come much better than Ronald McDonald for instance – he's the 21st century pied piper. 'They've been claiming for the last five to 10 years that they're part of the solution to the overweight issue, not the problem, but I'm yet to be convinced that they are. I have watched them closely for the last 10 years: their job is making money and they'll make money in any way they can – their job is not health.' The pop-up store is one of many recent attempts by the fast food company to boost their reputation following a huge drop in profits . The global net income of the major food supplier dropped by 30 per cent in the last quarter ending September 30. The company saw its total net income fall to $1.07 billion or $1.09 per share . Last week the restaurant launched a social media campaign called 'Our food. Your questions' in which the company answered questions from consumers like: 'Is pink slime in a Chicken McNugget?' and 'Why doesn't your food rot?' Although it provided a short-term lift in quality perception and purchase consideration, the company's key demographic of frequent fast-food eaters were largely unmoved by the campaigns, YouGov spokesman Drew Kerr told Reuters.

"A predicted rise in pests could cause vast bread and potato shortages and force the nation to change its diet, scientists claim. According to a study, Britain’s farms could be ‘overwhelmed’ by pests within the next 30 years and the risk to crops has been ‘significantly underestimated’. One in ten pest types are already present in half the world’s crop-producing countries. However this is set to increase dramatically as a result of climate change and inadequate biosecurity measures meant to protect species from disease. Researchers predict a rise in pests could cause vast bread and potato shortages and force nation change diet . And researchers at the University of Exeter say the UK is particularly vulnerable having ‘significantly underestimated’ the risk that crop pests pose to crops including wheat and potatoes. The study forecasts that factors including climate change, inadequate biosecurity measures and other new variants will help pests spread in the next three decades. Professor Sarah Gurr, of the University of Exeter and Rothamsted Research, said: ‘The UK has significantly underestimated the scale of the threat. ‘This is a huge problem that is lacking in public and political awareness. ‘People are absolutely paralysed with fear of diseases like Ebola, but while they are extremely dangerous, the need to tackle crop diseases is just as pressing. ‘We are not spending enough on research, on training, on surveillance and on biosecurity. ‘Unless we significantly step up our efforts we could be forced to change our diets in the future as crops come and go.’ Potential threats include fungi, bacteria, viruses and insects, with powdery mildew and leaf blotch posing a danger to wheat. Items like bread and potatoes are said to be at risk of pests in the UK after threat was 'underestimated' Potatoes are at risk from new variants of Phytophthora infestans – the blight which caused the catastrophic Irish potato famine of the late 1840s. Professor Gurr said that if pests go on to spread at their current rate, then a large proportion of the world’s biggest food-producing countries will be inundated with pests. Dr Dan Bebber, of the University of Exeter, who also worked on the report, told the Independent this would pose a ‘grave threat to global food security’. More than one in 10 pest types is already present in about half the crop-growing countries, but that level is set to increase dramatically, the report states. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘We take the issue of plant biosecurity very seriously and have appointed a chief plant health officer to oversee our work. 'This includes a plant health risk register and biosecurity strategy for the UK.’","Researchers say UK is particularly vulnerable after underestimating risks .

"Swansea may have suffered a heart-breaking set-back after blowing their lead against Manchester City but if they've let it get them down they aren't showing it. Swansea were on track to going level with City on the Premier League ladder when Wilfried Bony scored his fifth of the season inside the opening 10 minutes at the Etihad - but Stevan Jovetic and Yaya Toure goals saw to it that the Swans went home empty handed.

"'Systematic failure': His Honour Judge Nicholas Marston found the council had unlawfully deprived the teenager of her liberty . A judge has condemned a council which unlawfully took an autistic 19-year-old woman into care for more than a year and banned her parents from seeing her alone. Lawyers acting for the family from Yeovil, Somerset, accused the council of committing ‘one of the most serious cases of the deprivation of liberty’ ever seen by a court. The disabled woman - known only as P - was supposed to go into respite care with Somerset County Council for just two weeks while her parents went on a break. The young woman, who cannot speak, had injured herself at school three days earlier and her worried mother had alerted respite staff to self-inflicted bruising on her chest. But with her family out of the country, staff concluded the injury had been caused by ‘someone or something other than herself’ and decided to take her into care. Her desperate parents were then banned from unsupervised contact with her and forced to battle for 14 months to get her released. A judge at the Court of Protection has now criticised the council and ruled it acted unlawfully. The council has apologised but the couple are suing them for damages. The court heard how P was on a residential school placement before the separation, but had regular contact with her family. While on a school trip in May 2013 she was in an ‘extremely distressed condition’ after staff saw her ‘breathing heavily and hitting herself on the sternum area’. She displayed behaviour described as ‘severely challenging behaviour’ and had to be restrained by staff and taken home early. Her mother noticed bruising on her chest and, after consulting her GP, took her to an arranged respite placement in Yeovil three days after the school incident. Illegal move: Lawyers acting for the family from Yeovil accused Somerset County Council (whose headquarters are pictured) of committing 'one of the most serious cases of the deprivation of liberty' ever seen by a court . Despite alerting respite staff to the bruises, the teenager was taken to Yeovil District Hospital within days, but staff declined to tell the doctor - Dr K - about her previous incident at school. As a result Somerset County Council was called in and they decided to take P into full-time care. Her parents returned from holiday to hear of the decision in their absence. But after a nine-day trial earlier this year, His Honour Judge Nicholas Marston found the council had unlawfully deprived the teenager of her liberty. He said the lack of a ‘proper investigation’ showed a ‘systematic failure’ by the authority. He said: ‘[The doctor’s] report said “the bruising is felt to be comparable with a blow or blows to P’s anterior chest with a significant force or fall onto an object. ‘”This would be an unusual injury pattern to have been self-inflicted but if this was the case then it would be expected that such self-harm, which would have been demonstrably significant and painful, would have been witnessed”. ‘These are very significant words given that members of staff at the school had observed [previously] P breathing heavily and hitting herself on the sternum area. ‘This information was easily available but was never passed onto Dr K nor was further information that on the class trip P had displayed severely challenging behaviour pulling hair, kicking seats and that staff on that trip had been ""taken to the ground"" by P and she had had to be restrained in the approved holds for physical restraint on the trip. ‘Instead, at a strategy meeting, as a result of the conclusions of the medical report that it was “highly likely that P has received a significant injury from someone or something other than herself....” so instead it was decided she would not be returned to her mother.’ A spokesman for the family’s lawyers said P was now back at the family home and ‘settling in well’. She said: ‘The council did not take account of several possible explanations for the cause of the bruising, not least the fact that she had been observed hitting herself in that area and that she had also taken a member of staff to ground whilst out on a school trip. ‘Crucially, the young woman herself was not given the opportunity to explain how the bruising had occurred.’ She added: ‘In delivering his judgement that the council had unlawfully deprived P of her liberty, His Honour Judge Marston criticised the council for its systemic failure, its corporate failings and its misguided philosophies. ‘The council continued to pursue an unsubstantiated case against the family, and unreasonably refused to drop allegations made against them.’ Somerset County Council said it accepted the judge’s ruling and comments. A spokesman said: ‘We were completely motivated by serious concern for the young lady’s welfare. ‘We have apologised to the family for the distress that our actions caused and are working closely with them to provide the right care and support for their daughter now and in the future. ‘We have also taken urgent steps to ensure that all adult social care staff learn from this case and this situation never arises again.’","Somerset County Council took woman, 19, into care for more than a year .

"They were separated by 3,500 miles and two rather different jobs. In six-inch heels, Victoria Beckham click-clacked in the footsteps of world leaders at the United Nations in New York yesterday and made an impassioned plea to safeguard women’s health and stop babies dying of Aids. And husband David? He stayed at home to mind the shop. The new shop in Mayfair. While Victoria Beckham hung out with world leaders at the UN in New York, her husband David stayed at home to mind the new shop in Mayfair . The world-renowned footballer-cum-charity do-gooder swapped roles temporarily with his fashion leader wife to allow her to make her political debut on the world stage. Meanwhile he bowled up in scuffed brown shoes for the launch of the ex-Spice Girl’s swish new clothing store. Ordinarily, those who queued for a first glimpse of VB’s sales floor might have expected their heroine to oversee the opening. But even as they scrambled for a peek inside, perhaps equally excited at the prospect of meeting DB, Victoria was unavoidably elsewhere – wowing them at the UN after being made an International Goodwill Ambassador. The role gets her instant membership of a celebrity club that includes Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have all used their star status to draw attention to UN good works. In a sober suit, and with barely a hint of her trademark pout, the 40-year-old said she was ‘humbled and honoured’ to represent the UN in its Aids campaign, adding: ‘For some reason people will listen to me. This is the beginning of an incredible journey for me.’ Despite it being the opening of her store, Victoria was unavoidably elsewhere – wowing them at the UN after being made an International Goodwill Ambassador . The role gets the former Spice Girl instant membership of a celebrity club that includes Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have all used their star status to draw attention to UN good works . That journey appears to have been inspired by a trip to South Africa, where she met children stricken by Aids and spoke to afflicted mothers. The visit was part of the Born Free initiative, which tackles the issue of HIV being transmitted from mother to child. ‘I came home and I knew I had to do something,’ the mother-of-four said yesterday. ‘I think every woman has the right to health, and every woman has the right to give their children a healthy future.’ Elton, she said (that’s Sir Elton John) was a ‘dear friend’ of her and her husband, and the couple had been patrons of the piano player’s Aids Foundation for 20 years. ‘Babies should not be born with HIV and we can stop that,’ she said. ‘I’m a mother, a woman, and I want to reach out and help as many women and mothers as I can.’ Back in London, David - who was wearing scuffed brown shoes - was reaching out to help his wife’s other interests . In the unusual Dover Street store, there is no window display and the goods are arranged with the minimalist chic of an art installation . Back in London, David was reaching out to help his wife’s other interests. Her store is a bold venture into traditional retail as opposed to online shopping. Traditional, that is, until you step inside the shop. It would have been fun to see David Beckham behind a till, for example – but there aren’t any. Sales are made through iPads, doing away with anything so vulgar as a cash register. There is no window display, and the goods are arranged with the minimalist chic of an art installation (or, depending on your point of view, in a way that makes it look as if the shop has already been burgled). Victoria will be there from time to time – but she has other agendas.

And in January, an MRI scan revealed they all suffer from Chiari Malformation. The condition pushes the back of the brain into the spinal cord. If untreated, it can lead paralysis or death. Mrs Ramirez and her husband are now planning to travel from their home in Oro Valley, Arizona, to Michigan so the girls can be treated by their chosen neurosurgeon Dr Holly Glimmer. 'It's scary for them and I try to be very honest. I try to comfort them. 'I tell them Mommy is going to be there. Daddy is going to be there,' Ramirez told CBS. Miraculous: Isabel Ramirez was told she was infertile but fell pregnant with triplets without fertility treatment . Struggle: All three have been in and out of hospital since birth with various muscle and speech defects . Adorable: Mrs Ramirez said the girls are all 'fighters' and their struggles have not dampened their spirits . MRI scan: Izabelle, pictured, started repeatedly falling over so she was scanned and found to have the disorder . Doctors discovered the disorder after one of the girls, Izabelle, kept falling over and struggling to follow information. She was scanned, alongside her sisters as a precaution. The news was a devastating blow for the family as their insurance does not cover treatment for all three girls. 'I never let the girls see me cry, upset, or scared. I want them to see me strong. They're such fighters. I am so proud to be their mom,' Ramirez added. Difficulties: Isabel Ramirez hopes to get treatment for the girls in Michigan if she can afford the surgery .

"An unidentified body exhumed in Alabama is not the man accused of using a sledgehammer to kill his family in Maryland in 1976, the FBI said Wednesday. The FBI had said photos of the unidentified hitchhiker who was killed in a hit-and-run looked like William Bradford 'Brad' Bishop Jr., but using DNA, agency scientists determined it was not him, spokeswoman Amy Thoreson said in an email. Bishop was accused of killing his wife, mother and three sons in their Bethesda, Maryland, home in 1976. Authorities later found the bodies burned in North Carolina and Bishop's station wagon in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park south of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Last year, a Scottsboro, Alabama, police officer began a campaign to publicize the hit-and-run cold case, resulting in a story in the local newspaper. The FBI also renewed its investigation into the disappearance of Bishop. He was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List in April and his case was featured on the CNN program 'The Hunt with John Walsh.' Scroll down for video . The FBI exhumed the body of a John Doe buries in Scottsboro, Alabama (right) believing it could be wanted-man William Bradford Bishop (left). A DNA test revealed it was not the same man accused of killing his entire family in 1976 . Grave: Workers at the Cedar Hill Cemetery dig up the coffin of the still-unidentified white male, who was hit by a car while walking on the highway in 1981 . Scottsboro resident Jeremy Collins saw the program and noticed similarities between Bishop's picture and the hitchhiker's photo. He called police and the body was exhumed. Thoreson said she did not know if the FBI had identified the body. The John Doe was killed when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver while walking on a highway in Scottsboro, Alabama, in October 1981. The FBI added Bishop to its 10 Most Wanted list in April. Since Bishop was added to the 10 Most Wanted list, the FBI has received about 350 tips, Thoreson said. The last confirmed sighting of Bishop was at a sporting goods store in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the day after his family was killed. Two weeks later, his station wagon was found in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, just over 200 miles from Scottsboro. Given the size of the park, which encompasses more than 500,000 acres, Bishop, an avid outdoorsman, 'could have remained in the North Carolina/Alabama/Tennessee area for many years without being discovered,' FBI agent Pamela Hanson wrote in an affidavit. It is believed he was overlooked for promotion in the months leading up to the brutal killings and had been seeking treatment for depression. Wanted: This FBI poster shows the ten most wanted fugitive poster for Bishop, the diplomat suspected of killing his wife, mother and three sons in their Maryland home 1976. He has not been seen since . Evading capture: A spokesman for the FBI said Bishop was an avid outdoorsman, and could have travelled in North Carolina, Alabama or North Carolina for years without detection . Weapon: Bradford, who was said to have been overlooked for a promotion before the deaths, allegedly killed his wife and three sons with this sledgehammer .","William Bradford Bishop is suspected of killing his wife, mother and three sons in Maryland in 1976 .

"Britain awoke to a blanket of frost this morning after temperatures plummeted to almost -4C on what was one of the coldest nights of the season so far. Large swathes of the country experienced sub-zero temperatures as millions of people headed outside to enjoy Bonfire Night activities and firework displays. The coldest temperature recorded last night was -3.8C in South Newington, Oxfordshire, which was closely followed by -3.7C in Topcliffe, North Yorkshire. The mercury also dropped to -2.8C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. Red sky in the morning: The spectacular scene as the sun rises on this frost covered hill in Malmesbury, Wiltshire .

Deer stand in long frost-ridden grass at Richmond Park in west London as Britain recovers from overnight temperatures of almost -4C . Although last year’s Bonfire Night was slightly colder, at -5C, yesterday was colder than the same night in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Forecasters at the Met Office said widespread frost caused by last night’s plunging temperatures would be replaced by heavy rain across large parts of the country this afternoon. Severe weather warnings have been issued for parts of Northern Ireland, where 80mm of rain is predicted to fall within the next 24 hours, and in Scotland where localised flooding is a possibility. However, despite last night’s chilly temperatures, forecasters said the mercury would rise again this week, with temperatures returning to the November average of between 10C and 12C. Mark Wilson, meteorologist for the Met Office, said: ‘Last night was a cold night, one of the coldest nights of the season far. ‘There’s been widespread frost this morning but cloud is thickening from the west and that heralds wet and windy weather pushing through. ‘If you’re in the south east, it will stay dry until after dark but elsewhere in the country it will turn wetter throughout the course of the day. ‘Weather warnings have been issued and in eastern parts of Northern Ireland we could see as much as 80mm of rain over the next 24 hours.’ Despite the heavy rain forecast for much of the UK today, Mr Wilson said the country would experience some respite from last night’s cold weather. He said: ‘Tonight will be much, much milder than last night. The lowest temperature will be in the Scottish highlands and that will be around 4C to 5C so much milder. 'Over the coming days, temperatures are looking closer to average. Last night would have been the coldest night for the next few nights. 'By day, temperatures will be in the 10C to 12C range generally. 'The weather remains largely unsettled though. 'Tomorrow, the persistent rain will clear away, leaving a day of sunny spells and showers with strong, breezy winds. 'As we head into Saturday, unfortunately we see a pretty wet day across much of England and Wales. ‘There’s a band of rain pushing up towards the north east, affecting much of England and Wales during the day, but Scotland and Northern Ireland will see the best of the weather. ‘However, if you’re looking to get out and about this weekend, Sunday is definitely the better day. There will be one or two isolated showers but mostly sunny spells and lighter winds.’ Forecasters said it would get milder and temperatures would not plummet to below zero again this week.

A less-severe weather warning is also in place for much of Scotland today, which warns of heavy rain until 6pm on Friday. Mr Wilson added: 'The public should be prepared for the risk of localised flooding. It’s not going to widespread but there is a risk of localised flooding – especially in the eastern areas of Northern Ireland.'

The first migrating Siberian swans of this year landed in Britain this morning - heralding the belated arrival of winter. Each year around 300 Bewick swans flock to the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust reserve at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, after flying more than 2,500 miles from Arctic Russia. This year's arrival - coinciding with the first cold snap of the season - is the latest for 45 years. It traditionally marks the beginning of winter as the birds head to Britain to escape the Arctic weather which follows closely behind them. The first family of two adults and two cygnets touched down at 7.15am and the adults were identified as regulars Nurton and Nusa, who have been visiting the spot for the last five years. The first migrating Siberian swans arrved in Britain today at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust reserve in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire . Slimbridge swan expert Julia Newth said: 'This is the latest arrival date since 1969. 'It is no coincidence that their arrival has coincided with a change from the mild temperatures and south-westerly head winds that have dominated in recent weeks. 'We are excited to see that the first arrivals are a family because the swans desperately need more cygnets to bolster the dwindling population.' The Bewicks - the smallest and rarest members of the swan family - live in Siberia during the summer. In winter they migrate west - aided by chilling easterly winds - to escape winter temperatures of -25C. They normally arrive at Slimbridge in a steady stream between October and January.","Temperatures dropped to -3.8C in South Newington, Oxfordshire, and -3.7C in Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, last night .

"Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel (pictured) said sponsored posts will appear on Snapchat 'soon', but they'll only show up on the app's Stories feature . Despite not having a regular source of revenue, Snapchat was recently valued in the region of $10 billion (£6 billion). But that is about to change after co-founder Evan Spiegel revealed plans to show adverts on the app. The 24-year-old developer told Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit that sponsored posts will appear on Snapchat 'soon', but they'll only show up on the app's Stories feature. Snapchat Stories add Snaps together to create a narrative. When a user adds a Snap to a Story it lives for 24 hours before it disappears, making room for the new. Mr Spiegel said: 'People are going to see the first ads on Snapchat soon. We think they're pretty cool.' He added that the adverts will be opt-in, and users can choose to look at them, or skip. And unlike adverts on Instagram and Facebook, Snapchat's ads would not be targeted at unique users, they will just be added to a story for whoever is looking at the app, at that time. The exact date that the ads will appear was not revealed. Facebook has used targeted advertising for years, and its Instagram app began rolling out sponsored posts to the US, Canada and the UK from June. Facebook also recently released 'local awareness' ads that help local business promote themselves to users. Earlier this week, reports claimed Yahoo was reportedly preparing to invest £12 million ($20 million) in Snapchat. Despite not yet having a source of revenue, more than 100 million users use the app - which is apparently enough to convince companies to spend vast sums on the three-year old startup. Yahoo’s move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August. Facebook has used targeted advertising for years, and its Instagram app began rolling out sponsored posts (pictured left) to the US, Canada and the UK from June. Facebook also recently released 'local awareness' ads that help local business promote themselves to users (pictured right) Earlier this week, reports said California-based Yahoo (CEO Marissa Mayer shown making her keynote address in January 2014) is planning to invest £12 million ($20 million) in the three year-old tech startup. If true the investment would value the company at £6 billion ($10 billion) The move comes after a similar, albeit much larger, investment in Chinese technology firm Alibaba reaped huge dividends for Yahoo, with its $1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars. This latest move, according to the Wall Street Journal, comes as Snapchat starts to seek funding from venture-capital firms, money managers and companies. Earlier this year Instagram  launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt. The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world. Snapchat may be a key partner to Yahoo as it gets set to release Snapchat Discovery next year. This is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app, which will likely become a key source of revenue for Snapchat. Snapchat Discovery would provide a platform for Yahoo to distribute its own content. However, the £6 billion ($10 billion) valuation of a company that hasn't, yet, monetised its users, has been dubbed a risky proposition. That’s not to say it hasn’t worked before; Microsoft’s 2007 investment in Facebook valued the then three-year old company at £9.4 billion ($15 billion), and later proved hugely successful. Last year Snapchat infamously turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook - a decision that left many stunned. But the move seems to have paid off, as Snapchat’s owners Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company. If the valuation holds true, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £6 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB. Yahoo's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August this year. Pictured are owners Evan Spiegel, left, and Bobby Murphy . Snapchat lets users send photo-messages that vanish within seconds, but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services. This may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users. Although Snapchat, and other similar mobile messaging apps, don't have established business models yet, its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so. Snapchat is continuing to grow in popularity, with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day. In June, Facebook launched a similar app called Slingshot in the hope of replicating Snapchat’s success. The app lets consumers exchange photos and videos, which later disappear, without requiring Facebook accounts. But despite its rapid growth, Snapchat has had a number of obstacles to contend with. The group this year settled charges with US regulators, which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time. According to the Federal Trade Commission at the time, photos sent on Snapchat could, in fact, be saved by recipients using several methods, such as taking a screenshot.","Snapchat's Evan Spiegel said sponsored posts will appear on the app 'soon'

"Help could be at hand for aircraft passengers fed up with the sound of wailing babies, non-stop talkers or snorers. An Israeli company that specialises in noise-reduction products says it has a solution which could put an end to fellow travellers being too loud.

"The daughter of the 'Happy Face' serial killer has revealed how at the age of 15 she found a roll of duct tape in the bed of his long-distance truck's sleeper cabin - a moment which she brushed off but came back to haunt her, many times, years later. Melissa Moore, now 34, has revealed in a new essay, published this week, chilling details about her father Keith Hunter Jesperson which had always left her with a lingering unease while growing up in Washington. When she was five she watched in horror when he hung her pet kittens on a clothes line and tortured them to death, paying no heed to his young daughter's screams. Scroll down for video . Melissa Moore has revealed in a new essay, published this week, chilling details about her father Keith Hunter Jesperson (right) which always left her with deep unease growing up in Washington. She and her husband brought their children to visit him in Oregon State Prison in 2005 but have had no contact since . Keith Hunter Jesperson pictured with Melissa when she was a child. She has revealed that although her father never harmed her, she was deeply uneasy around his graphic sexual conversations and horrified when he tortured her kittens to death . Jesperson (pictured in his 1995 mugshot, left, and right, in 2009)  killed eight women during his time as a long-haul truck driver in the 1990s . Another time, he pinned down a cat and twisted the animal's head until its neck snapped, as his children looked on. Mrs Moore said she remembered the look on her father's face as 'enjoyment'. She also described how her father's desire to describe graphic sexual details, including about sex with her own mother, and lewd comments to female strangers, made her sick to her stomach. In a new essay for BBC News, Mrs Moore relived the moment that her father, a 6'6', 240lb, long-distance trucker, came close to revealing his dark secret in 1994 - that he had strangled and raped seven women, and was within days of killing again. Melissa would not see her father for long stretches following her parents' divorce in 1990. One morning that fall however he showed up and offered to take her, her sister and brother for breakfast. Her siblings couldn't make it, so she went alone with her father to a diner. As they sat in a booth, she recalled in the essay: '[my] dad said, 'Not everything is what it appears to be, Missy.' And I said, 'What do you mean Dad?' 'I watched him wrestling with something internally. Then he said: ''You know, I have something to tell you, and it's really important.'' There was a long silence before I asked him what it was. ''I can't tell you, sweetie. If I tell you, you will tell the police. I'm not what you think I am, Melissa.''' The moment caused the teenager to feel suddently violently ill and she ran to the bathroom. When she returned to the table, her father changed the subject. Mrs Moore wrote: 'But I go back to that incident so often and I think: ''If he had told me, what would have happened next? If he had told me about his seven murders - it was very soon to be eight - would I have gone to the police? Having revealed his secrets, would he have given me the chance?' Jesperson killed eight women during his years travelling America's highways and isolated truck-stops as a long-haul rig driver in the 1990s. The serial killer earned his notoriety by sending confessions describing his heinous crimes to police and journalists and signing them with a smiley face. He often targeted prostitutes and homeless women, raping them before strangling them to death with his bare hands as he had done with so many animals. Jesperson murdered his first known victim Taunja Bennett, 23, in January 1990, after meeting her at a bar near Portland, Oregon and inviting her back to a house he was renting. He beat her and strangled her to death after they had sex, then went back out to a bar to have more drinks and provide himself with an alibi. He later returned to the house, strapped her into the front seat of his car and disposed of the body before leaving town. Three months later, Jesperson met Daun Richert-Slagle, a 21-year-old mother-of-three who became the only known victim to survive an attack. Jesperson murdered his first known victim Taunja Bennett, 23, in January 1990, after meeting her at a bar near Portland, Oregon and inviting her back to a house he was renting (left). The killer was finally caught in March 1995 after strangling long-time girlfriend Julia Ann Winningham (right) The young mother had stormed out of her home in Chico, California with her infant son in her arms after having an argument with her husband on April 13, 1990. She walked to a nearby shopping center where she struck up a conversation with Jesperson, eventually getting into his car to fight off the cold. He drove her to a  lakeside where he tried to sexually assault her for three hours in front of her baby. When she fought him off, he tried to strangle her. Ms Richert-Slagle believes that she only survived because of her son and she managed to eventually to convince Jesperson to let her go. The survivor told the Oroville Mercury-Register that she had filed a police report despite Jesperson's pleas not to tell anyone. The killer was caught by police and charged. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of sexual battery and was released. He vanished. The killer lay in wait for more than two years before he struck again in 1992, raping and strangling a woman near Blythe, California. She has still not been identified but Jesperson said her name was Claudia. His killing spree then escalated - a month later, the truck driver raped and strangled a prostitute Cynthia Lyn Rose in Turlock, California. Sole survivor: Daun Richert-Slagle, a 21-year-old mother-of-three, lived after Jesperson's attempts to rape and strangle her in front of her baby son . The next month, he killed a fourth woman, also a prostitute, named Laurie Ann Pentland from Salem, Oregon. He claimed to have strangled her because she tried to double the amount of money she wanted for sex and threatened to call the police. His fifth victim, a Jane Doe living on the streets in Santa Nella, California, was discovered in July of 1993. Police initially believed that she had suffered a drug overdose. Another Jane Doe's death, attributed to Jesperson, was found in September 1994 in Crestview, Florida. Jesperson said her name was Susanne. In January 1995, Jesperson committed a brutal homicide. He picked up a 21-year-old hitchhiker, Angela Subrize, whom he offered to drive from Spokane, Washington to meet her boyfriend in Indiana. On the journey, he raped and strangled her, then strapped her body face-down to the undercarriage of his truck so her face and prints would be ground off by the road while he drove. The killer was finally caught in March 1995 after strangling long-time girlfriend Julia Ann Winningham, who he claimed did not love him but only wanted his money. She was the only victim that he could be connected to. He initially refused to talk to police and attempted suicide twice. He then turned himself in, hoping for leniency at his trial.

Don Findlay, far right, son of murder victim Julie Ann Winningham, addresses the court and Keith Jesperson, before he was sentenced to life without parole on December 19, 1995 in Vancouver, Washington . He confessed details of his murderous history while in custody, but later recanted much of it. At one point, he claimed to have had as many as 160 victims. Only eight women have been confirmed. Jesperson is currently serving three consecutive life sentences at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem. At one point during her childhood, Mrs Moore said that she remembered a story he had told her about driving past the prison. Mrs Moore has written a book about coming to terms with being the daughter of a serial killer . '''I honked my horn,"" he told me on the phone one time,' Mrs Moore said. 'He said: ''Someday I'm gonna be there. But not yet!'"" In the essay for the BBC, his daughter Melissa revealed the years of pain trying to cope with living in the shadow of her father's terrible crimes. She has written a book, Shattered Silence, about her father and her family's struggle to cope. She reaches out to family members of serial killers, who often cope silently with the trauma and stigma, of who they are related to. She said that recently, a mother of two girls whose father had killed people in Europe, had written to her as one daughter was so depressed that she had thought about committing suicide. The writer asked her network to reach out to the young girl to give her hope. Jesperson's daughter has also reached out to the family of one of her father's victims, Taunja Bennett, along with survivor Daun Richert-Slagle. Mrs Moore said that she was able to move past her horrible deeds with the support of her husband with whom she went on to have children. She even brought her family to visit her father in prison in 2005. However it was a conversation with her grandfather while writing her book that helped Mrs Moore finally  leave Jesperson in the past and be able to stop separating who he was as a father - which at times she remembered fondly - from the violent serial killer. Mrs Moore's grandfather told her that Jesperson, now 59, had once admitted to thoughts of killing his own children. She told the BBC: 'Maybe people won't understand this, but hearing that gave me freedom. It allowed me to see that in truth there had been no double life - there had only ever been one Keith Jesperson and he had been able to manipulate everyone around him and present different facades to the world.'","Melissa Moore, now 34, is the daughter of Keith Hunter Jesperson who raped and strangled eight women in the U.S. in the 1990s .

"Tensions have emerged between accused murderer Gable Tostee's new legal team and police investigators prosecuting the case, as the alleged balcony killer was remanded in custody until January 12. Lawyers for Tostee complained on Friday morning about police delays in gathering evidence, as detectives said they are still seeking overseas witnesses and evidence in the case of 26-year-old Warriena Wright, who allegedly fell to her death from Tostee's high rise Surfers Paradise apartment on August 8.

After Ms Clark sought a 14 day adjournment, and police prosecutor Sergeant Michael Campbell sought more time that that because of 'difficulties with the brief of evidence' together.

Magistrate McGee asked for further evidence in the police case against Tostee, who did not make an appearance via audio visual link from Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre, be provided by November 14. She remanded Tostee, who has been in custody since August 15, until January 12. Ms Magee also stood over four other charges the 28-year-old allegedly committed in two separate overnight drunken incidents in the months before his alleged Tinder date with Ms Wright. The court heard that the latter two offences were alleged to have occurred during a car pursuit from NSW over the Queensland border and that Tostee is due to appear in a northern NSW Court next month over related charges alleged to have been committed in that state. Ms Clark said police analysis of evidence also needed to be expedited for the resumption of Tostee's bail application, which has yet to be listed. Last month, transcripts of an alleged tape recording of Ms Wright's final hour and a half in Tostee's company were tendered to the court by the Crown during his bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court. The application, which has been adjourned to allow the accused's defence team to compile a report on Tostee's mental state and alleged autism, has yet been given a date to resume. Details of the transcript, which Tostee's new legal representatives described as 'prejudicial' and a 'threat to justice' in the murder case, included what prosecutors claimed were 'sounds consistent with the deceased being held down and her airway restricted'. It is alleged in the documents submitted by the Crown to the court that sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'. The transcript filed at the bail hearing allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall . Police opposed the bail application for Tostee, claimed he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright . It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer . Noises of an apparent struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier. Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath. The Crown brief says 'the sounds of restricted breathing continue for 78 seconds'. During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle. The Crown alleged in the brief: 'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying 'let go, let go'. The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him. 'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out 'no' repeatedly,' the Crown briefed claimed. 'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.' The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit. 'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams 'just let me go home'. '[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, 'I would but you have been a bad girl'. 'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door. The Crown brief continued: 'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.' Tostee has maintained his innocence. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Gable Tostee to remain behind bars until January 12, court hears .

"A teenager spent a week on a drip and had to have part of her ear removed after a cheap piercing became badly infected. Bianca Hart, 18, had a stud put in the top of her right ear in a quick £10 procedure before starting university, but began suffering crippling pains days later. Infection set in and despite attempts to remedy it, the student from Chelmsford, Essex, ended up having surgery after it ate into her cartilage. And doctors told her she was lucky her ear was saved at all. Bianca Hart, 18, just after she had her ear pierced, left, and right, swollen before surgeons had to operate on it . Miss Hart, who studies psychology and criminology at Nottingham Trent University, had her piercing done at the end of August at the Lady Pirates parlour in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, shortly before starting university. Within days, however, it was hurting her, so she returned to the parlour to have the original replaced with a small bar. Miss Hart said: 'I went back to the shop when it didn't settle and she said it ""needed to breathe"". 'She took it out and put a tongue bar in which was apparently the worst thing she could have done.' But that failed to solve the problem, and a fortnight later, Miss Hart was rushed to A&E for emergency surgery. She said: 'The pain was just so much, it was excruciating, and I was throwing up constantly.  The piercing was disgusting as well - it was bright purple and oozing pus.' Surgeons cut open her ear in an attempt to ease the pressure, but instead it revealed that the infection had eaten into the cartilage, and they had to cut off the top part of her ear. 'They operated and found that my cartilage had just disintegrated,' Miss Hart said.  'The surgeons had to build my ear again.' The first year student was put on an antibiotic drip for a week and then arrived for Freshers' Week with a bandage around her head. Miss Hart, who had to start university in Nottingham with a bandage around her head, will be scarred for life . She said: 'I had to turn up at university with a bandage on my head.  It was so embarrassing, especially when you're worried about making friends. 'I can't even look at my ear because it just reminds me of that horrible time I went through. The experience - which doctors said nearly resulted in Miss Hart developing septicaemia - has now put her off piercings for life. 'I would never have had this done if I had known,' she said. Miss Hart's father, Greg Hart, 50, who runs a catering business, has now called in the local authority to investigate. He said: 'The surgeon said it was the worst case they had ever seen - in the end they were lucky to save her ear. 'It will never look the same and has scarred her for life. We just don't want this to happen to everyone else.' He added: 'We got told they were changing all their procedures now, but it should never have come to this.' But the owner of the Lady Pirates parlour insisted Miss Hart caused the infection herself. Carrie Blood said they had not had one complaint in four years, and refuted claims they had inadequate health and safety procedures. Surgeons hoped cutting the ear would ease the pressure but found the infection was worse than they thought . She said: 'If the first thing she did was touch it when she left the shop then it is going to get infected. We can't control what they do when they leave here. 'When we changed the bar it wasn't infected. We told her that if it was bothering her then she should take it out but she didn't. 'Everything we do is by the book.  As far as I am concerned we have done nothing wrong.' A spokesman for Southend-on-Sea Borough Council said: 'As soon as this matter was reported to us, we began an investigation which is still ongoing. 'There are strict laws governing body piercing and we make regular checks of all establishments which offer this service.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A doctor who was running as a Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate has died in a plane crash. Dr Douglas Butzier, a 59-year-old married dad-of-two, was the pilot of a single-engine Piper PA-46 that crashed about a mile north of  Dubuque Regional Airport in Iowa around 11pm on Monday. Butzier, who had taken off from Ankeny Regional Airport around 10pm, had missed the first approach to the runway and crashed while approaching for a second time, KCRG reported. Butzier, who was the only person in the aircraft, was running for U.S. Senate against Democratic U.S. Representative Bruce Braley and Republican state Senator Joni Ernst. Loss: Dr Doug Butzier, pictured with his wife Ann, has died after crashing his single-engine plane a mile from Dubuque Regional Airport in Iowa. He was running as a Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate . On Monday night, debris from the small plane could be seen on the ground at the base of a tree near the 8700 block of Military Road. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash but a cause has not yet been determined. KCRG reported that around an inch and half of rain had fallen on the area throughout the day, but it was not yet clear if the weather played a role in the crash. Butzier, who  married wife Ann in 2010, had two sons from a previous marriage and three stepchildren. He had worked as an emergency room physician at Mercy Medical Center-Dubuque for 17 years. Scene: First responders work early on Tuesday morning at the crash scene. The cause is under investigation . Tragedy: It is not yet known if the heavy rain that fell in the area on Monday had anything to do with the crash . The Washington Post reported that Butzier was a long-shot to win against Ernst and Braley. After the news of his death, Ernst expressed her condolences on Twitter. 'Deeply saddened by tragic news of Dr. Doug Butzier,' she wrote. 'Gail&I will keep Doug’s family in our thoughts&prayers as they mourn their untimely loss.' Braley said in a statement that he was 'shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden and tragic death of Doug Butzier'. 'I have enormous respect for anyone who puts their name forward as a candidate for public office,' he wrote. 'Carolyn and I send our thoughts and prayers to Dr. Butzier’s wife and family during this difficult time.' Proud: Butzier, pictured, believed citizens should decide what was in their best interest, rather than the government. He was considered a long-shot for the seat but was well respected by his opponents . In a profile in the Des Moines Register that was published just six days ago, Butzier said he believed the government needed to be reduced in size to tackle federal debt. 'You are best at deciding what is in your best interest, not a Washington bureaucrat doing central planning,' he said. The profile explains that he had long been involved in community activities, including youth soccer and basketball, and volunteering. He also served as the medical director for the Dubuque and Asbury fire departments. 'Doug touched many lives and will be greatly missed. He was a great guy,' family spokesman and family medicine doctor Tom Schreiber told THMedia.

"A Tory MP told a one-legged man in a wheelchair begging outside Parliament to ‘get a job’. Ministerial aide Daniel Kawczynski, who is 6ft 8in, towered over the 47-year-old disabled drug addict, admonishing him for begging and  urging him to find work through a Government scheme. The MP was heard telling Mark McGuigan: ‘Get a job, find some work. Yes, I know it is hard, I have struggled too.’ Last night Mr McGuigan said the MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham made him feel small and humiliated and he wanted to ‘name and shame’ Mr Kawczynski. Mark McGuigan (right) was told to 'get a job' by Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski (left). Mr Kawczynski said he wanted to help Mr McGuigan . But the MP, a champion of welfare reform, told the Daily Mail he simply wanted to help the beggar back into  work, adding: ‘There are better and more productive ways for helping people to spend their time.’ The incident happened outside Westminster Tube station on October 7 at around 8pm and was witnessed by the Mail. After the MP walked off, a passer-by dropped some money into the man’s hat, saying: ‘Well done mate, for standing up to that t*****.’ Mr McGuigan, who lives in Bermondsey, South London, said: ‘He told me to stop begging and to get a job. He made me feel really small. He was so sanctimonious. ‘I can’t get a job. I can barely read and write. Look at me, I am missing a leg. ‘I said that to him but he just started getting more and more aggressive. It  was horrible. ‘I felt very intimidated by the way he was leaning over me saying, “Get a job, get a job”. He was towering over me.’ Mr McGuigan was begging outside Parliament. He began drinking heavily and taking drugs at the age of 17, which culminated in him losing his right leg a decade ago . The father of one, who grew up in  Peckham, South London, added: ‘I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth like most MPs. ‘My parents were alcoholics, my brothers were burglars, my sisters were on the drink at an early age. My mother had  six kids to look after, and I was the  youngest. We didn’t have a bath, we had an outside toilet.’ Mr McGuigan added: ‘I was placed into care at the age of ten but it was almost the best thing that happened to me because suddenly there was food everywhere.’ He did not receive a proper education because he was in and out of care homes and quickly found himself embroiled in a life of drugs and crime. - Mark McGuigan . He began drinking heavily and taking drugs at the age of 17, which culminated in him losing his right leg a decade ago – it had to be amputated after he contracted septicaemia from injecting heroin. Mr Kawczynski, who is officially classified as a giant, said he did ‘not recall’ using the precise words put to him, but that he did think a man asking him for money should be challenged on why he was not looking for work. He said: ‘He asked me for money so I asked him what he was doing to find a job. He said, “I can’t get a job”. ‘He had difficulties in literacy and numeracy. I told him there were Government initiatives to help him with this. I said to him, “If you let me know where you live I can help”.’ Mr Kawczynski, who has hailed the Government for bringing 123,000 more disabled people into work, said he did not approve of begging, adding: ‘The State and individuals have a responsibility to help people to try to get work.’ The MP, an aide to Welsh Secretary David Jones, boosts his £66,000 salary with consultancy work for Middle East and mining firms and can charge £3,000 for eight hours’ work for the mining  company Tigris Financial. Another firm paid for him to travel to Mauritania for a mining conference. Mr Kawczynski, who was born in Warsaw but moved to Britain with his mother as a child, charged taxpayers for all 72 first-class rail journeys between his Shropshire constituency and London since March 2011. In 2009, he was criticised for advertising for an unpaid intern. In July he announced that he was bisexual and in a relationship with a man, two years after divorcing his wife Kate.","Daniel Kawczynski told the disable man there were schemes to help him .

"Found: Elisha Duncan, a NYPD officer reported missing, was found on Friday safe in the Bronx . A New York City cop who was reported missing was found safe in the Bronx on Friday. Elisha Duncan, 46, a 14-year veteran on the force, had not been seen since Wednesday, when he was spotted at Empire Casino in Yonkers, New York, after collecting $40,000 from fellow officers for tickets for this weekend's New York Giants game against the Seattle Seahawks. It is unknown if Duncan still has that money, or if he ever purchased tickets to the game. 'We just found him, we haven’t interrogated him yet,' a police source told the Daily News. Authorities believe that Duncan, who they say is depressed, may have gone on a gambling tear with the cash. They also turned up angry voicemails and texts from fellow officers who had paid Duncan money for tickets to this Sunday's game, which is in Seattle, wanting to know what was going on. Making the story even stranger is the fact that after he left the casino on Wednesday, Duncan then went and borrowed $1,000 from his sister to pay a bill. A source says that Duncan had not touched his latest paycheck, and that his ATM card was not used on Thursday or Friday. His father told the New York Post that he believes his son went into hiding because he did not have the money to give back to the men when he failed to produce the tickets. It is these men wondering what was happening with their tickets who reported Duncan missing. Gambling: Duncan was last seen on Wednesday night at the Empire Casino in Yonkers, New York, after receiving some $40,000 from fellow officers . Game day: Duncan had taken the money promising he could get the men tickets to a football game . 'Yesterday was a deadline for him to return the money to them and he did not have it. I believe that’s what caused the problem right now,” his father, Elisha Duncan Sr., said. 'He was depressed.” He believes his son is depressed and needs help.","Elisha Duncan, a 14-year veteran of the NYPD was found Friday after having been reported missing two days earlier .
