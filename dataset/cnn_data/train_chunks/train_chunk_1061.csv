"Jailed: Keith Cavendish-Coulson leaving Chester Crown Court handcuffed to a police officer after pleading guilty to abusing dozens of young boys . A 71-year-old former French teacher who sexually abused dozens of boys at a top boarding school was today jailed for nearly seven years. Keith Cavendish-Coulson, 71, preyed on the youngsters while working at the Terra Nova School in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire in the early 1970s. The teacher, who taught in an old-fashioned academic robe and affected a fake public school accent, was caught out and sacked from his job. But he escaped justice after a cover-up led by the then headmaster. Today it emerged many of his the former teacher's victims are seeking damages for the abuse endured. As Cavendish-Coulson was jailed at Chester Crown Court, lawyers painted a picture of the private preparatory school run with a 'brutal' military-style regime and described as like something out of a Charles Dickens novel. But Cavendish-Coulson, then aged 30 to 32, would behave in a more friendly and approachable way than the other masters. After befriending his victims he would molest them in classrooms, their dormitories and his private quarters, sometimes in the presence of other children, with his activities an open secret among the boys. But despite complaints he was allowed to leave the school for 'health reasons', and took up other private teaching posts, including offering his services to Eton College, the court heard. Two separate police investigations in 1998 and 2005 stalled, the court heard. Past pupils of the £13,000-a-year Terra Nova school include Olympic sailing gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie and David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son, Brooklyn. Cavendish-Coulson yesterday admitted 42 offences of indecent assault against 24 boys aged between eight and 13, while working at the school between 1973 and 1975. He also admitted a further offence of indecent assault against another child while working as a private tutor in the mid-1980s. Jailing him, Judge Roger Dutton said: 'It is a sad reflection on the attitudes of that time that even when complaints were made by parents no proper action was taken to investigate these grave allegations. That amounted to a shameful and abject failure to deal with serious sexual abuse upon boys. 'One cannot help but conclude that the reputation of the school meant more to those in authority than the exposure of wholesale sexual abuse by a member of staff on their premises. 'It is quite obvious that the impact of the defendant’s behaviour has had a profound effect on them all.' Paedophile: Cavendish-Coulson leaving Chester Courts in custody in the prison van after sentencing . Earlier, Anne Whyte QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'It is quite clear that this defendant was a persistent and predatory paedophile.' Boys at the school were separated from their families as boarders so there was 'no escape' from their tormentor, she said. For each victim it was their first sexual experience, they found it difficult to comprehend what was happening and it left wrecked lives, leaving years of feeling guilt and worthlessness and resentment towards their parents, Miss Whyte told the court. While the psychological harm had lasted 40 years for some victims, the defendant told probation officers he was abused as a youngster himself and said of his victims, 'Why can’t they get over it?' Cavendish-Coulson’s abuse was uncovered after the father of one boy overheard his son talking about it and contacted the headmaster, Andrew Keith. But Mr Keith concluded 'nothing sinister' had occurred, until weeks later the defendant was found in a 'compromising position' while tutoring another boy privately at a nearby house. Cavendish-Coulson was allowed to resign on health grounds and the real reason covered up, though school governors and doctors were aware of the real situation but did not want to 'stir up trouble unnecessarily'. The head wrote to one parent that police involvement would do 'untold damage to the school' and the 'quicker we can forgive and forget the better'. Cover-up: Cavendish-Coulson was caught preying on youngsters at the Terra Nova School in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire in the early 1970s but escaped justice after the then headteacher hushed up the abuse . The defendant’s name was however put on 'List 99' by the Department for Education and barred from working in state schools - though not, it appears from working in private schools or as a private tutor. He faked references and worked as a private tutor in Surrey and for a number of schools until his past was found out. Jeremy Laskar QC, mitigating for the defendant, said: 'The climate during the 1970s was as far removed from the climate that exists today than can possibly be imagined. 'I do not seek to suggest that what occurred all those years ago was any less reprehensible. 'When one listens to the regime that existed in the school in the 70s it does from today’s perspective, seem rather Victorian.' Judge Dutton interrupted: 'Dickensian. Dotheboys Hall. Extra-ordinary. Cavendish-Coulson was known as just Coulson at the school and when and how he acquired his double-barrelled name is unclear. He was noted for wearing an academic gown while teaching and affecting the manners and accent of an upper-class public schoolboy, claiming to be an old Etonian. He also had a conviction for fraud after adopting the names of peers of the realm to write out cheques. In fact he was born in Stockport, the son of a post office worker, and went to a local state school. Today it emerged a number of his victims are seeking damages for the abuse endured. Charles Derham, a solicitor representing two of Cavendish-Coulson's victims each seeking £35,000 said: ‘The school allowed Cavendish-Coulson to abuse his position of trust purely for his own sexual gratification. ‘Matters are compounded by the fact the school even knew what was happening and covered up the situation to protect themselves, when really they should have been protecting the children in their care. Changes: Martin Hallam, current chairman of governors at Terra Nova School, issued a 'heartfelt' apology . ‘Financial compensation is not going to mend the harm that has been done, but any compensation awarded may mean that they can obtain the specialist professional help that they may require.’ Lawyer Hywel Thomas, of Slater & Gordon, who is also representing a number of former pupils, added: ‘For months many of Cavendish-Coulson’s victims believed that they would have to attend court and recount the abuse they had suffered. ‘It is quite possible there are other people who have been abused by Keith Cavendish-Coulson who have not yet come forward. My advice is that they should contact the police as soon as possible.’ Martin Hallam, chairman of governors at Terra Nova, apologised to the former pupils and strongly condemned Cavendish-Coulson’s actions. He said the school was a very different place today, adding: ‘These offences are abhorrent and deplorable. 'Our first thoughts are with the victims who will have lived with this dreadful experience for their entire adult lives. ‘The school would in no way condone the ‘covering up’ of any allegations or behaviour that could risk a child’s welfare. ‘Policies on safeguarding are very different these days and much more robust and effective against this type of offence.’","Keith Cavendish-Coulson abused children at Terra Nova School in Cheshire .

"Reading have appointed Steve Clarke as the club's new manager, less than 24 hours after Nigel Adkins was removed from the helm. Clarke, the former West Brom boss and assistant manager at Liverpool and Chelsea, has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Royals. Adkins had spent just 20 months in charge of the Championship outfit. The former Southampton boss was appointed in March 2013, but results have slumped amid increasingly poor performances, and Saturday's 6-1 loss against Birmingham was the last straw for the club's board. Reading chairman Sir John Madejski shakes hands with his new manager Steve Clarke on Tuesday . Clarke speaks at a press conference and photocall at the Madejski Stadium following his appointment . Clarke enjoyed success as an assistant manger at Chelsea and Liverpool, and was West Brom boss last year . Clarke, 51, is tasked with salvaging Reading's season and mounting a push for promotion to the Premier League. The Berkshire club are 16th in the Championship and 10 points off a play-off place. 'I am absolutely delighted to be joining Reading Football Club and I look forward to helping the club move in the right direction,' Clarke told the club's website. 'A big part of the work ahead is on the training ground and I look forward to meeting the players and getting onto the grass with them. There is real potential here and hopefully exciting times ahead for the supporters.' While Clarke has just one permanent managerial job on his CV, he does have an extensive background in coaching having worked as an assistant at Chelsea, West Ham and Liverpool. He was given his maiden head-coaching position at the Baggies and enjoyed success in his first season, guiding the Midlands-based club to their highest-ever Premier League finish of eighth. Reading fans have watched their team fail to improve under Adkins - the club are 16th in the Championship . Nigel Adkins has been relieved of his duties as Reading manager with immediate effect . Saturday's loss to Birmingham was Reading's seventh in their last 11 Championship matches . Demarai Gray netted a hat-trick for the Blues during their 6-1 demolition of Reading at St Andrew's . However, Clarke's men toiled at the start of the next campaign and, after winning only seven of their top-flight games in 2013, the Scot was sacked. But Reading co-chairman Sir John Madejski insists Clarke's body of work in the top flight helped him land his new role. 'He comes with a CV of the very highest order and I look forward to moving back up the table with him in charge,' Madejski added. 'It has been a difficult period for all concerned, but now we can look forwards. Nigel Adkins worked tirelessly to achieve success, sadly it did not work out for him but we wish him, his family and staff well for the future. 'Now we look forward to a new era under Steve's stewardship and I for one am excited about this new beginning.' Clarke will take charge of his first game this weekend when Reading entertain Watford. Adkins, 49, took charge at the Madejski two months after being sacked by Southampton, having led the Saints from League One to the Premier League in successive seasons, but he was unable to prevent Reading from being relegated from the top flight. They finished seventh in the Championship last season and were only denied a play-off place by Leonardo Ulloa's late winner for Brighton at Nottingham Forest. Assistant manager Andy Crosby and coach Dean Wilkins left the club along with Adkins.","Steve Clarke has been appointed as the new Reading manager .

"A fist-pumping run down the line, a win and a red card. Life is rarely dull for Neil Lennon and his start to life as a manager in England was no different. He waited six months for this chance, first eyeing a position in the Premier League and then, in time, Cardiff and Fulham. Some of his calls were ignored, a few were answered. Ultimately, no-one seemed to want a man who led Celtic to a win over Barcelona. So here is at Bolton. They were bottom of the Championship going into this one; they finished it with only their second win of the season. Bolton defender Matt Mills (centre) scored the only goal of the match heading home on 20 minutes . Mills (right) is congratulated by his team-mates for his goal which moves the Trotters off bottom spot .

Subs not used: Kenny, Mason, Hall, Clayton, Vela . Goal: Mills 20 . Booked: Mills . Referee: Mark Haywood 6 . Attendance: 15,149 . MOM: Demarai Gray . He demonstrated his energy for management with a Mourinho-style dance down the line when Matt Mills headed Bolton in front. He stayed standing in his tracksuit when the heavens opened in the second half, eyes bulging and yelling instructions. He ended in the stands after the dust settled from Bolton’s late penalty, which they missed. What drama. For Birmingham, it means they have now won only once in 11 games in all competitions. It is a run made more understandable when you consider how they defended in the first half here. Perhaps the penny did not drop when Jay Spearing, once of Liverpool, delivered a perfect corner into the box after 10 minutes and found Dorian Dervite unmarked. Dervite’s header went wide and any message about the dangers of Spearing’s deliveries, not to mention the perils of poor marking, apparently went by the wayside. Moments later, Jermaine Beckford was allowed to waste a free header in Birmingham’s area and after 20 minutes, Spearing sent over the cross that put Bolton in front. Again, the delivery was precise; again Birmingham’s defence did not serve its most basic purpose. Mills buried the header and Lennon went for a touchline jog. Lennon took charge of his first game as Bolton manager on Saturday against Birmingham . In between those efforts, Birmingham did come close. Indeed, creating chances wasn’t their problem. In Demarai Gray and Koby Arthur, they had two attacking players who offered something to get excited about; in David Cotterill they have a player who can hit a fine free-kick, as he did in the 17th minute when he clipped the bar. Gray’s chance a moment later was arguably better. Clayton Donaldson had dug out a cross from the right-hand byline and Gray timed his run perfectly. Unfortunately for him, his half volley was drilled into the ground and bounced over. After Mill’s opener, there were further chances for Birmingham; further misses for Lee Clark to regret. Birmingham's Koby Arthur (left) and Bolton's Rob Hall battle for the ball during their clash on Saturday . Arthur ended a delightful run by shooting into the side-netting and Gray went on an exciting surge, holding off Neil Danns as he went. His curling shot from the edge of the area was well saved by Andrew Lonergan. It was encouraging, but tangible rewards are what the crowd want and the club need. Birmingham were loudly booed off at half time. Danns scuffed wide for Bolton early in the second half and Gray came close to levelling 20 minutes from time, cutting in from the left and drawing a good save from Lonergan at his near post. Arthur then wasted a better chance by launching a half volley over the bar from eight yards. Dean Moxey (right) tries to dispossess Birmingham's Arthur (left) at St Andrews . Lennon swapped his gilet for a tracksuit top and Bolton dug in. They still had the greater share of possession, but Birmingham were having the chances. Gray’s effort from the left, which Lonergan tipped onto the bar, underlined the point. Darren Pratley sent a weak shot wide in retaliation before substitute Craig Davies skied an 83rd-minute penalty that would have wrapped it up. Davies had won the spot kick after being brought down by Darren Randolph, who was sent off. Lee Novak took the gloves as Birmingham had used all their substitutes, but did not need them. In the confusion, Lennon was sent to the stands. A colourful start to life in English management. Craig Davies (left) won a late penalty for Bolton after being brought down by Darren Randolph .

"Since the WI launched their nude charity calendar 15 years ago, it seems every fireman, nurse and rowing club has got their wobbly bits out for Miss June or Mr December. So the pressure is on these days to make ever yearly planner bigger and better to stand out from the rest. The 'Hotties' - a group of soldiers WAGS who consider themselves veterans of the naked charity calendar - have gone one better this year by launching their 2015 offering in one of the country's best-known strip clubs. The Hotties are a group of soldiers WAGS, they are launching their 2015 calendar at Stringfellows this weekend. Keira Goodwin, 32, (left) an antiques dealer from the Yorkshire Dales, is Miss June, while Eneshia Prescott, 30, (right) an events stylist from Lancaster, is Miss January . They have taken over Stringfellows in London's West End tomorrow evening and instead of the usual ladies wrapped around a pole, the 12 women involved in the calendar will be walking their famous curves down a catwalk. Keira Goodwin, 32, is Miss June and has been in the calendar for the last three years. She believes they are a success because they represent the everywoman . Keira said: 'We're all very normal, we come in a range of sizes and all have different careers. 'In the last couple of years, we have raised more than £8,000 for Help For Heroes. 'We sell them all over, places like Gibraltar, some in Camp Bastion, some in New Zealand. Melanie Clarke (left), 32, is a lecturer from Lancaster, Emma Bond (right), 23, is a PA and also from Lancaster . 'It's amazing when people send them to us and we can see how far they have traveled around the world - people get a lot of enjoyment from it. 'What people like as well is that all of the Hotties interact with people on our social media pages, so it's not celeb-based where you aren't likely to get anything back.' All of the money from the event is going towards the Hotties' two nominated military charities - Soldiering On Awards and Mission Motorsport. Melanie Clarke, Eneshia Prescott, Emma Bond and Keira Goodwin have all modeled for the Hotties calendar for the last three years . The Soldiering On Awards recognises inspirational and outstanding achievements of members of the armed forces. Medals are given to a range of achievements, like the Against All Odds Award, the Canine Partner Award, the Courage Award and the Family Values Award. Peter Stringfellow donated the club for the evening because the Armed Forces have been a cause close to his heart after marrying his wife Bella, whose own family has been personally affected by war. He said: 'It’s admirable to see what these wives and girlfriends of our serving military men have done to help raise awareness of the charities they support. 'Hosting the 2015 calendar launch party to help bring attention to the Soldiering On Awards was the least we could do.'","The 'Hotties' consider themselves veterans of the naked calendar market .

"Manchester United can overtake Chelsea and Manchester City to win the Premier League title this season, according to former defender Phil Neville. Louis van Gaal's side have won their last six matches and currently sit in third place, eight points behind early pace-setters Chelsea. And, in contrast to his brother Gary, who wrote off United's chances last week, Phil Neville believes they have a chance.

'At the moment, they've got the momentum and you just never know.' Gary had ruled out United's chances after their match with Southampton last Monday, saying they didn't have enough quality in defence to sustain a title bid. But their 2-1 win at St Mary's and Sunday's 3-0 home win over Liverpool have maintained their good form.

"A neighbour has admitted throwing raw chicken, bananas and pickled onions on the driveway of a man dubbed the ‘mooning millionaire’ after a bitter dispute with another neighbour. Mari Hannah Swanson, 30, who lives in the wealthy suburb of Kingswood, Surrey, has been handed a restraining order banning her from contacting  Neville Williams after admitting harassing him. Mr Williams, 53, had been locked in a bitter six-year dispute with neighbour, Gerald Mead, 72, over a narrow strip of land between their properties - with both believing the land belonged to them. Scroll down for video . Feud: Neville Williams (left) was captured on camera 'mooning' at his neighbour as his gardener looked on . Mr Williams chopped down trees planted on the border by Mr Mead - and a smashed greenhouse, burnt trees and Mr Williams removing his trousers before ‘mooning’ at Mr Mead all followed. Although Mr Williams has said there has been some resolution to the border dispute, he is convinced it is the reason for Swanson’s attacks on his £950,000 two-bedroom detached house. He said: ‘We don’t know her from Adam. But we have been in a dispute with my neighbour for quite a while and he has been going round to neighbours and saying things against me. ‘It was decided he would put up a fence along the boundary by June 8 which he hasn’t. This may have been how she came round and decided to attack my property.’ Mr Williams said the chicken, bananas and onions were thrown on separate occasions, and not ‘in a lump sum’, while Swanson was hiding in Mr Mead’s bushes. Dispute: Mr Williams and neighbour Gerald Mead (pictured) both believed the land belonged to them . He said he caught her red-handed with cat food she intended to throw onto his driveway and called the police, who later arrested her. 'We don’t know her from Adam. But we have been in a dispute with my neighbour for quite a while and he has been going round to neighbours and saying things against me' Neville Williams . ‘She painted my brick wall white,’ added Mr Williams. ‘She would go round the area picking up rubbish, put it in her car and dump it onto my property.’ Mr Williams said: ‘I have been here 12 years and never had any problems. My neighbours have come to apologise about what’s been happening.’ But Mr Mead strongly denies knowing Swanson or spreading any rumours about Mr Williams. He said: ‘I had never seen her in my life and had no contact with her. I don’t have to talk to the neighbours. The neighbours see what’s happening.’ Explained: The piece of land between Mr Mead and Mr Williams's homes that they were arguing over . Mr Mead said he saw Mr Williams and Swanson interact on the night the police were called and hinted: ‘From the body language, I would say he knows her.’ 'I had never seen her in my life and had no contact with her. I don’t have to talk to the neighbours. The neighbours see what’s happening' Gerald Mead . He said he will put up the fence next month and then consider selling-up. ‘There was a lot in the papers about me saying I didn’t want it to look like Sutton. And there was him pulling his trousers down and showing his a*** to my grandchildren,’ said Mr Mead. ‘I want to move on. You live somewhere like this because you feel it’s private and you have the seclusion with all the trees. I’ve got nothing now.’ Mr Williams said he is surprised that Swanson was not ordered to pay any compensation for his brick wall, and said: ‘I just want to live a nice, quiet, peaceful life.’ Land: Mr Mead had planted trees on the narrow strip of land between their two houses as he believed it was his . Mr Williams has lived at his two-bedroom detached house since 2002, while Mr Mead has been at his five-bedroom detached house for at least 20 years. Their road's average house value is £1million. Swanson admitted harassing Mr Williams between July 7 and 16. She also pleaded guilty to damaging Mr Williams’s brick wall after painting it white. 'There was him pulling his trousers down and showing his a*** to my grandchildren' Gerald Mead . She was given a restraining order banning her from contacting her victim until next September. She received a 12-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and £85 in costs. Swanson also received a 12-month conditional discharge for the wall damage, although no compensation was ordered by the court because the amount was ‘not substantiated’. It was alleged she had thrown paper rubbish across Mr Williams’s driveway and went to his home intending to throw bags of wet cat food - but both charges relating to this were withdrawn in court.","Mari Swanson, 30, of Kingswood, Surrey, has received restraining order .

"The great and the good of the game queued up to pay glowing tributes to Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, who announced his retirement from football on Tuesday. Mesut Ozil, Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey were among the current Gunners to praise their club's hero, while Arsenal themselves also paid a fitting tribute to Henry, who is taking up a role as 'football expert and ambassador' with Sky Sports. Henry netted 228 goals in 377 games for Arsenal during two spells in north London - as well as winning the Premier League twice and lifting the FA Cup on three occasions. Thierry Henry has announced his retirement from the game and tributes have poured in for him . Henry has been confirmed as a full-time pundit for Sky Sports . Arsenal posted a 45-page gallery on their website to show tribute to their former great . Cesc Fabregas was among the footballers to pay tribute to his former team-mate on Twitter . And the club honoured the 37-year-old on Tuesday by displaying a 45-page gallery showing the many highlights of his  time at Highbury and latterly the Emirates on their website. It is entitled: 'Pictures: Thierry Henry's best moments.' During a stellar career spanning 18 years, Henry scored 360 club goals in 792 games for Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal Barcelona and New York Red Bulls. He also netted 51 times in 123 international caps for France. Chelsea midfielder and former Arsenal team-mate Cesc Fabregas was among those to show his appreciation for Henry. Henry will be remembered as one of the best strikers ever to grace the Premier League . Fabregas posted on Twitter: 'Sad to see the end to the career of one of the best players I've ever played with. A true legend @thierryhenry! ;-).' Current Gunner Walcott added: 'A true inspiration to me in my career. Thank you @Thierryhenry & good luck in your new path with @skysports.' German World Cup winner Ozil was also full of praise for Henry. He said: 'Once you enchanted all of us - now I can only say: Thanks for everything! @ThierryHenry #ArsenalLegend.' Welsh midfielder Ramsey posted: 'Congratulations on an outstanding career @ThierryHenry. Top player. Top guy. #Legend.' The French forward left New York Red Bulls at the end of the MLS season after four years there . Another Gunner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, also revealed how much of a pleasure it was to play alongside Henry. He posted: 'Was a honour to have played alongside this man! My idol and a big inspiration to my career... #KingHenry.' Having moved to north London from Juventus in 1999, the Frenchman spent eight years as a Gunner and became a legend at the club. Henry is the highest scorer in Arsenal's history with 228 goals in all competitions, 175 of those coming in the Premier League. Henry and his former Arsenal and France team-mate Robert Pires train at London Colney late last year . He helped Arsene Wenger's side win the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2002 and was also part of the invincible title-winning team of 2004. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher - who Henry will join as a Sky Sports pundit - said of the Frenchman: 'Defenders everywhere will be breathing a sigh of relief that he has hung his boots up. 'He was certainly the toughest opponent I ever faced and possibly the best player the Premier League has seen. 'I would have loved him to be on the same team as me during my playing career, I'm delighted we're finally on the same side.' Henry (second right) worked for the BBC as a pundit during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Another soon-to-be colleague of Henry's is Gary Neville, who the Frenchman faced many times for Arsenal in battles against Manchester United. Neville said: 'We were blessed in this country to see Thierry playing at his peak, potentially one of the greatest players in the world and even if you supported another team you couldn't help but enjoy watching him play. 'It's always a shame when such a career comes to an end, but it's very much Sky Sports' gain and I look forward to working with him.' Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, who played at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur while Henry was at the Gunners, said: 'I know from playing against Thierry how good a player he was and Sky Sports viewers are in for a treat. Henry celebrates after scoring at the San Siro in a 5-1 victory for Arsenal in 2003 . 'His game was built around incredible pace, power and finishing, not to mention the ability to read the game better than most. His views will be fascinating and I can't wait to work alongside him.' The forward spent three years at Barcelona after leaving Arsenal, winning two La Liga titles and the Champions League, before moving to New York Red Bulls in 2010. He returned to Arsenal for a loan spell in January 2012, scoring the winner against Leeds United in the FA Cup and Sunderland in the league. Henry was Arsenal's leading scorer with 228 goals, 175 of those in the Premier League . But Henry's four-year stay in New York has now come to an end, and he will take up a role as an analyst with Sky Sports. Elsewhere, Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge posted a message on Twitter about Henry. He said: 'Happy retirement to my hero and idol @ThierryHenry. Wish you all the best in the next chapter.' West Ham United on the other hand also sent out a good-luck message to Henry. The French striker scored the winner against Sunderland  in his final Premier League game for Arsenal . They posted: 'HENRY: West Ham United would like to wish @premierleague great @ThierryHenry all the very best in his retirement.' Finally, Stoke City striker and former Barcelona team-mate Bojan Krkic also took to Twitter. He said: 'You've been a very special person in one of the most wonderful stages of my life. An example of professional and person. A LEGEND. Thanks Titi!' Henry left Arsenal in 2007 and spent three years at Barcelona, where he won the Champions League . 1977: Born August 17 in Paris. 1990: Joins French first division side Monaco as a 13-year-old. 1994: Makes top-flight debut against Nice on August 31, aged 17. 1996: December - Signs pre-contract with Real Madrid, who approach player through agent not registered with FIFA. The world body fines both player and Spanish club and annul agreement. 1997: May - Monaco win Ligue 1 title, with Henry having scored nine goals in 36 matches.

"An Australian tourist’s candid snapshots of daily life in North Korea’s capital offer a unique look behind the veil of the secretive nation. Under the watchful eye of two native guards, businessman and former aid worker Andrew Macleod visited the East Asian country in February 2013 as part of his quest to visit every nation in the world. During his four-day excursion around snow-covered Pyongyang he photographed the city’s iconic monuments, children playing football and plenty of locals pushing, pulling and carrying loads of goods on their backs. Scroll down for video . Mausoleum: The Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il remain in state, is seen in Pyongyang, North Korea . Australian tourist Andrew Macleod visited the Socialist Revolution monument during his visit to Pyongyang in February 2013 . World traveller: The Australian businessman and former aid worker is hoping to visit every country on the planet . Construction of the Ryugyong Hotel, a 105-storey pyramid-shaped skyscraper, began in 1987 but has never been completed . Andrew's visit gave him a fascinating glimpse into a city that is no longer open to tourists for the foreseeable future now that the dictatorship has closed its borders and cancelled all tours in fear of the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. Even when its borders are open it can be difficult to enter the reclusive country with all tourists required to join pre-planned tours to approved sites, bypassing the poverty, starvation and notorious forced labour camps. Andrew, 47, travelled to the capital from Beijing and his first observations were the abundance of concrete bunkers, attractive border guards and deserted roads as only a small few own cars.

Andrew Macleod snapped this photo during his train journey from Beijing to North Korea in February 2013 . The capital's snow-covered streets were deserted during Andrew Macleod's visit as very few people own cars . Andrew Macleod said young North Koreans offered a friendly wave but older residents avoided eye contact . He said: ‘One could feel the fear people had for their government and one was amazed at the all-pervasive control the government had over every aspect of people's lives. ‘I cannot see the break in the cycle to cause the freedom for these people. I hope they get it but I don't see the roadmap.’ His own freedom was restricted as he was not allowed to speak to Pyongyang residents on the street and most North Koreans appeared too afraid to engage with visitors. He said: ‘I would love to have spoken to people on the streets however if I did I knew that both they and my guides would get in trouble for it.’ North Korea has closed its borders in fear of the spread of the Ebola virus outbreak that has killed hundreds in West Africa .

Snapshots taken by an Australian businessman and former aid worker are providing a unique look into secretive nation . Young children offered a friendly wave but older North Koreans avoided eye contact and wanted nothing to do with him, possibly because they feared getting in trouble, he said. But despite their trepidation towards Westerners, locals were friendly towards each and other and even let their children roam the empty streets unsupervised. The first stop on his tour was the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a mausoleum where the bodies of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il remain in state. Andrew Macleod encountered deserted motorways, metro stations plastered with propaganda and attractive border guards . North Korean military hats rest next to a window on a train from Pyongyang to Beijing in February 2013 . Local resident push and pull loads of goods in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, which acts as a buffer zone between North and South . During the trip Andrew Macleod was told how to take photos of monuments with only full-length photos allowed . The enormous white building, where loudspeakers blast out patriotic music over the open square, is a draw to loyal North Koreans hoping to pay their respects to the founding father. But it serves as a stark reminder of the obvious discrepancy of wealth among the population. Even so, weeping North Koreans poured into the building, many of whom were overcome with emotion at seeing the father and son lying in state. Andrew said: ‘If you only have one source of information you believe that source of information. ‘So the emotion that you see is genuine emotion. But it's emotion based on flawed information.’ All tourists required to join a pre-planned tour to approved sites, bypassing the poverty, starvation and notorious forced labour camps .

Andrew Macleod said he was not allowed to speak to North Koreans on the street during his four-day visit . Locals were friendly towards each other and they even let their children roam the empty streets unsupervised . Andrew soon discovered propaganda permeated every aspect of daily life as he visited the metro network, which features murals on the walls and orchestral music blaring from the tannoy systems. He laid a bouquet of flowers at a World War Two monument, where he paused to reflect and pointed out to one of his guides that North Korea an Australia were on the same side in the fight against the Japanese. During his trip he was even told how to take photos of the monuments. Only full-length photos of the statues were allowed.

"'Liverpool Football Club exists to win trophies' proclaimed the legendary Bill Shankly, and so far every manager at Anfield in the last 50 years has followed the mantra and collected silverware – except the unpopular Roy Hodgson. To avoid remaining a second member of the very exclusive and unwanted club, Brendan Rodgers must beat Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night, which will take his club into the semi-finals and within reaching distance of that elusive cup. For all his good work at Anfield, Rodgers has not been able to show off something tangible on a lap of honour. Even taking into account football's fickle nature, the fall in his stock has been remarkable. Brendan Rodgers (centre) takes Liverpool to Bournemouth for a Capital One Cup quarter-final on Wednesday . Steven Gerrard and his Liverpool team-mates are enduring an awful season in the Premier League . Roy Hodgson did not win a trophy in his short spell as Liverpool manager and was soon sacked . Less than eight months ago comparisons with Shankly himself were being made as Rodgers took Liverpool within touching distance of their first league title for 24 years. But since then Luis Suarez has left, Daniel Sturridge been injured, Raheem Sterling stopped scoring, Simon Mignolet made errors and Steven Gerrard slipped. To fill the gaps, Rodgers signed nine players at a cost of £117million, none of whom have been a success, particularly strikers Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert. Raheem Sterling is another player suffering this season, and the forward has not scored for 21 games . Eddie Howe's Championship-topping Bournemouth side lie in wait in the quarter-final at Goldsands Stadium . There are unresolved contract issues over Sterling, Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson and no words of encouragement for the manager from owner John W Henry just a few months after he handed the Ulsterman a new long-term contract. Rodgers knows that more than at any other club Liverpool fans judge their managers by trophies. Shankly got the ball rolling in a style that fulfilled his wish to 'make the people happy'. His successor Bob Paisley took domestic dominance into Europe and became the first manager to win the European Cup three times. Joe Fagan then won three trophies in one season – something even Shankly and Paisley hadn't managed. Bill Shankly started Liverpool's dominance of English football, and poses here with the FA Cup in 1974 . Bob Paisley continued Shankly's work, winning three European Cups - this was his first in 1977 . Joe Fagan managed to win the European Cup, League Championship and League Cup in 1984 . Kenny Dalglish won Liverpool's first league and FA Cup double as player-manger in 1986 . Bill Shankly (1959-74) League championship 1964, 1966, 1973 . FA Cup 1965, 1974 . Uefa Cup 1973 . Bob Paisley (1974-83) European Cup 1977, 1978, 1981 . League Championship 1976, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983 . League Cup 1981, 1982 1983 . Uefa Cup 1976 . Joe Fagan (1983-85) European Cup 1984 . League Championship 1984 . League Cup 1984 . Kenny Dalglish (1985-91) League Championship 1986, 1988, 1990 . FA Cup 1986, 1989 . Graeme Souness (1991-94) FA Cup 1992 . Roy Evans (1994-98) League Cup 1995 . Gerard Houllier (1998-2004) FA Cup 2001 . League Cup 2001, 2003 . UEFA Cup 2001 . Rafael Benitez (2004-10) Champions League 2005 . FA Cup 2006 . Roy Hodgson (2010-11) None . Kenny Dalglish (2011-12) League Cup 2012 . Brendan Rodgers (2012-?) None... so far . As player-manager, Kenny Dalglish then won the club's first league and FA Cup double, in 1986. In recent times Liverpool have been surpassed by Manchester United as the country's top team. But it hasn't stopped their managers from collecting silverware altogether. Graeme Souness won the FA Cup in 1992 with a young Steve McManaman to the fore; Roy Evans' side collected the 1995 League Cup; Gerard Houllier delivered a cup treble in 2001; Rafa Benitez unforgettably won the Champions League in Istanbul; and Dalglish won the League Cup at Wembley in his only full season in charge second time around. The one exception was Hodgson, sacked after six dismal months in January 2011. Rodgers is certainly regarded with far more respect than Hodgson and his achievements at the club are impressive. But it will mean little or nothing in Liverpool's illustrious history without a trophy to show for it. 'I want a trophy this year,' said Rodgers on the club's pre-season tour of America. With the Champions League gone and Premier League very, very unlikely, this is his best chance. It won't be easy of course. Bournemouth are tipped to win promotion to the top-flight this season under their bright young manager Eddie Howe and have improved rapidly since January, when Liverpool won an FA Cup fourth round tie 2-0 at Dean Court. But while Bournemouth are better than at the start of 2014, Liverpool's form suggests they are not. Their two goalscorers that day aren't available now, with Victor Moses at Stoke City and Sturridge out of action since August with a variety of muscular injuries. It is time for others to step up,  Lambert perhaps, or Sterling, who has gone 21 games without a goal for club and country. 'Liverpool are still the overwhelming favourites,' said Bournemouth skipper Tommy Elphick. Rodgers better hope they start playing like favourites. In its own way, this match is as important as the recent Basle and Manchester United games. The man who polishes cups at Anfield is beginning to feel redundant. VIDEO 'Liverpool taking all the cups seriously' - Rodgers . Graeme Souness was not able to continue Liverpool's remarkable success, but still won the FA Cup in 1992 . Roy Evans may have underachieved as Liverpool boss but he lifted the League Cup in 1995 . Gerard Houllier won a stunning cup treble in 2001, including the FA Cup at the Millennium Stadium .

"FISH AND CHIPS: A HISTORY by Panikos Panayi (Reaktion Books £18) When I started reading this, I assumed that histories of fish and chips were pretty thin on the ground and that Panikos Panayi had hit upon a comparatively unexplored corner of British cuisine. But how wrong I was. As he notes in his introduction: ‘This book follows a tradition of volumes on fish and chips.’ These include such seminal works as The Fish Frier And His Trade by one William Loftas (‘also known as“Chatchip”,’) and social historian John K Walton’s Fish And Chips And The British Working Class 1870-1940, warmly reviewed in the Fish Friers’ Review when it was published in 1992. All of which begs the question: is there really enough to say about fish and chips to fill one book, let alone a small library? The answer proves to be yes. As with the universe itself, no one quite knows where fish and chips came from. While the Portuguese are widely credited with inventing fried fish, and the Belgians with pioneering the chip, it took an unidentified genius to put the two together. Is there really enough to say about fish and chips to fill one book, let alone a small library? The answer proves to be yes . Whether they had joined forces by 1824 remains open to question, but this is believed to be the date of the first reference to an itinerant fried fish seller in the UK. It wasn’t a happy beginning. A Mrs Rebecca Mendes suffered a ‘Frightful Death By Burning’ when her frying pan caught fire and she went up with it. Charles Dickens’s 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities has a passage about ‘husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant drops of oil’. With due solemnity, we are informed that: ‘This would appear to be the first modern use of the word ‘chips’ applied to pieces of fried potato.’ But it wasn’t long before a thick pall of chip fat hung over the nation. By 1921, there were about 25,000 fish and chip shops in the UK. Anyone wondering why fish and chips was so popular with the working class needn’t do too much head-scratching. As George Orwell noted in The Road To Wigan Pier: ‘You can’t get much meat for threepence, but you can get a lot of fish and chips.’ Yet however cheap they were, fish and chips never lost the air of being a treat, this being one of those dishes that no one in their right mind would try to cook at home. By the Sixties, in a bid to retain their popularity, chippies were selling all kinds of deep-fried monstrosities — including spam fritters and, perhaps the greatest artery-clogger of all, the saveloy. Now they’ve changed again, leaving their working-class origins way behind and shooting to dizzying heights of trendiness. Near where I live in West London, there’s a gleamingly smart fish and chip shop numbering Simon Cowell among its devotees. As his name suggests, Panikos Panayi is not a dyed-in-the-wool Anglo-Saxon, but he’s been fascinated by fish and chips all his life. Professor of European History at Leicester’s De Montfort University, he is a bit too fond of words like ‘methodology’ for my liking. That aside, he’s written an affectionate, sprightly and crisply informative history of our national obsession. The classic dish is now becoming trendy with smart new shops opening and celebrities professing their love of the battered meal . But while we, the consumers, continue to wax lyrical — and nostalgic — about the joys of fish and chips, what of the friers themselves? Surely their levels of contentment must have soared with fish and chips’ changing fortunes? Well, up to a point. Again we come back to that invaluable source, Fried Fish Review, which once noted with brutal honesty: ‘A Frier’s Life is Quite a Happy One.’","Is there enough to say about fish and chips to fill a book, let alone a library?
The answer proves to be yes in this history .

"Juan Fernandez, 59, died of multiple traumatic injuries suffered in Tuesday's attack at his home in the city of Modesto . A Central California man has died after he and his 77-year-old mother were mauled by a pack of pit bulls owned by his neighbors, sheriff's officials said Wednesday. Juan Fernandez, 59, died of multiple traumatic injuries suffered in Tuesday's attack at his home in the city of Modesto, Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson said. His mother, Maria, remained hospitalized in critical condition. Investigators determined that the dogs were owned by the victims' neighbors and got into the victims' yard through a common fence, Christianson said. He did not identify the owners. They have not been arrested, though Christianson said the investigation into the attack was continuing. ""There is still a lot of work to do,"" he said. ""We have to be able to finish the investigation to determine what happened that led up to this tragedy."" To charge the dog owners criminally, Christianson said authorities would have to show they were negligent. Investigators will be looking to see whether the animals had any contact with animal control officers prior to the attack concerning bites or vicious behavior. A jury found a man guilty in August of second-degree murder after his pit bulls mauled a woman to death in the high desert town of Littlerock in Southern California. Scroll Down for Video . His mother, Maria, remained hospitalized in critical condition.atic injuries suffered in Tuesday's attack at his home in the city of Modesto . Prosecutors argued that Alex Donald Jackson, 31, was not just negligent but also knew that his animals could endanger someone's life. They presented evidence that the dogs were involved in at least seven other altercations in the 18 months before the fatal attack on 63-year-old Pamela Devitt. Also in Southern California, a pit bull mix was cut with a knife and hit with a shovel in South Los Angeles by a person most likely acting in self-defense, police said this week.

The mother was found inside the home suffering from bite wounds and told deputies she, too, had been attacked by the dogs . In Tuesday's mauling in Modesto, deputies responding to several 911 calls found Juan Fernandez being attacked by three pit bulls in the backyard of his home and a fourth pit bull circling him. Deputies shot and killed two of the dogs. The other two ran off to an adjacent yard but were later shot to death when they charged deputies trying to capture them, sheriff's officials said. The mother was found inside the home suffering from bite wounds and told deputies she, too, had been attacked by the dogs. Both victims were taken to a hospital.","Juan Fernandez, 59, died of multiple traumatic injuries suffered in Tuesday's attack at his home in the city of Modesto .

"Another victim falls for a Twitter hoax with New Zealand MP Peter Dunne unknowingly retweeting a photo of British serial killer Harold Shipman. The troll struck just 24 hours after Donald Trump was tricked into retweeting a photo of British serial killers Fred and Rose West which enraged the tycoon who retorted suggesting that he may sue over the prank. Mr Dunne replied just as disapprovingly after he had retweeted a post: 'My Dad, Hal was a huge supported buy passed away before he could vote for you. Please RT in his memory' alongside a photo of the notorious killer who murdered up to 250 people in England between the 1970s and 1990s. The hoax that fooled New Zealand MP Peter Dunne to retweet the photo of serial killer Harold Shipman . It is pointed out to Mr Dunne that the picture is in fact of a deceased notorious serial killer . The United Future political party leader expresses that he is far from impressed by the prank . Mr Dunne was led to believe that Shipman was a supporter of his who died before being able to vote for him . Once a Twitter user pointed out that Shipman had killed 200 people, Mr Dunne accidentally replied to the wrong person, instead of the prankster, calling him a 'humourless cow', Buzzfeed reported. It was then that who appeared to be the real troll stepped forward and tried to smooth over the online jape. 'You're a good man and a good sport; I've just go to keep politician's on their toes. All the best for your next term.' the cheeky culprit posted. The embarrassing gaff included pretending that Shipman was a supporter of the MP - although the man hung himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire the day before his 58th birthday in January 2004 after being jailed for life for murdering up to 250 people but was only charged for 15 of the cases. The supposed prankster tries to make light of the Twitter hoax . While Mr Trump's hoax involved pretending that the West couple deemed the American business magnate as an inspiration. The infamous pair tortured and raped numerous young women and girls and murdered at least 11 of them - including their own family members. Mr Trump deleted the post about 40 minutes later then called the troll a 'jerk' and said he would consider suing the culprit for the prank . 'I thought was being kind to somebody re their parents. I guess this teaches you to not to be nice or trusting. Sad.' he posted. Donald Trump was tricked into retweeting the married serial killing couple Fred and Rose West .

"In an assertion of same-sex marriage rights, Attorney General Eric Holder is applying a landmark Supreme Court ruling to the Justice Department, announcing Saturday that same-sex spouses cannot be compelled to testify against each other, should be eligible to file for bankruptcy jointly and are entitled to the same rights and privileges as federal prison inmates in opposite-sex marriages.The Justice Department runs a number of benefits programs, and Holder says same-sex couples will qualify for them. They include the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and benefits to surviving spouses of public safety officers who suffer catastrophic or fatal injuries in the line of duty.'In every courthouse, in every proceeding and in every place where a member of the Department of Justice stands on behalf of the United States, they will strive to ensure that same-sex marriages receive the same privileges, protections and rights as opposite-sex marriages under federal law,' Holder said in prepared remarks to the Human Rights Campaign in New York. Equal rights: Attorney General Eric Holder announced Saturday that same-sex spouses will have the same benefits as heterosexual partners under the Justice Department . The advocacy group works on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equal rights. Just as in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the stakes in the current generation over same-sex marriage rights 'could not be higher,' said Holder.'The Justice Department's role in confronting discrimination must be as aggressive today as it was in Robert Kennedy's time,' Holder said of the attorney general who played a leadership role in advancing civil rights. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said Holder's 'landmark announcement will change the lives of countless committed gay and lesbian couples for the better. While the immediate effect of these policy decisions is that all married gay couples will be treated equally under the law, the long-term effects are more profound. Today, our nation moves closer toward its ideals of equality and fairness for all.' Justice: Supporters hold a pro-gay marriage rally outside the Utah State Capitol on January 28, 2014 in Salt Lake City, Utah . Holder's speech was criticized by the conservative National Organization for Marriage. 'This is just the latest in a series of moves by the Obama administration, and in particular the Department of Justice, to undermine the authority and sovereignty of the states to make their own determinations regulating the institution of marriage,' said Brian Brown, the group's president. 'The changes being proposed here to a process as universally relevant as the criminal justice system serve as a potent reminder of why it is simply a lie to say that redefining marriage doesn't affect everyone in society.' On Monday, the Justice Department will issue a policy memo to its employees instructing them to give lawful same-sex marriages full and equal recognition, to the greatest extent possible under the law. Holder's address is the latest application of a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a provision in the Defense of Marriage Act defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The decision applies to legally married same-sex couples seeking federal benefits. Growing support: Opponents of an proposed amendment to the state's constitution to ban gay marriage rally after the House of Representatives passed the bill 5740 at the Statehouse in Indianapolis . After the Supreme Court decision last June, the Treasury Department and the IRS said that all legally married gay couples may file joint federal tax returns, even if they reside in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages. The Defense Department said it would grant military spousal benefits to same-sex couples. The Health and Human Services Department said the Defense of Marriage Act is no longer a bar to states recognizing same-sex marriages under state Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management said it is now able to extend benefits to legally married same-sex spouses of federal employees and annuitants. Equal benefits: Chris Serrano (left) and Clifton Webb kiss after being married, as people wait in line to get licenses outside of the marriage division of the Salt Lake County Clerk's Office, in Salt Lake City . Holder told his audience that the Justice Department will recognize that same-sex spouses of individuals involved in civil and criminal cases should have the same legal rights as all other married couples, including the right to decline to give testimony that might violate the marital privilege. Under this policy, even in states where same-sex marriages are not recognized, the federal government will not use state views as a basis to object to someone in a same-sex marriage from invoking this right. Holder said the U.S. Trustee Program will take the position that same-sex married couples should be eligible to file for bankruptcy jointly and that domestic support obligations should include debts such as alimony owed to a former same-sex spouse. He also said that federal prisoners in same-sex marriages will be entitled to visitation by a spouse, inmate furloughs during a crisis involving a spouse, escorted trips to attend a spouse's funeral, correspondence with a spouse and compassionate release or reduction in sentence based on an inmate's spouse being incapacitated.","Attorney General Eric Holder says gay spouses will be allowed the same rights as heterosexual couples under federal law .

"A quick-thinking man has saved the life of a baby wallaby he found on the side of the road after wrapping it up inside a washing basket. The hero passer-by, called Fraser, from Forestville, on Sydney's Northern Beaches, rode past the lifeless body of an adult female wallaby while on his regular Saturday morning ride on the 14th September. The animal had been struck dead by a motor vehicle. On his way back, Fraser found a blood soaked joey which had made its way across the road. The animal was shaking where it lay in the gutter. Scroll down for video . Fraser, a Forestville local, saved the life of a baby wallaby he found on the side of the road after wrapping it up inside a washing basket and calling for assistance . The animal was found near its mother, who had died in a road accident. He was soaked in blood, and shaking where it lay in the gutter . Quick thinking Fraser raced home, grabbed a washing basket and wrapped the joey up in a blanket, before calling Wildlife Information Rescue and Care (WIRES) for assistance. Fraser told the Daily Mail Australia: 'It was clear the animal had to be removed from the road immediately and kept warm. It had probably been injured for several hours and may not have survived much longer.' Fraser explained that his upbringing played a part in how he dealt with the situation. 'I grew up on a property in Central Victoria so we used to come across a lot of animals in need. It comes naturally to me.' When Fraser next saw the animal, he had been cleaned up and brought back to good health. As a gesture of gratitude, the Joey was named Fraser, after his rescuer. 'It brought a smile top my face when I heard he was named after me. It was wonderful to see when the little animal was cleaned up. 'An active and  beautiful marsupial. Who wouldn't want to take care of a lovely little animal like that?' Fraser explained that his upbringing played a part in how he dealt with the situation, as he grew up on a property with lots of wildlife and helping animals came naturally to him . Fraser has spent time in a humidicrib and a small backpack to simulate the mothers warm dark pouch. The animal has also been hand with a special milk formula . Robyn said the animal will stay with her for another few months until they find somewhere bigger for him, and when he is big enough he will be released into the wild . Fraser is now under the care of Robyn, a WIRES volunteer and fellow Forestville local. Robyn has volunteered for WIRES for twelve years, having cared for possums, bandicoots, gliders, wallabies. She is currently looking after another young wallaby and a flying fox. Robyn told Daily Mail that the animal was very lucky to have survived. 'When I first saw him, he was drenched with blood, one of his eyes was closed over. He was very cold and wasn't moving at all. 'I took him to Waif clinic in St Ives, and thankfully they said he hadn't sustained any injuries in the accident-it was all his mothers blood. From that point it was just a matter of warming him up with heat packs and giving him fluids to deal with the stress. 'Fraser has spent time in a humidicrib and a small backpack to simulate the mothers warm dark pouch. I also hand feed the joey with a special milk formula.' Now Fraser is eating and healthy. Robyn said he is barely recognisable from when she first saw him. 'He will stay with me for another few months until they find somewhere bigger for him. He will be at that residence for a few months and when he is big enough he will be released into the wild. WIRES relies almost entirely on donations from the general public.

"Storm chaser and photographer, Xavier Delorme, experienced a brush with death when a bolt struck the ground just 30 metres from where he was standing. Adrenaline-seeking Delorme, 31, has been following thunderstorms around France for years, trying to get as close as possible to take such incredible shots. However, it was this storm in Montpellier, during which Xavier found himself just  metres away from a huge bolt. Storm chasing photographer Xavier Delorme experienced his second brush with death in Montpellier, France . While snapping the shocking lightning storm, the photographer came just 30m away from one potentially lethal bolt . The French photographer, who travels over 20,000 km every year to captures these shots, is originally from Nimes in the South of France, and says that the shocking scenes are a great reminder of how unpredictable and fierce lightning can be. 'It was 4am and I had just experienced the most terrible hunt for storms in my life,' he explains. 'It started badly because I missed two important storms in Mende and Millau. 'I decided to head towards an enormous thunderstorm north of Montpellier. 'The conditions were horrendous in Montpellier. It was Armageddon! I barely had time to put down my equipment - an SLR and camcorder - before the light show began.' 'The conditions were horrendous in Montpellier,' he says. 'It was Armageddon!' 'I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up,' he says of the bolt's near-miss . Flashes began to erupt all over the sky - and then the big one came. 'This bolt illuminated the whole sky and struck only 30 metres away,' he says. 'I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up.' This isn't Xavier Delorme's first brush with death. In August, he faced a similarly terrifying bolt in Morbihan, France. But he isn't letting these instances keep him down. Xavier admits that while he won't stop chasing exciting storms, 30m is 'maybe the closest' he'd like to get . 'I hope to have many exciting times as I travel to find more storms, but maybe that was the closest I would like to get,' he admits. 'I was there until 3am and the rain was still falling heavily. 'It was time to pack up and leave, but it was a big hassle to get out of the pathway as everything was flooded. 'I kept calm and began to make my way back south, away from the horrific weather.'","Adrenaline junkie, Xavier Delorme, 31, experienced second brush with death .

"Researchers at a prestigious Swedish research centre have revealed a 17 year contest to slip Bob Dylan lyrics into scientific papers. Researchers at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm say the game started with a paper called 'Nitric Oxide and Inflammation: The answer is blowing in the wind'. The winner will be the researcher who quotes Bob Dylan in the most scientific articles before they retire - and will get lunch at a Swiss restaurant. The contest started 17 years ago with a paper called 'Nitric Oxide and Inflammation: The answer is blowing in the wind' The researchers in the game agree on Dylan's genius. Eddie Weitzberg thinks he merits a Nobel prize for Literature while Kenneth Chien compares him to a modern Shakespeare, though in music. But the researchers also draw parallels between Bob Dylan's music and the world of research. 'A musician who merely continues down the same highway for 30 years is not one who many want to listen to. 'Good music is innovative, like Bob Dylan's. 'And the same thing applies to good research. 'A researcher must also try to find new and different paths,' says Konstantinos Meletis. Jon Lundberg and Eddie Weitzberg, today both professors at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at KI, bean the game when they had an article published in Nature Medicine with the title: 'Nitric Oxide and Inflammation: The answer is blowing in the wind'. 'We both really like Bob Dylan so when we set about writing an article concerning the measurement of nitric oxide gas in both the respiratory tracts and the intestine, with the purpose of detecting inflammation, the title came up and it fitted there perfectly,' says Eddie Weitzberg. Some years later they saw an article written by Jonas Frisén, Professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, together with Konstantinos Meletis, Research Assistant at the Department of Neuroscience. The subject of the article was whether blood cells can change and become nerve cells. 'The title was 'Blood on the tracks: a simple twist of fate'; this is the name of the album on the one hand, and a song of Bob Dylan on the other, and the article contained additional Dylan references,' points out Eddie Weitzberg. Jon Lundberg and Eddie Weitzberg then succeeded in introducing 'The times they are a-changin' into the title in a separate article and, at the same time, sent an email to Jonas Frisén and announced the launch of an internal competition. 'The one who has written most articles with Dylan quotes, before going into retirement, wins a lunch at the Solna restaurant Jöns Jacob,' explains Jon Lundberg. The researchers have quoted lyrics from throughout Dylan's career. Jonas Frisén and a colleague responded with the article 'Eph receptors tangled up in two' in Cell Cycle the same year, 2010, the title of which is inspired by Bob Dylan's song 'Tangled up in blue'. The following year, Jon Lundberg and Eddie Weitzberg countered with 'Dietary nitrate – a slow train coming' in The Journal of Physiology. 'This article also concluded with a paraphrase of Dylan: 'We know something is happening, but we don't know what it is – Do we, Dr Jones?' where we jokingly addressed a British colleague with the same surname,' says Jon Lundberg. Moreover, Kenneth Chien, Professor of Cardiovascular Research at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and the Department of Medicine, Huddinge, has also been quoting Bob Dylan but – until very recently – was completely unaware of the articles of the others. 'Tangled up in blue: Molecular cardiology in the postmolecular era'was published in Circulation 1997; the same year that Lundberg's and Eddie Weitzberg's first article with a Dylan quote was published. 'The contest is open for everyone,' says Jon Lundberg. He goes on to explain that they usually draw attention to one another's new articles via email. The researchers also point out that it is primarily in review articles and commentaries that it is possible to use quotes since these articles are often slightly lighter in tone (less heavyweight) than others. 'But it's important that the quote is linked to the scientific content, that it reinforces the message and raises the quality of the article as such, not the reverse,' says Jonas Frisén.","Contest started with a paper called 'Nitric Oxide and Inflammation: The answer is blowing in the wind'

"Workers from existing EU countries could be banned from moving to Britain if their economy collapses under Tory plans to overhaul EU rules, it can be revealed. David Cameron has vowed to put immigration at the heart of his plans to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum. The Prime Minister has suggested migrants from poor countries joining the EU could be barred from the UK, but is being urged to go further and introduce economic tests for the current 27 member states. Scroll down for video . Net migration from EU countries has risen sharply in recent years, hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to March 2014, according to data from the Office for National Statistics . The Tories had promised to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' but the target has been smashed by a sharp rise in people arriving from other EU countries, which the UK government cannot control. Net migration from EU countries has risen sharply in recent years, hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to March 2014. Mr Cameron used his speech to the Tory conference yesterday to flesh out his ambitions for securing a better deal from the EU. He promised that ‘when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs’. The Prime Minister last year backed the idea of limiting movement by migrants from poorer countries which join the EU. He suggested ‘even saying until you reach a proper share of an average European Union GDP you can't have freedom of movement’. The Tories argue that migration between Britain and countries with similar economies like Germany or France are balanced. But there are ‘vast movements’ between poorer country and wealthier countries. Mr Cameron proposed saying: ‘Until your economy, until your wealth is similar to our wealth you can't have unrestricted movement.' David Cameron used his party conference speech in Birmingham to promise tackling freedom of movement rules would be at the heart of his bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with the EU . While the number of people leaving the UK has remained at around 80,000, the numbers arriving from the EU have risen sharply . A future Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act, David Cameron said. He vowed 'sort out' the European Court of Human Rights. The PM said the Strasbourg court's rulings had led to 'a whole lot of things that are frankly wrong'. Mr Cameron said: 'Let me put this very clearly: We do not require instruction on this from judges in Strasbourg. 'So at long last, with a Conservative Government after the next election, this country will have a new British Bill of Rights to be passed in our Parliament, rooted in our values. 'And as for Labour's Human Rights Act? We will scrap it, once and for all.' When the idea was floated last year, it was suggested that it would only apply to new countries joining the EU. But Mr Cameron is coming under Cabinet pressure to use his renegotiation to apply the same rules to existing member states. It would mean that if an EU country was hit by an economic crisis and rising unemployment, people living there would not be able to flock to Britain in search of work. A senior Conservative source said: ‘We think it can be done, not just for new countries. 'You can say this is the level your economy must be at before you can have open borders with Britain. ‘And if for example Spain or Italy’s economy collapses below that level, we should be able to say “you can’t come here”.’ One option being explored is to allow countries which use the euro to form much closer bonds, with all those EU countries with own currency to have a much looser relationship with Brussels. Mr Cameron has come under intense pressure to quell the rise of UKIP, following the defections of two Tory MPs - Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless - and a donor, Arron Banks who handed the party £1million yesterday. In his conference speech, Mr Cameron put immigration 'at the very heart' of his renegotiation strategy for Europe, which he has promised before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. He said: 'Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs. Anyone who thinks I can't or won't deliver this – judge me by my record. 'I'm the first Prime Minister to veto a Treaty the first Prime Minister to cut the European budget and yes I pulled us out of those European bail-out schemes as well. 'Around that table in Europe they know I say what I mean, and mean what I say. 'So we're going to go in as a country, get our powers back, fight for our national interest and yes – we'll put it to a referendum in or out – it will be your choice. 'And let the message go out from this hall: it is only with a Conservative Government that you will get that choice.'","Cameron promises tackling freedom of movement is key to renegotiation .

"With its chipped green paint and down-at-heel panelling, the entrance to Mambo Priestess Miriam Chamani's New Orleans temple looks nothing short of innocuous. But in  New Orleans, nothing is quite what it seems -  and Ms Chamani, 67, is certainly no ordinary pensioner. For within her simple looking temple, 200-year-old voodoo rituals are still performed, bringing devotees from all over the world to her door. Ancient traditions: Surrounded by artefacts and gifts, 67-year-old Mambo Priestess Miriam Chamani conducts a ritual in the back-room of the New Orleans Voodoo Spiritual Temple, where voodoo rites dating back to their West African origins are rigorously preserved . But, as Ms Chamani explains, voodoo isn't quite as black as it's painted and she's at pains to point out that dark rituals and animal sacrifice play no part in her repertoire. Instead, the entrance to the temple boasts a welcoming assortment of carvings, masques, beads while copies of the Bibles fill a small back room, heavy with the scent of incense and candle wax. ‘The unseen will always have a way to come to the light,’ she explains, gesturing towards her collection of curios – some of them gifts to the voodoo deities. ‘If you don’t try and bring it yourself it has a way to press towards you. A lot of things in this room are like that.’ Welcome: The temple - backdrop for many of her rituals - is filled with statues, masks and framed pictures, but there is little evidence of the clichés commonly associated with voodoo practice . 'I never question why people leave it': Dollar bills, gifts to the voodoo deities, are scattered across every surface, while others are rolled like handmade cigarettes . There’s also money – and plenty of it; crisp dollar bills layer every flat surface, while some are rolled like home-made cigarettes and pushed between the carved lips of mounted African masks. ‘I would have taken it out but it’s done so uniquely,’ she remarks with a wry smile. ‘I never question why people leave it. Chillingly, she adds: 'Death has a way to accumulate here. There’s a story for everything in this room.’ Nevertheless, easing herself into a chair, she’s keen to dispel the myths and clichés commonly associated with voodoo. ‘It’s funny that someone would walk around playing the fantasy game of voodoo practitioner, dressed like a made up mannequin,’ she says with a laugh. ‘People say “Well in Africa they wore white,” but it’s simple – in those days women didn’t have much clothing to choose from.’ To illustrate her point, she shows off a flowing gown decorated with a vibrant blue and burnt orange coral pattern, balanced with splotches of black. But while the wardrobe has clearly changed, voodoo traditions remain true to their 18th century origins. ‘They would not have said they were having a voodoo ritual,' says Ms Chamani of the early voodoo practitioners. 'Rather, they were using their early knowledge attained in Africa; their wisdom, their wits. They were using every principle and insight they had to survive. They were using the principles of knowledge they had learned over many years. ‘That knowledge lasts a long time when you are in dire conditions. You can’t scream for someone to take you to hospital because there is no hospital. The hospital is at your feet – the bush.’ Offerings: The Voodoo Spiritual Temple is a veritable treasure trove of seemingly disparate items. According to Priestess Miriam ‘The unseen will always have a way to come to the light. If you don’t try and bring it yourself it has a way to press towards you. A lot of things in this room are like that’ Born Mary Robin Adams in Bible belt Jackson, Mississippi, Ms Chamani says her first mystical experience took place at the age of 15, prompted by a fierce rainstorm that swept across her rural homestead while her mother was at church. ‘It was like something was hitting on the windows,’ she recalls. ‘I told my younger sister to form a circle with me and I cried “Oh Lord let your Angels come down!” ‘That was my first ceremony, and all of a sudden it stopped. A child’s prayer is worth all the weight of gold in Heaven. God hears a child quickly.’ Moves to New York and then Chicago would follow, where work as an operating theatre nurse was combined with a dual role as an ordained bishop at the Angel Angel All Nations Spiritual Church. Coy: Elusive about her practices, Princess Miriam says she often helps people who are  ‘ at the bottom of their own will. You give them some prayer, you give them their mojo back, you give them something they can feel' It was here, she says, that she met late husband Oswan, with whom she would move south to Louisiana in 1990, founding the Temple shortly before his death in 1995. ‘We came to New Orleans with six dollars in our pocket.’ she recalls. ‘We had the voodoo museum at  Jermaine Street and then in March ’94,  we moved to this place. 'In ’95 on March 6 he passed. We did his funeral right here in this room with his casket. When we received his death certificate, it said 8:28 in the morning was his passing and this store here is 8-28 North Rampart, and that door opened in April the next month after he passed. Death doesn’t surprise you, it rises.’ The temple has since been predominantly used for spiritual purposes but while she remains coy about the rituals conducted in her back room, she admits they are often sought by those in dire physical and emotional straits. Imposing: The carved sculpture of a West African doctor, the rim of his hat layered with dollar bills, is one of many icons on show in the Temple . ‘There are some people who are at the bottom of their own will,’ she says. ‘You give them some prayer, you give them their mojo back, you give them something they can feel. ‘Every time you are angry or depressed you put a dark cloud on your organs and they begin to deteriorate. 'When people get better acquainted with their own bodies they can have resolve with them, and make them less of a problem than they come to be. ‘Life does not promise to give you a better deal. You just keep shining on the surface because that’s what people like.’ Others come to Ms Chamani for comparatively superficial reasons. ’They can’t take failure,’ she says with a shrug. ‘They’re so enchanted. Sometimes people aren’t thinking about emotional wellbeing. They’re looking for a quick fix so they don’t have to think about very much. 'There are some people who just want you to push a button so this character they’re so fixated with will just materialise. Offerings: Piles of money layer various surfaces (L) while bottles, cups and cans of foodstuff join an array of beads, statues and assorted items on the back-room floor (R) ‘You need to have courage and insight to apply practices to yourself instead of finding things to glue onto you, because glue comes apart,' she continues. 'I like to talk like this because experiences bring you here, and if you have no experience you’re just going to believe in hearsay. I believe the divine energy brought me here.’ While many seek spiritual well-being through prayer to the voodoo deities, the room also serves as a place of celebration – and remembrance. ‘Visitors come here from all over the world and they want to come and see what they have heard,' she says. 'There are so many different ways that this room is used or presented to people. Colourful: Priestess Miriam dispelled some of the misconceptions related to her practice, amongst them the common belief that voodoo practitioners 'always wear white robes' ‘I don’t just deal with human crisis – that would be boring. I do weddings in this room, I do funerals. There’s a lot of shields on my shoulder. ‘ . For now Ms Chamani is looking ahead to 2015, when she celebrates the 33rd anniversary of her ordination as a spiritual bishop – and the US return of a certain British drama. ‘Downton Abbey! I can't wait for  January. And Foyle’s War? I love mysteries! Agatha Christie, you can always bring me some of her. My favourite is the Canterbury Tales. I love literature. ‘I like to let people know I’ve been somewhere in my head before they find me.’ Welcome: The New Orleans Voodoo Spiritual Temple is located on the city's North Rampart Street, close to the bustling French Quarter .","Miriam Chamani is co-founder of the New Orleans Voodoo Spiritual Temple .

"Singer Justin Bieber was two hours late for his debut show at the O2 after 'throwing a massive tantrum', ranting at worried staff: 'It's my gig, I will go out when I want to' - it has been claimed. According to backstage sources Justin, 19, was in a foul mood after waking up late because of a night out and the 'stroppy youngster locked himself in his dressing room to play computer games'. Despite being accused of coming onstage two hours after he was billed to, with hundreds of upset teenagers leaving before getting the chance to see their idol, Justin said he was only 40 minutes late on Monday - blaming technical difficulties and saying the gig was 'great'. Gamer: Justin Bieber was apparently two hours late to his show on Monday because he was playing video games and woke up late . One O2 worker, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'He was arguing with members of his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, ""I’m the star and I can do what I want""'. Another worker, Ellie Grace, said: 'I hope I never have to experience so many upset children and disappointed fans again.' Speaking to Heat magazine, an insider said the 19-year old refused to go onstage before showering, despite desperate pleas from his management to perform. Diva: A source close to the star told Heat magazine that the Canadian threw a tantrum before the Monday night show at the O2 . Tardy: Despite fans complaining, Bieber still maintains he was only 40 minutes late to stage . Curious: Wearing two expensive watches it's a wonder how Justin couldn't see he was late to his own concert . Another backstage source added: 'His . lateness was because he didn’t get out of bed until late and sat in his . dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked.' 'He then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first, despite already being late.' It is thought Justin arrived at the O2 arena at 3pm 'to do some meet and greets' but he . was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel. But the great audience at the O2 weren't the only ones to be disappointed.

The unhappy girl told Heat that she and her friends, waited for three hours to see Justin. However, when their idol finally arrived, they say he spent 'less than ten seconds' with him. She also claims the singer declined to give her a hug, ironically telling his fan 'I don't have time.' A source close to Justin said: 'There was no competition winner that we knew or approved of.' 'If it was a radio contest winner who got a meet and greet, they got the same amount of time as everyone else and exactly what was promised.' The rest of the accounts are 'wildly exaggerated or just untrue.' Party doesn't stop! After his show, Justin heads out for another 'good time' in London . Even an O2 staff member witnessed . Justin's alleged diva-like behaviour: . 'He was arguing with members of . his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, ""I’m the star and I can do what I want"".' Despite . a wealth of attendees confirming his two hour delay to stage, the . Canadian star still maintains he only kept his fans waiting for 40 . minutes. Still popular: Justin Bieber was presented with an official Wembley Way . Stone this week after playing the stadium last year, causing his fans to record . the loudest scream during the Capital FM Summertime Ball . 'Last night i was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 . not 830 but because of some technical issues i got on at 10:10..so...(sic)' the singer tweeted. Digital Spy also reported that the star is being asked to pay a £300,000 fine to Greenwich Council for causing the gig to run past the 11pm closing time. However, a Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said: '[We] have not taken any action against the owners of The O2 in relation to Justin Bieber’s recent performance, as no breach of our licensing conditions took place.' Poser: Justin visited Wembley Stadium on Monday to be honoured with his official Wembley Way Stone following his loudest scream recorded at a concert there last year . 'I never have any intent to upset or let anyone down. and Im not okay . with things being exaggerated. once again sorry for anyone upset.(sic)' But to ensure the backlash didn't . continue, the following night's performance saw Justin arrive on stage . two minutes early, according to his official Twitter page. However . it seems the furore hasn't dampened the Girlfriend's singer's feelings . towards the English capital, tweeting a simple message in the early . hours of Wednesday: 'Lovin London. #goodtimes'. And Bieber's popularity doesn't seem to be waning completely either. The Baby hitmaker was presented with his very own Wembley Way Stone this week ahead of his London concerts. Pants down!: Justin Bieber managed to flash his boxers while sitting in his car, giving passerby a glimpse of his bottom . Justin met up with The FA team and headed to Wembley on Monday, where he was inducted into the Wembley Way walk of fame after his performance at last summer’s Capital FM Summertime Ball. Bieber will now be immortalised with a Wembley Way Stone having rocked the stadium last year causing his fans to raise the roof at the national stadium with the loudest scream recorded at the venue. Justin said: 'Thank you to Wembley Stadium for presenting me with my official Wembley Way Stone!  Such an honour to be part of Wembley history, and thank you to my amazing UK Beliebers for helping me put on an incredible show last year!' The pop sensation becomes the second Capital FM Summertime Ball act to be honoured on Wembley Way; he follows Coldplay who were also given a Wembley Stone having been voted as Wembley Stadiums Greatest Moment of the Year for 2012.","Told staff and family: 'It's my gig, I will go out when I want to'

"One man has died and another is in a critical condition after a high-speed boat crash during a memorial Bridge to Bridge time-trials. It is the second fatality in two years for the prestigious race. 44-year-old experienced observer Ian Baker, nicknamed Bakes, from Victoria, died when he was thrown from his boat on the Hawkesbury River, north of Sydney. Police were called to the crash scene following reports a boat had flipped over during time trials for Sunday's race, throwing its occupants into the water. The cause of the crash has not been confirmed, however investigations are underway. The driver, Daniel McMahon, from Perth, is in a serious condition in Westmead Hospital. The high-speed race trials were being held in remembrance of 20-year-old champion water-skier Sarah Teelow, who sustained serious spinal and head injuries and died in the same race, just one year ago. Scroll down for video . One man has died and another is in a critical condition after a fatal boat crash which occurred during a memorial Bridge to Bridge race on the Hawkesbury River in Ebenezer . The high-speed race trials were being held in remembrance of 20-year-old champion water-skier Sarah Teelow, who sustained serious spinal and head injuries and died in the same race, just one year ago . According to NSW Police, emergency services were called to the Hawkesbury River, near Portland Head Road, following reports a boat had crashed about 11:45am on Saturday morning. 'It is believed the boat was towing two water skiers and participating in trials for the Bridge to Bridge Race when it lost control and flipped,' police said. 'The driver and his observer were thrown into the water where they were picked up by a rescue boat and taken to shore,' Ian Baker was acting as an observer in the boat when the crash occurred . The experienced skier was thrown from his boat after it flipped during time trials . 44-year-old experienced observer Ian Baker, nicknamed Bakes, from Victoria, died after being thrown from his boat during the tragic crash on the river . Emergency services were called to the river and attempted to revive the Mr Baker, however he sadly passed away at the scene. The boat is still submerged in water at the scene of the crash. When it is retrieved it will be mechanically examined for evidence. The driver, Daniel McMahon, from Perth, is in a serious condition in Westmead hospital . Two water-skiers who were skiing off the back of the boat managed to swim to shore and were able to assist the injured men. Broken Bay Water Police and officers from the local Hawesbury command have established a crime scene which will be investigated by a forensic team. Attempts will be made by water police to revive the boat by nightfall. Both Ian and Daniel were competing in the race as part of their team, called 99 Psycho Clowns . Just last year, the maritime community was left in shock following the tragic death of champion skier Sarah Teelow. All events on the river were stopped while detectives from the Marine Area Command continued investigations into the crash. According to NSW Police, emergency services were called to the Hawkesbury River, near Portland Head Road, following reports a boat had crashed about 11:45am on Saturday morning . The boat is still submerged in water at the scene of the crash but police hope to have it retrieved by nightfall . It is unclear whether Sunday's remembrance race will go ahead. The annual Bridge to Bridge Ski Race is one of the longest running and most prestigious ski racing events in the Southern Hemisphere. It runs for 112km on the Hawkesbury River, from mouth of the River to Windsor in Western Sydney. Emergency services were called to the river and attempted to revive the Mr Baker, however he sadly passed away at the scene . Ian Baker was taking part in time trials for the Bridge to Bridge race on the Hawkesbury River when the fatal crash occurred . Broken Bay Water Police and officers from the local Hawesbury command have established a crime scene which will be investigated by a forensic team . Inspector Suzanne Rode-Sander said the boat had apparently flipped over during its designated time trial. ‘The boat has apparently flipped and ejected the driver and the observer,’ she said. ‘The skiers actually dropped their skis and were able to assist the injured people.’ Police say Mr McMahon was airlifted to Westmead Hospital in a serious but stable condition . The boat crash took place during time trials for the famous Hawkesbury River Bridge to Bridge race . She said the skiers were obviously very distressed following the incident. ‘It’s very tragic and it’s very upsetting for all concerned,’ she said. Noel Griffin from Ski Racing Australia expressed his sadness at today's tragedy in a statement. 'Police and maritime authorities have taken charge of the incident and it is not appropriate that we make further direct comment until those authorities have informed relatives and given us permission to speak,' he said. The boat will be examined by a forensic team once it has been retrieved from the river . 'The incident occurred on a broad expanse of the Hawkesbury River while the boat was towing two skiers in qualifying.' In a feature story on Ski Racing Australia's website, driver and owner of 99 Psycho Clowns Daniel McMahon said he would like to see a change to speed patterns in the sport. 20-year-old champion water-skier Sarah Teelow sustained serious spinal and head injuries during the same race last year. She died in hospital a few days later. Sarah Teelow died at the same race last year. She was travelling at over 100km per hour on her skis . 'The one thing I’d like to see is Superclass and Unlimited becoming capped for speed. It would make all boats equal, and probably more importantly, it would be safer.' he said. He also talked about the teams drive and their love for the sport. 'At first, we had some resistance within the sport – not many people had that sort of mindset, and a lot of them would tell us that’s just not the way th . The maritime community was shocked last year when 20-year-old Sarah Teelow  died following a skiing crash . Both Mr Baker and Mr McMahon were competing in the time-trials as part of their team, 99 Psycho Clowns. Mr Baker, a married father-of-four, has been involved in ski-racing for 22-years. His role in the team consisted of 'Observer, Skier, Driver (Rookie) and Accommodation Administrator.'

"A court ruling has stated that fingerprints are not protected by the Fifth Amendment, which could mean police can access devices such as iPads and iPhones more easily through their touch ID. The decision in Virginia by Judge Steven C. Fucci stated that defendants do not have to give up passcodes or pin numbers to access personal devices. However, they will be required to open fingerprint operated gadgets, according to the Virginia Pilot. The by Virginia Judge Steven C. Fucci stated that defendants do not have to give up pass-codes or pin numbers to access personal devices - but may have to give up fingerprints to operate devices such as iPhones . The Fifth Amendment states that 'no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,'. This protects memorized information like passwords and passcodes, but it does not extend to fingerprints in the eyes of the law . The ruling is believed to have stemmed from a case involving David Baust who allegedly strangled his girlfriend. Prosecutors believed Baust may have stored video of the attack on his phone, and requested that the judge force him to unlock it. If protected by a passcode, Baust will not be required to unlock his phone under the Fifth Amendment, but if protected with a fingerprint, he could potentially be forced to unlock the device. Macie Pridgen, a spokeswoman for the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office, said prosecutors still are considering whether to appeal.

"Disbarred lawyer, Ann Marie Miller, 40, will be extradited to Colorado to face charges that she swindled two elderly men out of their homes . A former lawyer who removed her fingerprints to hide her identity will be extradited to Colorado to faces charges that she swindled two elderly men out of their homes. Ann Marie Miller, 40, has been charged with 14 counts of theft, forgery, conspiracy and attempting to influence a public servant. The disbarred bankruptcy lawyer, who burned off her fingerprints with chemicals, will go on trial next month in Allen County, Ohio, on a felony tampering charge. Lynn Kimbrough, spokesman for the Denver District Attorney's Office, said prosecutors will file extradition papers to move her to Colorado after she is tried in Ohio. Miller came to the attention of police when the siblings of an elderly man who suffered from dementia tried to sell their brother's home after his death. They found he no longer owned the property, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. Prosecutors accuse Miller of filing a fraudulent claim to the house days before the man died, transferring ownership to her alleged accomplice, a paroled sex offender. Investigators were made aware of a second victim, an elderly man whose will was allegedly forged by Miller, revoking his previous will and deeding his house to her. Miller was arrested after trying to use a fake birth certificate to obtain a state identification card under the name Julia Wadsworth. While booking her in jail, authorities discovered that her fingerprints were gone. 'There was no ridge detail whatsoever. Just smooth, like a baby's butt. They're never going to come back,' said Allen County Sheriff Samuel Crish. On her computer, investigators found she had researched information on how to remove fingerprints and how to determine if someone was being investigated by a federal agency. She was identified after Sheriff Crish's office contacted police in southwest Florida, where the woman mentioned she had spent time caring for an elderly man. Miller practised law in Roanoke until her license was revoked in 2009 by the Virginia Bar, records show. The former lawyer previously faced several charges in Virginia relating to a love triangle with a male attorney and a female paralegal.","Disbarred laywer Ann Marie Miller, 40, will be extradited to Colorado .

"Crime scene investigators can tell what a criminal ate and drank before they committed a crime, thanks to pioneering fingerprint technology. The equipment can detect certain food and drink, such as garlic and coffee, as well as work out if a criminal has taken drugs. Scientists have already used the tool to determine the sex of a criminal and are now working on it being able to test for medical conditions. The Arro SupraNano powder produces similar results to technology recently developed by researchers from Sheffield. Their microscopic technology is called Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) (pictured) and it traces drugs, hair and cleaning products in fingerprints . A fingermark is made up of material from the surface of the skin and from gland secretions. Conventionally, fingermarks found at the scene of a crime are lifted, often using a powder, and are compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect. The new technology uses MALDI-MSI to produce multiple images of fingermarks that can provide extra information on a suspect. These details can be important background information in a criminal investigation, especially if the suspect's fingerprint is not on the police database and a positive ID cannot be made. They could also use it to tell the police how long a fingerprint has been at the crime scene. The microscopic technology is called Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) and it traces drugs, hair and cleaning products in fingerprints. It has been developed by researchers at Sheffield Hallam University’s Biomedical Research Centre (BMRC). The researchers are working with West Yorkshire Police, who are trialling the technology on fingerprints left at scenes of crime. Dr Simona Francese, who led the research, said: ‘MALDI enables you to detect the chemistry of the finger marks so essentially what chemicals are present on finger marks. ‘What we can do with the technology is detect multiple species in one analysis.’ Scientists have already used the tool to determine the sex of a criminal and are now working on it being able to test for medical conditions. Here, Dr Simona Francese uses mass spectrometry to analyse a fingerprint . Speaking about an example fingerprint, she explained: ‘We found the presence of cocaine in traces, we also found the presence of cocaine metabolite, that is very good because it actually tells us immediately the person who left the mark has not just touched cocaine but actually ingested it. ‘So that changes the forensic scenario very quickly. With food, I’ve tried that on my own fingerprints, . I’ve drunk a cup of coffee, then looked at my own finger marks at a certain time, after ten minutes, and could see a very clear signal for caffeine. ‘We can tell not just what you’ve touched but what’s coming out through your body and through the sweat. The technology can detect food and drink, such as garlic and coffee, from fingerprints (pictured) ‘We’ve started with looking at determining the sex of offenders through the unique chemistry of the finger marks and one of our biggest ambitions is to look at medical conditions, again from unique chemicals that are present through finger marks.’ Dr Francese explained that because meals are made up of such complex components, it might not ever be possible to say, for example, that person ate meatballs for dinner. ‘But things like garlic, which have strong chemical components, we might be able to detect. ‘It’s really interesting and who knows what we may be able to tell in the future.’ MALDI-MSI, which is a powerful technology normally used to map different molecules within tissue sections, produces multiple images of fingerprints which are made up of materials from the surface of the skin and from gland secretions. Conventionally, fingerprints found at the scene of a crime are lifted after using a powder to enhance them, and are then compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect. The research team also discovered that the cooking spice, turmeric can be used as the powder to lift finger marks within the MALDI-MSI process. Dr Francese said: ‘Our collaboration with West Yorkshire Police takes us one step closer to our aim of getting MALDI-MSI integrated into standard forensic procedures at scenes of crime up and down the country. ‘It is a valuable opportunity to be able to gather authentic evidence that demonstrates the efficiency of MALDI-MSI to be used in order to provide additional intelligence to the investigators in real casework.’ West Yorkshire Police’s Regional Head of Identification Services, Neil Denison said: ‘This research presents an exciting opportunity to enhance fingerprint capability beyond just identification. ‘We may soon be able to accurately age finger marks and by analysing the constituent parts of the finger impression, profile the habits of the offender.’","Mass spectrometer can detect food, drink and drugs in fingerprints .

"The Home Office's first Forensic Science Regulator claims that human error, partial prints and false positives mean that fingerprints evidence is not as reliable as is widely believed . Human fingerprints may not be unique, according to the Home Office's first Forensic Science Regulator. This cornerstone of criminal investigation and identification may be flawed, as Mike Silverman claims that human error, partial prints and false positives mean that fingerprints evidence is not as reliable as is widely believed. Mr Silverman, who introduced the first automated fingerprint detection system to the Metropolitan Police, said: 'No two fingerprints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same finger. 'And the fingerprint often isn't . perfect, particularly at a crime scene. It might be dirty or smudged. There are all sorts of things that reduce the accuracy. 'And not everyone's fingerprints have been recorded so it's impossible to prove that no two are the same. 'It's improbable, but so is winning the lottery, and people do that every week.' Other . factors which can reduce the 'uniqueness' of finger prints include . certain skin conditions which can make the fingertips smooth, and . elderly people's skin changing in elasticity. Families also share . extremely similar patterns. Mr . Silverman stressed that juries are should be made better informed of . these caveats, and said: 'I think it is important that juries are aware . of this. 'Too often they . see programmes like CSI and that raises their expectations. What you see . on CSI or Silent Witness simply doesn't exist. He added that the same logic could be applied to the assumption that all DNA is unique, as this claim is impossible to prove. A police officer uses a mobile finger print analyser on a suspect . Incorrect fingerprint evidence has led to several cases of innocent people being wrongly linked to criminal cases. In 2004, Brandon Mayfield, was wrongly linked to the Madrid train bombings by FBI fingerprint experts in the United States and Shirley McKie, a Scottish police officer, was wrongly accused of having been at a murder scene in 1997 after a print supposedly matching hers was found near the body.","Mike Silverman blames human error, partial prints and false positives .

"Chanel has the tweed jacket, Miu Miu the quirky phone case - but when it comes to the It Bag, Louis Vuitton rules the runway. And today's SS15 catwalk presentation on the final day of Paris Fashion Week only served to reassert the brand's bag genius. The eyes in the front row were permanently fixed on the  totes swinging jauntily down the runway. Louis Vuitton presented an array of seventies inspired bags at their SS15 catwalk . The brand has always been most famous for its luggage, with style icons such as Jackie Onassis adopting the signature monogrammed cases back in Sixties. Since then, it become the luggage of choice for everyone from Kim Kardashian to Alexa Chung, with countless airport pap shots featuring the brown and cream leather cases. For his second season at the French fashion house, designer Nicolas Ghesquière, 43, presented a collection that looked back to the Seventies. Wide-legged velvet flares were paired with patterns that echoed the interiors of that decade in bold floral prints. The bags took a step away from the traditional logo totes that the brand is famous for . Always on trend Miranda Kerr appeared at this morning's show with the latest Louis Vuitton accessory draped over one shoulder . Nicolas Ghesquiere didn't steer completely away from tradition with the LV print appearing on a select few handbags but in red and black rather than the traditional cream and brown . The theme of the time warp extended to the accessories - and of course the brand's famous arm candy. Bags took centre stage in all forms - with several even appearing as a print on the fabric of the models' skirts. Louis Vuitton took a step away from the brown leather bags and LV initials that the brand is so famous for. The bags that replaced them came in the same seventies colour palette as the collection in an array of mohogany, orange and, of course, denim. As well as smaller clutches Nicolas presented large carry-alls perfect for working girls . Most were paired with the chain strap often associated with the classic Chanel bag. Both innovative in design and practical the chain can prevent bag theft as thieves are unable to snip the strap. But Nicolas Ghesquiere didn't break completely with tradition, with the LV print appearing a select few handbags, but in red and black rather than the traditional cream and brown . Miranda Kerr was lucky enough to have already got her hands on this small box clutch . A crocodile skin effect seemed to be the pattern of choice for the brand's latest accessories . The seventies theme continued onto the bags that seemed to have taken inspiration from bold prints of that decade . This is not the first time that we have seen Nicolas Ghesquiere work his magic on the old favourite. Last season - his very first at the brand - the designer put a new spin on the traditional logo. Models took to the catwalk carrying the Petite-Malle, a rectangular shaped bag with a fold over lid top, clasps and buckles give the appearance of a traditional vanity case or treasure chest. The show always attracts plenty of celebrity fans with today's front row including Selena Gomez, Anna Wintour and Michelle Williams. Miranda Kerr proved to be the biggest fan of all. Refusing to wait until after the show to get her hands on the latest designs, the 31-year-old model was spotted wearing one of the bags seen on today's runway as she entered the show. The rest of us, however, might have to wait a little longer - and save up for a few years - before we get our hands on them...

F-15s are manoeuvrable tactical fighters, designed so one person can perform air-to-air combat. They can reach speeds up to 1,875 mph, according to the Air Force website. The website said each unit costs nearly $30million (£19million) and the Air Force has nearly 250 F-15s. The first F-15A flight - the first model - was made in July 1972. They were designed by McDonnell Douglas and first used in the Vietnam War. They are now among the most successful modern fighters. The F15-C - one of the most used in the Air Force -  is 63ft long and has a 48ft wing span. In January, four U.S. Air Force crew members based at Lakenheath died when their helicopter hit a flock of geese and crashed during a training mission. The police spokesman said: 'The plane has come down in an isolated rural area and no premises have been affected. 'A cordon has been put in place and the public are advised to avoid the area as the plane is alight and the fumes may be hazardous. 'The pilot appears to have escaped with very minor injury and has left the scene by helicopter.' Residents nearby the crash site said on Twitter that they heard the plane's engine 'cut out' before crashing to the ground. User @bigtommmm said: 'I heard a planes engine cut out over Spalding then 10 minutes later it's crashed in west one hills woah.' Adrian Done tweeted: 'working in Spalding and an army plane has just crashed in the next field' And Lucy Chesworth said: 'Literally just seen an RAF plane go down and crash and pilots parachuting out, ran to help, man that was terrifying, shaking like a leaf.' Roger Smith added: 'The plane crashed literally 100 feet from my mum's school... Right near some houses. Police say only one pilot was in it, but we saw two parashoots.'","The F-15 aircraft from RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, came down at 3.30pm .

"Air bags, mirrors and sensors can only do so much to prevent deaths as a result of a dangerous driving. Now Volvo has developed a technology that, it claims, could eliminate road fatalities in its cars by 2020. The Swedish group claims that by the end of the decade, its next-generation cars will be equipped with computers that have a 360-degree view of their surroundings. Scroll down for video . Volvo claims that in a few years, its new cars will be equipped with computers that have a 360-degree view of their surroundings. If an accident is likely, the system will allow the car to find an ‘escape route’, brake automatically or steer the car to avoid a crash. The firm aims to end driving fatalities from Volvo cars by 2020 . This required the development of a centralised Sensor Fusion framework to enable the various technologies – cameras, radar and GPS - to share information efficiently. If an accident is likely, the system will allow the car to find an ‘escape route’, brake automatically or steer the car to avoid a crash. The system looks for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles and anticipates their movements, in comparison to the car, five seconds in advance. An alert will be sent out if the driver is in danger of crashing. If the driver doesn’t respond, the car will take over. The technology was developed by Volvo’s four-year Non-Hit Car and Truck Project, which will be drawing to a close in December. The system looks for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles and anticipates their movements in comparison to the car five seconds in advance.  An alert will be sent out if the driver is in danger of crashing. If the driver doesn’t respond, the car will take over . ‘We’ve taken a significant step towards realising the vision that by 2020 no one should be killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo car,’ said Anders Almevad, project manager for the Non-Hit Car Project at Volvo Cars. ‘The technology is also imperative for the development of self-driving cars, which will be able to automatically steer and brake to avoid collision with any object in any situation. Fobo Tire uses four sensors to monitor the pressure of each tyre sending information to any Android or iOS device using Bluetooth . Tyre pressures can now be checked remotely with a simple monitor which sends alerts and updates directly to your mobile. Fobo Tire uses four sensors to monitor the pressure of each tyre, sending information to any Android or iOS device using Bluetooth 4.0. The Malaysia-based team behind Fobo Tire say drivers can fit the sensors in less than five minutes by screwing them on top of each tyre valve. This enables readings to travel via Bluetooth to both smartphones and the in-car unit. The gadget can then monitor up to 20 cars simultaneously and share readings with friends and family - a useful feature if one car has more than one driver. The entire set is also locked to a specific cloud account so any stolen pieces of equipment cannot be reused. The gadget  was put on crowdfunding website Indiegogo on September 1 but it has already surpassed it’s target of £17,500 ($28,100). One Fobo Tire set comes with four tyre sensors, one in-car unit and a free Fore tyre app to be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The kit costs £91($146) and will be ready for shipping in November. ‘Our primary objective is to focus on preventing different types of accident scenarios. But going forward, we will also continue to work on developing cars that adapt to each individual driver’s unique behaviour.’ According to Jordan Golson at Wired, the technology is similar to that used in Volvo Trucks, but this system is only used to alert the driver rather than carry out severe avoidance manoeuvres. Tesla today announced similar safety features on its new dual-motor sedan. The vehicle features a system that moves the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal. It will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly . Tesla today announced similar safety features on its new dual-motor sedan. The group's Model S steers itself back if it wanders from its lane and brakes automatically if it is about to hit something, founder Elon Musk said. These features are already offered on luxury competitors, as well as mainstream brands such as Ford, Hyundai and Toyota. But Tesla is going a step further. Its new system will move the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal. It will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly. Mr Musk added that 'auto pilot' does not mean that the car could drive itself - as he put it, a driver cannot 'safely fall asleep.' Although, he said, on private property - not public roads - a driver could summon the car remotely.

"Too soon: St Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras died Sunday in a car accident in his native Dominican Republic . Less than a year after making his Major League Baseball debut, St Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras has died in a car crash. The 22-year-old slugger's death was confirmed by his agent and newspapers in his native Dominican Republic, after he was involved in a traffic accident there on Sunday. His girlfriend, identified as 18-year-old Edilia Arvelo, was also reportedly in the 2014 Chevy Camaro when it crashed and died as well. 'He wasn't carrying documents at the time of the accident, but his body was identified by family members,' Col. Diego Pesqueira of the Metropolitan Transportation Agency said of Taveras. National police spokesman Jacobo Mateo Moquete said he was told by the mayor of Sosua that Taveras lost control of his vehicle and went off the road. It was reported that he died while driving on a stretch of road between the towns of Cabarete and Sosua. 'I simply can't believe it,' Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said in a release. 'I first met Oscar when he was 16 years old and will forever remember him as a wonderful young man who was a gifted athlete with an infectious love for life who lived every day to the fullest.' Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. said the organization was 'stunned and deeply saddened' by Taveras' death. Scroll down for video . Smashed: This photo shows Oscar Taveras' heavily damaged Chevy Camaro after the St Louis Cardinals player died in a crash with his young girlfriend in the Dominican Republic on Sunday . 'Oscar was an amazing talent with a bright future who was taken from us well before his time,' DeWitt said. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends tonight.' 'All of us throughout Major League Baseball are in mourning this evening,' baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a release. 'Oscar, a young member of the baseball family, was full of promise and at the dawn of a wonderful career in our game, evident in his game-tying home run against the Giants exactly two weeks ago.' Several of Taveras' Cardinals teammates have started mourning his loss on Twitter. 'Absolute tragedy,' teammate Matt Carpenter tweeted after hearing the news. 'My prayers go out to Oscar [Taveras'] family.' 'We mourn the passing of Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras,' the MLB also tweeted. Taveras was signed to the Cardinals as a free agent in 2008. He made his major league with the Cardinals this past season, after being ranked the third top prospect by Baseball America. The magazine also called him an 'all-star in the making'. He appeared in 80 regular season games and seven post-season games, and hit a game-tying home run in a championship game against the San Francisco Giants two weeks ago. 'Obviously, we have deep condolences to his family. We are still waiting for more details before issuing a full statement,' Cardinals GM John Mozeliak said Sunday evening.

"Imagine arriving at your own home and finding out a stranger is not only squatting there — he's claiming the place for himself. That's the nightmare that an elderly New York City woman is living, and now she is fighting to get back the house that she says an ex-con stole from her by filing a fraudulent deed and breaking in. 'It just devastates me,' Jennifer Merin told the New York Post.  'The house was maintained basically as sanctuary to my family.' Merin says that 49-year-old Darrell Beatty and his sons — Darrell Kash, 25, and DeShaun, 22 — have been living at the home in Queens since February. She says Beatty filed a bogus deed and moved into the house, which Merin wasn't renting, then changed all the locks. Heartbroken: Jennifer Merin is battling to get the Queens home back after a man claimed it with a fraudulent deed . Marin's home (center) was purchased by her immigrant grandparents in the 1930s and is where her mother was raised. The Queens residence is now occupied by Darrell Beatty, who says he bought it in 2013 . She found out that the house that her grandparents, who immigrated from the Ukraine and Russia, bought in 1931 had been lifted back in May, when the water bill for the previously-empty home skyrocketed. When Merin when to check, she found the locks had been changed and her 1992 Subaru Outback missing — along with most of her possessions. All of her family's heirlooms — vintage furniture, photos, a classic television set — were piled in the garage like trash. 'Everything from Chinese palace vases to my underwear,' she told the Post. Merin says that Beatty filed a deed transfer claiming that he bought the house in 2013 from a woman named 'Edith Moore' — who doesn't seem to exist, according to public records. 'I see them coming and going,' a neighbor said of the Beatty trio to the Post. 'I don’t think they talk to nobody in the neighborhood.' The city's Finance Department says the deed was indeed fraudulently transferred in 2013. Officials in June put Merin's name back on the document  — but now she's battling in court to have the Beatty clan. Jennifer Marin says a squatter filed a fraudulent deed and swiped her Queens home. Now she's fighting in court to get the men out of there . Family home: Jennifer Merin's grandparents bought the home back in the 1930s. Here she is pictured with her mother Eda Reiss outside the property . A judge has approved an eviction for Beatty, but the order was stayed because the squatter says he is having health problems. He claims to have rented the house from a 'Khalid Moore' for $10,000 with an option to buy. Several reporters have attempted to confront Beatty outside his home, but he always refuses to comment. He only confirms his version of the story: that the house is his.","Jennifer Merin discovered squatters had moved into her Queens home when she saw a spike in the vacant property's utility bill .

"With her big brown eyes and constant need for cuddles and kisses, Matilda makes every maternal fibre of my being swell. Every time I look at her - or even a picture of her - my heart fills with immeasurable love and the desire to hold her close, bury my face in hers, protect and cosset her - the normal, all-encompassing feelings of intense love and responsibility that a mother has towards her child. But Matilda is not my daughter. She is my four-year-old West Highland White terrier, and I freely admit that I love her as much as I love my 11-year-old son, William. In fact, on some occasions I love her more than him. And I don't feel a bit guilty about admitting that. My son spreads mess around the house. He has to be chided and reminded to do his homework and put away his clothes, or told off for answering back, while my dear, sweet-natured Matilda is always obedient, even-tempered and brimming with affection. Mother's best friend: Kelly Rose admits that her dog Matilda is often higher in her affection than her son . Everything I do for Matilda results in love and gratitude. Every plate of food is gulped down amid much tail-wagging and excitement; the mere mention of a walk produces yaps of joy and wet doggy kisses. By contrast, no matter how many meals I dream up for William, how many of his clothes I launder or how many times I take him swimming or to after-school clubs, I barely get a word of recognition or thanks. Before you pick up the phone to the NSPCC, you should know that I'm not alone in how I feel. A recent study revealed that dogs trigger the same parental instincts in adults as their children do. Dog-owning mums reacted with the same feelings of love and compassion to images of their pet as they did to those of their children. It comes as no surprise to me that in one part of the study, where the area of the brain that deals with facial recognition was analysed, the women responded more favourably to pictures of their canine companions than to pictures of their offspring. Different needs: While Matilda will always rely on Kelly Rose, William is becoming more independent . This resonates with me. For, much as I love my son - and I do, more than any words could express - I also love Matilda with the same drive and passion. And on occasions, those feelings of love for her do run deeper than those I have for William. After all, I'm on borrowed time with Matilda in a way I'm not with my son. With her, I have 12 or so years at best. I'm already a third of the way through, so I need to make her every moment as happy as possible. I want her never to feel unloved or unwanted. Obviously, I want my son to feel that way too. But as we have decades of fun and shared time left together, I feel that Matilda's needs now are more pressing. There is also the fact that she will always be a baby, while my son is growing up and away from me. A puppy brings out that same love that a parent feels for a newborn - a ferocious sense of idolatry combined with a need to protect and treasure. But with children that love evolves and becomes more organic, less obsessive. It doesn't change with a dog because they always need you in exactly the same way. Pampered pooch: Sometimes Matilda gets more attention than William . Home hierarchy: The dog believes she's second in line, then William . The enormous sense of responsibility I feel towards Matilda has not changed since the day I brought her home. I chose to take her from her mother, bring her into my home and make her dependent on me for ever. Unlike with William, I am not preparing her for a bigger journey. Her life begins and ends with me. It's up to me to make her happy. After all, isn't that what having a pet is all about? Shouldn't every responsible owner put their furry companion first? My role in loving, nurturing and caring for William is to ready him for the world, to make him a responsible adult and less reliant on me. And with each passing day, he is demonstrating that he needs me less and less. At 11 and a half, the signs of burgeoning independence are there. There is no more hand-holding when we are out, no kisses goodbye if anyone can see. The little boy who would spend hours snuggled up to me on the sofa sharing a book, or falling asleep with his head in my lap, is long gone. And as a single mother, I have to hand William over to his father every other weekend, so my relationship with him is punctuated by periods when he is away from me. Not so with Matilda, who never leaves my side or suffers from divided loyalties. She doesn't complain when I nuzzle my head on her belly, stroke her face lovingly or scoop her into my arms. Pupply love: Matilda gives affection in abundance . She doesn't disappear to school every day, or for playdates or football competitions. She is there at my side, wherever I am. She spends her days in my office under the desk and sleeps in my bed at night. If I tell her I have to pop out, she flattens her ears and puts her tail between her legs, and when I return she greets me as if I've been away for months. It is on those occasions - when her face is pressed into my neck, her nose cold and wet against my ear, her love for me palpable - that I really cannot imagine loving anyone or anything more. I guess a lot of it comes down to a human need to feel wanted and loved, and Matilda gives that in abundance. Children, as they grow older, do not give such physical shows of love to their parents. The feeling of being the most important person in the world to your child stops the moment they start school and realise that other people can fulfil their basic needs. And as they grow up, you fade fast from their thoughts. Sharing a parent: William can sometimes get jealous of his mother's constant canine companion . They want you out of the way when their friends are around. You are told not to interfere, not to nag. And that's tough for any mum to cope with - which is probably why, as the study bore out, so many women eventually replace their needy kids with needy dogs. It is probably why you used to see old ladies pushing dogs around in old prams. Unlike children, dogs never grow out of the need to be babied. More than one in three pet owners say they would cut back on their own food spending ahead of their pet's . Naturally, my son can resent the attention I pay Matilda and her attachment to me. He'll complain that Matilda's walks take priority over giving him a lift to his friend's house, or that her need to be fed outweighs his calls for a snack. He will become jealous when I tell him that, no, I can't get up to look at what he is doing on his computer because Matilda is asleep on my lap. And no, he can't move her off the chair nearest the TV, where he wants to sit. This doesn't go down well with everyone. A relative once berated me when I came home and greeted the dog with kisses and cuddles but forgot to acknowledge my son. Yet Matilda plays up to her role of mummy's girl in a way my child never has, and I just react to it. She is jealous of him too. On the rare occasions when my now quite strapping son plonks himself next to me on the sofa, Matilda is there in a flash, sitting between us, one paw placed possessively on my knee. If I am styling his hair or helping him with his tie, she presses herself against my legs, needing to be part of the goings-on. And I love it. Who doesn't get pleasure from feeling wanted and needed, and knowing you are the centre of someone's world? Being a pack animal, Matilda observes a hierarchy and, while she knows I am head of that pack, it is obvious that she regards herself as second in line, with William third. In my mind, though, and despite what anyone else might think, based on my love for her and the fulfilment of her needs over anyone else's, Matilda will always be first.","Kelly Rose adores her four-year-old West Highland White terrier, Matilda .

"Former Australia paceman Jason Gillespie has called for Ireland to be elevated to the Test cricket ranks. The 39-year-old, now head coach of Yorkshire, believes the move would both reward Ireland's performances in limited-overs internationals and provide a necessary boost to the five-day format. Gillespie told All Out Cricket: 'Let's face it, outside of Australia and England and, to a lesser extent, South Africa, people don't turn up to watch Test cricket. That's just the way it is, and it's sad. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie believes that Ireland should become a Test playing cricketing nation . Batsman Ed Joyce pictured in action for Ireland in a one-day international against Pakistan in Dublin . 'One fantastic way to give Test cricket a lift straight away would be to give Ireland full Test status. It's something that should happen sooner rather than later from the ICC. 'Imagine if Ireland were given Test status. That would be huge news in world cricket, and it would be a massively positive story for the world game. 'The ICC and all the national boards talk a lot about the importance of protecting the integrity of Test cricket. If it is that important, then we should look to improve it, and in my view including Ireland would improve it.' Ireland reached the Super Eight stage of the 2007 World Cup, beating Pakistan and Bangladesh in addition to a memorable tie with England, and also qualified for the World Twenty20 in 2009 and 2010.

"A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer who was forced to hand over his uniform after he smoked medical marijuana for PTSD while wearing it has taken his own life. Corporal Ronald Francis, a father-of-four and 21-year veteran of the force in New Brunswick, died on Monday afternoon. His cause of death has not been released. Last year, he had appeared in an interview with CBC and smoked  marijuana while wearing his red serge uniform, explaining that it helped the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his job. 'I get up in the morning, have my coffee and the marijuana. I go at lunchtime, have a marijuana joint, and then again in the evening. That would be my medical regime,' he said. Scroll down for video . Suicide: Corporal Ronald Francis, 43, took his life on Monday. He is pictured in an interview with CBC News last year, in which he smoked medical marijuana which had been prescribed for his work-related PTSD . Reliant: He smoked upto 15 joints a day - but his bosses said he could not do it while wearing his uniform . 'I'm still functional, but your nervous system is relaxed, and that makes a big difference.' In the interview, he explained that every time he saw a black mat on the ground it would trigger flashbacks of him returning after a gruesome job and wiping brains from his boots. Francis said he was first prescribed anti-depressants by doctors when he developed signs of mental stress but noted no improvement. After being prescribed the marijuana, the corporal smoked three grams - or up to 15 joints - a day. But his bosses said smoking in his uniform sent mixed messages to the public about drug use. Recreational marijuana is illegal in Canada. RCMP Deputy Commissioner Gilles Moreau said officers with a medical marijuana prescription could take their medication but he said they shouldn't use it while in uniform in public. Emotional: After sparking the public debate, the 21-year veteran of the force returned his red serge uniform . Upset: He sobbed as he was filmed handing over the uniform. He was still on leave at the time of his death . Francis was put on restricted duties while on the drug and was not allowed to carry a firearm or drive a patrol car. Francis countered that he wanted employers to better understand the importance of medical marijuana. He argued that it was a PTSD issue rather than about taking drugs. 'I'm trying to draw attention to the fact that the RCMP fails to have a program in place for proper [PTSD] screening for their members and proper information for their families,' he told the National Post at the time. 'People are dying, they're committing suicide because there's no proper backup.' Francis was eventually ordered to turn in his uniforms. He was captured sobbing on camera as he arrived to hand them over. In December 6 last year, he allegedly punched and shoved two RCMP officers who had confronted him in an effort to take him to hospital for a mental-health assessment. A few weeks later, he allegedly assaulted two other officers in Oromocto after they arrested him for breaching the terms of his probation by drinking alcohol, the National Post reported. He was later charged with assault and breaching an undertaking to not possess or consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs. He pleaded guilty to three counts before his trial was to begin and the other charges were dropped. His sentencing was scheduled for November 3. Concerns: In an interview after he was put on leave, Corporal Francis said he feared for his health . He was still on medical leave from the RCMP at the time of his death. He was 43. Chief Gabriel Atwin of Kingsclear First Nation spoke about the loss on Monday night, CBC reported. 'It's a tragic, tragic event,' he said. 'Tragic loss to our community. Ron was not only a good friend of mine, and a great community member, but also a family member of mine. It's a tragic event.' A Facebook group, Families of the RCMP for PTSD Awareness, posted a tribute to Francis. 'Our hearts go out to Ron, who struggled for so long, his family who journeyed with him, and all those who knew, worked with and loved him, all of whom are struggling to deal with the aftermath of suicide,' it read. 'Please know that we at Families of the RCMP for PTSD Awareness are devastated and we are working tirelessly to do all we can to stop these tragedies from occurring.'

Although he would not be drawn on who would feature against Alan Pardew's men other than to confirm Emmanuel Adebayor's absence, Pochettino insists any team he picks will be good enough to get the job done. When asked about being criticised for making changes he replied: 'It was a lack of respect for my players. 'I always defend my players. If we have players in the squad, it is because we believe in them. If not, why are the players in the squad? 'But always when you lose, people take something to criticise you.

When you are the coach, you have all the information and if you win, you are the best and if you don't, you are a s**t who made the wrong decision. This is true.' One player who will not be considered is Adebayor, with Pochettino insisting it is 'impossible' for the 30-year-old to play a part. The striker was granted compassionate leave last week as he flew to Ghana for 'personal reasons' and his future at White Hart Lane remains unclear. Pochettino said: 'He was back yesterday, but play tomorrow? No. 'He began training after one week yesterday so it would be impossible for him to be ready tomorrow.'","Tottenham take on Newcastle United in Capital One Cup quarter-finals .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is relaxed about Raheem Sterling's future despite reported interest from Bayern Munich. The Reds are trying to tie the 20-year-old to a new long-term contract and can ill-afford to lose their next potential world-class star following the departure of striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona in the summer. 'Hopefully it is not going to be the case. We are trying to build something here,' said Rodgers. Liverpool want to tie down England forward Raheem Sterling to a new long-term contract . 'We were on a path for a couple of years and we have had to come off that path since the summer having lost some players and have had to regroup. 'He is a real talisman for this team. He has been a great example of the progress that a lot of the players have made here. 'He has gone from a youth team player to one of the top young players in European football. 'The club, I am sure, will work very hard (on his contract) and Raheem is happy here, he loves being a Liverpool player. Sterling has been attracting interest from Bundesliga champions and Champions League favourites Bayern . 'I am sure between them and the representatives we can get a deal done which will see him go on to continue to develop what is an exciting career. 'I will never be surprised teams will be linked with Raheem as he is such a big talent at 20, a wonderful young player, but I am quite relaxed about it.' Sterling found himself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons at the weekend after missing Liverpool's best chances in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United. Rodgers insists the youngster is not being affected by the debate over his future. Sterling is thwarted at Old Trafford once again by Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea . 'I think Raheem has been brilliant, absolutely outstanding,' added Rodgers, ahead of a crucial Capital One Cup quarter-final at Championship leaders Bournemouth. 'The kid's played in a front role for me at the weekend - a role he has played before as a youngster - but I don't think it is affecting him one bit. 'OK, he maybe could have got a goal or so but he puts defenders on the back foot, he is intelligent in his game, has running ability, and is getting himself into some wonderful positions. Brendan Rodgers is coming under increasing pressure at Liverpool after a woeful start to the season . 'The kid has been a real catalyst for us in terms of our attacking threat so I don't think there is anything which has affected him. 'He leaves his representatives to work with the club to hopefully organise the deal for him and he has no real influence in that. 'All I ask him to do is concentrate on playing football and the performances will come and he has shown consistently he has been a real threat.'","Liverpool want Raheem Sterling to sign new long-term contract .

"A family of six woke up early Wednesday morning to discover their suburban Detroit home engulfed in flames after being firebombed. The attack on the house of Linda Bazzi in Dearborn Heights took place at around 12.30am and was caught on surveillance video, which captured the moment a man ran up to the residence, hurled a Molotov cocktail through the front window and fled on foot. For Bazzi, her husband and their four children, the first sign that something was amiss was that their house felt unusually warm. Scroll down for videos . Under attack: A surveillance camera outside a home in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, captured the moment a man ran up to the residence carrying a Molotov cocktail . Fire starter: The suspect hurled the firebomb through the front window of the two-story home . Inferno: The flammable liquid sparked a blaze inside the house, where a family of six slept . When Bazzi's husband left their bedroom and went downstairs to check, he discovered a raging inferno ravaging their first floor. ‘He screamed at the top of the lungs, “Get the kids! The house is on fire!""’ Bazzi told the station Click On Detroit.

"Expectant father Adam Scott shot a three-under-par round of 69 on Friday to close within two shots of the lead at the halfway stage of the Australian PGA championship. Scott, who revealed before the start of play that his wife is pregnant with their first child, followed up his opening-round 68 to head into the weekend at seven-under-par. That left the world number three alone in third place, just two strokes behind his fellow Australians Wade Ormsby and Scott Strange, who finished at nine-under.

American Boo Weekley, who led overnight after the first round was suspended because of thunderstorms, fired an even-par 72 to remain at six-under but dropped back to fourth place on a heavily congested leaderboard. Six players, including Nick Cullen, who beat Scott by a shot to win last month's Australian Masters, ended the day at five-under while a total of 44 players were under par. Conditions on day two were perfect at the Royal Pines Resort Queensland, near where Scott was raised, and the defending champion made four birdies but gave back a shot with a bogey at the par-four 13th hole. 'I really want to finish this off with a win and hang on to trophy this year and go into next year feeling a little bit chuffed with myself,' Scott told reporters. 'It was really solid golf from tee to green today, just a bit frustrated not to take advantage of a few more of the holes.' Home crowd favourite Wade Ormsby shot a second round 67 to cement his place at the top of the leaderboard . Scott Strange, pictured playing a shot on the ninth hole, shot a stunning round of 66 on day two in Australia . Ormsby and Strange had contrasting rounds. After making a bogey on his opening hole, Ormsby made an eagle at his third, the par-five 12th, then reeled off four birdies in a row from the 14th. He made another birdie on the third hole, his 12th, then made a late bogey for a round of 67. Strange produced the round of the day, a flawless six-under-par 66. He made a solid start, with two birdies on his front nine, before picking up four more on the run home, including one on his last hole to join Ormsby in the lead.

"As a passionate supporter of women's rights, British actress Thandie Newton jumped at the chance to visit Ghana to support a charity campaign - even though the trip fell just a few months after she had given birth to her son, Booker. The 41-year-old told MailOnline that her trip to the country earlier this year was 'humbling' and 'fascinating'. She said: 'I felt strongly about going as I knew so much could be achieved with a short trip. I have always worked when my babies are small. 'I carried on breastfeeding through the trip and I'm lucky I have a husband [British director Ol Parker] who is a committed new dad and my mum is up the road. I also have two little mums in the shape of my two daughters [Ripley, 14 and Nico, 10]. Scroll down for video . Right to be born healthy: Thandie Newton travelled to Ghana to see how a charity project is helping prevent the spread of HIV to a new generation . Making friends: The actress said she felt an instant kinsmanship with the people she met during her visit . The BAFTA-winning actress travelled to Ghana to see how Galaxy is making a difference to the lives of people in Africa by teaming up with the charity (Red). Five pence from every bar of (Galaxy)RED chocolate sold goes to the hospitals, maternity wards and clinics that Thandie visited, where staff are working to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to their babies. Thandie said: 'I saw first-hand how they are trying to bring an AIDS-free generation into being. I had no idea that a woman could prevent passing on the disease to her child by taking intravenous drugs during pregnancy. 'I met one woman who was late getting to the clinic so her baby was born with HIV but they are able to now give the baby drugs so there is a strong chance he can be cured.' As well as being a charity ambassador and mother-of-three, Thandie is also currently busy working on TV show Rogue, which has been a hit in the U.S. and is soon coming to the UK, plus another show West World - yet to be aired. Humbling trip: The mother-of-three said she was honoured to visit hospitals, maternity wards and clinics that are being supported by funds from Galaxy chocolate and the charity (Red) She said being a busy working mother isn't tiring - in fact, she's never felt better. 'It's a busy time but even though I have just had a baby, I feel really energised and in the prime of my life,' she said. 'I felt the same after having my first two children.' 'I think one of the reasons is because during pregnancy I have been eating healthily and living really well, not smoking or drinking or doing all the things you associate with not being good to your body.' Being a mother meant Thandie felt an instant 'kinship' with the women she met in Ghana even though their lifestyles are seemingly quite different. 'I showed them my baby pictures and I met their babies, I felt like I was with my girlfriends back home,' she said. 'I could really identify with the women I met, maybe I have a few pairs of Louboutins more but I don't know if that makes me any happier than they are.' The clinic Thandie visited, which is helping to treat pregnant women with HIV, would not have been created with the support of charities like (Red). Pleasurable donation: Simply by buying a bar of chocolate, you can help the people in Ghana who Thandie met . Busy working mother: The actress said she feels in the prime of her life at 41 . Thandie said: 'Five years ago there was no maternal clinic. It started being run out of a corridor but is not a thriving part of the maternity hospital. Women are becoming more empowered, more aware and less stigmatised. 'I left feeling excited and optimistic and honoured to have been around people who give us an example of what they can do to change the face of a disease that has been the blight on our landscape for 20 years with limited funds.' Although medical intervention is helping, it is estimated 150,000 people are infected with HIV in Ghana. Thandie said something as simple as having access to an HIV test can make a huge difference. She said: 'I saw someone having an AIDs test and it took less than ten minutes but it can change the course of someone's life. 'If they don't know they have it, they could infect other people or have a child with it so just being tested can have a fundamental effect on a community.' While recent charity campaigns have seen people chucking buckets of ice water over themselves or daring to bare their faces on social media in no make-up, the project Thandie is advocating is far more pleasurable. All you have to do is buy a Special Edition (Galaxy)RED chocolate bar and you could end up saving a life. As Thandie explains: 'Ghana is a country which has made great progress in reducing the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and, while there is still much work to be done, it shows the world the very real possibility of creating an AIDS free generation. This campaign enables people in the UK to help ""Make Lives Better"" through the simple action of buying a (Galaxy)RED bar.' (Galaxy)RED chocolate is on sale now, with 5p from each pack going to The Global Fund to help ensure that more mothers can have HIV-Free babies.

"James Davies scored a late try as Scarlets beat Ulster 22-13 at Parc y Scarlets to keep their chances alive of reaching the knockout stages of the Champions Cup. With Rhys Priestland kicking 17 points Scarlets have gone second in Pool Three with games against Toulon and Leicester remaining in January. Ulster could only manage a losing bonus point despite a Darren Cave try, two penalties from Ruan Pienaar and a conversion from Ian Humphreys. James Davies slides in for his late try which secured the win for the Scarlets on Sunday evening . Rhys Priestland kicked 17 points for the home side as they moved second in Pool Three . Scarlets were forced into a late change when Wales lock Jake Ball pulled out with a virus, with George Earle coming into the second row. For Ulster, centre Luke Marshall returned after recovering from a knee injury sustained playing for the Ulster Ravens in October. It was Scarlets who made the early inroads on the scoreboard, opening up a 6-0 lead in the opening quarter through two Priestland penalties, the first after Franco van der Merwe was penalised at a line-out and another when Ulster hands slowed ball at a ruck. Another useful attack from the home side forced Van der Merwe offside as Priestland made it three out of three. And it was 12-0 after 33 minutes as Priestland found the target again after Rory Best handled the ball at a ruck. Franco van der Merwe runs into the tackle of James Davies, Rhodri Williams and Joe Snyman . Tommy Bowe makes a break but Ulster came up just short at Parc y Scarlets to sit bottom of the pool . Priestland sent a 40-metre attempt wide and was short with another shot but an 11-3 penalty advantage at the break had already taken its toll. But it took Ulster only 90 seconds after the restart to break their duck, with Luke Marshall and Darren Cave combining effectively twice for Cave to go in under the posts and Humphreys converting. Scarlets had put themselves under pressure when Rhodri Williams’ box kick had gone straight into touch from just outside the 22. Priestland was wayward with another penalty after Ulster continued to struggle at the scrum. Ulster also had a chance to cut the deficit further but Humphreys was wide of the target with his first penalty shot on 55 minutes. But Scarlets got on the scoreboard next with a Priestland penalty which went over via the help of the right upright to take the home side into a 15-7 lead on 61 minutes. Darren Cave dives over for Ulster's only try but failed to take another golden opportunity as Ulster fell short . Rory Best (left) and Luke Marshall (right) look dejected as Ulster's qualification hopes took a dent . Referee Doyle lost his patience with the Ulster scrum and sin-binned tight-head prop Declan Fitzpatrick on 65 minutes. But despite being down to 14 men Tommy Bowe broke through the Scarlets defence before Cave could not hold on to what would have been a try-scoring pass. But Pienaar kicked two penalties, one from close to halfway, in the space of three minutes to cut the deficit to only two points. However, on 76 minutes Pienaar missed a third penalty which would have given Ulster the lead. And the contest but was put to bed two minutes from time when flanker Davies intercepted the ball from an Ulster scrum to go over under the posts. Priestland added a drop-goal conversion.","James Davies' late try secures win for Scarlets .

"You might have tried everything for dry eyes. But one Bosnian grandmother claims she has a new miracle cure: her tongue. Hava Cebic says she can cure all manner of eye problems with just one lick, sweeping away anything from a splinter of wood to the sticky sleep caused by a conjunctivitis infection. Grandmother Hava Cebic, 77, from Bosnia, says people from all over the world are flocking to her small village for her unique method to cure eye problems . Mrs Cebic, 77, has been helping her neighbours and friends with their eye problems for 40 years. But she now claims people from nearby towns and villages are flocking to her, hoping her tongue can help with their ailment. She claims a quick dab of her special saliva can cure allergies, dry eyes and conjunctivitis - and can even reduce the symptoms of more serious conditions like cataracts. Recently, a Japanese craze for eyeball licking was said to have resulted in a plague of eye chlamydia, styles and conjunctivitis. But Mrs Cebic reassures the squeamish that she always douses her tongue in alcohol before and after an eye-lick, which may prevent infection. She discovered her tongue's mysterious healing properties when she was a little girl growing up in the small village of Crnjevo in northern Bosnia. As a joke she pinned down her brother and licked his eyeball after he complained of dry eyes. He told her he'd been able to see better after that. We've all heard about people doing strange things for love, but Japanese students are taking love-induced madness to a whole new level - and putting their health at risk in the process. The latest craze sweeping through Japan is ‘oculolinctus’ – eyeball licking as an expression of affection between young lovers. However, it has led to a surge in cases of eye infections and can even cause blindness, doctors have warned. The bizarre fetish, which is also known as ‘worming’, was uncovered by the Japanese website, Naver Matome, which revealed that videos of eyeball licking have been posted on YouTube. So she turned her hand – or rather, her tongue – to more serious ailments. There are times when she is able to provide a cure, when even hospitals have failed, she said. One man had a terrible pain in his eye for which doctors said there was no cure. Mrs Cebic was able to help him with just a single lick, she claims. Her husband is now a convert, after his dutiful wife swept away his splinter – with her tongue. She told Oddity Central: 'At first my husband was very confused and didn't want me to do it.' 'But one day he got a piece of wood in his eye and after I licked it out he agreed that I had a gift, and I should help others.' She added that she has a rare 'gift' and that it is a 'miracle'. 'Now, whenever anyone has something stuck in their eye or whatever, they come to me' she said. The procedure only takes a minute or two, and she has recorded all the names of the people she has helped over the years. She never asks for a fee, but people often give her money to express their gratitude. People plagued by eye problems have come from as far as Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, Kaknja, Croatia and other cities in Bosnia. She worries that her children cannot take over her work after her death, and hopes her tongue will be cut off after she dies so that it can continue its work of healing the eyes of the sick. Mrs Cebic claims she can cure dry eyes, allergies, conjunctivitis and even help reduce the symptoms of cataracts by licking eyeballs (stock image)","Hava Cebic, 77, claims her gifted tongue can cure eye problems .

"Rio Ferdinand admits spending time on QPR's bench has been a 'comedown', but is still more than happy to be at the club. The former England captain penned a one-year deal with Rangers in the summer, reuniting with former boss Harry Redknapp after leaving Manchester United.

Rio Ferdinand has spent the majority of his time at QPR on the substitutes' bench . The 36-year-old will be hoping to worm his way back into Harry Redknapp's first team plans . But fitness and a Football Association ban for Twitter comments means he has been left out of the first-team picture and on the bench. 'No footballer worth his salt likes sitting on the bench. So I would be lying if I said I'm perfectly OK about being left out of the QPR team recently,' Ferdinand told the Sun. 'When you have enjoyed all the success of being at a club as big as Manchester United for more than a decade, there is no hiding the fact that my current circumstances are a bit of a comedown. 'But do not make the mistake of thinking I have any regrets about my move to Loftus Road - because I don't. 'I knew what I was getting myself into and knew I'd be at a club where you would mostly spend your time looking up at teams rather than down at those below you. 'And I was well aware that I probably wouldn't play every game. I'm realistic that, at the age of 36, that was never going to happen.' QPR face Everton on Monday night.

"A football-loving, 77-year-old Nebraska woman refused to let her failing health keep her from rooting for her favorite football team Saturday. Yvonne Stahmer and her 81-year-old husband Leonard have held season tickets to Nebraska Cornhuskers football games since 1962 and, having earned the name 'Grandma-Go-Big-Red,' Yvonne's team spirit hasn't wavered despite her failing health, according to LiveWellNebraska. The Stahmers have been to nearly every home game since obtaining their first season pass up until almost 10 years ago when back problems, arthritis, and Parkinson's Disease began making it difficult for Yvonne to attend, LWN reports.

Yvonne told her family that she wants to attend one more Husker home game before 'I go to my maker,' LWN reports. Her wish was granted. The Omaha Nursing and Rehabilitation Center exchanged the couple's season tickets for handicapped seating and on Saturday, Yvonne was wheeled into Memorial Stadium, wearing all red, by her husband and a nursing home aide. Just years ago, Yvonne could be seen jumping up and down, hooting and hollering, but the Parkinson's Disease has left Yvonne with little movement in her arms and none in her legs. The disease also makes it difficult for her to speak.

Though other things have changed, this hasn't. At the Nebraska-Purdue game Saturday, Yvonne asked her aide for her headphones so she could listen to the play-by-play as she had years before. LWN reports that Yvonne and Leonard sat just 30 feet from the end zone, separated from the players by only a fence. Leonard pulled a red 'Huskers' blanket snug around his wife. He held her hand and bounced it gently on his lap as the marching band began to play.","Nebraska Cornhuskers-loving Yvonne Stahmer, 77, asked her family to take her to one last home game before 'I go to my maker'

"Match of the Day pundits are being urged to be forthright in their opinions by BBC executives in a bid to combat their more controversial rivals on Sky and BT Sport. The BBC's flagship football show now faces unprecedented competition from their paid-for rivals so are looking at ways of improving their coverage. Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Rio Ferdinand have been told to let rip their true opinions, however controversial, in a bid to keep ratings. Executives at the corporation have express their concerns about the show following the departure of the outspoken Alan Hansen after 22 years on the MOTD sofa - which understandably came as a huge blow. As well as this elsewhere the successful pairing of Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville have made Sky's Monday Night Football coverage a must-watch for lovers of the beautiful game. New era: Pundits on Match Of The Day will be more opinionated this season, says a BBC executive. Pictured (left to right), presenters Danny Murphy, Robbie Savage, Alan Shearer, Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand, Phil Neville . Much-respected: Hansen was an integral part of Match of the Day before departing after 22 years . Mark Cole, head of football at the BBC, is trying to balance stirring up opinions with avoiding alienating the show's 10m viewers. He told The Independent: 'It's okay to have people throwing the remote controls at the telly. 'We want all the guys to offer opinions. But it needs to be balanced and they cannot be changing their minds next week. It has to come from the heart.' He added that the extensive use of technology used by Sky would not appeal to the BBC's core audience, who would find a 13-minute technical analysis 'too long, too intricate and too complicated'. Cole also addressed criticism about the absence of a woman in the MOTD line-up, claiming that pundits must have played the game at the highest level to get a spot on the sofa. However, presenters Jacqui Oatley and Gabby Logan will feature next season. The BBC have also signed up Phil Neville for this season's MOTD despite his much-criticised performance in the commentary box at the World Cup. Rival: The BBC's flagship football show now faces unprecedented competition from shows like Monday Night Football on SkySports, with former players Jamie Carragher (left) and Gary Neville proving to be a real success . The former Everton and Manchester United star is joining show veterans Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Danny Murphy alongside other newcomers Ruud Gullit and Rio Ferdinand. Neville admitted working as a commentator was 'harder' than he thought after hundreds of viewers complained about his on-air performance during the World Cup game between England and Italy. Viewers criticised his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game with several Twitter users joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville. On Neville's appointment, Cole said: 'After 22 years, Alan Hansen will no longer be with the show, but the World Cup really showcased the strength of the new BBC punditry team. 'We will continue to evolve the Saturday night panel and feel we have a really good blend of regular studio guests. 'Alan Shearer has established himself as one of the top pundits in the UK, while Danny Murphy and Philip Neville will regularly provide added tactical analysis. 'There will be strong opinions from Ruud Gullit and Robbie Savage, while Rio Ferdinand will continue to give excellent insight around his playing commitments. 'We will continue to mix our team of regular analysts with current players and managers, which featured Roy Hodgson, Thierry Henry, Vincent Kompany and Roberto Martinez last season. 'We are confident we have put together a varied team full of insight and opinion, led by Gary Lineker, who has consistently proved to be amongst the best presenters in the UK.'

"Steven Fletcher has pleaded with Gus Poyet to recall him to the Sunderland side for this weekend’s Tyne-Wear derby after Jozy Altidore’s goal drought extended to over a year. American striker Altidore has started the last two in place of Fletcher but has failed to add to his one Premier League strike, which came on December 4 last year. The £6.5million frontman was guilty of a glaring miss during Saturday’s 1-1 draw with West Ham when he swung at fresh air just five yards from an open goal. Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher (right) is tackled by West Ham defender Winston Reid in December . Altidore was eventually replaced by four-goal top scorer Fletcher, and the Scotland international has told manager Poyet that he is ready to start at St James’ Park having missed the last two 3-0 victories on Tyneside. ‘I had a little niggle after the Man City game so I missed Liverpool, which was disappointing, but I got on against West Ham and I feel fully fit now,’ he said. ‘I missed both 3-0 wins through injury so I want to be involved next week. ‘We’ve got a good record there but their form has picked up as well. But there’ s no point in putting extra pressure on ourselves because that won’t help. Jozy Altidore was guilty of a glaring  during his side's 1-1 draw with the Hammers on Saturday . Altidore reacts after he tried to shoot, but instead kicked air from three yards out with the goal at his mercy . Altidore looks frustrated as the chance passes him by shortly before the half time whistle was blown . ‘I’m looking forward to going there. I’ve only played there once before for Wolves.’ Fletcher did score against Newcastle during last season’s 2-1 victory at the Stadium of Light. And he reflected: ‘Scoring against Newcastle at the Stadium of Light is definitely the highlight of my Sunderland career so far. ‘It was a great moment. I don’t think I’d scored for a while when I did so I was a bit emotional.’ The Black Cats are without a win in six having drawn five of those matches to leave them two points above the relegation zone and Poyet has admitted that he doesn’t enjoy watching his team play. Fletcher, however, says there is no need to panic just yet. ‘The draws can’t be a bad thing,’ he said. ‘It’s a point and we’re happy as long as we can start turning the draws into wins. Gus Poyet shouts instructions during his side's 1-1 draw against West Ham at the Stadium of Light . ‘We’re creating chances so if we start putting them away we will start winning games. We are hard to beat at the moment. ‘From last year to this season it’s a big positive for us to have more points on the board.

After a home defeat to CSKA Moscow in November, City were at the bottom of Group E and struggling to see a way of progressing in Europe's most illustrious club competition.

"Surrounded by thousands of well-wishers, the widow of Herve Gourdel clutched a single white rose as she openly cried at a gathering in tribute to her husband who was murdered by Islamic extremists. Mr Gourdel's wife, Francoise, was with the mountaineer's parents today as thousands of people, including hundreds of Muslims, took to the streets of France to denounce the killing by Algerian Islamic extremist group Jund al-Khilifa - close allies of ISIS. Many more Muslims gathered outside mosques in cities across France to condemn the barbaric murder of the 55-year-old father-of-two. Scroll down for video . Distraught: The wife of Herve Gourdel, who was killed by an Islamic extremist group in Algeria earlier this week, attended a gathering in tribute to her husband in the southern French city of Nice . Harrowing: Mrs Gourdel clutched a white rose, as did hundreds of others at the large crowd, alongside pictures of the Frenchman who was brutally murdered by Jund al-Khilifa - close allies of the ISIS militant group . The parents of Herve Gourdel, Jean (left) and Genevieve (right) also attended the tribute service to their 55-year-old son, who was visiting Algeria for a walking holiday . Relatives of Mr Gourdel helped his father to stand at the gathering in Nice, where thousands took to the streets to pay tribute to the 55-year-old man . Thousands of people gathered in the southern French city of Nice for a silent walk, where flowers and pictures of the murdered man, were held aloft. Francoise and Mr Gourdel's parents, Jean and Genevieve, were visibly emotional as they lay flowers at the service.C . Candles were lit at a separate service in a square in Montpellier yesterday, as many more congregated in Paris and Nantes. A video of Mr Gourdel's brutal murder, titled 'A Message in Blood for the French Government', followed French airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria. President Francois Hollande has declared three days of national mourning but says France will not give in to 'blackmail' from terrorists. The flag atop the Grand Palais in France is being flown at half-mast. Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, spoke to a crowd of people mainly of North African origin in the French capital, saying: '[Mr Gourdel] was the victim of a cowardly murder. 'Islam demands respect for life. The Koran tells us that to kill one man is to kill all humanity.' The qualified mountain guide had spent years training other guides in Nepal, Morocco and Jordan, and was visiting the country for a ten-day walking expedition . Members of Jund al-Khilafah stand behind Mr Gourdel just before beheading him.

President Francois Hollande has declared three days of national mourning but says France will not give in to 'blackmail' from terrorists . The glaring sun beat down on the thousands of people paying tribute as they walked silently along the Mediterranean sea front in Nice, south-east France . Gone but not forgotten: Today's march saw hundreds of flowers and pictures of Mr Gourdel left as a tribute to the man, who leaves behind two grown-up children . The video of Mr Gourdel, a tour guide who was visiting Algeria, shows the man kneeling with his arms tied behind his back before four masked militants. Frenchman Herve Gourdel was a qualified mountain guide. The 55-year-old spent years training other guides in Nepal, Morocco and Jordan, and had visited Algeria before. He lived with his wife, Francoise, in Nice, and had two grown-up children. Mr Gourdel was abducted by the Jund al-Khilifa Islamic extremist group on September 21 - just one day after arriving in Algeria for a 10-day walking holiday. Three days later, the video of his death was posted online. Like previous beheadings by ISIS fanatic 'Jihadi John' in Syria, who has killed two American journalists, as well as British aid worker Alan Henning, the beheading is not shown but the grim aftermath is. The video, released just 30 minutes after Barack Obama's used a speech at the UN urging the world to dismantle ISIS' 'network of death', sent shockwaves through France, with public support for military intervention against ISIS rocketing to 69 per cent following Mr Gourdel's murder. France's five-million-strong Muslim population is the largest in Europe. Some on the French right have suggested the Islamic community has not condemned Mr Gourdel's murder strongly enough. This claim was strongly rejected by its leaders, and was rebutted by the rally in Paris and others across the nation today and yesterday. Dozens of Algerians were among the hundreds outside the Grand Mosque, and more gathered in the cities of Nantes, Montpellier and Bordeaux. 'This is not Islam, what they are doing,' Mohamed Benbouzia, an elderly Parisian man of Algerian origin said. 'It is a perversion, by sick people, murderers, criminals, people who should be sitting in jail. 'The Algerian government must do absolutely everything it can to track down the people who did this and bring them to justice.' Enes Mustafic, 65, said: 'Nowhere does the Quran say other religions or nations must be attacked. Cutting people's heads off is really the most despicable. If airstrikes can stop these fundamentalist, aggressive ideas from spreading, I am all for it.' A service in Montpellier saw hundreds of people gather at the Comedy Square to light candles in the mountaineer's honour, southern France . Candles were lit around a message reading 'Goodbye Herve' during the gathering, which takes place on the second of three days of national mourning across France . Hundreds of Muslims gathered at the Great Mosque in Paris yesterday to pay  tribute to Mr Gourdel. Prominent French Muslims have lent their voice to protests by Muslims in several countries against the campaign of terror waged by ISIS and their allies . Muslims waved Algerian and French flags outside the mosque after Friday prayers, as people protested against barbaric extremist group ISIS . Mourning: The flag at the Grand Palais, Paris, has been at half-mast since Mr Gourdel's death, which was revealed in the video titled 'A Message in Blood for the French Government' by Jund al-Khilifa . The video shows French text, which translates to English as  'BLOOD MESSAGE FOR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT'. It then shows Gourdel kneeling with his arms tied behind his back before four masked militants. Two have assault rifles. Gourdel appears to have a gash on the front of his throat. He appears calm. One of the men, reading from a script, says: . 'Here is criminal France that is full of hatred for Muslims, coming to us with a new dress. The aggression on the Muslims in Mali was not enough for it, and before that in Algeria, where it destroyed and sowed corruption in the land, violated honor, fought whoever converted to Islam with its laws, prevented the hijab, spread vice and corruption, and killed the Muslims and displaced the weak. 'And today it refused to see the Shariah of Allah be applied in the land, the implementation of proscribed punishments, and the religion be spread. 'So it came with its horses and men to participate in this Crusader war under the pretext of terrorism, as they allege.' 'Let the French people know that their blood is cheap for their president, and it is the same as you made the blood of the Muslim women and children cheap in Iraq and Sham [Syria] and other countries. 'Your blood has been cheapened as an exact recompense.' The militants then push the victim on his side and hold him down. The video does not show the beheading, but a militant holds the head up to the camera afterwards. Just before the militants gave their statement, the Frenchman briefly addressed his family. Zohra Lamloum, a French teacher of Algerian origin at a high school in a Paris suburb, said she was 10 years older than Gourdel and felt like he was her 'younger brother'. Holding up a newspaper and pointing at a photograph of Gourdel, she said: 'He was a healthy man, somebody who went hiking, who lived cleanly, who went to our country with the purest intentions, and this is what happened to him. 'The people who did this are drug addicts, imbeciles, they have no heart.' The rector of Bordeaux's largest mosque, Tareq Oubrou, said French Muslims need not demonstrate in the name of their religion because ISIS is not representative of Islam. The hashtag #pasenmonnom - meaning 'not in my name' - trended on Twitter, as Muslims tweeted their support for the gatherings across the country. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Thursday his country had received 'credible' intelligence that Islamic State militants planned to attack subway systems in Paris and in the United States. U.S. and French officials said then that they had no evidence to back up the prime minister's warning. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Friday there had been no confirmation of the Iraqi information about possible attacks on the Paris subway system by Islamic State militants.","Herve Gourdel was brutally murdered earlier this week by barbaric Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa - close allies of ISIS .

"A shocking rise in crystal meth use across the UK and Europe is down to the influence of hit TV show Breaking Bad, a leading academic has warned. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has revealed how parts of the EU are now being flooded with methamphetamine. Germany in particular has seen the highest surge in usage of the class A drug, reporting a worrying 51 per cent rise. In Britain alone border patrols have seen a surge in attempts to smuggle crystal meth into the country, with incidents rising by 400 per cent in the past year. A shocking rise in crystal meth use across the UK and Europe is down to the influence of hit TV show Breaking Bad, an expert has warned . In the show Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston (left) plays a chemistry teacher who teams up with his former student Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul (right) to sell methamphetamine . Figures released by the Government in January also revealed seizures of the deadly drug by police forces have also quadrupled in the last five years. Professor Ellis Cashmore, an author on celebrity and media culture, from Staffordshire University, said the global success of the critically acclaimed US drama could be to blame. He claimed having the central plot of a popular TV show revolving around the drug would instantly boost its appeal. Mr Cashmore said: 'Although the show does not go out to glamourise the drug, its very inclusion promotes interest in that substance. 'The fact it is a central premise to almost the entire series would serve to boost this interest for people who perhaps had not encountered it before. Referred to as ‘ice’ or ‘glass’, methylamphetamine can be consumed orally, sniffed, smoked or injected and is becoming increasingly popular as a stimulant in the gay club scene. In its most popular crystalline form it resembles glass shavings or a crystal rock but is also available in pills and powder. The drug causes a range of dangerous side-effects alongside its high, such as increased heart rate, paranoia and heart problems. The first crystal meth factory in the UK was found in 2005 and fears of its gradual introduction in the UK prompted its upgrade from a class-B to a class-A drug in January 2007. The drug was first synthesised in 1919 but has grown in popularity due to the ease with which it is produced using a number of household products and items. Across Europe, seizures of methamphetamine have increased from 30kg in 2000 to 1,582kg in 2011. 'One of the central protagonists Jessie, played by Aaron Paul, is portrayed as a drug addict and he is now a Hollywood A-Lister. He is a bit of a sex symbol. 'The fact this character who we grow to love is taking crystal meth instantly makes people curious. 'We live in a hedonistic generation where people are seeking pleasure from various sources, and increasingly these are be found in the most illicit forms.' Even if the harmful effects of the drug are portrayed, people may still be drawn in, he added. He said: 'Even if a TV show, like Breaking Bad, portrays drugs in a negative aspect and showing its most destructive side, it will still appeal to somebody. 'Showing the horrendous impact of crystal meth can have a boomerang effect and cause curiosity among some viewers who might think 'that must be good'. 'I'm not surprised following the success of Breaking Bad that we have news of a surge in the use of methamphetamine. 'The fact millions of people have watched the show and been entertained by it almost instantly glamorises its subject matter, whether deliberate or not.' Prague, is now the epicentre of the crystal meth industry, said to be the source of a staggering 95 per cent of all batches consumed in Europe. In the show - which has won numerous Emmy and Golden Globe awards - one episode focuses on a scheme to export methamphetamine from New Mexico to the Czech Republic. In Britain, border patrols have seen a surge in attempts to smuggle crystal meth into the country, with incidents rising by 400 per cent in the past year . Professor Ellis Cashmore, of Staffordshire University, blames the surge on the TV show Breaking Bad. Having the central plot of a  show revolving around the drug instantly boosts its appeal, he said . In reality, police say it is also down to a much more sophisticated production and distribution network run by Vietnamese gangs based in the Czech Republic. Colonel Jackub Frydrych, from Czech Republic Police, who heads the team trying to disrupt the trade, said: 'There are booming markets. 'I will give you an example: in Japan there is a big mark up of about £435 on each gram of crystal meth. 'From a profit perspective it is one of the most dynamic markets.' Home Office figures revealed the problem is also much closer to home with around 17,000 people believed to have used crystal meth in 2013. Border police intercepted the drug on 252 occasions last year, rising from the 61 seizures recorded in 2011/12.

"Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward endeavoured to explain on Tuesday that the fallen Barclays Premier League club remain a huge draw to players – by highlighting their social media standings. Woodward will be laughed at in some quarters by trying to big up his club by revealing, for example, that new signings Daley Blind, Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao saw their Twitter, Facebook and Google standings rocket on the day they signed for United in August. With United out of European competition for the first time in years this season and currently struggling to impose themselves on this term’s Premier League, many fans would rather see some points on the board than listen to stories of social networking increases. Ed Woodward insisted United's new sponsorship deals will still stand the club in good stead . Louis van Gaal is having to re-tune his playing squad after last season's failure . However, Woodward’s comments came in a conference call with United investors to coincide with the release of the club’s quarterly figures this morning and, as such, were meant to illustrate to shareholders perhaps frustrated by lack of progress on the field that, in global terms, the Old Trafford club remain as prominent and high-profile as ever. Woodward said: 'I want to share the impact on players' profiles around the world by joining Manchester United. 'Manchester United commands more than 51 per cent of the Premier League’s entire global TV audience, which is in 200 countries worldwide. 'Di Maria saw a 12-times increase on Google searches on the day of his transfer from Real Madrid and Falcao saw a 10-times increase in searches compared with the day he signed from Atletico. Van Gaal unveils Manchester United signings Radamel Falcao (left) and Daley Blind (right) 'When Daley Blind signed from Ajax in August his Twitter following increased by 72 per cent, with his daily increase up an incredible 50 times. 'We have six million followers on Facebook. 3.8m Twitter followers and have accumulated 87m followers across all social media. We are directly in touch with over 100m fans. 'The club’s media reach is further illustrated by research that shows for every article on our own website - and there about 150 of those every month - a further 160 articles about Manchester United are written elsewhere and 13,500 social media posts are made about the club. 'This impressive multiplier effect shows the popularity of the club around the world.' The Old Trafford outfit have announced a 10 per cent drop in income for the first quarter of the financial year . United released their financial quarterly results for the three months ending on September 30 at lunchtime on Tuesday, revealing a £9.8million drop in income due to the fact they are not participating in the Champions League or even the Europa League this season. Commercial, broadcasting and matchday revenue came to £98.5m for the same period last year. This time that figure is down 9.9 per cent to £88.7m. United's debt is also seen to be up slightly from £361m to £362.2m although the club has been quick to point out that the last quarter has also seen them sign the largest kit manufacturer deal in sport - £750m over 10 years – amid five other sponsorship deals across the globe.

"Jockey Tom O’Brien will replace a suspended Richard Johnson on the key Christmas-period rides of Menorah in King George VI Chase and Garde La Victoire in the Ladbroke Hurdle. Grahame Whateley, who owns both Philip Hobbs-trained geldings with wife Diana, confirmed he would be using Hobbs’ No 2 rider and not searching for a big-name replacement after emotionally welcoming his resurgent Peterborough Chase winner Wishfull Thinking at Huntingdon. Menorah is 10-1 for the King George with sponsors William Hill after winning the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby and finishing second to Silviniaco Conti in the Betfair Chase at Haydock while Garde La Victoire is 8-1 second favourite to follow up last month’s Greatwood Hurdle win at Cheltenham at Ascot on December 20. Tom O’Brien will replace suspended jockey Richard Johnson in two of the key Christmas-period rides . Johnson is ruled out because of the 12-day suspension he picked up at Exeter on Friday for taking the wrong course. Whateley, who won the 2012 Peterbough Chase with Menorah when it was switched to Kempton, said: ‘I am very sorry for Richard. He made a mistake but we are all human. We have a good jockey in Tom O’Brien – he is a cracking rider. We will just have to hope the ground both suits Garde le Victoire and Menorah.’ Whateley punched the air as if he had won the Gold Cup as he led Wishfull Thinking to the Huntingdon winner’s enclosure. Like Menorah, 11-year-old Wishfull Thinking, who had produced a career best steeplechasing performance when landing the Old Roan Chase at Aintree on his penultimate run, is riding on the crest of the wave being generated by the in-form Hobbs. Whateley, who saw his winner’s brother Wishfull Dreaming finish second on his Exeter Bumper debut on Friday, added: ‘If we had only been able to solve Wishfull Thinking’s breathing problem, which we have never done, he would have been exceptional.’ Wishfull Thinking made virtually all under Johnson, jumping with real spring in his hooves, but he was arguably lucky. Nicky Richards-trained Eduard had hit the front when losing all momentum under Brian Harding at the last fence. Johnson was given a 12-day suspension at Exeter on Friday for taking the wrong course . Some bookmakers quote Wishfull Thinking for the King George but he is likely to have a ‘long rest’ and be brought back for a spring campaign. Similarly, Gold Cup quotes about Don Cossack, winner of the John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown for trainer Gordon Elliott and jockey Brian O’ Connell, seem equally redundant. Elliott said his preference would be to go direct to the Cheltenham Festival in March to run in the shorter Ryanair Chase. Returning Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere did as well as could be expected with his third place behind Don Cossack, finishing strongly over the inadequate two and a half mile distance. Meanwhile, C4 presenter Clare Balding will not be the only absentee from Aintree on Grand National day next year after preferring to cover the first televised Woman’s Boat race instead in her much scaled-down role. Robert Waley-Cohen doubts he will let Saturday’s Becher Chase winner Oscar Time take his chance at the age of 14. His dual King George winner Long Run, however, has Aintree on his agenda and is about ‘six to eight weeks’ off returning to trainer Nicky Henderson as he recuperates from injury.","Richard Johnson is suspended for two of the key Christmas-period rides .

Zwanziger wants fellow members to agree to a change of the ethics code which, via Article 36, currently prohibits the publication. Garcia has compiled a report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively. The American lawyer has also appealed against the initial findings into his report, delivered by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert which criticised England's bid but cleared Russia and Qatar to host the tournaments. Chairman of the FIFA Ethics Committee Hans-Joachim Eckert has already published a summary of the report . Russia, Qatar and England were accused of breaking rules during the 2018 and 2022 bids in the report . Zwanziger told the Germany press agency DPA: 'I would like to see this ban relaxed so that the FIFA executive committee, as well as the public, in an appropriate form can be informed of the contents of the investigation.' Zwanziger has previously said awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was 'one of the biggest mistakes ever in the history of sport' and in September suggested it will be moved from the country due to the scorching heat. FIFA responded to that remark by insisting the tournament will definitely be staged in Qatar - a process is underway to decide on what time of year it will be held.","FIFA's executive committee will meet next week in Marrakech .

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini will trial James Milner as a deep-lying centre forward in training this week as he attempts to solve his club’s chronic injury crisis. City face three matches this month without a fit striker after Edin Dzeko injured his calf before kick-off at Leicester and joined Sergio Aguero and Stevan Jovetic on the casualty list. Frank Lampard’s goal gave City their seventh straight win to keep them on Chelsea’s tail at the top of the table but Aguero is out until mid-January with a knee injury, Dzeko is unlikely to return until the new year and there are similar fears about Jovetic, who strained a hamstring against Roma last week. James Milner will be trialed up front in Manchester City training this week by Manuel Pellegrini . Samir Nasri (left) and David Silva (right) are also alternatives with City without a fit recognised striker . Pellegrini says Milner is a very useful player for the squad and may play as a deep-lying forward . Pellegrini will assess whether David Silva, Samir Nasri or Milner can cope with playing as a false No 9 and also ask Patrick Vieira if anyone from his development squad can step up. Jose Angel Pozo, the 18-year-old who replaced Dzeko on Saturday, prefers to play in midfield while four City forwards — Alvaro Negredo, Jordy Hiwula, Marcos Lopes and Andy Cole’s son Devante — are out on loan. The possibility of a new role for Milner is intriguing. ‘We will work this week with the players to see who can play best in that position. It can be Silva, it can be Nasri, it can be Milner,’ said Pellegrini. ‘We must decide which is the best one. I always said James is a very useful player for the squad. At some moments he wants to play more but wherever he plays he is important. That is why we’ve kept him here. ‘Pozo is not a striker. We must try to find another way to play because our strikers will be out for at least one month more.’ 18-year-old Jose Angel Pozo has played up top in recent weeks but he prefers to operate in midfield . Pozo replaced Edin Dzeko against Leicester- the Bosnian injured himself in the warm-up . The mounting injury list could not have come at a worse time for City. Centre back Vincent Kompany also pulled up with a recurrence of a hamstring injury, meaning more pressure will be put on veteran defender Martin Demichelis alongside £32million summer signing Eliaquim Mangala. Pellegrini believes it is a consequence of top players being worked too hard. ‘Last year I remember playing nine games in December and nine games in January. It is difficult for the players to keep the high pace, because of the intensity of every game in the Premier League.’ The City boss would like to see the festive season reduced rather than ended. ‘I understand Boxing Day is important for English football but if we play on the 26th, I don’t know why we have to play on the 28th and January 1,’ he said. Pellegrini will fight for reinforcements in January but at least he has Lampard. The 36-year-old, on loan from City’s parent club New York City FC, settled a dour match at Leicester with a 40th-minute finish from Nasri’s cross for his 175th Premier League goal. Vincent Kompany is expected to miss the rest of 2014 after being taken off injured at the King Power Stadium . Frank Lampard and City want his contract with the club extended until March but they need MLS permission . Both player and club want his loan spell extended until March but it will need permission from the MLS, who have promoted Lampard as one of their biggest stars. Leicester remain bottom of the table and yesterday sacked director of football Terry Robinson. He was informed of the decision by chief executive Susan Whelan. There are no suggestions that manager Nigel Pearson’s job is in danger. The 51-year-old would not confirm interest in Jermain Defoe, who plays for Toronto in the MLS, but indicated he would like a goal poacher similar to the ex-Spurs man. Leicester have collected only two points from 33 since beating Manchester United 5-3 in September.

"Police are investigating alleged racist messages sent to Manchester City footballer Yaya Toure following his team's derby win over Manchester Untied. The midfielder  rejoined Twitter on Monday, five months after leaving the social network site in order to focus on the World Cup. The Ivory Coast international posted his first tweet at 6pm, reflecting on City's 1-0 victory over Manchester United the previous day. Scroll down for video . Manchester City's Yaya Toure was reportedly subjected to racial abuse within hours of rejoining Twitter . He wrote: 'Great to be back on twitter after a good win yesterday. Now my focus is on the next game... Happy Monday everyone!!' Within hours of posting the message, the  31-year-old received abusive and racist messages from other Twitter accounts. Anti-discrimination group Kick It Out was appalled by some of the tweets and decided to report the matter to the police. 'NEWS: We are informing the Police of racist tweets directed @yayatoure earlier this evening and offer him our full support #kickitout,' KIO posted on Twitter. A Kick It Out spokesperson said Monday night: 'At this stage we have received complaints about two separate tweets of a racist nature aimed at Yaya Toure and now we are informing the police. 'Yaya Toure has been on Twitter for a matter of hours and he has already received abuse of an appalling nature. 'We are disturbed by the fact that someone can be treated this way. It makes footballers start to question why they should use these platforms. We will offer Yaya Toure our full support.' Greater Manchester Police confirmed that they are investigating the matter this afternoon. Toure, pictured during training at his club's the Etihad stadium today, has not commented on the matter . A spokesman for the force said: 'GMP can confirm we have received a number of complaints regarding racist tweets directed at Manchester City Football Club player Yaya Toure on Monday 3rd November 2014.Officers are currently investigating.' On Monday evening Toure favourited a tweet from one City fan - @111Lesley111 - who offered her support to the former Barcelona player. She wrote: '@YayaToure Welcome back to the land of the tweetiverse. Ignore the nasty jealous ones. There are far more out here that (heart) you. #MCFC' This is not the first time Toure has been the target of racist abuse. Last season he was subjected to racist chanting during City's Champions League game at CSKA Moscow. 'I'm not just disappointed, I'm furious,' Toure said after City's 2-1 win in Russia. It was unbelievable and very sad.' CSKA denied Toure had been abused, but UEFA disagreed and ordered the Russian club to close part of their ground for their next Champions League match.","Player rejoined Twitter on Monday following win over cross-town rivals .

"Santi Cazorla has urged his Arsenal team-mates to forget their 'nightmare' against Anderlecht and finish the Champions League group stage campaign on a high. The Gunners take on Galatasaray in Istanbul on Tuesday night knowing that they must win to have a chance of finishing top in Group D.

The players have got a lot of respect for Sam. ‘They speak very highly of him and to know that’s the case made me want to get involved.

"Arsenal cruised into the knockout rounds of the UEFA Youth League after goals from Stephy Mavididi, Tyrell Robinson and Aaron Eyoma guided them to victory over Galatasaray. The impressive 3-1 result means the young Gunners finish second in Group D behind Belgian side Anderlecht but they had to come from behind to secure their win. Steve Gatting's team stepped onto the artificial surface at the Esenyurt Necmi Kadioglu Stadium knowing it would take an absolute catastrophe for them not to reach the last 16. Stephy Mavididi blasts home Arsenal's equalising goal against Galatasaray five minutes before the break .

Referee: Georgi Kabakov (Bulgaria) Because of their 5-1 success over the Turkish side on matchday two, the young Gunners were unlikely to come second on the head-to-head record used to divide teams on the same number of points. But the locals were dreaming of an unlikely rout when Galatasaray took the lead just eight minutes in. Altug Tas did well to create an opening and Kerem Caliskan blasted the ball into the roof of the net. It took a good 20 minutes for the visitors to find their rhythm and their first attack of note saw Eyoma dash to the byline but his cross evaded Mavididi. Their first real chance fell to Mavididi, who scored their all-important winner against Borussia Dortmund two weeks ago, but his shot wasn't strong enough to trouble goalkeeper Mert Karaca. As the half neared its conclusion, Arsenal built up a real head of steam and it resulted in them leading at the break. First, Daniel Crowley sent a 25-yard free-kick just over the crossbar, then Mavididi rattled the crossbar with a power-packed shot after Chris Willock teed him up.

As it stood, Galatasaray would have to win the match 6-1 in order to qualify and that equation became even more improbable two minutes later. Arsenal's second was all Robinson's own work as he burst between a couple of defenders and fired a low shot into the far corner to put his team ahead. Any doubt over Arsenal's progression was removed two minutes after half-time. Galatasaray struggled to clear their lines after Mavididi had delivered a dangerous cross and Eyoma was alert to finish from close range.

"Just a few days ago she was tearfully recalling how she 'fell in love' with her boss President Clinton - and, she claimed, unwittingly became the first person to have their reputation torn to shreds online.

Lewinsky has recently plunged herself into the limelight again by speaking out about her dalliances with the former President, which led to a national uproar and Clinton's impeachment. Casual: The former White House intern was dressed mainly in black - and donned shades to wait outside for her ride . Reinvention: Lewinsky, 41, is reinventing herself as a social activist who will fight cyber-bullying - of which she claims to be the first victim . She was the star speaker at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia last week, where she picked over the explosive revelations of 1998 again, and cast herself as 'patient zero' in an epidemic of cyber-bullying. Addressing the crowd from a podium, she said: ‘Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss. She continued: 'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. 'I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet. 'I fell in love with my boss': Lewinsky spoke out over her affair for the first time at a Forbes summit last week . ‘I lost my public self, or had it stolen... In a way, it was a form of identity theft... Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. 'Yet around the world this story went - A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly ""social"" media,' she recalled, according to Forbes. The speech marked the start of Lewinksy's drive to shift her public image from being the butt of countless jokes to a social activist, fighting against bullying. She used the Forbes event - and her much-commented-on Twitter debut the same day - to stoke the fires of her planned 'cultural revolution' over cyber-bullying.

"Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola should be wary about resting some of his star players for Wednesday's Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow, according to Matthias Sammer. The Bavarians sporting director - who made 115 appearances for Borussia Dortmund during his playing career - is unsure as to whether Guardiola should rest several first-team players despite Bayern's progress to the knockout stages already guaranteed. The Bundesliga champions won their first four Group E matches to ensure qualification to the last 16 before losing to Man City two weeks ago. Bayern Munich won their opening four Champions League group games to progress to the knockout stages . Bayern  manager Pep Guardiola should be wary about resting some of his star players against CSKA Moscow, according to sporting director Matthias Sammer . With CSKA desperate for a victory to ensure their own progression, Sammer believes should Guardiola choose to rest some of Bayern's star men, it could have an adverse affect on the team in the long run. 'I do not know [if it would be a good idea to rotate,' Sammer said speaking to TZ. 'On the other hand: yes. On the other hand: no. 'Because it is a risk that we could lose our momentum again when we leave six or seven first-team players out of the line-up. 'Under Pep there is a good attitude in the squad. He knows how important it is to keep momentum going. 'We want to again play a good game,' the forward said. 'We're aiming for a victory on home soil.'

"Republicans danced Tuesday night to the tune of a new U.S. Senate majority, but governor's mansions will also be redder in 2015 than they were this year. Stunning upsets in Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts – three of America's more liberal-dominated states – left political consultants and commentators shaking their heads. The strong GOP showing – they won at least six races in states with Democratic governors – will be seen as a repudiation of Barack Obama, who said in October that while he wouldn't be on the ballot, his policies would be. It also will cast doubt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's ability to galvanize Democratic voters in states she would need to win in order to claim the presidency in 2016. Clinton stumped for Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown in October, carefully controlling events by limiting reporters' access while playing to half-empty auditoriums. Brown lost big to political newcomer Larry Hogan, known in real estate but not in Annapolis, in a 6-point upset that also brought first lady Michelle Obama out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to buck up Brown as his campaign flagged. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . THE THRILL OF VICTORY: Maryland Gov.-elect Larry Hogan, a Republican, acknowledges supporters after winning the state's gubernatorial race . THE AGONY OF DEFEAT: Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown (left) lost a bruising race despite help from the Obamas and the Clintons . DIDN'T HELP: Anthony Brown (right) was already Maryland's lieutenant governor, and Michelle Obama wanted him to get the top job . Maryland's incumbent governor, Martin O'Malley, is also a potential 2016 presidential candidate. His stock fell Tuesday, too, as Democrats saw him surrendering the keys to the governor's mansion to a Republican. That sleeper race was one of Tuesday's biggest shockers. Brown led in nine of the last 10 opinion polls covering the race, slipping behind just days before the election – and then only in a poll commissioned by Hogan's campaign. In June, Hogan faced a seemingly insurmountable 18-point deficit. Five months later, he thanked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, for helping him seal the deal. Christie, he told wildly cheering supporters, 'was so excited that we had the biggest upset in the entire country, that he wanted to fly his helicopter down here to be with us tonight.' He framed his victory as the 'largest mandate for change in Maryland in 63 years.' 'Tonight countless Democrats crossed over,' he said, 'and affirmed the wisdom of John F. Kennedy who said, ""Sometimes party loyalty demands too much"".' Massachusetts Republican  Charlie Baker (left) won his race despite the state's liberal-bastion status . TWO-TIME LOSER: Democrat Martha Coakley (right) crashed and burned for the second time in four years, earning her the nickname 'Croakley' In Massachusetts, state Attorney General Martha Coakley crashed and burned at the hands of former state cabinet member Charlie Baker, who won in every county except those in the western part of the state plus Boston and the elite playground islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. Coakley earned the sobriquet 'Martha Croakley' after losing a special election in 2010 that was called to fill a U.S. Senate seat after the death of Ted Kennedy. That seat had been in Democrats' hands for ages, but then-unknown Republican Scott Brown trounced her. Brown appeared to have failed in a bid to return to the Senate in a New Hampshire race on Tuesday, in a race he lost by less than one-half of one percent. He has not, however, conceded the race. That's one thing he and Coakley have in common: On Tuesday night, trailing by one and one-half percentage points, she sent her supporters home and said she wouldn't admit she had lost. Baker trailed all summer in the polls but held a consistent if narrow lead through October. Christie, the pugnacious Garden State loudmouth who may fancy himself a presidential contender in just a few short months, also stumped for Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who squeaked by Democratic former Gov. Charlie Crist by about 1 per cent of the votes cast. President Obama, too, had a hard night at the polls as Americans saw evidence that his 39 per cent approval rating has rendered his coattails too short to grasp. LAMEST DUCK: Wisconsin Democrat Mary Burke failed to end the rule of Gov. Scott Walker, even though she got some raer in-person help from President Barack Obama . He personally campaigned for Democratic challenger Mary Burke in Wisconsin, only to see her fall to incumbent Gov. Scott Walker by a 7-point margin – in a state where every Democratic incumbent in the U.S House won another two-year term. During  an October 28 rally, cameras caught people leaving in droves as the president spoke. In Obama's adopted home state of Illinois, incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn lost by 5 points to Bruce Rauner. He, too, hadn't conceded the race by the time Rauner delivered his victory speech. 'There are a lot of votes still to be counted,' Quinn said. 'I don’t believe in throwing in the towel when there are that many votes still to be counted.' But Rauner was romping, crediting his outreach to black pastors – a constituency that helped Obama launch his political career – with delivering crucial margins in nearly every county statewide. 'Are you ready for a new direction? Are you ready to bring back Illinois?' he asked a capacity crowd at his victory party. 'This election is about bringing back our great state. This is a victory for our taxpayers who need to have a lower tax burden. This is a victory for our workers who deserve to have a booming economy.' 'This victory is for our students, our children, who deserve the best schools in America. And this is a victory for our citizens who deserve a government without corruption.' The win changes the political landscape in Illinois with an injection of Republicanism for the first time in a dozen years. WINNER: Texas Attorney General and Republican Governor-elect Greg Abbott cruised to victory . NOT HER NIGHT: An emotional Wendy Davis (right) wiped away her tears after she lost her bid to become governor of Texas, as her daughter Dru (left) looked on . In Connecticut, Vermont and Colorado, incumbent Democratic governors held on in races that were too close to call. Democrats' only bight spot all night came in Pennsylvania, as Republican Gov. Tom Corbett lost his job to Democrat Tom Wolf. Another closely watched race turned into a Republican landslide as Greg Abbott, the paraplegic state Attorney General, trounced state Sen. Wendy Davis by 20 points. Davis is a freshly minted feminist icon known for filibustering an anti-abortion bill in pink sneakers. Abbott had pulled away in recent days, enlarging a 6-point lead to an 18-point spread in the last two weeks – since Davis ran a controversial TV ad making a wheelchair the center of attention. He won big on Tuesday, despite reports that his name never appeared on touch-screen voting machines in at least one polling place. In her concession speech, Davis told her supporters to be disappointed, but not discouraged. Accusations surfaced Tuesday afternoon that in the Lone Star State's third-most populous county, Abbott's name isn't on at least one touch-screen ballot machine. Instead, an Instagram photo of a Bexar County machine shows, the Republican slot is taken by David Dewhurst, the 2012 failed GOP candidate for lieutenant governor. An alert Bexar County, Texas voter snapped this picture of a voting machine that omitted the name of GOP gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott, substituting 2012 failed lieutenant governor hopeful David Dewhurst instead . Gov. Walker has attracted scorn and tens of millions of dollars in attack ads from angry labor unions, but still could not be stopped . BIG SURROGATE: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (front) stumped last week for Maryland Republican gubernatorial hopeful Larry Hogan in a race that's now too close to call . Logan Churchwell, communications director at the conservative True the Vote organization, told MailOnline that his group had confirmed Bexar County has received 'additional complaints' and that 'they are currently investigating how widespread the matter is.' 'I think it's a photoshopped deal but we are checking,' Bexar County Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen told the San Antonio Express-News. The image, which shows clunky block-like sections of the video template out of place, could reflect a ham-fisted Photoshop attempt, a Republican campaign consultant in Washington told MailOnline. 'Or,' he said, 'it could be that the voting machine's software is messed up. If it's pulling in candidates from two years ago, who knows what else is wrong in those computers?' The campaign operative insisted, though, that Abbott would win Tuesday. 'Not even the Democratic Party could buy enough votes or stuff enough ballot boxes to save Wendy Davis at this point,' he said. WOAI reporter Jocelyn Tovar posted the Instagram photo after she interviewed the woman who snapped it. It's unclear how that voter could have edited the image so fast, and without leaving the polling place. 'I don't have time for that,' the woman told her. Tovar posted a second photo on Twitter, showing the same kind of digital goof.","Massive power shifts came Tuesday in liberal-dominated Maryland, Illinois and Massachusetts as Republicans sent Democrats packing .

"When Roy Hodgson likened Jack Colback to Italy legend Andrea Pirlo within a few minutes of his first international call-up in August, it did the Newcastle midfielder few favours. Before he had even had the chance to anchor England’s diamond – polishing his passes Pirlo style – he was injured. Hodgson’s comparison had been much like an art teacher announcing to class that the new student was their very own Michelangelo, only for him to snap his brush in the first lesson. Jack Colback was excellent as Newcastle ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season at St James' Park . The headlines and the hype – Ginger Pirlo proved popular – and the subsequent disappointment of the calf complaint which forced his withdrawal, did little for the player’s confidence. Upon his return to St James' Park, the early-season form which had won him Three Lions recognition stalled. He wasn’t playing badly, but ‘Jack Colback, 6: Neat and tidy’ became the norm. But United boss Alan Pardew – and, evidently, Hodgson – had seen something more within the former Sunderland man, who quit the Stadium of Light for his hometown club in the summer. Only now, however, is the wider audience taking note of the combative schemer who marries graft to his craft. It was the second time in 2014 that Colback had been on the winning side against Chelsea . For Colback, having starred in Saturday’s 2-1 win against Chelsea, is now the only player to have enjoyed a Premier League double over the Blues in 2014. He was at the heart of Sunderland’s midfield in April when, at Stamford Bridge, he and Lee Cattermole out-fought and out-thought Nemanja Matic and Ramires in a 2-1 victory; that was the last time Jose Mourinho’s side had been beaten in the league before the weekend. This time, he got the better of Cesc Fabregas and John Obi Mikel and it was from his tackle, forward drive and incisive throughball that Papiss Cisse poached his match-winning second. Colback had been outstanding throughout, reopening the debate about his England credentials. But those aspirations can wait. For now, he and Newcastle are quite happy changing people’s perceptions. Papiss Cisse scored twice in the second half as Newcastle inflicted Chelsea's first  defeat this season . ‘We showed we can match it with the best,’ said the 25-year-old, who was part of the side beaten 4-0 at Southampton in September to leave them bottom of the table. ‘To be the first team to beat Chelsea this season is a great achievement and we were deserving of it. It was tough at times but we showed our quality as well. ‘A lot of people will look at that result and will probably be shocked to see it. But we matched them and didn't give them too much respect, which if you do, can catch you out.’ Chelsea were without loss in 21 this term before their trip to Tyneside - and Colback rates Newcastle’s success as greater than that of Sunderland last season. ‘They were strong in April when I beat them but they have added a lot more quality with Fabregas and Diego Costa and Didier Drogba off the bench,’ he said. Newcastle's midfield engine room of Moussa Sissoko and Colback share a smile with manager Alan Pardew . ‘They have quality all over the pitch and it is difficult to see a weakness. It is a bit different to last season. ‘Going forward they are a lot stronger. Defensively they have been strong as well and have brushed most teams away, so it was a fantastic win.’ Newcastle are up to seventh following their sixth win in eight and travel to an Arsenal side on Saturday just one place ahead of them on goal difference. Colback, though, feels the Magpies have laid down a marker with recent victories over Spurs, Manchester City, Liverpool and the league leaders. ‘We go to Arsenal with confidence,’ he said. ‘They are a similar team to Chelsea in the way they play and we have just got to settle it down like we did on Saturday and we can be dangerous against any team. ‘I enjoyed it against Chelsea. It is good to test yourself against the best team in the league and come out on top.’ Forget talk of Pirlo, Colback is proving he is very much his own man right now. Colback's form this season could see him earn a second call-up to the England squad .","Jack Colback was excellent in Newcastle's 2-1 win against Chelsea .

"Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. Spanish newspaper Marca has an interview with Real Madrid's James Rodriguez on Monday in which he praises the team's work ethic and declares Cristiano Ronaldo light years ahead of his rivals. 'The key is we all defend,' Rodriguez said after Real won their 18th straight game with a 3-0 victory over Celta Vigo over the weekend. 'We were thinking more of the next match than the 18 victories.' Marca has an interview with James Rodriguez, who 'reveals the secrets of (Real) Madrid's records' Carlo Ancelotti's side top of La Liga and are already through to the last 16 of the Champions League. Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in Real's win over Vigo, setting a record of 23 La Liga hat-tricks, causing his fellow forward to declare: 'The difference between CR7 and the rest is enormous.' Another Spanish newspaper, Mundo Deportivo, leads with Barcelona's 5-1 rout over Espanyol. Like Ronaldo, Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick in his team's victory and the paper's front page reads 'genius and a five-goal haul'. The paper describes Messi's display as 'decisive' and 'stratospheric'. Barcelona's win meant they stay two points behind fierce rivals Real in La Liga. Mundo Deportivo lauds the performance of Lionel Messi in Barcelona's victory over Espanyol .

"Newcastle have taken a swipe at exiled loanee Hatem Ben Arfa via their matchday programme – and he will again be forced to train with the reserves should Hull, as expected, send him back to St James’ Park next month. Alan Pardew will not allow the French winger, whom he chose to get rid of during the summer after becoming disillusioned with his ‘lack of professionalism’, to disrupt the team spirit he has harnessed on Tyneside this season. And Newcastle’s programme was quick to remind supporters of Ben Arfa’s current struggle for form with a page detailing his ‘torrid’ performance at Manchester United, during which he was substituted before half-time. Hull's Hatem Ben Arfa (left) was hooked by Steve Bruce in the first against Manchester United last month . Newcastle made reference to Ben Arfa's 'torrid' performance against United in their matchday programme . So far, Pardew and the club have preferred not to mention the 27-year-old and the boss was a little miffed at one press conference when – amid United’s six-match winning run - a French journalist repeatedly asked questions about Ben Arfa, forcing Newcastle’s press officer to intervene. But the programme previewing Saturday’s 2-1 win over Chelsea made a point of highlighting Ben Arfa's poor display at Old Trafford. Using a big picture of the player for the first time, they wrote: ‘Hatem Ben Arfa lasted just 35 minutes of Hull City’s 3-0 defeat at Manchester United last Saturday before being replaced by Sone Aluko. Ben Arfa (centre) has struggled for form since moving to Hull on loan in the summer . It is thought that the French winger could be sent back to Newcastle in January . ‘The French winger endured a torrid opening half hour at the hands of Louis van Gaal’s United before Tigers boss Steve Bruce made the change.’ Bruce has since been forced to deny that there was a fall-out with Ben Arfa. Sportsmail, however, understands the Hull boss has lost patience with his deadline-day signing, who has failed to score in eight appearances and has been left out of the last two matchday squads. The player’s work-rate is thought to be a major concern among the management team at the KC Stadium. Bruce, whose side have slipped into the bottom three after a run of eight without a victory, said: ‘There is no disputing that he has got ability but ability isn’t enough at this level, so he will be training like everyone else will be training. The Newcastle matchday programme took a swipe at Ben Arfa, describing his display at United as 'torrid' ‘We have now got four or five weeks until January and we could lose three or four players next week and then there is a chance that he might be back in. ‘We will see what December and January brings and have a sit down and see where we all are.’ Ben Arfa, via his Instagram account, says there is no rift with Bruce: ‘I just wanted to clarify my situation,’ he wrote. ‘I have no problem with my coach (Bruce). This is someone that I love that I respect and I admire!’ Ben Arfa’s contract at Newcastle is up at the end of the season and, should he return to the club in January, it is thought they will allow him to leave on loan for the remainder of his deal.","French winger Hatem Ben Arfa is on loan at Hull from Newcastle .

"Which would you rather win? The League Cup quarter-final? Or the derby? Radio phone-ins, newspaper polls, Twitter squabbles – debate has raged all week on Tyneside. The reality is, of course, Newcastle United, as is their wacky way, will probably either win both or lose both. Alan Pardew's Newcastle face Tottenham in their Capital One Cup quarter-final on Wednesday night . The 1955 FA Cup, brought home to Newcastle here, is the last time the club won domestic silverware . Newcastle captain Jimmy Scoular is raised above boss Duggie Livingstone with the FA Cup in 1955 . But, for now, it provides a fascinating insight into the mindset of supporters often billed the country’s longest suffering (50,000 every week and no domestic trophy in 60 years is unique, you have to say). On Wednesday night their team travel to Tottenham Hotspur in the last eight of the Capital One Cup. It is the first time they have been beyond the fourth round of a domestic cup competition during Alan Pardew’s four-year tenure. They are two ties from Wembley, a venue last visited in 2000 when, during an FA Cup semi-final, Sir Bobby Robson’s team were undone by a double from Chelsea’s Gus Poyet. On Sunday, it is Poyet – a perennial nemesis of the black and whites – who brings North-East rivals Sunderland to St James’ Park. Gus Poyet celebrates scoring Chelsea's second goal during the 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat in 2000 . The now Sunderland boss scored twice to knock Sir Bobby Robson's side out of the competition . Alan Shearer looks downcast as his side are knocked out of the FA Cup by Chelsea at Wembley . Newcastle have lost the last three derbies. And therein, perhaps, lies the reason why many supporters are siding with a shot at Wembley over victory in the derby. In a perverse way, they are used to losing the derby now. It hurts, of course – some have even punched horses in protest – but the fear of defeat has been realised. There is no longer a proud record to protect. There will be more derbies, one as soon as early April. But cup runs and Wembley and days out in the capital with Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden awash in black and white, now they don’t come around twice a season. Pardew's Newcastle are looking to bounce back after a 4-1 defeat by Arsenal on Saturday . Gus Poyet celebrates during Sunderland's 3-0 win against Newcastle at St James' Park last season . Pardew's players look dejected during the heavy 3-0 defeat in February . Fabio Borini (31) celebrates his St James' Park strike against Pardew's side . If memory of that trip to Wembley 14 years ago has faded, then Newcastle supporters only have to look to Sunderland for reminder of what joy such journeys can bring. They were beaten in last year’s League Cup final but, for the 40,000 who descended on London, that weekend still ranks as their best of the season, perhaps their best of recent times. It is no coincidence that their DVD season review recorded the third highest sales in the country. Newcastle fans want that – and that is why they rank the game at White Hart Lane as the most important of the coming days. Pardew, you feel, senses as much. He would never answer the poser which is dominating discussion in these parts. But this is a manager who has lost three successive derbies and survived. That, for now, will not be forgotten. Win a trophy, however, and it may well be forgiven.","Newcastle face Spurs on Wednesday for place in League Cup semi-final .

It was a far cry for Arsenal's young stars, who last week enjoyed a win over Galatasaray with the first team . But things could hardly have gone worse for the young Gunners, as they conceded in the first five minutes, Tom Walker finishing nicely after being set through by a chipped through ball. Arsenal hit back through O'Connor who headed in an Akpom cross as the back post after 19 minutes. But despite dominating the possession, and having two goals disallowed for offside, the Gunners couldn't find a winner, and were punished by two late Bolton goals. Kaiyne Woolery took advantage of a mistake by the home goalkeeper Matt Macey with three minutes to go, and with Arsenal pushing for an equaliser, Woolery grabbed a second in stoppage time to round off the win.","Bolton take early lead through Tom Walker after just five minutes .

At 22 inches tall, Acer is perfect house pet size, and barely as big as his best friend, his owner’s black labrador, Demon. As a result he enjoys all the comforts of home. Acer, now aged three, was born with dwarfism, caused by a recessive gene which only affects a foal when it is carried by both of the parents. Scroll down for video . Standing tall: Little Acer stands next to a normal-sized horse in the field next to the Miniature Horse Farm . Run of the house: The horse's small size means that he makes the perfect house pet for owner Maureen . Best friends: Owner Maureen O'Sullivan with Acer and Demon the labrador - who is inches taller than the horse . Most dwarfism foals are put down because of health problems but his owner, Maureen O’Sullivan, who runs the Miniature Horse Farm in Corringham, Essex, couldn’t bear to part with him. She said: ‘We imported his dad from America and put him with our American mare and they must both have been carrying the dwarf gene – he was the result. ‘Due to dwarves having various health issues most breeders would have put him down, but little Acer was so full of life and otherwise healthy, it was never an option. ‘One day we were in the living room and he just wandered in, we were really surprised. My little pony: Maureen with Acer, who she couldn't bear to put down - despite his potential health problems . Walkies! Thanks to his size, Maureen can simply take Acer for a walk on his lead in the nearby fields . Horse power: The horse, believed to be Britain's smallest, can even fit into the family car for a run out . Stable of pals: Acer sniffs at a treat with his best friend, Demon the black labrador in Maureen's kitchen . ‘When he comes in he loves to watch the television, he just stands there staring at it. He likes to walk around and sniff everything so now we let him come and go when he wants.’ Although he is more than welcome to wander around the house, Acer does have his own traditional stable at the farm. But it does cater for his size with the tiniest of stable doors so he can see out onto the yard. Miss O’Sullivan said: ‘We had the door specially made for him so he can put his head over and see all the other horses.’ Pampered: Though Acer has the run of the house, he also has his own traditional stable at the farm . Cuddles: Acer gets close to Maureen as she takes him for a spin on the back of a golf buggy around the farm . Wait for me!

"The model who stripped naked in a corporate box at Saturday's AFL Grand Final has broken her silence and revealed her raunchy antics that shocked fans was a bet. Heather McCartney, a 26-year-old Scottish model caused a social media storm when she took off her clothes and danced in front of thousands of supporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as Hawthorn were beating the Sydney Swans. After receiving complaints, police arrived to arrest her - but she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her. Scroll down for video . Tom Steinfort tweeted a photo of Heather McCartney, naked in a corporate box at the MCG, captioning the snap: 'Celebrating your team winning the grand final by getting nude in a corporate box... priceless' Heather McCartney (left) donning a Hawthorn scarf before she danced naked in full view (right) of strangers during the game's final quarter at AFL Grand Final . The Gold Coast woman spent the night in a police cell and was fined $300 for indecent manner. McCartney spoke out after her court appearance on Sunday - and revealed she stripped off for a bet. 'It was a bet. I said if Hawthorn win, I’m getting naked. They won, and I got naked,' she told the Herald Sun. Ms McCartney said she stripped on a bet: 'What a f---ing day, it was great' 'What a f---ing day, it was great.' McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning. She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.' One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'. Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG,who have launched an investigation. MCC spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances, and appropriate action would be taken. 'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said. An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke told the Herald Sun he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL. 'It’s a disgrace. It’s the people’s game and it’s for families,' he said. The model appeared at a Melbourne court after a night in police custody . 'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.' The model was forced to the ground and cuffed in an unknown state of undress. During her arrest, she reportedly yelled ‘f*** off, I don’t have to tell you anything, you f**ing r****d,’ before hitting an officer in the face, the Sun Herald also claims. Images of McCartney cavorting naked in the MCG corporate box have gone viral on social media, with disbelieving onlookers snapped in the background. She was released from Melbourne Remand Centre after a night in custody and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday. McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time. The court was told that McCartney was dared to strip naked if Hawthorn won the Grand Final against Swans . McCartney has gained a significant number of followers on her official Facebook fan page 'Miss Lady Darling' after Saturday night's explicit stunt. One Facebook user named Kevin Richardson commented: 'How was your night in the slammer Heather??' Scott Evan said: 'Awesome show yesterday!' Michael Coyte said: 'well done darling' William Divic said: 'Damn didn't recognize you with clothes on' Heather McCartney, a 26-year-old Scottish model is currently living on the Gold Coast . The court was told that she accepted an invitation to attend the corporate box and dared to strip if Hawthorn won. The Hawks (21.11.137) easily claimed the cup over the Sydney Swans (11.8.74). However, there are claims that Ms McCartney was hired to strip, according to Herald Sun. McCartney's lawyer told the court 'she didn’t understand at the time it could lead to police involvement'. The court also heard that alcohol and strong medication for aplastic anaemia had made her unable to control her actions. Magistrate Alan Spillane described her conduct as 'pretty nasty offending.' 'The part I think is really worrying is basically you were biting and hitting out at people who were out trying to do their job.' At 6.15pm police received reports of a naked woman in a corporate box. McCartney pleaded guilty to several charges including an act in an indecent manner. She was released from Melbourne Remand Centre after a night in custody and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday .","The model who stripped naked in a corporate box has spoken out and revealed it was a bet .

"There was an hour of daylight left in the Omani desert when we hopped into the Land Cruiser. Our guide, Zubair, revved the engine — in another life he might have been a rally driver — and off we set. 'Dune bashing!' cried Zubair, encouraged by squawks of delight from our youngest daughter, aged ten. Oman's Wahiba Sands are classic desert terrain — the sort you get in a David Lean film or one of those 'parched man crawls towards oasis' newspaper cartoons. Hillocks of sand stretched to the horizon. Dune bashing in Oman's Wahiba Sands was a particular highlight of Quentin Letts' holiday . Guides take guests out into the desert in 4X4 Land Cruisers and speed through the expansive sand dunes . What was most striking was the colours, at once uniform and subtly different. The sand was all yellow, of course, but there were valleys of brown and black, too, lengthening as the golden sun dropped. Zubair drove with gusto. We surged over and through the dunes. It was like skiing. 'Snowplough!' I yelled when we seemed to be going down far too steep an incline and the car, thrillingly, was skidding sideways, throwing out a high spray of sand. Our children cackled with laughter. Zubair grinned broadly. My wife screamed. The moment we stepped out of the 4x4, there came a contrast: complete, refreshing silence as we sat on the dune tops and watched the sun set on this astonishing landscape. This was the reason I'd dug deep into the family savings and chosen Oman for a week's holiday over New Year. It lived up to every expectation. The Sultanate of Oman, long an ally of Britain, lies east of Saudi Arabia. To its south is troubled Yemen. British Airways flights from Heathrow take seven hours to reach the Omani capital Muscat. Quentin Letts and his family spent a night on the country's tallest mountain, 9,800ft Jebel Shams, which has a not-so-mini 'Grand Canyon' FOR the first four days, we had the company of speedmerchant Zubair. He took us to the fortified town of Nizwa, where a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market is held on Fridays. The nut sellers in the souk had copped on to the idea of overcharging Western tourists — when my wife asked for a small bag of cashews, she was charged the Omani rial equivalent of £3. 'You should have haggled,' I said. She told me she would have felt mean. 'They expect and enjoy haggling,' insisted Zubair. Nizwa has a restored fort that could have been the setting for Carry On Up The Khyber. I was half expecting to find Kenneth Williams round the next turret. The fortified town of Nizwa, home to 'a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market' held every Friday . Even better than Nizwa's fort was the one at Jabrin, where a 17th-century sultan reclined with dates, concubines and political worries. His reception room had hidey holes from which his henchmen could pounce to slay visitors. And his fortifications had gizmos worthy of James Bond: false steps on stairs down where attackers might plunge to their deaths, and 'killing holes' through which boiling-hot date syrup could be poured. The beautiful Sun And Moon room, meanwhile, was cleverly designed to keep the ruler cool by day and silver-lit by night. Arid Oman's mountains are a purpling grey, and water is precious. Where the irrigation projects have not yet reached, you see blue water lorries labouring up roads. Government infrastructure work is everywhere. The village of Misfat, perched on a hill with banana trees and palms, is situated near to Jebel Shams, Oman's highest mountain . Since 1970, the country has been wrenched from medieval times into the 21st century, yet its people remain gracious and attractively modest. Although Western tourists are welcomed, women are urged to dress discreetly in the streets (no short skirts, low-cut tops or bare shoulders). Nor would you ever go to Oman for a Western stag night — alcohol is not plentiful. We spent a night on the country's tallest mountain, 9,800ft Jebel Shams, which has a not-so-mini 'Grand Canyon'. Our accommodation at the View Camp was odd — freezing cold, prefab huts with mod-con bathrooms worthy of a London hotel. But true to its name, it had a fine view of the plain below. The nearby village of Misfat was a delight, an oasis perched on a hill with banana trees and palms. My wife was so enchanted by one deep-gorge wadi we visited that she has kept drawing pictures of it since we got home. In the desert, we stayed at another camp where the sleeping quarters were Bedouin-style tents, and evening entertainment was provided by a discordant band of bongo drummers and overweight dancing ladies. Quentin explains that market traders in the souks of Nizwa have copped on to the idea of overcharging Western tourists, charging the Omani rate of £3 for a bag of nuts . The opulent Al Waha Hotel at Shangri-La's Barr Al Jissah Resort and Spa, Sultanate of Oman . For supper, the staff produced a side of spiced lamb that had been cooking for 24 hours. Gosh, it was cold that night. But our children found it all fascinating — and they even got to grips with a few hesitant words of Arabic. The least interesting part of the trip was when we returned towards Muscat and had a few nights at the opulent (but pricey) Al Waha Hotel. Great pools, comfortable rooms, but we could have been in Western Europe, complete with a clientele of bored white bankers and their pouting girlfriends. We did manage to escape into the city, however, and visit the souk, with its goodly whiff of frankincense, the fish market (rather different smells there) and the Grand Mosque, which was completed in 2001. The chandelier in the mosque's main chamber has more than 1,000 bulbs — just think of the electricity bills! The mosque complex, which can accommodate 20,000 worshippers, is a monument to cultural and national selfconfidence in a country blessed with rich natural resources and a lingering Arabian mystique. ABERCROMBIE & Kent (01242 854 133, abercrombiekent.co.uk) offers eight nights in Oman from £1,675per adult, based on two sharing. Children under 12 are an additional £1,025pp based on two sharing, including return flights with British Airways.","Guides offer high-speed trips across Omani desert in 4X4 Land Cruisers .

"Two police staff could face charges over the treatment of Bijan Ebrahimi (pictured) who was murdered by a vigilante who branded him a paedophile . Two civilian police staff could face charges over the treatment of a disabled man murdered by a vigilante who branded him a paedophile. Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, repeatedly contacted Avon and Somerset Police complaining that he was the victim of anti-social behaviour and was being targeted by his neighbours in Bristol. Mr Ebrahimi begged officers to help, telling them he did not feel safe in his home, hours before he was beaten to death and his body set on fire by neighbour Lee James in July last year. James, of  Brislington, Bristol pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years. Stephen Norley, who lived next door to James, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender after obtaining white spirit and helping to drag Mr Ebrahimi's body to where it was set alight. He was jailed for four years. A post-mortem examination found Mr Ebrahimi suffered 'multiple heavy blows to the face and head' and died before he was set alight. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has now sent a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service in relation to a call handler and a dispatch supervisor for Avon and Somerset Police. The CPS must decide whether criminal charges should be brought on the basis of the evidence the IPCC has uncovered. The IPCC said it had completed its investigation into police treatment of Mr Ebrahimi in the days before his death. In July the watchdog passed a file of evidence to prosecutors concerning three constables and a community support officer. In total the IPCC has investigated five constables, three sergeants, two inspectors, one community support officer, five call handlers and two control room dispatch staff. IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'As part of this inquiry, our investigators criminally interviewed six Avon and Somerset Police officers and staff and I decided that files for all these individuals should go to the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether they should face criminal charges. 'In total, 18 police officers and staff members who had some involvement in the force's dealings with Mr Ebrahimi in the days leading up to his brutal murder have been investigated. Scroll down for video . Lee James, pictured left, pleaded guilty to the murder of Bijan Ebrahim while Stephen Norley, pictured right, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender . 'I have provided the acting chief constable with a report detailing our findings as to whether or not those individuals have a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct and should face disciplinary proceedings. 'Until the conclusion of potential criminal matters, it would not be appropriate to release further detail.' The watchdog said it was also looking at historic police contact with Mr Ebrahimi dating back six years before his death. Acting chief constable John Long said: 'The murder of Bijan Ebrahimi was a needless and dreadful tragedy. 'We believed from an early stage that we failed in our duty to protect him, and the report confirms that. 'My thoughts and feelings at this moment are with the family and friends of Mr Ebrahimi. I am deeply sorry that we did not do enough to prevent his death. Wrongly accused: Mr Ebrahimi was attacked outside this building where he lived in Bristol . 'I am grateful for the thoroughness of the IPCC report. My intention now is to address the matters of misconduct, the service failure that took place and the lessons to be learnt in a prompt, firm and direct manner. 'Whilst the pain of the family can never be diminished, we will act as quickly as we can to do what we must do. 'Until the CPS have made their decisions and the disciplinary processes reach a conclusion, we cannot comment further on the detail of the IPCC report, but I want to reassure the communities of Avon and Somerset that we are treating the findings with utmost seriousness and will continue to improve the way we work to protect the public and keep them safe.'","Two civilian police staff could face charges over treatment of disabled man .

"Residents of one of the Philippines' worst slums - where families live atop graves and children play among human remains - are preparing for the annual Filipino day of the dead. All Souls' Day in the Philippines, known as Araw ng mga Patay, and All Saints' Day are the two most important days in the Filipino calender.

Many people live in the cemetery - it is one of the country's worst slums . Families tend to light candles and clean crypts ahead of All Saints' Day celebrations on October 31. As the largest Catholic nation in Asia, All Souls' Day allows Filipinos to visit family crypts for overnight and weekend vigils. Offices and schools close and the usually silent graveyards are transformed into parties with food and music. The celebration corresponds with that of All Saints' Day - which is a chance for Roman Catholics to worship the Saints who do not hold their own feast day. Thousands of policeman are set to be deployed to cemeteries across the country to help manage the influx of visitors. One such cemetery will be Navotas Municipal Cemetery in north-west Manila. Here, crippling poverty means many people live in the cemetery on top of the rows of stacked graves, while children play barefoot through the cemetery's muddy roads amid human remains.

"There is something about black and white photography that can instantly transport you back in time. Their subjects often appear shrouded in mystery, with grey shading making them appear part of a shadowy world very different to the one we live in today. Now a group of artists have begun drawing the dark veil back from these figures, to bring them out of the murky past and into vivid reality. Digital artists are reviving the lost art of photo colourisation, which has been around for more than 175 years. Pictured is 'The March on Washington' that took place on 28 August 1963 in Washington D.C. as part of  civil rights movement. Here Martin Luther King gave his famous 'I have a Dream' speech . The artists, many of which have become popular on Reddit threads, are reviving the lost art of photo colourisation, which has been around for more than 175 years. 'Many people don't know that colour photography dates as far back as the craft of photography itself,' said Mads Madsen a student from Denmark, who runs the popular Colourised History subreddit. 'We're not trained to recognise objects in black and white, but seeing these images in colour completely negates that and we're suddenly able to connect with that photograph. 'We feel as if we're there with those people, experiencing it.' From the moment the first photo was taken by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826, photographers began experimenting with ways to try and bring true-to-life colour into the frame. Pictured is Audrey Hepburn with her pet deer, 1959. This image was a time-consuming colourisation as the accuracy of the shelved products required considerable research . 'Flippin' Burgers.' October 1938, Crowley, Louisiana, USA by Russell Lee. 'We feel as if we're there with those people, experiencing it,' said Mads Madsen a student, who runs the Colourised History subreddit . It was in 1839 that the world's first publically announced photographic process, the daguerreotype, began coming into widespread use, according to Italy-based printing firm, Pixartprinting. Then, in 1861, the first colour photo made its debut by James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish mathematical physicist, when he snapped a photo of a tartan ribbon. Meanwhile, in Japan a photographer named Yokoyama Matsusaburō used his training as a painter and lithographer to create shashin abura-e or 'photographic oil paintings'. The process involved cut cutting away the paper support of the photo and applying pigment to the emulsion with a drying oil, claims Pixatrprinting. Today, while oil paintings, dyes and watercolours are still used to bring black and white images to life, technology allow more accurate ways of recapturing colour. It was in 1839 that the world's first publically announced photographic process, the daguerreotype, began coming into widespread use, according to Italy-based printing firm, Pixartprinting. Pictured is colourised image of actor James Dean . Originally photographed by Vivian Maier, a street photographer who is known for her candid shots of New York life throughout the 1940s and 1950s . 'Most of us use Photoshop - I use CS6 with a Wacom Bamboo tablet. That being said, there are many examples of people using Gimp, or Paint.net - whatever you use, it's all about the technique, rather than the program,' said artist Mads Madsen. 'I liken colourisation to the game of Chess. Simple to pick up but extremely difficult to master and I have a very long way to go,' added artist Jordan Lloyd when speaking with Pixartprinting. 'The basic formula in its variations is straightforward: just keep adding layers of colour onto the black and white image, and mask it off 'between the lines'. That's it. The more colour variation you add, the more 'real' the final image is perceived to a point (then you're hitting diminishing returns).' 'Most of us use Photoshop,' said Mr Madsen told the printing firm, who carried out extensive interviews with the artists. 'I use CS6 with a Wacom Bamboo tablet. That being said, there are many examples of people using Gimp, or Paint.net - whatever you use, it's all about the technique, rather than the program.' The artists use the software to add layers of colour onto the black and white image, and blend the colours between the lines. But part of it is guesswork. 'You make educated guesses much of the time, but those guesses are informed by a laborious level of research into the visual and historical context of the photograph,' said Jordan Lloyd is a colour restoration expert who works for Dynamichrome.

Not everyone is convinced that colourising the history is a worthwhile endeavour. Despite the historical research put in, some claim it's an insult to history as artists can never really know the true colour photographed. Despite the dissenters, many artists claim they've also received positive feedback from those who are able to appreciate the photos in a new and personal way. 'People are enamoured with well colourised image because it makes an abstract concept, 'the bygone era in black and white', and renders it into a concept we all understand: well defined colour,' said Wayne Degan who blogs at Metacolor.org. 'I've heard my own work described as a 'visceral experience' or 'relatable'.

"Prehistoric cave paintings, canyon art and structures such as Stonehenge may have been inspired by 'spooky sounds', a scientist has claimed. Dr Steven Waller thinks that sound waves reflecting off a cliff face or cave wall produced echoes that may have been interpreted by our ancestors as voices calling within the rock. He used acoustic measurements so show the link between prehistoric rock sites and strong echoes. Spirited painting? Prehistoric cave paintings, canyon art and structures such as Stonehenge may have been inspired by spooky sounds, a scientist has claimed. A prehistoric cave painting in India is pictured . Dr Waller, who is based in La Mesa, California, has studied acoustic archaeology around the world and says that echoes of clapping could sound similar to hoof beats or a herd of stampeding animals. ‘Many ancient cultures attributed thunder in the sky to “hoofed thunder gods,” so it makes sense that the reverberation within the caves was interpreted as thunder and inspired paintings of those same hoofed thunder gods on cave walls,’ he said. ‘This theory is supported by acoustic measurements, which show statistically significant correspondence between the rock art sites and locations with the strongest sound reflection.’ Rock music: Dr Waller said that Stonehenge (pictured)  may be linked to the haunting effects of sound interference patterns. He believes this may have influenced the positioning of the Stonehenge rock slabs . Dr Steven Waller thinks that sound waves reflecting off a cliff face or cave wall produced echoes which could have been interpreted as voices calling within the rock, by our ancestors. These noises may have inspired them to paint and lay out stones in a certain way. He says that echoes of clapping could sound similar to hoof beats or a herd of stampeding animals. Because some ancient cultures attributed thunder to 'hoofed gods' he thinks the reverberation within caves was interpreted as these gods and inspired ancient man to paint images of hooved animals on the walls. Dr Waller thinks that Stonehenge and other megalithic sites may be linked to the haunting effects of sound interference patterns. Speaking at the Acoustical Society of America's annual meeting in Indianapolis, Dr Waller said that Stonehenge and other megalithic sites may be linked to the haunting effects of sound interference patterns. He believes this may have influenced the positioning of the Stonehenge rock slabs. To test his theory, he played the same droning note on two flutes in an open field. ‘The quiet regions of destructive sound wave cancellation, in which the high pressure from one flute cancelled the low pressure from the other flute, gave blindfolded subjects the illusion of a giant ring of rocks or “pillars” casting acoustic shadows,’ he said. ‘My theory that musical interference patterns served as blueprints for megalithic stone circles - many of which are called Pipers' Stones - is supported by ancient legends of two magic pipers who enticed maidens to dance in a circle and turned them all into stones.’ He explained that even today, sounds can be used to manipulate a person’s perception of the world around them and lead to illusions inconsistent with scientific reality. Dr Waller thinks this phenomenon has interesting practical applications for virtual reality and special effects in entertainment media. ‘Sound, which is invisible and has complex properties, can easily lead to auditory illusions of the supernatural,’ he said. ‘This, in turn, leads to the more general question: what other illusions are we living under due to other phenomena that we are currently misinterpreting?’ Dr Waller has studied acoustic archaeology around the world and says that echoes of clapping could sound similar to hoof beats or a herd of stampeding animals. A painting of bull-like creatures in Lascaux Cave, France is pictured. The cave contains some of the best-known Upper Paleolithic art, painted 17,300 years ago . The stones at Stonehenge could have been ‘played’ like a giant xylophone, a study claimed in March. Researchers spent months tapping pieces of stone onto 1,000 types of rock and recording the sound they made. Most produced a muted ‘thud’, but bluestones from the Preseli hills in south Wales – where the monoliths are thought to have originated – ‘sing’ when struck. Their ‘exceptional sonic nature’ may explain why Neolithic man carted the stones 200 miles to Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire more than 4,000 years ago to build Stonehenge. It may also shed light on their circle formation, with sound resonating among the stones when they were ‘played’. Rock music: The stones at Stonehenge could have been ‘played’ like a giant xylophone, a study claimed in March. Researchers spent months tapping pieces of stone onto 1,000 types of rock and recording the sound they made . The startling conclusion was the result of a study by experts at the Royal College of Art rather than by archaeologists. They were even granted access to Stonehenge itself to play the structures like a giant xylophone, where they confirmed the rocks made a range of metallic sounds like bells, gongs and tin drums. Paul Devereux, who led the study with Jon Wozencroftfrom, said: The one thing that hasn’t been considered until now is that sound may have been an important factor. 'We found it was a noteworthy soundscape, with a significant percentage of the actual rocks making metallic sounds like bells, gongs, tin drums, etc, when tapped with small, handheld ""hammerstones"". 'We have had percussionists up here who have been able to actually get proper tunes out of the rocks. This is real rock music.' The research team tested rocks from 1,000 different locations from around the UK to test their sonic abilities. They found that bluestones from the Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire, sounded like no other. English Heritage allowed the team to acoustically test the bluestones at Stonehenge, effectively playing them like a huge instrument. To the researchers’ surprise, several were found to make distinctive, if muted sounds, with several of the rocks showing evidence of having already been struck. The stones make different pitched noises in different places and different stones make different noises - ranging from a metallic to a wooden sound.","Dr Steven Waller thinks that sound waves bouncing off cave walls produced echoes which could have been interpreted as voices by our ancestors .
He thinks reverberation was also interpreted as thunder and inspired paintings of 'hooved thunder gods' such as ancient animals .

"Speaking out: Niall Ferguson described the First World War as 'the biggest error in modern history' The political row over the First World War has intensified after one of Britain's best-known historians declared that the conflict was 'the biggest error in modern history'. Harvard professor Niall Ferguson argues that Britain should never have entered the war against Germany, saying that 'the cost was catastrophic' and it was not worth the millions of lives lost. He is the latest historian to weigh in on the origins of the war after Michael Gove took aim at 'Left-wing academics' who have perpetuated a view of the conflict as an unmitigated disaster. The Education Secretary blamed experts for the picture of the First World War put forward in popular culture such as Blackadder, which focuses on the casualties of battle and the blunders made by aristocratic officers. He faced a backlash from some eminent historians, as well as his Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt - but Mr Ferguson is the first figure from the Right to speak out against his views. In an interview with BBC History magazine, the Scottish professor and author said: 'Britain could indeed have lived with a German victory. What's more, it would have been in Britain's interests to stay out in 1914.' Mr Gove wrote in the Mail that the First World War was a 'just war', essential for 'defending the western liberal order' by constraining the imperial ambitions of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Carnage: Soldiers carrying a stretcher on the front line in Flanders during the First World War . But Mr Ferguson, 49 - who is presenting a BBC2 series based on his 1998 book The Pity of War - disputed this judgement, saying that sending millions of troops to the continent was unnecessary to defend Britain's interests. 'Britain could indeed have lived with a German victory,' he said. 'What's more, it would have been in Britain's interests to stay out in 1914. 'A better strategy would have been to wait and deal with the German challenge later, when Britain could respond on its own terms.' 'Even if Germany had defeated France and Russia, it would have had a pretty massive challenge on its hands trying to run the new German-dominated Europe and would have remained significantly weaker than the British Empire in naval and financial terms.' Under fire: Education Secretary Michael Gove is embroiled in a political row about the war's origins . It . was on the 28 July 1914 that artillery units of Austria-Hungary began . to rain down shells on Belgrade, the Serbian capital - the very first . shots of the First World War. That . attack was to start a chain reaction that, within weeks, embroiled all . of the world's great powers into a global war which mobilised more than . 70million military personnel. The Great War - as it was soon to be known . - was the first military conflict to be fought on an industrial scale. But . the technological advances that led to increases in the lethality of . weapons were not matched by changes in strategy, with both sides . resorting to practically suicidal human wave attacks. Although . much of the warfare took place in Europe, battle was soon joined across . the planet via the colonies of the European imperial powers. By . 1918, the powers of Central Europe were exhausted by fighting. A final . last-ditch offensive along the Western Front by Germany was successfully . repelled and, as U.S. forces began to enter the trenches, the Allies . staged a series of successful advances, forcing the enemy to surrender on November 11. Mr Ferguson - who is Tisch Professor . of History at Harvard and a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford - continued: . 'The cost of the First World War to Britain was catastrophic, and it . left the British empire at the end of it all in a much weakened state. 'Arguments . about honour, of course, resonate today, as they resonated in 1914 but . you can pay too high a price for upholding that notion of honour, and I . think in the end Britain did.' Some have argued that Britain had a moral obligation to join the war because of its treaty with Belgium, which was invaded by Germany, but the historian dismissed this idea. 'Realism in foreign policy has a long and distinguished tradition, not least in Britain - otherwise the French would never complain about ""perfidious Albion"",' he said. 'For Britain it would ultimately have been far better to have thought in terms of the national interest rather than in terms of a dated treaty.' Mr Ferguson concluded: 'We should not think of this as some great victory or dreadful crime, but more as the biggest error in modern history.' He has previously been seen as an ally of Mr Gove, having advised the minister on the new history syllabus and spoken out in support of his educational reforms. But his intervention in the First World War debate puts him on the side of figures such as Cambridge professor Sir Richard J. Evans, who described the Education Secretary as 'a donkey who pretends to be a lion' and accused him of historical ignorance. After Mr Ferguson's interview was released, other historians stuck up for Mr Gove's point of view and insisted that the war was justified. Gary Sheffield, professor of war studies at the University of Wolverhampton, wrote on Twitter: 'Contrary to Niall Ferguson's views, for Britain to have stayed out of First World War would have disastrous for Britain and Europe.'","Harvard's Niall Ferguson says the cost of WWI was 'catastrophic'

"Nasa has spotted the ghostly glow of ancient galaxies that were ripped apart by gravity. The event happened four billion light-years away inside an immense collection of 500 other galaxies. And the remarkable data suggests as many as six such structures were torn up over a period of six billion years. Scientists at Nasa in California have spotted evidence of galaxy destruction in massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744, seen here. Total starlight from the cluster has been coloured blue, with the dispersed light shown in dark blue. The light comes from 'dead' galaxies town apart at the centre of this cluster . The finding was made by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, nicknamed Pandora's Cluster. It found that scattered stars from the event were no longer bound to any one galaxy, and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster. By observing the light from the orphaned stars, Hubble astronomers assembled forensic evidence that suggests as many as six galaxies were torn to pieces inside the cluster. The doomed galaxies would have been pulled apart like 'taffy' according to Nasa if they plunged through the centre of the galaxy cluster where gravitational tidal forces are strongest. Hubble spotted light that came from 'dead' galaxies. The galaxies were torn apart long ago by the cluster's gravitational forces, and their stars were scattered into 'intracluster' space - the space between the galaxies. These orphaned stars roam the cluster, without being gravitationally tethered to any single galaxy. Because these extremely faint stars are brightest at near-infrared wavelengths of light, this type of observation could only be accomplished with Hubble's infrared sensitivity to extraordinarily dim light . The intracluster light was detected as part of the Frontier Fields program, an ambitious three-year effort, begun in 2013, that teams Hubble with NASA's other Great Observatories - the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory - to probe the early universe by studying large galaxy clusters. Astronomers have long hypothesised that the light from scattered stars should be detectable after such galaxies are disassembled. However, the predicted glow of stars inside such a cluster was very faint and was therefore a challenge to identify. 'The Hubble data revealing the ghost light are important steps forward in understanding the evolution of galaxy clusters,' said Dr Ignacio Trujillo of The Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain. 'It is also amazingly beautiful in that we found the telltale glow by utilizing Hubble's unique capabilities.' The team estimates that the combined light of about 200 billion outcast stars contributes approximately 10 per cent of the cluster's brightness. 'The results are in good agreement with what has been predicted to happen inside massive galaxy clusters,' said Dr Mireia Montes of the IAC, lead author of the paper published the Astrophysical Journal. Hubble measurements determined that the phantom stars are rich in heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. This means the scattered stars must be second or third-generation stars enriched with the elements forged in the hearts of the universe's first-generation stars. The finding was made by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope (shown) in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, nicknamed Pandora's Cluster. It found that scattered stars from the event were no longer bound to any one galaxy, and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster . Weighing more than four trillion solar masses, Abell 2744 is a target in the Frontier Fields program. This ambitious three-year effort teams Hubble and Nasa's other Great Observatories to look at select massive galaxy clusters to help astronomers probe the remote universe. Earlier this month Abell 2744 was used to spotted one of the faintest and most distant galaxies ever seen in the universe. Galaxy clusters like this one are so massive that their gravity deflects light passing through them, magnifying, brightening, and distorting light in a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Astronomers exploit this property of space to use the clusters as a zoom lens to magnify the images of far-more-distant galaxies that otherwise would be too faint to be seen.","Scientists at Nasa in California have spotted evidence of galaxy destruction .

"Unwell: Brooke Todd, 17 months, pictured in hospital in Spain after falling severely ill while on holiday . A family have been offered £130 from a holiday company as a ‘goodwill gesture’ after their toddler ended up in hospital on a trip to Spain. James Todd and Helen Ball, of Walker, Newcastle, said they complained to staff about poor hygiene standards at the all-inclusive Grupotel Mar de Menorca, which they claim led to Brooke Todd falling severely ill. The 17-month-old was ‘frightened and screaming’ as she was placed on three separate drips as doctors tried to treat her for diarrhoea and vomiting. Her parents allege they had informed a Thomson Holidays rep about the standard of food at the Cala Canutells, Menorca, resort. They claim the hotel staff used the same utensils on cooked and uncooked meat. Mr Todd said he had complained from the very first day but nothing was done until after Brooke became ill. He said: ‘The food was not cooked properly and I was constantly complaining to the rep. ‘The chefs were using the same utensils on raw meat and then moving the cooked meat about and serving it to customers. ‘The holiday went from bad to disastrous when Helen woke up just before midnight and found Brooke face down choking in her cot. ‘We were up all night with diarrhoea and vomiting and took her to hospital the following morning. ‘She was taken into a room and doctors tried several times to find a vein. ‘She was frightened and screaming and did not know what was going on. ‘After what seemed a lifetime in hospital and being on three different drip bags our little girl was allowed to leave but we were told to see her own doctor when we got home.' Mr Todd said chefs at the hotel later used different utensils and special gloves for handling raw meat but the damage had been done. James Todd, pictured at his home in Newcastle with Brooke, is seeking compensation over the 'nightmare' trip . Popular: The family were staying in Cala Canutells, Menorca, pictured, when their daughter fell ill . He said: ‘We were really stressed and traumatised by our holiday from hell experience. ‘Helen is constantly worrying if Brooke is going to choke in the night again.

"Engineers have revealed that the size of pterosaurs such as the pterodactyl (pictured) was limited by their ability to get airborne . Think of a pterodactyl and you may imagine a fierce flying predator soaring over volcanoes and prehistoric palms. But the reality for some larger creatures may have been less successful. Engineers have revealed that the size of pterosaurs was limited by their ability to get airborne, because if they grew too large and heavy, they would not have had the strength to take off and would likely have been eaten by other predators. The discovery of large numbers of fossil species indicates that pterosaurs were initially highly successful, but creatures with a wingspan of over 39 ft (12 metres) may have had trouble taking off, according to researchers. The flying reptiles lived from the late Triassic to the early Cretaceaous period between 228 million and 66 million years ago. With wingspans of around 32ft (10 metres) the largest species may have weighed as much as a quarter of a ton. They were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight. A transatlantic team of experts used 3D imaging of fossils to create a computer model of a pterosaur with a 19 ft (6 metre) wingspan. This model was then scaled up to create enlarged models with 29 ft (9 metre) and 39 ft (12 metre) wingspans. They were used to estimate the wing strength, flexibility, flying speed and power required for flight in massive pterosaurs to see if textbook images of enormous beasts soaring through the skies were scientifically possible. The results showed that even the largest pterosaur would have been able to sustain flight by using air currents to glide. It would also have been able to slow down sufficiently to make a safe landing because its wings were formed from a flexible membrane. With wingspans of around 32ft (10 metres) the largest species may have weighed as much as a quarter of a ton. They were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight. This illustration shows how large the animals were, compared to a giraffe and human . Pterodactyls used both their arms and legs to push themselves off the ground during take-off, in a manoeuvre known as the 'quadrupedal launch'. They were almost as tall as a giraffe with wing spans of around 32ft (10 metres). Using a computer model, engineers worked out that creatures with a wing span of 39 ft (12 metres or above) would not be able to take off. They showed that even the largest pterosaur would have been able to sustain flight by using air currents to glide. It would also have been able to slow down sufficiently to make a safe landing because its wings were formed from a flexible membrane. But taking off was all but impossible because large reptiles weighing almost half a tonne would not have had the push-off force required to get the model off the ground. Take-off, on the other hand, proved an entirely greater challenge in the computer experiments. Unlike modern birds, pterosaur anatomy suggests that they used both their arms and legs to push themselves off the ground during take-off, in a manoeuvre known as the 'quadrupedal launch'. However, the results suggest that larger-than-usual specimens, weighing towards half a ton, would have struggled to get off the ground. Once wingspans approached 39ft (12 metres), the push-off force required to get the model off the ground was too great. Bristol University mechanical engineer Colin Palmer said: ‘Getting into the air ultimately limited pterosaur size. ‘Even with their unique four legged launch technique, the iron laws of physics eventually caught up with these all time giants of the cretaceous skies.’ The team will present their results at the upcoming Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Berlin. Mr Palmer, who has worked on sailing boats and windmills, said: ‘It has been fascinating to apply an engineering approach to understanding biological systems.’ California condors (pictured) can become too heavy to take off from the ground and have to find a ledge . Vultures have weak legs and feet along with bulky bodies. While this is no disadvantage in the air, it makes it difficult for the birds to get airborne from the ground. To overcome this problem, the heavy birds run downhill to pick up speed in order to launch, or jump off cliffs and high ledges to take off. Once they are airborne, their large wings enable them to glide and soar to spot prey. Vultures soar slowly and stably. They average 30 mph in flight and can get up to 40mph. They take about 16 seconds to complete a circle in soaring flight. When they spot a carcass, the large birds sometimes eat too much, which increases their weight further, meaning they can't take off. The California condor, for example, can survive up to two weeks without a meal. So when it feasts, it eats until it's full, storing up to three lbs of meat in a part of its oesophagus, not to mention its stomach. If it overdoes it, the bird makes itself sick to lighten the load and get airborne again. The flying reptiles lived from the late Triassic to the early Cretaceaous period between 228 million and 66 million years ago.

"Is is one of the great mysteries of our planet. Earth is known as the Blue Planet because of its oceans, which cover more than 70 percent of the planet's surface and are home to the world's greatest diversity of life. However, until now, we have not known how - or when - water arrived on Earth. Water on Earth came, not from a comet, but from meteorites - and arrived at the same time the planet's rock was forming, researchers have claimed. Researchers used meteorite samples provided by NASA from the asteroid 4-Vesta. The asteroid 4-Vesta, which formed in the same region of the solar system as Earth, has a surface of basaltic rock—frozen lava. These basaltic meteorites from 4-Vesta are known as eucrites and carry a unique signature of one of the oldest hydrogen reservoirs in the solar system. The measurements show that 4-Vesta contains the same hydrogen isotopic composition as carbonaceous chondrites, the most primitive known meteorites, which is also that of Earth. That, combined with nitrogen isotope data, points to carbonaceous chondrites as the most likely common source of water. Now researchers say they have a solution - water came, not from a comet, but from meteorites - and arrived at the same time the planet's rock was forming. 'The answer to one of the basic questions is that our oceans were always here,' said Adam Sarafian of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the lead author of the paper in the journal Science. While some hypothesized that water came late to Earth, well after the planet had formed, the new study significantly moves back the clock for the first evidence of water on Earth and in the inner solar system. 'One school of thought was that planets originally formed dry, due to the high-energy, high-impact process of planet formation, and that the water came later from sources such as comets or 'wet' asteroids, which are largely composed of ices and gases,' said Sarafian. 'With giant asteroids and meteors colliding, there's a lot of destruction,' said Horst Marschall, a geologist at WHOI and coauthor of the paper. 'Some people have argued that any water molecules that were present as the planets were forming would have evaporated or been blown off into space, and that surface water as it exists on our planet today, must have come much, much later—hundreds of millions of years later.' The study's authors turned to another potential source of Earth's water to solve the problem. The most primitive known meteorites, carbonaceous chondrites, were formed in the same swirl of dust, grit, ice and gasses that gave rise to the sun some 4.6 billion years ago, well before the planets were formed. 'These primitive meteorites resemble the bulk solar system composition,' said WHOI geologist and coauthor Sune Nielsen. 'They have quite a lot of water in them, and have been thought of before as candidates for the origin of Earth's water.' In this illustration of the early solar system, the dashed white line represents the snow line -- the transition from the hotter inner solar system, where water ice is not stable (brown) to the outer Solar system, where water ice is stable (blue). Two possible ways that the inner solar system received water are: water molecules sticking to dust grains inside the 'snow line' (as shown in the inset) and carbonaceous chondrite material flung into the inner solar system by the effect of gravity from protoJupiter. With either scenario, water must accrete to the inner planets within the first ca. 10 million years of solar system formation. In order to determine the source of water in planetary bodies, scientists measure the ratio between the two stable isotopes of hydrogen: deuterium and hydrogen. Different regions of the solar system are characterized by highly variable ratios of these isotopes. The study's authors knew the ratio for carbonaceous chondrites and reasoned that if they could compare that to an object that was known to crystallize while Earth was actively accreting then they could gauge when water appeared on Earth. To test this hypothesis, the research team, which also includes Francis McCubbin from the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico and Brian Monteleone of WHOI, utilized meteorite samples provided by NASA from the asteroid 4-Vesta. The asteroid 4-Vesta, which formed in the same region of the solar system as Earth, has a surface of basaltic rock—frozen lava. These basaltic meteorites from 4-Vesta are known as eucrites and carry a unique signature of one of the oldest hydrogen reservoirs in the solar system. Their age—approximately 14 million years after the solar system formed—makes them ideal for determining the source of water in the inner solar system at a time when Earth was in its main building phase. The researchers analyzed five different samples at the Northeast National Ion Microprobe Facility—a state-of-the-art national facility housed at WHOI that utilizes secondary ion mass spectrometers. This is the first time hydrogen isotopes have been measured in eucrite meteorites. The measurements show that 4-Vesta contains the same hydrogen isotopic composition as carbonaceous chondrites, which is also that of Earth. That, combined with nitrogen isotope data, points to carbonaceous chondrites as the most likely common source of water. 'The study shows that Earth's water most likely accreted at the same time as the rock. The planet formed as a wet planet with water on the surface,' Marschall said. While the findings don't preclude a late addition of water on Earth, it shows that it wasn't necessary since the right amount and composition of water was present at a very early stage. 'An implication of that is that life on our planet could have started to begin very early,' added Nielsen. 'Knowing that water came early to the inner solar system also means that the other inner planets could have been wet early and evolved life before they became the harsh environments they are today.'","Find could mean life began very early on Earth .

"Scientists have long been baffled by why animals took so long to thrive on Earth. Prehistoric creatures first began to prosper at the end of the Proterozoic period, around 800 million years ago, but for a billion years before that, only very basic forms of life developed. Geologists have put this ‘boring’ billion years down to poor air quality by discovering that oxygen levels were insufficient to support animals. Prehistoric creatures first began to prosper at the end of the Proterozoic period, about 800 million years ago because before that, oxygen levels were too low - 0.1 per cent of what they are today -  to support the rise of animals such as the comb jelly (pictured) a primitive jellyfish among the first complex creatures . International researchers led by a team at Yale University in New Haven, found that oxygen levels during the ‘boring’ period were only 0.1 per cent of what they are today. Noah Planavsky, Assistant Professor at Yale, explained that Earth’s atmosphere couldn’t have supported a diversity of creatures, no matter what genetic advancements were poised to occur. ‘There is no question that genetic and ecological innovation must ultimately be behind the rise of animals, but it is equally unavoidable that animals need a certain level of oxygen,’ he said. Professor Noah Planavsky of Yale University (pictured right) and Professor Chris Reinhard of Georgia Tech (left) were among experts who studied chromium isotopes in ancient sediments to study ancient oxygen levels . Research is ongoing to more accurately date when different stages of life appeared on Earth, which which a  over 4.5 billion years old. 3.8 billion years ago it's thought that first life arose in the form of simple cells . 2.1 billion years ago multicellular life began to evolve. 800 million to 600 million years ago the first animals appeared, including the first arthropods and later fish. 475 million years ago saw the birth of plants on land. 400 years ago, insects and seeds appeared. 360 million years ago amphibians began to evolve and 300 million years ago, reptiles, with dinosaurs following soon afterwards. 200 million years ago the first mammals appeared. 150 million years ago birds began to develop. 130 million years ago saw the birth of flowers. 60 million years ago, primates arrived on Earth. 2.5 million years ago the genus Homo (including humans and our predecessors) arrived, leading to the evolution of anatomically modern humans 200,000 years ago. ‘We’re providing the first evidence that oxygen levels were low enough during this period to potentially prevent the rise of animals.’ Together with Professor Chris Reinhard, he analysed chromium isotopes in ancient sediments from China, Australia, Canada, and the United States to examine ancient oxygen levels. Chromium is found in the Earth’s continental crust, and chromium oxidation is directly linked to the presence of free oxygen in the atmosphere, according to the study, published in the journal Science. They studied samples deposited in shallow, iron-rich ocean areas, near the shore and compared their data with other samples taken from younger locations known to have higher levels of oxygen. Scientists have long been baffled about oxygen’s role in controlling the first appearance of animals and Professor Planavsky believes that chromium has helped to solve the mystery. Previous estimates put oxygen levels at 40 per cent of today’s conditions during pre-animal times, suggesting that oxygen was already plentiful enough to support animal life. In the new study, the researchers acknowledged that oxygen levels were ‘highly dynamic’ in the early atmosphere, with the potential for occasional spikes. However, they say, ‘It seems clear that there is a first-order difference in the nature of Earth surface chromium cycling’ before and after the rise of animals. Co-author of the study, Tim Lyons of the University of California, Riverside said: ‘If we are right, our results will really change how people view the origins of animals and other complex life, and their relationships to the co-evolving environment. This could be a game-changer.’","Animals arrived 800 million years ago and scientists have only just proved that they could not have thrives before then because of oxygen levels .

"It is a stunning family portrait of the Earth and its moon. China's experimental spacecraft, currently flying around the moon before returning to Earth on Saturday, has captured these incredible images. The eight-day mission is seen as a test-run for the country's first unmanned return trip to the lunar surface, which will take place in 2017. Scroll down for video . China's experimental spacecraft, currently flying around the moon before returning to Earth, has captured these incredible images. The mission is intended to be a precursor to a mission to the lunar surface in 2017 . The module will be 257,000 miles (413,000 km) from Earth at its furthest point on the eight-day mission. The official Xinhua news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second (25,000 mph) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern China's Inner Mongolia region. It will return to Earth using a Soviet-designed method in which it will first bounce off Earth's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up. And if China successfully manages to bring samples back from the moon, they will be only the third nation to carry out such a mission after the US and Russia. The spacecraft lifted off from the southwestern Xichang satellite launch centre early this morning. It separated from its carrier rocket and entered Earth orbit shortly after, the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (Sastind) reported, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. 'The first stage of the first return journey test in China's moon probe programme has been successful,' Sastind said after the launch, from the Xichang space base in the southwestern province of Sichuan. The module will be 257,000 miles (413,000 km) from Earth at its furthest point on the eight-day mission. The official Xinhua news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second (25,000 mph) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern China's Inner Mongolia region. China's lunar exploration program, named Chang'e after a mythical goddess, has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes and last year landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard. China has also hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon at a future date if officials decide to combine the human spaceflight and lunar exploration programs. The craft also captured this amazing 'blue marble' image showing the Earth . An image of the lunar surface captured as the craft passed by . Xinhua said the latest mission is to 'obtain experimental data and validate re-entry technologies such as guidance, navigation and control, heat shield and trajectory design' for the future moonlander christened Chang'e 5. It will return to Earth using a Soviet-designed method in which it will first bounce off Earth's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up. China's military-backed space program is a source of massive national pride, especially its series of successful manned missions that have placed up to three astronauts at a time in an experimental orbiting space station called Tiangong 1. The Long March 3C rocket carrying an experimental moon orbiter launches from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan province, 24 October 2014. The spacecraft will fly around the moon and back to Earth as China's first return-trip of lunar orbiter. It sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third nation after Russia and the US to achieve manned space travel independently. China has powered ahead in a series of methodically timed steps, independent of the American programme, which is now in its sixth decade of putting people into space and has long-term plans to go to an asteroid and Mars. Alongside the manned program, China is developing the Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket needed to launch a more permanent space station to be called Tiangong 2. China's space programme has been picking up speed over the last decade. They have already sent a handful of astronauts into Earth orbit including Liu Yang, left, Jing Haipeng, right, and Liu Wang pictured here in June 2012 on their way to the launch pad . Last year China successfully landed and operated a rover on the moon called Jade Rabbit, shown. However, it ultimately succumbed to the bitterly cold lunar nights.

"Channel 4 is facing furious demands to axe a controversial drama that hijacks a real terrorist murder of a senior Tory MP for entertainment. The family of Airey Neave are fighting to ban the fictional thriller, which uses genuine  news footage of the car bomb that killed him in the Commons car park, from being aired tomorrow. Producers of the drama Utopia pretend that his 1979 death was perpetrated by a secret MI5 cell, when in fact he was murdered by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), an IRA splinter group. Close: Margaret Thatcher with her  friend and advisor Airey Neave at a 1978 press conference . Slurs: Airey  Neave is shown drinking and plotting in Channel 4's Utopia . His devastated family – who were not consulted by the channel – last night said they were intending to take action after learning how the prime-time series had  fictionalised the atrocity ‘in the name of entertainment’ as well as falsely depicting him as a debauched and conniving figure. The drama muddies the line between fact and fiction, drawing heavily on debunked conspiracy theories that Mr Neave – a war hero who escaped Colditz – was assassinated by the Government. The programme includes genuine footage showing the blood-stained wreckage of Mr Neave’s car, paramedics racing to save his life and Margaret Thatcher’s reaction to news of the murder of her close ally and confidant, lending the fiction a veneer of credibility. Mr Neave’s youngest son William, 60, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am upset and I would dearly like to protect my father’s reputation from lies and fabrication. 'It seems that when somebody dies, people can say whatever they like. We would love to stop it from airing.’ Norman Tebbit – a close friend and colleague of Airey Neave who himself survived an IRA bomb – said: ‘To attack a man like that who is dead and cannot defend himself is despicable.’ In the first episode of Utopia’s  second series, which airs tomorrow  at 10pm, Mr Neave – played by Blackadder’s Tim McInnerny – is portrayed as a hard-drinking double-dealer who connives with spies. Downing red wine over lunch, he is seen striking a murky deal with the security services to bring down Jim Callaghan’s Government by silencing a prominent Labour MP – by whatever means necessary. Real murder: Airey Neave's bomb-damaged car on the ramp of the Commons car park . Report: Daily Mail front page of the attack in 1979 . William, a Lloyd’s underwriter  who was 26 when his father was murdered, added: ‘I don’t know why Channel 4 would want to make such sensationalist claims when they are just not true. 'The suggestion that my father was a drinker is particularly upsetting and utterly dishonest. After his heart attack in 1959, he gave up drinking altogether. We may well have to take action over this.’ William’s brother Patrick, 66, branded the drama an ‘utter travesty and a cynical, money-making exercise’, adding: ‘Who do these people think they are, reinventing history for the purpose of entertainment? To show real-life footage of my father’s death is in incredibly poor taste, real in-the-gutter stuff. ‘We will be sending a very terse message of disapproval to the head of Channel 4. They didn’t even have the courtesy to contact us about this. That is the very least they should have done. ‘This is nothing  more than propaganda. Channel 4 is watched by  people in their 20s and 30s. They will think this mock history is the truth. That is  monstrous and wrong.’ Patrick’s wife Elizabeth, 61, added: ‘This is appalling – we all want to get  it stopped. My father-in-law was a dear and able man. He was not a drinker and he was most certainly not killed by MI5. 'We will do all that we can to shut this series down. Frankly, it is disgusting that anyone would think that slurring a man’s character and reputation in the so-called name of entertainment is remotely appropriate.’ A hero's burial: Patrick, left, and William Neave grieve with their mother Diana at Airey's funeral in 1979 . Mr Neave’s eldest child Marigold, 70, also called for the programme to be cancelled, saying: ‘We are not happy at all and I would like to see it banned because I don’t see any point in it. The man portrayed is not the man I knew.’ David Ray, the secretary of the  Colditz Society, added: ‘Channel 4 has crossed the line. Airey Neave was a war hero, the first Englishman to get back from Colditz. He had a fine record. 'I am very saddened to hear this drama is going out. It’s terrible that a great man’s name should  be dragged through the mud.’ The script weaves conspiracy with real life. Mr Neave, who was Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary at the time, was killed just two days after the vote of no confidence which brought down Callaghan. In 2005, Utopia creator Dennis Kelly wrote a stage play Osama The Hero, about a teenager in thrall to Al Qaeda. But he is best known for writing Matilda The Musical with comedian Tim Minchin and BBC3 sitcom Pulling with Sharon Horgan, who quipped of the show: ‘There isn’t a moral centre because Dennis and I don’t have one.’ Kelly himself admitted of Utopia: ‘I’m capable of being a c***, a not very nice person.’ The vote would have made Mr Neave Northern Ireland Secretary. The INLA killed him because they believed he would have brought their ‘armed struggle to its knees’. But on screen, Mr Neave is silenced by The Network, a fictional, secret clique within the intelligence community, to prevent him from revealing  its existence. The drama also suggests that Sir Richard Sykes – the British Ambassador to the Netherlands who was shot dead by the IRA just a week before Mr Neave’s assassination – was killed by security services for the same reason. Again, genuine news footage of  the diplomat’s killing is used, with a graphic shot of a pool of Sir Richard’s blood shown after an agent is told: ‘Deal with Sykes.’ Laura Sykes, 56, the wife of Sir  Richard’s son Andrew, said: ‘The family has been made aware of the programme but we do not wish to comment.’ The episode ends with an agent from The Network, played by Downton Abbey’s Rose Leslie, admitting responsibility for Nr Neave’s murder. Perversely, the 27-year-old actress has even suggested the fiction is, in fact, a ‘history lesson’. She said: ‘The political intrigue, the way the Airey Neave story is woven in, it’s brilliant. ‘It was a real history lesson for me as well. I was embarrassed about how little I knew of the 1970s.’ Claims that Mr Neave was killed by the security services were first raised by Kevin Cahill, an Irish journalist, who believes the politician was killed by MI6 agents working with the CIA because he was about to expose corrupt, senior members of the intelligence community. Propaganda: Utopia star Rose Leslie says the untruths are 'a history lesson' But Lord Carlile, a counter-terrorism expert, said: ‘There’s no evidence to support these spurious conspiracy theories. They were totally discredited at the time. ‘All right-minded people always realised it was just tittle-tattle. It is incredibly offensive to the family of Airey Neave to give these claims oxygen again.’ A Channel 4 spokesperson said: ‘The drama series Utopia is entirely fictional. 'A conspiracy thriller about a fictional organization called The Network, Utopia occasionally blends real moments in history with fictional storylines, and therefore some events and characters have been adapted for dramatic licence. 'It was not our intention to cause offence and Utopia does not suggest that any other real organisation was responsible for the death of Airey Neave. That period in history has been both widely reported and dramatized over the last 35 years and is the subject of many conspiracy theories.' Norman Tebbit and his wife Margaret narrowly avoided death  when Brighton’s Grand Hotel was blown up by the IRA during the 1984 Tory Party conference, killing five and leaving Margaret requiring a wheelchair. Here he describes his ‘disgust’ over Channel 4 using Airey Neave’s murder for entertainment. I struggle to find the words  to describe the extent of my disgust at the piece of so-called television drama concerning my dear, late friend Airey Neave, on Channel 4. If reports that they are proposing to use real news footage of his cruel murder by Irish terrorists are accurate, it must surely mark a new low point in British broadcasting. It is a nauseating example of the victory of greed and sensationalism over respect for the dead, over  the feelings of the loved ones of  those who have died, and over that derided old-fashioned quality, decency. Anger: Lord and Lady Tebbit . I had the privilege of knowing Airey Neave, a man who showed the kind of bravery and dedication to his country that is alien to broadcasters in cynical pursuit of titillation, higher ratings and money. In a bygone world, a man of Neave’s honour would have challenged  the film maker to a duel. Sadly,  Airey is not around to throw down the gauntlet. To trash his reputation in this way is bad enough, but to do it to a man who is dead and cannot defend himself is despicable. I have a much better film idea for Channel 4. It has all the drama and excitement they like. It is about the first British officer to escape Colditz, who nearly starved to death on the way back to Britain as he avoided the Germans, but made it in one piece, who spent the rest of the war directing the operation that enabled other heroic PoWs to negotiate the same perilous route back home and was awarded the Military Cross. A man who played an important role in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, became an MP, survived a heart attack, was among a small band of far-sighted and self-effacing politicians who saw the remarkable talent of a grocer’s daughter from Grantham, helped her save the country and was rewarded for all this by being blown to bits in the House of Commons itself by terrorists. A film about this story was made many years ago, but a new one would be most welcome. The star, Airey Neave. There is only problem: every word is true, so I doubt Channel 4  will be interested.","Cruel TV drama says Thatcher confidant was drinker killed by MI5 agents .

"It can be difficult to grasp just how vast the universe and its planets and stars are - especially in relation to Earth. But now one amateur astronomer has attempted to reveal the scale of objects in our galaxy by overlaying Earth’s continents, and our world itself, on celestial objects. One image reveals how Earth would fit across the width of Saturn’s rings six times over, while Mars’ Olympus Mons is also shown to be the same size as the state of Arizona. The pictures were created by Lancashire-based amateur astronomer John Brady and show Earth’s size relative to the sun, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter. In his first image, he shows how a neutron star’s size compares to the north west of England, between Liverpool and Warrington (shown) The pictures were created by Lancashire-based amateur astronomer John Brady . ‘The vast majority of objects out there in the universe are pretty big so it can be difficult sometimes to get your head round their actual size,’ explained Mr Brady on website Astronomy Central. ‘Here you’ll see how some space stuff out there compares to Earth stuff down here.’ In his first image, he shows how a neutron star’s size compares to the north west of England, between Liverpool and Warrington. Neutron star: 12 miles (20km) Olympus Mons: 374 miles (624km) Jupiter’s moon Io: 1,942 miles (3,636km) Mars: 4,220 miles (6,792km) Earth: 7,918 miles (12,742km) Saturn: 72,367 miles (116,464km) Jupiter: 88,846 miles (142,984km) Saturn’s rings: 175,000 miles (282,000km) The Sun: 864,950 miles (1,392,000km) But Mr Brady added that a neutron star, such as the one pictured, is 1.5 times the mass of the sun despite its relatively small size. ‘So dense in fact that just a teaspoon of it would weigh over a billion tonnes,’ continued Mr Brady. Another image, this time of North America, shows how the Martian volcano Olympus Mons would obscure the state of Arizona. Located in the Tharsis Montes region of Mars, Olympus Mons is the biggest volcano in the solar system. It is taller than three Mount Everest’s above sea level and is 374 miles (624 km) across. Jupiter’s moon Io, meanwhile, would cover almost the entirety of North America. ‘Looking like a cheese pizza’ according to Mr Brady it would fit snugly between San Francisco and Detroit. This illustration shows how the Martian volcano Olympus Mons would obscure the state of Arizona. Located in the Tharsis Montes region of Mars, Olympus Mons is the biggest volcano in the solar system . Jupiter’s moon Io, meanwhile, would cover almost the entirety of North America. ‘Looking like a cheese pizza’ according to Mr Brady it would fit snugly between San Francisco and Detroit . Io is the first of Jupiter’s four main Galilean moons and for this reason it is pushed and pulled by the planet’s intense gravity. This has made it the most volcanically active place in the solar system, including Earth, with hundreds of volcanoes known to be active on its surface. Mr Brady then shows how Mars, which is about half the size of our planet, would comfortably cover the whole of North America with plenty of room to spare. But in comparison to Jupiter North America would be dwarfed by a create margin; the continent appears as just a speck on the vast cloud bands of the gas giant.

But in comparison to Jupiter North America would be dwarfed by a great margin; the continent appears as just a speck on the vast cloud bands of the gas giant . In fact our planet’s diameter is 11 times smaller than the gas giant, which has lightning bolts 1,000 times more powerful than those on our own. Zooming further our, Mr Brady then compares Earth to Saturn. Our planet would fit six times over into the width of the rings, which span a whopping 175,000 miles (282,000km) wide. And if our planet took the position of Saturn, the our planet sit in the middle 41,600 miles (66,900km) away from the rings. Zooming further our, Mr Brady then compares Earth to Saturn.

And if our planet took the position of Saturn, we would sit in the middle 41,600 miles (66,900km) away from the inner edge of the rings, which then extend much further into space . Compared to the Sun, our planet appears even smaller. ‘At the Sun’s scale, Earth is now really starting to look puny,’ explains Mr Brady. ‘Across the Sun’s disk you could fit 109 Earths side by side, and to fill the Sun’s volume would take 1,300,000 Earths.’ He continues: ‘The Sun puts out more energy in one second than has ever been produced in all of human history, and loses four billion tonnes of material into space every second but has enough to last for another five billion years. ‘A solar flare, an explosion from the Sun’s surface caused when hugely powerful magnetic fields break apart under stress, can have the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs.’ All the images serve to show just how our planet compares to other objects in space. Compared to the Sun, our planet is even more dwarfed. ‘At the Sun’s scale, Earth is now really starting to look puny,’ explains Mr Brady. ‘Across the Sun’s disk you could fit 109 Earths side by side, and to fill the Sun’s volume would take 1,300,000 Earths’","Pictures were created by Lancashire-based amateur astronomer John Brady .

"Obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat-busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gaining weight, a new study has revealed. Scientists found a specific bacterial family passed down form generation to generation was more common in the guts of lean individuals. Lab tests showed a strain of that bacteria prevented people gaining weight when it was transplanted in mice. Genetics influence whether we are fat or thin by shaping which types of microbes thrive in our body, the study found. Obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat-busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gain weight, a new study has revealed . The breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases on an individual's genetic make-up. Associate Professor Ruth Ley at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics of Cornell University said: 'Up until now, variation in the abundances of gut microbes has been explained by diet, the environment, lifestyle, and health. 'This is the first study to firmly establish that certain types of gut microbes are heritable - that their variation across a population is in part due to host genotype variation, not just environmental influences.' Both genetic variation and the composition of gut microbes have previously been linked to diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, putting sufferers at greater risk of heart disease, stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels. Despite these common links. the relationship between genetic variation and the diversity of gut microbes has been difficult to establish. Past studies of twins failed to reveal an effect of genetic variation on the diversity of gut microbes. The Cornell University researchers suspected past studies included too few pairs of twins. As a result they sequenced the genes of microbes found in stool samples from 416 pairs of twins. They found an abundance of specific types of microbes were more similar in identical twins, who are genetically the same, than in non-identical pairs no more similar than ordinary siblings, other than sharing environmental influences in the womb. The findings demonstrated that human genes influence the composition of gut microbes. The breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases on an individual's genetic make-up, the team at Cornell University believe. File picture . The type of bacteria whose abundance was most heavily influenced by human genetics was a recently identified family called christensenellaceae. Members of the health-promoting bacterial family were more abundant in lean individuals, than those who were obese. Mice that were then treated with this specific bacteria strain gained less weight than those that were not treated with the microbes. The team believe their findings could pave the way for a microbe that prevents obesity in humans. Prof Ley said: 'Our results showing that bacterial abundances run in families may be useful for disease risk prediction. 'The microbiome is also an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation. By understanding the nature of our association with these health-associated bacteria, we could eventually exploit them to promote health.' The study was published in the journal Cell.","Scientists at Cornell University found a specific bacterial family that was more common in the guts of lean individuals .

"Comedian Noel Fielding said he was left 'shocked' when he was handcuffed to the ground, wearing gold boots and a boiler suit, while his friend was allegedly violently assaulted by police. Mr Fielding was giving evidence at the High Court in the case of Jimmy Browne, his friend and a onetime bodyguard for the late Amy Winehouse, who claims he suffered a broken leg in the attack in Kentish Town in north London. Fielding claims he was pinned to the ground while he was still wearing his attire from a gig he had done at the 100 Club in London the night before. Comedian Noel Fielding (left) and James Browne (right) outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London today . When he was asked if he struck out, the comedian who created and starred in cult television show The Mighty Boosh, replied: 'It was Kentish Town so there were quite a few brightly coloured people around'. Fielding said he felt 'tired and blurry' on the night of the incident and had had 'no time to change after the late night gig. He added: 'I wouldn't normally march down the street in golden boots and a boiler suit'. Fielding was with Mr Browne, who was stopped by police on suspicion of possessing drugs during the incident on Easter Sunday in 2010 – although that turned out not to be the case. Both ended up handcuffed to the ground and Fielding admitted he had no clear view of Mr Browne being subjected to 'violent behaviour' or manhandled by police officers. He said: 'I was handcuffed myself so it was very difficult for me to see what was happening to him, but I could tell what was happening because I could hear it.' Noel Fielding created and starred in cult television show The Mighty Boosh and is pictured with Julian Barratt (left) who starred as Moon. Fielding is pictured as Vince Noir in a scene from the third series of the show . 'I was in quite a lot of shock,' added the comic, who said he had never experienced anything similar and described the episode as 'traumatic'. He accepted in court that he had not witnessed any 'wanton, gratuitous violence' by the police towards his friend, but added: 'I could definitely tell there was a struggle'. He said the pair had become friends after meeting in the pub and denied Mr Browne was his minder. Fielding's evidence came on the first day of 53-year-old Mr Browne's £80,000 lawsuit against the Metropolitan Police. Fielding, pictured above in The Mighty Boosh in 2007, is known for his brightly coloured outfits during his shows . Fielding is pictured in a large black cape as the comedian performs at Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow . He alleges assault and battery over his arrest outside a convenience store, and claims he was 'grabbed' from behind by officers. Mr Browne – sometimes known as 'Jimmy the poet' – once acted as bodyguard to Amy Winehouse and even penned an ode in her honour following her death. The court heard he had a previous conviction for manslaughter. However Mr Browne denied resisting arrest before suffering leg fractures when he was bundled to the ground by police. The 53-year-old claims his right leg was shattered after an officer 'grabbed him from behind' and repeatedly kicked him. Fielding claims he was handcuffed and pinned to the ground after the incident in Kentish Town in London . Mr Browne stepped into the witness box to testify today, and insisted that he had done nothing to provoke any violent reaction from the police. Mr Browne's QC, Stephen Cragg, claimed he was subjected to 'excessive force', but defence lawyers insist police actions were reasonable and proportionate. The force has denied liability. Edward Buckett, representing the Met Police, claimed both Mr Browne and Mr Fielding were 'acting in a strange manner on the street'. He told Judge Rosalind Coe QC that neither gave 'any meaningful response' when asked what they were doing. When one of the officers followed Mr Browne into a Kentish Town corner shop, he saw him 'reaching into his jacket to remove something. 'He suspected that he may be removing drugs or a knife', the barrister added. 'Mr Browne was asked to stop again but walked away'. Noel Fielding gave evidence during the first day of Mr Browne's case against the Met Police at the High Court . However, the former soldier denied any lack of cooperation, insisting: 'One thing I never did was resist arrest'. Mr Browne was quizzed by Mr Buckett about his criminal past - including convictions for manslaughter and robbery dating back to 1984, for which he received an 18-year sentence. Explaining the background to the killing, Mr Browne said he had recently left the Army and 'made some terrible decisions and mistakes'. 'I have to live with that for the rest of my life,' he told the judge. He disclosed that a security guard had been killed in what was 'basically a robbery'. Mr Buckett put to him: 'Was a firearm involved?', to which Mr Browne replied: 'Yes.' Mr Buckett: 'And you had control of that firearm?' Mr Browne: 'I did.' The High Court hearing continues.","Noel Fielding said he was 'shocked' when he was pinned to ground .

"Lloyds Banking Group said eight members of staff have been dismissed after a financial scandal . Lloyds Banking Group has fired eight members of staff and withheld bonuses worth £3million as part of disciplinary action taken in the wake of July's revelations about rate-fixing. The financial giant was hit with fines totalling £218million after an investigation found it had rigged the Libor benchmark interest rate. However, the group has been unable to take any action against a number of individuals who had already left the bank prior to the bank's £218 million settlement with UK and U.S. regulators. Lloyds said it has shared all relevant information with City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority and other relevant authorities. In July, Bank governor Mark Carney described the actions of Lloyds between 2006 and 2009 as 'highly reprehensible, clearly unlawful and may amount to criminal conduct on the part of the individuals involved'. Lloyds said unvested bonuses and long term incentives totalling around £3 million in aggregate for the fired individuals will be forfeited. Chairman Lord Blackwell said the significant reputational damage and financial cost to the group will also be reflected in the options considered in relation to other staff bonus payments. He said: 'The board has been clear that it views the actions of those responsible for the misconduct referred to in the settlements as being completely unacceptable. 'It is entirely right that the group undertook a prompt, independent and thorough disciplinary process immediately after the settlements were announced and has taken appropriate action as a result. A number if individuals have been dismissed.' Three of the 'Big Five' British banks were penalised for the Libor scandal, two years after Barclays became the first to be hit with a £290million fine. The state-backed lender said at the time that the manipulation took place between May 2006 and 2009, and confirmed that those involved had either left the group, were suspended or subject to disciplinary proceedings. Its investigation was believed to have focussed on 15 members of staff. Scroll down for video . 'Shocking conduct': Lloyds manipulated rates to reduce the fees it had to pay to the Bank of England . Chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said the bank had taken steps to prevent the same kind of behaviour happening again. He added: 'The changes we have implemented over the last three years as part of our successful customer-focused and UK-centric strategy have created a culture and values that focus totally on our retail and commercial customers.' The settlements followed allegations that banks formed cartels to fix two key interest rates used to set the price at which banks lend money to each other for trillions of dollars-worth of financial products, from mortgages to complex financial products. Some £70million of Lloyds' fine is for attempting to manipulate fees that it owed for taking part in a taxpayer-backed government scheme designed to support the UK's banks during the financial crisis. While Lloyds' misconduct related to Libor rigging was similar to that of other financial institutions, the rigging of this scheme – the Special Liquidity Scheme – had not been seen before by regulators. Lloyds will pay the Bank £7.8 million in compensation for the reduction in the amount of fees received by the central bank as a result of the manipulation. The £105million total fine from the FCA is the joint third highest ever imposed by the regulator or its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, and the seventh penalty for Libor-related failures. Libor stands for the London Interbank Offer Rate and is a measure of the interest rate banks charge to borrow between each other. The rate is set every morning by a panel of banks and overseen by trade body the British Bankers' Association. Each bank sets the rates at which it believes it can borrow, from overnight to 12 months. There are 150 Libor rates, spanning ten currencies and 15 time periods. It heavily influences how banks price variable rate mortages, such as new tracker and discount deals and standard variable rates. Some borrowers also have mortgages linked directly to Libor, which are typically reset every three months. Traders could make money from tiny movements in the rate due to the millions being gambled on them, however, by the time these shifts of fractions of one per cent reach mortgage pricing their effect would be minimal. Even those whose mortgages were directly linked to Libor would find changes in their interest rate would have little overall effect. As part of the settlements on Libor rigging, Lloyds had to pay £35million to the FCA and £62million and £51 million respectively to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice. Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime, said at the time: 'The firms were a significant beneficiary of financial assistance from the Bank of England through the SLS. 'Colluding to benefit the firms at the expense, ultimately, of the UK taxpayer was unacceptable. This falls well short of the standards the FCA and the market is entitled to expect from regulated firms. 'The abuse of the SLS is a novel feature of this case but the underlying conduct and the underlying failings - to identify, mitigate and monitor for obvious risks - are not new. 'If trust in financial services is to be restored then market participants need to ensure they are learning the lessons from, and avoiding the mistakes of, their peers. Our enforcement actions are an important source of information to help them do this.'","Banking giant confirmed the staff were dismissed in wake of rate rigging .

"A farmer who lost 810 acres of land during last winter's floods was refused £11,000 compensation - after being told these aerial pictures showed 'insufficient evidence' of the damage. James Winslade was forced out of his farm in Bridgwater, Somerset and had to shift 550 cattle to safe havens after floodwater reached 12ft deep in some places. The cattle farmer was entitled to government funding to reseed his fields, but officials told him he would need to provide evidence of the damage. Scroll down for video . James Winslade lost 810 acres of land in Bridgwater, Somerset, during last winter's floods was refused £11,000 compensation because of 'insufficient evidence' The cattle farmer was entitled to government funding to reseed his fields, but officials told him he would need to provide evidence of the damage . Mr Winslade sent a collection of aerial images showing his land under almost eight ft of water to highlight the damage caused during the bad weather. But he was stunned when he received a response telling him the evidence he submitted was not sufficient to show his problems. The payment only came after a Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs sent an inspector to the farm - almost six months later. Mr Winslade, who became a figurehead during the flooding crisis, said: 'I think it could be far more simple. I know it's European money and that they need to be accountable to Europe but surely with every farm in and around Moorland that had been affected there should have been a far simpler system. He applied to the fund in April, and bought more than £11,000 worth of grass seed in May and June to start the regrowing process on his land . During the Christmas and New Year flooding he had to shift 550 cattle from West Yeo Farm and Newhouse Farm in Moorland on the Somerset Levels . The beef producer hoped to be paid back in instalments after buying the seed, but officials said there was 'insufficient damage'  caused by the flooding . 'They could have sent someone out to inspect, and said, right you have done the job here is the money. 'I put in all the photographs back in April to show the damage but they said the photographs weren't good enough and didn't prove I was flooded. 'I couldn't believe it. They were aerial photographs of my parents' farmhouse and my farmhouse and of the land. Of 840 acres 810 was flooded.' He applied to the fund in April, and bought more than £11,000 worth of grass seed in May and June under a three-month payment plan. The beef producer hoped to be paid back in instalments after buying the seed, but he only received the funding six months later. Farming Minister George Eustice, defended the delay, saying officials did not have all the information needed at first to make the payment. He said: 'We went the extra mile and sent a Defra official out and he has been paid now. 'This is public money it is coming out of a European fund and there are lots of rules about the way you monitor and apply European funds.' The payment only came after a Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs sent an inspector to the farm to assess the damage almost six months later .

"Pestered: Charlotte Green said the BBC World Service had a 'panic button' for women to press . A former Radio 4 newsreader has claimed that the BBC World Service had a 'panic button' for women to press when they were at the mercy of the wandering hands of male colleagues in the 1970s. Charlotte Green, who joined the BBC in 1978 as a studio manager and retired in 2013, was at one time 'the voice' of BBC news bulletins. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the 58-year-old said that staff at Bush House, the former headquarters of the World Service, referred to the alarm as an 'emergency button'. She said: 'I think mainly because one or two people did fancy themselves as dashing lotharios and possibly on night shift might get carried away.' She added that 'it had never actually happened at Bush House but it was there just in case there were problems'. Miss Green’s comments come as the BBC finds itself embroiled in a series of investigations, accusations and scandals relating to sexual abuse committed by employees. High profile figures include Jimmy Savile, Stuart Hall, Dave Lee Travis and Rolf Harris. The corporation said the buttons were still in their studios and were standard practice for a number of emergencies, including technical failure or if someone falls ill. Last week, Miss Green, who is promoting her memoir -The News Is Read By Charlotte Green - revealed how she was harassed by the ‘wandering hands’ of a BBC colleague she worked with in the 1970s. She said the studio manager, would touch her inappropriately, and when she complained was told he was simply ‘being friendly’. She told the Festival – supported by the Daily Mail – that she tried at all costs to avoid being in the same room as the ‘pest’. She added that she found herself repeatedly having to ‘make a fuss’ about his unwanted attention, which happened in her 20s. Eventually, he was finally kept away from her. Alarm: Miss Green said that staff at Bush House, the former headquarters of the World Service, referred to the alarm as an 'emergency button' She said: ‘Unfortunately, it was my least favourite studio manager who was putting the programme out. He had wandering hands, so I kept well away from him. ‘Fortunately you could say to him – and I won’t say his name – “oh for goodness sake, stop being silly and just get off me” and he would. ‘But I’m afraid this was the 1970s and as we’re hearing so much about lately, with far worse examples, he was a nuisance and he was a pest. I did have to complain about him because it would happen quite frequently.’ Miss Green, who is now a presenter on Classic FM but in the past has also been involved with the Shipping Forecast and The News Quiz programmes on Radio 4, said when she complained her objections were dismissed by senior colleagues, reports The Times. Miss Green added that 'it had never actually happened at Bush House (pictured) but it was there just in case there were problems' She said: ‘I went to my line manager and said “this isn’t good enough, I’m not putting up with this”. ‘And he just looked at me and said “well he’s just being friendly”, which looking back now is astonishing, but that was the attitude. ‘I had to make a real fuss and in the end. I said “I won’t work with him, I’m not going to put up with that”. And eventually he was kept well away from me and I didn’t have to work with him but I shouldn’t have had to make a fuss. But that was how things were in the late 70s, sadly.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Behaviour like this is not tolerated in the BBC of today and we would encourage anyone with information on such issues to speak to the police.’","Charlotte Green, 58, said button was to protect against male colleagues .

"DNA testing has lead the investigators to D'Marcus Tucker, 15, who was charged with first-degree murder on Monday . A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of a young woman who was found stabbed to death at her Florida home five months ago. Nicole Franco, 19, who worked as a pastry chef at the Boca Raton Resort & Club, was murdered in her own bed on June 3. DNA testing has lead the investigation to D'Marcus Tucker, 15, a neighbor at the gated Bridgewater Place apartments in Oakland Park. Tucker was charged on Monday with one count of first-degree murder. According to the sheriff's department, Tucker entered Franco's ground-floor apartment through a sliding door and grabbed a knife from her kitchen. He then went into Franco’s bedroom and took her wallet from her purse. As he turned to leave, Tucker accidentally stepped on the purse, which awoke Franco. Police said a startled Tucker then stabbed Franco multiple times in the chest. Tucker allegedly told police he watched Franco dial 911 before fleeing and throwing the wallet into a lake behind the apartments. During the 911 call, Franco told the call-taker someone had broken into her house and beat her. However, she fell unconscious before she could provide more details. Deputies arriving to the apartment building had to go door-to-door at 4:11 a.m. to find Franco’s apartment. They eventually noticed the open sliding glass door and discovered her body. Tucker had entered the Fort Myers Youth Academy, a juvenile facility in Lee County, on September 17 on another matter. Nicole Franco, 19, who worked as a pastry chef at the Boca Raton Resort & Club, was murdered in her own bed on June 3 . A DNA sample was obtained from him and entered into a state database.

"Stargazers across north America were treated to an amazing display with the final partial solar eclipse of 2014. Across the continent amateur astronomers, school children and photographers were able to track the sun, which looked like it had lost a bite-sized chunk. According to NASA, the partial eclipse was the final such event of the year. For Americans, the next total solar eclipse will take place on August 21, 2017. The moon covers almost a third of the sun as it passes by the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at Notre Dame University in Indiana . In Missouri, the residents of West Alton waited patiently as heavy cloud obscured the partial eclipse, giving only a two-minute glimpse . Over in San Diego California, the cloudless sky provided a perfect view of the eclipse - which was shot through a special filter . A NASA spokesman said: 'Throughout history, total eclipses, in which the entire sun is blocked from view, have offered scientists the chance to see the faint light of the sun's atmosphere called the corona, without its being overwhelmed by the sun itself. 'Total eclipses provide views of that atmosphere, which we otherwise can only get with specialized telescopes – both in space and on the ground -- that block out the bright light of the sun. As a partial eclipse, the October 23 eclipse is of less scientific interest, but it still makes for a great view!' In New York, the event was overshadowed by heavy cloud but in the Canadian arctic, more than three-quarters of the sun had been obscured. There are three types of solar eclipse, ranging from the total eclipse, where the sun is completely blocked out by the moon. A partial eclipse is where only a section of the sun is obscured. The final type of eclipse is the annular eclipse. This is where the moon appears smaller than the sun and blocks everything apart from an external fiery ring. In this combination photograph taken from Mount Wilson Observatory, the sun looks almost like a bloated Pac Man character . In Provo, Utah, it appears like the moon has taken a slightly larger chunk out of the sun as it approaches its zenith . In Mexico, this images was taken in Esenada in the State of Baja California, showing several sun spots . Up in the pacific northwest more than two-thirds of the sun is obscured from this vantage point in Kerry Park, Seattle . In Lake Hefner, Oklahoma City, a bird flies low past the sun which is silhouetted against some high-tension power lines . When looking at a solar eclipse it is necessary to wear appropriate equipment as staring at the sun can cause blindness . In Florida, this couple watch the sun setting off Sand Key on the Gulf of Mexico for the last partial eclipse of the year . This image was taken from Paynes Prairie in Gainsville Florida from behind a tree .

"Twelve more people are being looked into as part of an ongoing investigation into historic child abuse, it has been claimed . Twelve more public figures including senior policeman and politicians are being investigated over claims of historic sex abuse, sources have revealed. Civil servants and local authority chiefs are also among the suspects being considered by police across the UK it was claimed, over allegations of abuse between the Fifites and the Eighties. Their names have been passed on to Operation Yewtree among other forces by the investigative reporter who exposed the sustained abuse of children by Jimmy Savile in a documentary two years ago. Mark Williams Thomas said that unlike those arrested already, new suspects are not celebrities but law makers and enforcers. Rolf Harris, Stuart Hall and Max Clifford have all been jailed over sexual abuse carried out decades ago. Most recently, Dave Lee Travis was found guilty of assault and handed a suspended sentence of three months which is could be reviewed by the Attorney General. Williams Thomas, a child protection expert, said: 'I know of another twelve public figures and that is a minimum. 'Sadly some of these people still remain un-touchable because they are so powerful. Whilst huge progress has been made following Savile expose - some very powerful people still need to be brought to justice.' Dozens of TV and radio personalities have been looked into as part of the investigation following the exposure of Jimmy Savile's horrific abuse towards children, with scores of women coming forward to reveal their experiences with the men in the past. 'It just takes one person brave enough to come forward. Then, as the investigations start to unfold, more victims tell their stories,' Mr Williams Thomas added. 'The names I have supplied are senior police officers, politicians, local authority officials and senior civil servants - people with a lot to lose. 'After Savile I got letter bombs and death threats. That's nothing compared to what you will get with politicians and the like. 'There will be dirty games played, a campaign to undermine those investigations. The only way to do it is through a proper inquiry, to have properly skilled investigators to dig out more evidence. Jimmy Savile (left) was exposed as a serial child abuser in a documentary shown two years ago. Since then, a handful of British celebrities have been faced trial for sexual offences including Max Clifford (right) who was sentenced to eight years in jail . Rolf Harris (left) was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault and Stuart Hall (right) is serving a 30-month sentence . 'There are hundreds of victims. Savile had close to 1,000. Offenders don't offend in isolation, and they continually offend. 'The offences date back to the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Some go back to the 1950s. The accused are old people now. If we leave it too long they will die or be dying, or have gone senile.' Earlier this year the head of an inquiry into alleged abuse at Westminster was forced to resign amid claims she herself may have been too close to the scandal. Retired judge Lady Butler-Sloss, stepped down just days after her appointment following criticism due to her brother, Lord Michael Havers. There have been suggestions Lord Havers, the attorney general at the time, failed to investigate after concerns were raised. Former Lord Mayor of London, Fiona Woolf, was named as the new head of the independent inquiry last month. A spokesman for Metropolitan Police said no new arrests had been made by Operation Yewtree.

Drones have identified around 200 mansions and 100 swimming pools in Buenos Aires, Argentina, that have not been declared by their owners . The unregistered mansions and pools were found in an area about 10 miles south of the city and, according to the tax agency, they appeared to be large and constructed with 'premium materials'. Owners of the properties have been told to get their papers in order and get ready to pay hefty fines. The tax evaded has been estimated at a total of £1.2million. Each drone costs about £6,000 and the technology is also often used by Argentine security forces.

And Diame admits that he is hoping to join a side challenging at the top of England’s elite division at some point in the future. Moving on up? West Ham midfielder Mohamed Diame has ambitions to play for a side in the top six . 'I don’t want to stop here,' Diame told French website Hat-trick. 'I still want more: Joining a club from the top six would be a dream come true.'

'La Liga is also a very good league, but honestly the Premier League has this little special thing which makes all the difference.' Diame joined West Ham from Wigan on a free transfer in 2012, but before moving to Upton Park he almost signed for Liverpool. 'In my head I was already in Liverpool,' he revealed.

'There were proposals last summer, I was thinking of going to Arsenal but it didn’t happen so I stayed at West Ham, because I felt good here,' he said.

"Tom Magliozzi, one half of the brother duo who hosted National Public Radio's Car Talk, died on Monday of complications from Alzheimer's disease aged 77. Car Talk featured the brothers bantering with callers and commiserating over their car problems and was NPR's most popular entertainment program for years. The show reached more than four million people a week at its peak and continued to be a top-rated show even after the brothers stopped taping live shows in 2012 and the network began airing reruns and archived materials. Popular show: Tom Magliozzi, co-host with his brother Ray of National Public Radio's Car Tal', died on Monday at age 77 and is shown here in a 2008 photo . Car Talk executive producer Doug Berman, in a statement posted on NPR's website, said Magliozzi's 'dominant, positive personality' will be missed. 'He and his brother changed public broadcasting forever. Before Car Talk, NPR was formal, polite, cautious ... even stiff,' he said. The duo, which called themselves 'Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers,' mixed sound advice about repairing cars with sharp one-liners, self-deprecating humor and off-topic digressions on philosophy and the mysteries of life. Life advice: Ray and Tom mixed car repair advice with off-topic musings on philosophy and life . 'It's only a car.' 'If it falls off, it doesn't matter.' 'Never let the facts stand in the way of a good answer.' 'Life is too short to own a German car.' 'Do it while you're young. You may never have another chance to do anything this stupid again!' 'It is better to travel in hope than arrive in despair.' 'Happiness equals reality minus expectations.' 'How do you know if you've got a good mechanic? By the size of his boat.' 'If money can fix it, it's not a problem.' 'I like to drive with the windows open. I mean, before you know it, you're going to spend plenty of time sealed up in a box anyway, right?' 'Don't drive like my brother.' 'I like to drive with the windows open. I mean, before you know it, you're going to spend plenty of time sealed up in a box anyway, right?' Tom once quipped on-air. The brothers always ended their shows with a catchphrase - 'Don't drive like my brother' - delivered in their signature Boston accents. Ray Magliozzi affectionately teased his late brother, who was 12 years his senior, in a statement posted on Car Talk's website announcing his death from complications of Alzheimer's disease: 'Turns out he wasn't kidding. ...He really couldn't remember last week's puzzler.' The Cambridge, Massachusetts, brothers were an unlikely radio duo. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates opened a car repair shop in the early 1970s. As the story goes, Tom was invited to a radio round-table discussion with other local auto mechanics on Boston's NPR affiliate, but was the only one to actually show up. He impressed the station's producers, however, and was invited back the following week. Tom brought along Ray, and Car Talk was born. Funny hosts: Ray and Tom are shown in 2008 during a premiere of a cartoon show about them in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Cartoon version: Tom posed with a caricature of himself in Cambridge . The weekly Boston-produced program began airing in 1977 and became nationally-broadcast starting in 1987. Magliozzi was born June 28, 1937, in a largely Italian-American section of East Cambridge. According to NPR, he was the first in his family to attend college, earning a chemical engineering degree. Goofing around: Ray and Tom filled their show with one-liners and self-deprecating humour . Besides running a car repair business, Magliozzi worked at times as a consultant and college professor. Magliozzi is survived by his first and second wives, three children, five grandchildren, and his close companion of recent years, Sylvia Soderberg. In lieu of flowers, the family has requested fans make a donation in his memory to either their local NPR station or the Alzheimer's Association.

"A royal shame: Irina Walker, a Romanian princess living in Oregon, was sentenced to probation on Wednesday for running an illegal cockfighting business at her home . A Romanian princess was sentenced Wednesday to probation after apologizing for her role in an Oregon cockfighting enterprise that she said brought shame to her and her family. 'I'm very sorry about my involvement in this business,' Irina Walker told a federal judge before she was given three years' probation. 'It was not my intention to go against the law.' She and her husband John Walker both pleaded guilty in July to operating an illegal gambling business. John Walker, a former sheriff's deputy, was also sentenced to probation by U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman. As part of the plea deal, the Walkers agreed to sell real estate and pay $200,000 to the government. Irina Walker, 61, is the third daughter of former Romanian King Michael I, who was forced to abdicate by communists in 1947. The judge agreed to let the Walkers travel internationally during their probation after their attorneys said the 93-year-old former king has health problems and Irina wants to visit while he's still alive. It's unclear how she made her way to Oregon, since she was born and spent much of her life in Switzerland. Heirs to the throne: During the hearing, she apologized for the shame she brought on her family. Irinia is pictured as a child, sitting on her mother Queen Anne's lap. Pictured flanked by her elder sisters Elena and Margareta and in front of her father, King Michael I . Partner in crime: Princess Irina's husband John Walker, a former sheriff's deputy, was also sentenced to probation on Wednesday for the cockfighting ring . As the third daughter of Michael I, she is fifth in line to the now-defunct Romanian throne, behind her eldest sister Margareta, second eldest sister Elena, and Princess Elena's two children. She is also a great-great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria,  which puts her in the line of succession to the British crown as well. The Walkers were arrested in 2013 after authorities said they staged at least 10 cockfighting derbies in a barn at their ranch in Irrigon, 175 miles east of Portland. The Walkers charged spectators each $20 to watch roosters with knives attached to their legs fight to the death. Crowds generally exceeded 100 people, and the couple also made money from the sale of alcohol. Authorities said the people who brought roosters paid $1,000 to enter the fights, and the prizes ranged from $10,000 to $18,000. The person whose roosters won the most matches took home the money, except for 10 percent kept by referees. More than a dozen other people were indicted in the case. Charges against a woman who made food were later dropped, and two suspects remain fugitives — Ruben Saltos Godina, known as Chino; and Antonio Dominguez Robles, known as Tono. Everyone else pleaded guilty either in Oregon or Washington state. Irina Walker moved to the U.S. from Switzerland in the early 1980s with her former husband John Kreuger, according to her daughter Angelica Kreuger, who said her mother raised two children while living for many years in Coos County in southwest Oregon. The princess later divorced her husband and married Walker, a family friend and neighbor. The couple moved to sparsely populated Irrigon and lived in a triple-wide manufactured home. Country home: Walker has lived in Oregon since at least the late-1980s. Above a view of her and husband John's property in Irrigon.

"A well-preserved human forearm that was once displayed near the Antietam National Battlefield as 'The Arm of the Unknown Soldier' is now grabbing the Halloween spotlight at the National Museum of Civil War Medicine. Officials at the Frederick, Maryland, museum call the naturally mummified relic the highlight of their first 'Behind the Screams' Halloween tour of the facility - a 19th century embalming parlor that they dub 'the most haunted building in Frederick.' But they also insist it's not just a marketing gimmick. 'We don't want it to be a scary Halloween prop,' said curator Lori Eggleston. 'This is the arm of a 16-year-old boy who probably died on the battlefield.' Mystery: Smithsonian Institution anthropologists who examined the limb for the Frederick museum were unable to authenticate it as a battlefield relic . The Civil War museum is exhibiting the limb as an example of a typical wound from the clash near Sharpsburg on Sept., 1862, that left about 23,000 soldiers dead, wounded or missing on the bloodiest day of the Civil War. The forearm's skin and tendons appear to have been violently twisted, making it unlikely that the arm was surgically amputated. 'Medical specimens aren't torn off of bodies,' said Eggleston said. However, it's far from certain the arm was torn off in battle. Smithsonian Institution anthropologists who examined the limb for the Frederick museum were unable to authenticate it as a battlefield relic. They say it belonged to an unidentified white male of about 16 - five or six years younger than the average soldier - who probably hailed from New York, Pennsylvania or Ohio, based on forensic evidence of his diet. There is a smaller possibility he was from the local area, the researchers found. Research: Anthropologist say it belonged to an unidentified white male of about 16 -  who probably hailed from New York, Pennsylvania or Ohio, based on forensic evidence of his diet . 'The authenticity of the arm as a Civil War relic is highly questionable due to inconsistencies in its collection record with evidence from the analysis, historic documentation, and interviews with local residents,' Karin S. Bruwelheide and Douglas W. Owsley of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History wrote in their report. The muddy-looking arm was donated anonymously to the museum in 2012 after decades on display at a roadside museum in Sharpsburg. The limb purportedly was found two weeks after the battle by a farmer who was said to have pickled it in brine before giving it to a local physician, who supposedly preserved it with embalming fluid. But researchers found no evidence of chemical preservation. Rather, the arm appears to have dried out naturally, either in the open air or under a light soil cover - like the shallow graves in which those slain in battle were hurriedly buried before their remains were moved to the Antietam National Cemetery. 'It is possible that the arm was uncovered during this process. It seems unlikely however, that it would have remained unplaced in a grave,' the Smithsonian anthropologists wrote. Researchers also couldn't verify that the limb was ever in the possession of a local doctor. They cited another account that it was found on the battlefield around 1900 by a local patent medicine dealer named Daniel or Peter Fahrney. Human remains have been found at Antietam as recently as 2009. Whatever its origin, the limb deserves respectful treatment, Eggleston said. 'I think as long as we are respectfully telling the story and using it as an opportunity for people to learn about it, I think we're doing OK,' she said.","A well-preserved human forearm referred to as 'The Arm of the Unknown Soldier' is now on view at the National Museum of Civil War Medicine .

"A jeweller has spoken of the moment he grappled with a hammer-wielding thief who stole thousands of pounds worth of Rolex and Cartier watches from his shop. David Mellor, 62, was thrown to the pavement as he tried to stop the man escaping with his accomplice on the back of a motorbike. The men pulled up outside the David Mellor Jewellery shop in Andover, Hampshire and began smashing the glass cabinets with a claw hammer. Jeweller David Mellor, 62, bravely confronted the armed robber who smashed his glass display with a hammer .

He threw them into a rucksack while his accomplice Luke Peverall, 24, waited by the doorway on the bike. Mr Mellor, dressed in a white short sleeved shirt, tried to tackle the armed robbers and snatched the bag. Despite his efforts, the intruders sped off on the motorbike following the incident on September 8. The intruder broke into the store and targeted 18 watches worth thousands of pounds . Tom White bashed in the glass display filled with expensive watches and grabbed a Rolex, a Cartier 18-carat white gold watch and a Cartier Roadster. His accomplice Luke Peverall waited by the doorway on the bike . The robbers  were later caught by police and have been jailed for up for five years each at Winchester Crown Court. Mr Mellor, who took the intruders on despite having hip and knee replacements, said he and his staff have been left scared  following the attack. Full-time security has now been rolled out at all three of his jewellery shops. Mr Mellor said: 'Every time a motorbike or a car goes up the road my heart goes into my mouth thinking that it is going to happen again. 'My staff are twitchy now - they are very nervous, like a cat on a hot tin roof. 'Every time something goes up the street they are looking to see what it is.' The courageous shop owner was thrown to the ground after he took on the armed intruders on September 8 . Prosecutor Kerry Maylin said the raid targeted 18 watches and the pair had visited Mr Mellor's stores two days earlier. Peverall and White were arrested in Reading, Berkshire, after police linked a phone found in the bag left behind at the scene to them. Recorder of Winchester Judge Keith Cutler handed Peverall, of no fixed abode, and White, from Iver, in Buckinghamshire, five years in jail each. They both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob. Judge Cutler said: 'I want you to know that shops will have the protection of the courts. 'Mr Mellor came to see what was going on then there was a struggle in which he was injured. 'This is the risk with carrying out the sort of criminal activity that you were intending on. 'There was a very high risk that someone would be hurt and indeed someone was and that was Mr Mellor.'","David Mellor, 62, fought with robbers who stole watches from his shop .

"Russia is to open the largest prison in Europe next year, holding 4,000 inmates in conditions officials boast will meet 'European standards'. Pictures published in Russian media have shown the plans and building site of the vast jail, which is in Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg. The new prison is a no-expense spared affair, with a sports complex including a sauna and 'fighting room', concert hall and even a museum. Locked up: Outside Russia's new prison, which will be the largest in Europe and hold 4,000 inmates . They won't let me out: Officials boast the new jail, named Kresty-2 will meet 'European standards' Amenities: It has a sports complex including a sauna and 'fighting room', concert hall and even a museum . It will replace the notorious Kresty prison which housed political prisoners during the tsarist and Soviet eras. It will be known as Kresty-2. Among those jailed in the old red brick Kresty were revolutionary Leon Trotsky, as well as members of the provisional government toppled by Lenin in the Bolshevik Revolution. The prison gained a reputation as a tough place to be kept. In the mid-1990s the prison held more than 12,500 inmates, more than ten times its design capacity. Currently no more than six inmates can be held in a cell originally designed for solitary confinement. Vladimir Lukin, Russia's former human rights ombudsman, found during a visit to Kresty in 2008 'that the prison hospital was grossly inadequate and that prisoners in significant numbers had cut their arms with razor blades in protest at their conditions,' according to leaked U.S. Embassy cables hosted by WikiLeaks. Nonetheless, despite its dark past, Kresty may be redeveloped as a luxury hotel after the site is auctioned. Spacious: The as-yet empty and pristine hallways of the prison . Flagship: President Vladimir Putin personally announced the construction of the new jail in 2006 . Comfortable: Shared accommodation at the jail, which officials say will be the most-modern in Europe . Plans: How Kresty-2 will look when its finished, according to architects' plans . Putin personally announced the construction of the new jail in 2006. 'It will be the most modern prison in Russia and the biggest in Europe,' said Gennady Kornienko, head of Russia's prison service. Europe's current largest prison is believed to be France's Fleury-Merogis Prison on the outskirts of Paris which can hold some 3,800 detainees. The development comes amid fears that Russia is reverting to authoritarianism a decade and a half into strongman Putin's rule. But Kornienko insisted the new jail would include modern facilities, making it a far cry from the gulag prison camps of the Stalin era . 'Every inmate will be allocated seven square metres which fits European standards,' he said. 1 - prison cells; two blocks of cells, 1,792 people in each building. Architecturally they copy the old Kresty prison, but the new buildings are double the height with eight floors instead of four . 2 - dormitory for inmates who serve as prison 'housekeepers' including dining room, gym, showers and bedrooms. Holds 280 people . 3 - dining room with two halls for Kresty-2 personnel, one for 150, another for 30. 4 - church . 5 - single cells to dangerous prisoners and punishment sweat boxes - for 216 inmates. 6 - passage ways . 7 - hospital . 8 - sport complex and rest rooms, with gym and sport rooms, fighting room, wardrobes, showers, sauna and other rooms. A shooting range for use by prison staff. 9 - garage . 10 - reception with small cafe, shop and a desk accepting letter and parcels . 11 - 5 storey administration building, with a court room, lawyers' offices, long and short term meeting rooms, concert hall and jail museum. 12 - entry and exit facility for new and released inmates, including sanitary inspection rooms, shower and 'disinfecting' facilities and an investigative ward. Overcrowded: The old Kresty prison, which dates back to Tsarist times and has given the architectural inspiration for the new jail. It has housed many political dissidents . Russia has the third highest prison population in the world, after the U.S. and China; however, take into account population size, and it has only the tenth highest prison population rate at 469 per 100,000. The U.S. has the world's second highest prison population rate at 707 prisoners per 100,000 people. Russia does have by far the higest prison population rate in Europe. The architecture of the new jail is modelled on the old Kresty jail but on a gargantuan scale. Kresty prison - which currently holds 1,150 inmates - dates back to the 1730s but was redeveloped in the reign of Tsar Alexander III by Anthony Tomishko, whose ghost is said to haunt it. In the first revolution of 1917, the jail was stormed by revolutionaries in an attempt to emulate the 'Storming of the Bastille' from the French Revolution. They ended up freeing hundreds of hardened criminals, causing crime rates to soar.","Kresty-2 will replace St Petersburg's famous Tsarist-era prison .

"Jeremy Clarkson has claimed the Falklands number plate scandal was not deliberate by saying if it was the BBC would have fired him. The Top Gear presenter – along with co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond, and their crew – had to flee Argentina last week after locals were angered by a number plate on a Porsche he was driving. They believed the plate, ‘H982 FKL’, was in reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Clarkson said had his employer thought he was in on the controversy he would have lost his job. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson and fellow presenters, Richard Hammond, left, and James May, right, in Argentina where they were set upon by locals over a number plate on his car which they believed was in reference to the Falklands War; Clarkson said had the BBC thought he deliberately requested the plate he would have been fired . Clarkson said the show had the choice of only two Porsche and chose one based on its colour alone . Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: 'I don't think it's a secret that BBC boss Danny Cohen and I don't get on. 'And if he thought for one moment that I was in some way responsible for the whole sorry affair, I'd be out on my ear.' He said his employer had 'done all the digging', checked dates and who purchased the car and why, and for once 'for once Top Gear has done nothing wrong'. Clarkson and TV controller, Mr Cohen have had a fractious relationship. In August it was revealed that Mr Cohen had launched an investigation into Top Gear after footage was leaked of Clarkson saying 'n****' in an out take. It was one of a number of controversies to hit the show in recent months. Mr Cohen gave Clarkson a final warning and ordered a review of the show's culture and practices, saying there had been 'some significant issues' on the programme. The Porsche 928GT had a licence plate that read H982 FKL which locals believed was in reference to the Falklands War; Clarkson said his crew changed the plate as soon as the controversy was pointed out to them . Recalling how the number plate controversy came about, Clarkson said when he asked the office to find a Porsche 928GT, only two were available. One was grey and the other black. He said because black 'doesn't work on television' he chose the grey one, and 'didn't even see it' until he arrived in Argentina. Clarkson went on to say no one in the Top Gear crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in Chile. Its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet, the show's executive producer has said. Government officials were then contacted and asked if the plate would be a problem when they arrived in Ushuaia two weeks later, Clarkson said. The were told to change it before they arrived, which Clarkson said created continuity issues as the car had already been filmed. Clarkson said they then formed a 'cunning plan' to make-up for the number plate swap. They created joke plates - saying BE11 END - which they planned to film May and Hammond fitting on the car without his knowledge making him look 'idiotic' when he drove it. To make up for continuity issues involving the plates Clarkson said the crew created these joke plates which they were going to put on the car to make him look 'idiotic' when he was driving around . But before the crew had a chance to film the scene they were set upon by an angry mob who threw rocks at their cars. The H982 FKL plates were then removed, revealing an old personal plate underneath, which they left on, then drove off. The cars were later abandoned. An Argentine judge is now reportedly considering whether to begin a criminal inquiry into unauthorised ‘plate changing’ on the vehicle. The offence carries a jail sentence of up to three years. Clarkson concludes by saying the episode will be aired at Christmas and viewers can make up their own minds about whether the incident happened by chance, or was a made for television stunt. Yesterday May said the Porsche had its original number plate, something they had no power over, and that any suggestion they deliberately requested it was 'nonsense'. He went on to say the plate was 'actually meaningless', saying: 'If you looked at it you have to want to see the meaning.' And added: 'We weren't thinking about the Falklands War, we were going to do an epic long, very difficult drive, to celebrate V8 cars. 'We wouldn't drudge up a war, especially one in living memory, and make a mockery of the casualties.'","Jeremy Clarkson said he'd be 'out on my ear' if plate stunt was deliberate .

"The boss of a filthy kebab shop where rats 'gnawed' at the doors while staff prepared food without washing their hands has been fined more than £1,000. Nisar Ahmed, 42, who ran Dr Food takeaway in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, pleaded guilty to six food breaches and hygiene regulations when he appeared at Stafford Magistrates' Court yesterday. The court heard a large dead rat was found in the food storage area of the kitchen while 'gnaw' marks from rodents were found on one of the doors. Decaying: Health inspectors found a dead rat in the food storage area of Dr Food takeaway in Stoke-on-Trent . No soap or towels were found in the food preparation area, water was leaking through the ceiling which was collected in buckets and raw burgers were stored above salad in the fridge. Health inspectors from Stoke-on-Trent City Council also found microwave ovens, fridges and dough mixers in the kitchen were filthy after an initial inspection in February last year. In a second visit in October, inspectors found conditions had not improved and a large decaying rat. Ahmed admitted failing to control pests, failing to effectively clean equipment, failing to dispose of food waste and rubbish and refuse on an outside terrace. He also failed to train staff in food hygiene and adequately cover food in the fridge. He was handed a 12-month community order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £1,178 in court costs. Breach: Dr Food takeaway, pictured left, and right, inspectors found rodents had gnawed through the doors . Prosecutor Lionel Desa said: 'An examination was conducted at the Dr Food premises. Prior to the inspection the inspectors requested site food safety documents, but none were in place. 'Staff prepared food without aprons or appropriate clothing. There was no soap or towels in the preparation area. 'In general the preparation room was dirty and there was no sanitiser or disinfectant present. Dirty: No soap or towels were found in the food preparation area and equipment were found in filthy conditions . Filthy: The conditions found by inspectors in February 2013 breached food and hygiene regulations . Lack of safety: A damaged electrical socket in the takeaway where water was leaking from the ceiling . 'During that inspection a dead rat was found on the staircase. Water was leaking from the ceiling adjacent to the staircase, with buckets to collect the water. 'Evidence of a pest control report was discovered dated January 29, 2013. It stated a pest infestation was present and it stated that the infestation was ongoing. 'Due to the state of the property and the presence of the dead rat on the premises, the local authority applied for the premises to be closed, which it was. 'A further inspection then found evidence of gnawing on one of the doors.' The court heard Ahmed blamed the problems on a friend who he had left in charge so he could visit his mother in Pakistan. Mohammed Khan, defending, said despite the health and safety breaches, the takeaway was still open. He said: 'People know that Dr Food was closed down because of a dead rat and as a result there have been fewer customers walking through the door. 'He should have done a lot more with pest control. 'He accepts he is in a very sorry situation. I say that because he had no experience of how to run any of these premises before he started the shop. 'Mr Ahmed hoped to run it really well so he could live a better life. In reality he was chasing money and happiness. 'The business closed for five or six months and his landlord is trying to assist him. 'There has already been one punishment, and that's the damage to his reputation.'","Inspectors found large dead rat decaying in food storage area .

"Dr María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio from Mexico was photographed before and after her execution and the pictures were posted to her Twitter account . A citizen journalist who spoke out against organised crime in her city was allegedly killed by drug traffickers who used her own Twitter account to announce her death, according to reports. Dr María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio from Reynosa, Mexico, was brutally killed and her kidnappers hacked into her Twitter account to post a photo of a bloody, lifeless body. This was accompanied by a series of tweets, which started by saying: 'Friends and family, my real name is María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio. I am a physician. Today my life has reached its end.' The second warns others to close their accounts and says: 'Do not make the same mistake I did.' She was known for tweeting under the name Felina and @Miut3 handle with the hashtag #reynosafollow to warn others about crime in her city, which has a reputation for corruption. The Tamaulipas state prosecutor's office says it is investigating whether Dr Fuentes Rubio has been killed after being reported kidnapped by a gunman on Thursday. Dr Fuentes Rubio was an administrator for Valor por Tamaulipas (which means Courage for Tamaulipas), the most popular citizen news hub in the state. Her Twitter account was once used to share information about possible shootouts within the heavy gang and drug cartel community, but has since been suspended. The Valor por Tamaulipas Facebook group paid tribute to Dr Fuentes Rubio, calling her 'a doctor who was dedicated to informing the community about risks—with a heart as large as her courage.' Her kidnappers hacked into her Twitter account, which used handle @Miut3, to post a photo of a bloody, lifeless body on Thursday 16 . Dr María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio was killed and her kidnappers hacked into her own account to announce her death. The first tweet (shown at the bottom of the picture) said: 'Friends and family, my real name is María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio. I am a physician. Today my life has reached its end.' The second tweet (shown in the middle of the picture) said:  'I have no more to tell them. Do not make the same mistake I did not gain anything. Today I realise that.' The final tweet (shown at the top of the picture) said: 'I found death for nothing we are closer than you think.' She was known for tweeting under the name Felina and @Miut3 handle with the hashtag #reynosafollow to warn others about crime in her city, which has a reputation for corruption. Members of the group posted: 'Today, Miut3 stopped reporting. But the criminals do not know that Miut3 this in our soul and she never would surrender to organised crime.' The group received a threatening tweet a week before her death which said: 'We're coming very close to many of you watch out felina.' Reynosa lies within the state of Tamaulipas which borders Texas from east Laredo to the Gulf of Mexico. Two rival drug cartels in Tamaulipas have final say over what gets printed or broadcast in the local media, according to the Daily Beast. This means the people of the state increasingly have turned to social media to share information about organized crime and its infiltration of the government.

"10-time World Series of Poker title holder Phil Ivey denies what he did to win almost $22million at baccarat in Atlantic City and London. In an interview that will be broadcast on CBS 60 Minutes Sports Tuesday, Ivey denies he was cheating when the casino granted him special accommodations they chalked up to superstition. 'I'm viewing the casino as my opponent,' he said. 'It's my job to try to exploit weaknesses in the house and try to give myself the best opportunity to win.' Winner: Phil Ivey, who has won 10 World Series of Poker titles, is being sued by two casinos . The Borgata in Atlantic City and Crockfords in London both claim what Ivey did to win millions of dollars from them in 2012 is cheating. According to Ivey, both casinos agreed to certain conditions before Ivey sat down with a few million dollars to play. The player asked for a specific brand of playing cards, a shuffling machine, an Asian dealer and stipulated that the same card decks be used. The conditions helped Ivey use 'edge sorting' to exploit printing errors on the backs of playing cards that offset designs too far to one or the other side. Ivey's partner, Cheung Yin Sun, was with him at the baccarat table and instructed the dealer in Mandarin to rotate 'good cards' and 'bad cards' in specific ways before discarding them after a hand. The sorting machine maintained the positioning of these cards, Ivey explains, allowing him to know whether a 'good' or 'bad' card was coming based on small design imperfections. Withheld: Ivey leaves the Royal Courts of Justice, where he is fighting a lawsuit against the Crockfords casino . Team: Ivey with Cheung Yin Sun after arriving to the courts in London with their legal team, focused on a suit against Gentings, which owns Crockfords . Competitor: Ivey (right) stares down poker player David Moon during a hand at the 2009 World Series of Poker . In court filings, casino officials say they believed Ivey's requests were just superstition and not aimed at changing the odds of the game in his favor. The Borgata is suing Ivey to recover the $9.6million the player won, while Ivey is suing Crockfords for nearly $12 million after the London casino refused to pay. Officials with The Borgata and Crockfords didn't participate in the television interview because the companies don't comment on pending litigation. 'Some people believe that it was cheating,' Ivey said. 'I know it wasn't. The professional gamblers know it's not. I wouldn't do anything close to cheating. I mean, my reputation is everything in gambling.' Sun and two companions are also suing Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut for withholding money won using a similar 'edge sorting' tactic. Bluff Magazine records Ivey's lifetime poker tournament winnings to be just shy of $20million. In July, Ivey won his tenth World Series of Poker bracelet.","Ivey, 38, is accused of cheating the Borgata of Atlantic City and Crockfords of London at baccarat .

"The weather could turn out to be the most frightening thing this Halloween with a blast of freakishly cold weather set to the hit the Northeast and even the possibility of snow forecast in some areas. Bone-chilling air, rain and even some early-season snow will fall on parts of those regions on Friday, according to a forecast from AccuWeather. Frosty the Snowman might be a better Halloween costume than Dracula this year. After the treat - an exceptionally mild week with temperatures in the mid-60s - comes the trick as temperatures will drop towards the end of this week with high's forecast to be in the 50s on Thursday and Friday for Halloween. The cold front plunges through the Great Lakes early, then through the Ohio Valley and Appalachians. Rain may mix with, or changeover to wet snow in parts of Michigan, northern and eastern Wisconsin early to the Ohio Valley and Appalachians later in the day into the night. Bands of lake-effect rain or snow may set up . The storm will start out as a disturbance in the upper levels of the atmosphere, associated with a cold front near the surface on Friday. This front will move through the Great Lakes and into central New York, producing rain and wet snow showers as it does so . Kids and adults partaking in the Friday evening Masquerade will need to bundle up. Rain showers will stretch from along part of the Interstate-95 corridor westward to Pittsburgh, Buffalo and New York, as temperatures begin to tumble . A potent storm is heading for New England straight from northern Canada this weekend bringing with it the coldest air of the season down from the polar regions. It will feel more like December as temperatures will struggle to reach 40 degrees both Saturday and Sunday in the northeast. ""The dramatic change to colder air following late-summerlike warmth will be a shock for some people,"" wrote AccuWeather meteorologists Brett Rathburn and Alex Sosnowski in a morning forecast. ""Kids and adults partaking in the evening masquerade will need to bundle up and should consider bringing along a light or reflective items to increase visibility for passing motorists."" There is likely to be some snow in some areas where temperatures will remain in the 30s all weekend. Additional snow may fall over the Appalachians from east Tennessee and western North Carolina north to at least eastern West Virginia. Some wet snow may also linger in parts of eastern Lower Michigan, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western New York. Snow may develop later in parts of northern New England . Some snow, possibly heavy, in parts of northern New England, including some lower elevations. As of now, the best chance of snow looks to be in northern/eastern Maine . Although forecasters are not being specific in where snowfall may hit, it's almost a certainty. Regardless of how the storm plays out, it looks like Halloween night is not going to be a great night for trick-or-treating in many areas, as a raw, chilly wind sweeps in from the north across New England, and rain showers develop. Snow isn't all that unusual in the interior Northeast and New England this time of year: The season's first measurable snow usually falls during the first week of November in cities such as Buffalo, Syracuse and Burlington, Vt. And there have been other snow events around Halloween over the years, including the Halloween Nor'easter of 2011, which deposited a half a foot of snow or more from central Maryland to central Maine, . The clocks go back early on Sunday morning. A final reminder that winter is right around the corner. Nothing to panic over: o one is forecasting a repeat of the Halloween storm of 2011 that left 6 inches of snow in New York City and knocked out power to about 2.3 million customers .","Aside from the snow, wind chill temperatures will tumble into the 20s around the Great Lakes and the 30s in the Ohio Valley on Friday evening .

"YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki said that the site is working on a paid-for service, and is ‘optimistic that [users] will see it soon’ After a year of speculation, YouTube has given its biggest confirmation to date that it is about to launch a subscription music service. Speaking in California, YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki said that the firm is working on a paid-for service, and is ‘optimistic that [users] will see it soon.’ It is expected to rival Spotify by offering ad-free, and offline access to millions of videos. But Ms Wojcicki declined to say exactly when the service would launch while addressing the audience at Recode’s Code/Mobile conference in California. Prices have not been announced either. Speculation about YouTube’s Spotify rival began last year when ‘two people familiar with the matter’ announced its arrival was imminent. It is expected to allow playback of videos without adverts, and let people watch videos offline on mobile devices. This would match the options offered by Spotify on its own paid-for subscriptions, but with the added bonus of videos. Reports claim YouTube has already reached deals with all three major music labels - Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group - and many independent labels, representing about 95 per cent of all labels. But the sources added that a small number of independent artists who had not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked in some countries starting in a few days, even on the free version of YouTube. YouTube is rumoured to be looking at ways to block the music videos so users of the test version won't be confused about which content they can access for free and with features require payment. The move also adds pressure on those labels to sign, because not being on YouTube altogether will result in less advertising revenue and exposure. Speculation about YouTube’s Spotify rival began last year. It is expected to allow playback of videos with adverts, and let people watch videos offline on mobile devices. This would match the options offered by Spotify on its own paid-for subscriptions, but with the added bonus of videos, for example . It will not be the first time YouTube has experimented with paid-for plans. In May last year, the Google-owned video giant launched a paid-for subscription service that charged users from 79p (99 cents) a month to watch videos on specialist channels, such as Comedy.TV and PGA Digital Golf. YouTube has more 1 million channels. More than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month. Over 4 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube. 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. 70 per cent of YouTube traffic comes from outside the US. YouTube is localized in 53 countries and across 61 languages. In 2011, YouTube had more than 1 trillion views or around 140 views for every person on Earth. Individual channels charge more for a subscription if they choose to, and the majority of UK subscriptions charge £1.49 ($2.50) a month. Over 50 channels were launched as subscription-only, but not all paid-for channels can be subscribed to in the UK - namely Jim Henson Family TV, and National Geographic Kids. The revenue split between YouTube and the channel producers and musicians is expected to be similar to the 45-55 split that YouTube currently has with advertising revenue. At a media conference last year, YouTube's CEO Salar Kamangar said that a subscription model would give networks and producers a more direct line to their audience with lower costs. A Google spokesman added: 'We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models. 'There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we're looking at that.' It will not be the first time YouTube has experimented with paid-for plans.

"American imports are becoming all too common in Britain these days. But one Essex couple were shocked to see something far more unusual than a car or a candy bar more than 5,000 miles from its country of origin. Karen Beckwith saw a huge Harris Hawk, usually seen soaring above woodland in southern California, perched on a neighbour's 4x4. Bird of prey: The Harris hawk was spotted on a leafy street in Romford, Essex, thousands of miles from home . She spotted the bird, which appeared to have a collar around one foot, on a leafy road next to her street in Romford, on the border between London and Essex, last week. She immediately sent the pictures to husband Jeff, who rang the RSPB to report the sighting. Telecoms technician Jeff, 56, said: 'It was my wife that spotted it and took the pictures. The bird, which is thought to have escaped from a pest control company, was spotted sat on a Honda CR-V . The hawk, which had a collar around its foot, flew away from its perch as Jeff Beckwith reported the sighting . 'I think she only took the pictures because she didn't think I would believe her. 'All the other birds had flown to the uppermost branches and were calling to each other as if they were warning them about the hawk. 'It was such a magnificent sight.' But as Jeff rang the RSPB, the bird of prey flew away from its perch on top of the Honda CR-V. An RSPB spokesperson, who believes the bird had escaped from a pest control company, said: 'My advice is just to leave the bird alone and don't feed it because eventually they will find their way back to their owners. 'People with pets shouldn't be concerned.' Harris Hawks have a whopping wingspan of around 48 inches, and can take down prey more than three times their 1.5lb weight. Pictured in its usual habitat, a Harris hawk in flight prepares to land on dead limb in Rio Grande Valley, Texas . Named after 19th-century US naturalist Edward Harris, the hawks can have a wingspan of up to 5ft, with females about a third larger than males. Found in southwestern United States and parts of South America, including Chile and Argentina, other names for Harris hawks include Dusky hawk and Bay-winged hawk, . They can be identified by their dark brown and chestnut plumage and white-tipped tails. They are nicknamed the 'wolves of the sky' because they hunt in ‘packs’, which allows them to catch larger prey, usually in sparse habitats, such as desert, woodlands and marshlands. They eat rabbits, rats and birds but are themselves hunted by great horned owls. The oldest recorded life span of a wild Harris hawk is 12 years and seven months but this can increase to 25 years in captivity. Although sometimes spotted in Britain, these have most likely escaped from captivity as the species is one of the most popular for falconry. This is because they are one of the easiest species to train. A £60,000 Harris hawk was used to rid London's Trafalgar Square of its unwanted pigeon population.","Karen Beckwith spotted the hawk on neighbour's car in Romford, Essex .

"Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol is facing a barrage of criticism after the former France and Bayern Munich defender said African players are ‘powerful’ but seemed to suggest they lacked intelligence and discipline. In an interview with local newspaper Sud Ouest, Sagnol said: ‘The advantage of the typical African player is that he is not expensive when you take him, he’s generally ready to fight and he is powerful on the pitch. But football is not just that, it’s also technique, intelligence, discipline.’ Sagnol also hinted that he didn't want to sign many African players due to the African Cup of Nations which takes place during the Ligue 1 campaign. Willy Sagnol has been criticised for the comments he made regarding African players . Sagnol, pictured with Malian player Cheick Diabate during training, has been publicly backed by Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud . Ludovic Sane - Senegal . Abdou Traore - Mali . Henri Saivet - Senegal . Thomas Toure - Ivory Coast . Cheick Diabate - Mali . Andre Poko - Gabon . Wahbi Khazri - Tunisia . David Djigla - Benin . Former France full-back Lilian Thuram and anti-racism associations hit out at Sagnol, who has the backing of his club. ‘It’s laid-back anti-black racism,’ SOS Racisme said in a statement, asking that ‘the LFP (French League), FFF (French Federation) and the Sports ministry take immediate sanctions.’ Thuram said: ‘It is damaging that someone can hint that African players lack this or that quality.’ The International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) said in a statement: ‘These abject theories are those that during the course of history have led to some kind of men and women having their humanity denied.’ Bordeaux, however, stood by their coach, with president Jean-Louis Triaud saying on Wednesday that the interpretation of Sagnol’s remarks were ‘malicious’. In 2011, then France coach Laurent Blanc also came under fire after he attended a soccer federation meeting in November where the idea of quotas for Arab and African youth players were discussed. Blanc was cleared of discrimination charges following an inquiry by the French government.

"A pair of brothers who went on the run after operating what authorities call the largest drug ring in Detroit history were sentence to life in prison Friday. Carlos Powell, 39, of Washington Township and Eric Powell, 36, of Franklin Farms, were sent to prison after an extensive DEA investigation found a sprawling drug empire run by 13 people from 2006 to 2010. The top operators cashed in selling huge quantities of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, often smuggled in hidden compartments on semi-trucks and other vehicles driving cross-country. Carlos Powell, 39, and brother Eric Powell, 36, have received life sentences after running one of the largest drug rings in Detroit history . Authorities also seized more than $21 million in cash . The lucrative operation brought them $800,000 in jewelry, boats, and luxury cars from Ferrari, Bentley, Rolls Royce and Mercedes, The Detroit Free Press reports. One of the top level was even a former Democratic state representative Kenneth Daniels. Daniels, who helped hide Carlos Powell financially, was sentenced to one year in prison in September. But the brothers went on the run along with a third defendant, Earnest Proge, when the jury verdict came in. A national manhunt followed that ended with the three in custody. The U.S. Attorneys office said the group would send their drug money to Arizona, Mexico, and other states to purchase even more narcotics. Seized drugs credited to the group amount to more than 12 kilograms of cocaine, 30 kilograms of heroin, and 1,000 pounds of marijuana.

The men, who wores fezzes during the trail, begged for leniency, according to The Detroit News. 'I want to say I did not mean any disrespect to the court, Carlos Powell said, vowing to turn his life around if given a break, and saying he only fled because of fear of a life sentence. He also asked for leniency so he would not be gone when his three children needed him. Brother Eric Powell spoke only through his attorney, but also asked for a light sentence. However, Murphy said he could not help them. 'The problem is, I have less discretion,' he said. 'The choices he's made are abominable.' As Eric Powell left the courtroom in handcuffs, an unidentified shouted out, 'I love you, Eric.' 'I'll be alright,' he said.","Carlos Powell, 39, and Eric Powell, 36, were sent to prison after an extensive DEA investigation found a sprawling drug empire run by 13 people from 2006 to 2010 .

"K9 Tragedy: Montville police say its K9 officer, Beny, died from injuries consistent with heat stroke, while in the back of a police vehicle in the parking lot of the police department on September 28 . An Ohio officer whose police dog died from heatstroke in his cruiser has pleaded not guilty on two misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. The Medina Municipal Court clerk's office says an attorney filed the plea on behalf of Montville Township police Sgt. Brett Harrison. Police say the two-year-old German shepherd, Beny, died September 28 after Harrison left him in a cruiser in the station parking lot from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. failing to leave the windows open. More than four hours later, Harrison returned to the cruiser and discovered the dog laying lifeless in his rear passenger compartment's kennel. The temperature when the officer arrived on station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was found. Harrison previously issued a statement apologizing to the township, calling Beny a 'partner, friend and loving family member.' An investigation concluded Harrison violated policy and procedures. He received a two-week unpaid suspension and lost 40 hours of vacation. Montville Police welcomed K9 Officer Beny to the department in September 2013.

"Scientists believe green tea could be used to develop drugs to fight cancer . It has been shown to lower cholesterol, improve blood flow and protect against heart disease. And now scientists believe green tea could be used to develop new drugs to fight cancer. A chemical extracted from the beverage is an ideal carrier of proteins that combat the disease, according to research by the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, Singapore. Green tea is made up of a class of chemicals called catechins, the most abundant of which is EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate). It is believed EGCG is responsible for green tea's health benefits and could have anti-cancer effects. Dr Joo Eun Chung and her colleagues have shown anticancer protein Herceptin can combined with EGCG to form a stable and effective complex to deliver a drug to a tumour site. She said: 'When designing drug carriers, the drug to carrier ratio is an important consideration because the use of high quantities of carriers can result in toxicity as a consequence of poor metabolism and elimination of the carriers. 'However, these issues would be of less concern if both the drug and carrier had therapeutic effects. When injected into mice, the Herceptin loaded nanocomplex demonstrates better tumour selectivity and growth reduction, as well as longer blood half life, than free Herceptin.' 'It effectively protected the proteins against many obstacles from the point of administration to the delivery sites. The combined therapeutic effects of the green tea based carrier and the protein drug showed greater anticancer effect than the free protein.' The researchers injected the combination of EGCG and Herceptin into mice and found it was better at targeting tumours and reducing growth, as well as lasting longer in the blood. It is hoped the finding reported in Nature Nanotechnology could help build better drug delivery systems. When designing drug carriers several factors must be considered, including that it must be specific so it just attacks the cancer. Using high quantities of the carrier could result in toxicity if the body cannot metabolise it. The complex will be ineffective if the body attacks and eliminates it too quickly. A chemical extracted from the beverage is an ideal carrier of proteins that combat the disease, according to research by the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, Singapore .","Scientists believe green tea could be used to develop  drugs to fight cancer .

"It is the heartwarming moment rescuers spot a pair of eyes looking back at them from the bushes alongside a busy LA freeway. Rescuers were delighted when they found Iris the homeless dog who had been reported by a concerned member of the public and were even more surprised when they realised the injured pooch was guarding three young pups. Non-profit organisation Hope For Paws had to work hard to gain the trust of the terrified dog in order to try and coax her out of hiding for treatment alongside her puppies. Rescuers Eldad Hagar and Lisa Chiarelli had received a call received a call about Iris informing them that Iris was hiding in a den and rarely came out of hiding except to look for food late at night. After 10 minutes of searching in bushes Mr Hagar and Ms Chiarelli finally located the anxious dog and her puppies. Although the dog could easily have escaped she chose to stay with her puppies.

Mr Hagar says many times when Hope For Paws  go to the rescue location it may seem like they find the dog, but this is not always the case. He says, 'The search for the dogs is a challenging part of it because they usually hide. Finding Iris was difficult, but it could have been dangerous... we didn't know how she would react when we entered her den, and there is always a risk when going to these rough neighbourhoods in the middle of the night.'

Costing £6,000 and available with bluetooth and iPhone connections, it is a far-cry from its 70s namesake . Details of the Viva revival as a sharply styled small hatchback are revealed in the latest edition of motoring magazine Auto Express. The original Viva was launched in June 1964 with the first ‘HA’ model with a 1.0 litre engine coming off the Vauxhall production line at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. Many teenagers of the era learned to drive in the popular cars, which were a middle-class family favourite. Such is its understated but enduring charm, the car has even  been mentioned in an Elvis Costello song. The last time the Viva name was seen was in 1979 on a small family saloon car – a forerunner to today’s Astra - after a 15 year run during which 1.5million Vivas were sold. The slightly larger, re-styled and re-worked  second generation ‘HB’ Viva was unveiled in 1966 for a four-year run before being overtaken by the ‘HC’ which ran until the Viva’s demise in 1979, to be replaced by the Astra. The 'HC' model Viva was built at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire from 1970 to 1979 costing from £783 . After a 35 year gap bosses at the UK car-maker have decided the time is right for a return in its UK heartland. In 2004 the Viva name was briefly used on a car created Vauxhall’s parent company General Motors for Russia. But this will be the first time  since 1979 that it will be used in its home market of Britain. The new Viva is set to go on sale next Spring after being unveiled officially at the Geneva Motor Show in March. It will cost £6,995 designed to  take on small rivals such as the Ford Ka, Hyundai i10, plus the Volkswagen up!, Skoda Citigo and SEAT Mii. The new city hatchback will only be called ‘Viva’ in the UK – marking the first time in more than 20 years that Vauxhall and Opel, its German-based General Motors sibling, will use different names for a car in the UK and mainland Europe. Auto Express editor-in-chief Steve Fowler said: ‘It’s great that a cherished British name is being revived. 'Many people will remember being driven as children in a Viva on family outings, or even learning to drive in one. Viva became a middle-class favourite and will be remembered by many as they car they learned to drive in . The optional extras on the 1970s model included three or four doors and did just 30 to 37 mpg . 'Vivas were a solid, unflashy but popular and practical family car which many remember fondly.’ Sadly, the new generation five-door Viva city car will not be built like the original at Ellesmere Port,  but in Korea. It will share the underpinnings of the next generation Chevrolet Spark. But insiders say GM’s European design team, led by Briton  Mark Adams, has worked hard to give the car its own unique look. There’ll be five doors and easy access, while dynamically the new model is said by Vauxhall insiders to focus more on comfort and refinement than sporty handling. Auto Express’s Mr Fowler said: ’Expect some typical Vauxhall design cues. There’ ll be swept-back headlamps with distinctive LED daytime running lights, a large Vauxhall badge sitting on large chrome wings on the grille.’ ‘Space will be key to the new Viva’s appeal. To keep the costs down There won’t be the huge array of options seen on other small cars. 'But inside  different finishes have been used on the plastics to give a more stylish, premium look.’ There will be some modern must-have technology on board – such as  Bluetooth and -  iPod connectivity - but potential buyers are warned not to expect the cutting-edge infotainment systems which would simply make the car too costly. To keep running costs and emissions  low, the  new car is expected to be powered by  Vauxhall’s latest family of small, economical engines  such as the new three-cylinder, 1.0-litre engine. Vauxhall is aiming to keep emissions – on which road tax is based- to under 100g/km which would mean an average fuel economy of around 70mpg. An all-new, British-built Vauxhall Astra set to be unveiled at next year’s Frankfurt Motor Show.","Original Vauxhall Viva 'HA' was launched in 1964 and cost from £527 .

"Nik Stauskas, a Sacramento Kings rookie, claimed  he was targeted on the court because he's white . A newly drafted Sacramento Kings players has reignited a race debate in the NBA after claiming that he expects his opponents to attack him on the court 'because I'm a rookie and I'm white.' Nik Stauskas, a 6-foot-6 shooting guard from Ontario, Canada, made the comments after his first appearance on an NBA court on Sunday. He gave up eight points to the Toronto Raptors in the second quarter, including a dunk by Terrence Ross, and was targeted again and again by the Raptors offense. After the preseason game, which the Kings lost 94-99, the 20-year-old Stauskas told a Sacramento Bee reporter: 'I understand that I’m a rookie and I’m white, so people are going to attack me at all times. 'Just coming out there in the game, I felt it right away.' Stuaskas was picked eighth overall in the NBA draft this summer after playing two successful seasons with the University of Michigan Wolverines. He is considered a likely star of the NBA in the future for his strong three-point shooting ability. However, Yahoo Sports points out that the Raptors likely targeted Stauskas because he's new to the league and because scouting reports listed him as weak on defense. On Monday, it seemed he may have been regretting his words. He posted a quote on his Twitter account: 'Work in silence, let success make the noise.' Stauskas was targeted time and again by the Toronto Raptors' offense and gave up eight quick points in the second quarter . Raptors' player Terrence Ross is seen here leaving Stauskas in his dust. Scouting reports say the 6-foot-6 Canadian was likely to be a defensive liability . Stuaskas' claim, that there is a double standard for whites in a league where more than three quarters of the players are black, is not new. White and black players have been talking about it openly since the 1990s - at least. In a 1997 Washington Post story, white players complained that they were stereotyped as only being three-point shooters and that they were slow and a liability on defense. 'You can stop your man nine times in a row and if on the 10th time your man gets around you and dunks on you, you're too slow. It's a form of labeling that goes around in the league,' Washington Bullets player Tim Legler told the Post at the time. Even veteran NBA players have acknowledged the racial overtones. Last year when Minnesota Timberwolves star Kevin Love received NBA honors for 'Which player does the most with the least?' he deemed it the 'White Guy' award. The 6-foot-10 Love, who was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers this year, is considered one of the best white players in the league - even though he's never led his team to the playoffs, or even a winning record. Kevin Love, center, joked about getting the NBA's 'white guy award' when he was given honors for 'Which player does the most with the least?' Love is 6-foot-10 .","Nik Stauskas, a 20-year-old Sacramento Kings rookie, claimed there is a double standard for white players in the NBA .

"Hi-tech: Ian Hopkins, pictured, of Greater Manchester Police, has suggested that the public should start reporting crimes using web services such as Skype . The days of reporting crimes by walking into a police station or dialling 999 could soon be over, as one of Britain's top officers has predicted that the public will start using Skype to contact police instead. Ian Hopkins, deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, argues that modern technology such as social networks can make the police more responsive to the demands of the public. However, he also admitted that it would help the force save money in a time of squeezed budgets which is likely to lead to a reduction in the number of officers. Critics have spoken out against the idea of reporting crimes online, arguing that it is no substitute for face-to-face contact - and expressing concern that the online phone service could compromise crime victims' privacy. But Mr Hopkins said today that he would consider setting up Skype conversations between police and victims or witnesses of crimes. While it is not exactly clear how the proposal would work, it is possible that 999 callers would be able to leave their details with an operator and get a Skype call back from a duty officer. Mr Hopkins said it was 'paramount' to ensure that the public could speak to an officer directly, but argued that Skype is as good a way of doing that as meeting in person. He added: 'For instance in Boston they have an app where people can report graffiti when they see on the street and that goes straight through to someone in the works department to do something about it. 'It takes a whole lot of cost out and obviously those sorts of opportunities exist for us in the police as well.' Bobbies on the beat: But budget cuts are likely to reduce the number of officers in most forces . Similarly, insurance firm Aviva allows customers to register mobile phone thefts online and make a claim for a replacement within minutes. The policy would be a drastic change from current practice - Greater Manchester Police, like most other forces, explicitly tells the public not to report crimes via Twitter and other online media. However, some have suggested that police could be using technology to lessen the impact of budget cuts - for example, Greater Manchester Police faces a 25 per cent cut to its funding over the next few years. In response to a similar scheme mooted by Bedfordshire Police last year, the  Police Federation claimed that the plans could be a 'substitute' for rigorous policing. 'When police forces embrace new technology it should not be as a means of coping with the effects of budgetary cuts,' vice-chairman Steve White said. Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of the charity Victim Support, told MailOnline: ‘Anything that makes it easier for a crime victim to make a report to the police is welcome, as long as victims can be sure they are transmitting information confidentially and there is no assumption that they all have the technology or want to make a report this way. ‘Reporting a crime remotely is one thing, but cannot replace a “scene of crime” investigation. If the police don't do a thorough investigation, there is a big risk that critical evidence could be missed and that would mean criminals are more likely to get away with it.’ However, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police emphasised that Mr Hopkins's remarks do not represent the force's official policy, and there are no immediate plans to start accepting calls via Skype.","Ian Hopkins of Greater Manchester Police calls for greater use of technology .

"Ukip’s new MP Douglas Carswell was the subject of a behind-the-scenes plot to steal his seat in the House of Commons today – after a secret ambush was launched by Labour MPs. A group of working class northern MPs – who call themselves the ‘awkward squad’ – sit on the Commons front bench to the left of Labour leader Ed Miliband. The prized position gives outspoken left-wingers the chance the barrack Tory MPs. But after Mr Carswell was returned to the Commons as Ukip’s first elected MP last week he gate-crashed the Labour MPs’ prized spot – allowing him to attack the Government from one of the most prominent spots in the House. Scroll down for video . Labour MPs arrived before Prime Minister's Questions today to grab the best seats so Douglas Carswell could not sit with them . The move caught Labour MPs off guard – with a group of Labour MPs last week refusing to take their position in the Commons because they were on strike in solidarity with civil servants union the PCS. But the MPs caught out by Mr Carswell’s move organised an early ambush of the Commons ticket office to grab the best seats before the new Ukip MP arrived today. Hard-left MP Grahame Morris put in his request for a seat at 8am this morning alongside other members of the awkward group. The group included veteran MP Dennis Skinner, and a contingent of North East MPs including Ronnie Campbell, Grahame Morris and Ian Mearns. Liverpool MP Steve Rotherham was also present. But there plot was rendered pointless after Mr Carswell failed to show up - choosing to go campaigning in Rochester for Tory defector Mark Reckless instead. Last week Mr Carswell took up position with Labour's 'awkward squad' of MPs - leaving many of them unhappy .

The Ukip MP also met Tory peer Lord Ashcroft - a long-time critic of the Prime Minister David Cameron . One of the MPs told MailOnline that Mr Carswell was trying to win northern votes for Ukip by sitting with working class Labour members. He said: ‘There’s no way we are going to let him sit with us and claim he is one of us. He is more Tory than the Tories.’ Another gleeful MP declared: 'There's no room at the inn for UKippers.'

"Karren Brady and her daughter Sophia, pictured at a movie premiere last year. Brady has revealed she encouraged her daughter to learn . Celebrity businesswoman Baroness Karren Brady has joined the growing list of wealthy stars to declare an insistence their children must work to earn their own way through life. Brady, who is the vice-chairman of West Ham United and a judge on the BBC television show The Apprentice, has revealed she encouraged her daughter Sophia to take up a Saturday job at a Solihull branch of Hollister's. She said work place demands taught teenagers basic communication skills and developed their personality much further beyond just academic success. It also taught them how to better interact with others, which spending too much time in front of computer and smartphone screens would not. Following in the footsteps of the Beckhams, Kim Kardashian and Sting, Brady, 45, told the Sunday Times her daughter 'folded clothes, hoovered and worked on the till' during her Saturday shifts. She said: 'It helped her realise there is a whole world outside school of different experiences and places. 'It helped her develop her personality, not just academic skills.' Brady also revealed Sophia, who is now 18, and studying at university, is funding her studies and living expenses with a student loan - which Brady refuses to pay off. Last year Brady told the Huffington Post her own first job was sweeping the floor at a hairdressers. Role model: Karren Brady featuring in last week's episode of The Apprentice, where she acts as Lord Sugar's eyes and ears . She said: 'My own career began when I joined a hairdressers to sweep the floor. It wasn't a job that on paper I wish for my daughter, though the skills I learnt there put me on the right path.' She joins a growing number of celebrities who have expressed a desire for their children to learn the value of hard work. In May, it was revealed David and Victoria Beckham's son Brooklyn had taken up a job at a West London coffee shop where he was paid £2.68 an hour.

A member of staff, who did not want to be named, confirmed he had worked a few shifts and ‘got on OK’ with other baristas. News of his decision to make his own money and not sponge off his wealthy parents earned him praise as a good role model for other teenagers. Last year David Beckham said: ‘We try to lead by example, by showing them it’s important to work hard. ‘That’s one of the key things me and my wife have always done … We juggle everything around the family because our main priority is the children, simple as that, and it always will be, but being hardworking is the best thing you can show children.’","Karren Brady reveals her belief youngsters should learn workplace demands .

"Mousa Dembele has responded to Gary Neville’s suggestion that Tottenham are ‘weak’ and ‘never ready’. Former Manchester United defender Neville blasted Mauricio Pochettino’s team after they capitulated against Newcastle United at White Hart Lane a fortnight ago to lose 2-1. The SkySports pundit insisted he always suspected Tottenham were ‘weak up here (in the head)’ after they let their half time lead slip in the Barclays Premier League match. Mousa Dembele has hit back at Gary Neville's criticism that Tottenham are mentally weak . Newcastle's Ayoze Perez scored the winning goal in the second half as the Magpies beat Spurs 2-1 in October . 'When I think of (Mauricio) Pochettino at Southampton, a team that always seemed ready, they were always alert. You never thought you could catch them out, certainly not with what I’d call basic tactics like this. ‘And yet when you talk about typical Tottenham, he’s got to affect the culture at that football club and it runs right the way through it. ‘This is a coach who had a bright team, an alert team last season. He’s got to affect the culture at this football club. ‘It’s what I think of Tottenham historically, never ready, weak, weak up here (in the head), and they have to change that culture. ‘I think Pochettino needs to be given two or three years to run amok through that club to get rid of that type of attitude.’ Neville added he felt Pochettino developed a far more composed team at Southampton and that the ‘culture’ at White Hart Lane is in need of a revamp. Tottenham found themselves on the ropes in yet another second half on Thursday evening. The north London club held on to a scrappy 2-1 win over Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League and, while Dembele insisted Neville’s criticism was news to him, the Belgium international was quick to defend. ‘I think we’re not weak but I didn’t hear this. I think we think differently about this,’ said Dembele. ‘Every team has some weaknesses and we have our own things to think about. ‘We need to be ready quicker, from the first minute. We did it in the first half and then in the second half we didn’t expect them (Asteras) to come at us. ‘We were too relaxed and this cannot happen again. We need to speak about it. ‘Personally there are some reasons why in the second half we didn’t do so well but we will talk with the team about it. A lot of people have their opinion so we will talk internally. ‘We were surprised by them. It can’t happen again because we could have ended up drawing or losing. ‘We need to learn that even when we’re 2-0 up it’s not over yet. That’s the lesson.’ Dembele is to be reunited with manager Mark Hughes on Sunday when Stoke visit White Hart Lane. Neville (right) blasted Spurs for being mentally weak after losing to Newcastle last month . The pair worked together at Fulham, with Hughes handing Dembele his Premier League debut against Manchester United in August 2010. And the 27-year-old Tottenham player praised Hughes for getting his career in England going. ‘For me he was a very good manager,’ Dembele said. ‘It was my first year in the Premier League and he spoke a lot with me. ‘Maybe the most important thing was the confidence he gave me. How he spoke with me and he made me important in the team. It made me feel very important and that’s a big thing. ‘Everyone can see (Stoke) are a good footballing team now. Before they did different things. ‘In general he is a coach who gives confidence to his players and likes to play football as well, which you see at Stoke now.’ Dembele (centre) will be hoping to start for Spurs when they host Stoke in Sunday's Premier League clash .","Tottenham lost 2-1 at home to Newcastle in the Premier League last month .

"London Underground workers plan to cripple the network next week with a 48 hour strike. The walkout  starting next Tuesday evening has been called because of a long running dispute over Boris Johnson's plans to close ticket offices. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union have been instructed not to book on for any shifts between 9pm on October 14 and 8.59pm on October 16. The walkout threatens travel disruption in the capital and coincides with strikes by council workers and civil servants across the country in separate disputes over pay and job cuts. Scroll down for video . Misery: There were chaotic scenes at Tube stations earlier this year that will likely happen again next week after staff called a 48-hour strike starting next Tuesday . Dispute: Unions have been in a long-running row with Tube bosses, and held several strikes earlier this year . Earlier this year the unions caused chaos with a string of Tube strikes over the same issue. The latest phase of action in RMT's Every Job Matters campaign follows a mass meeting of reps to report back from talks with London Underground. The union said that although some limited progress has been made its executive has taken the view that it is not enough after months of negotiations and that the only option is to move back into a further round of strike action. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: 'RMT negotiators have made every effort in the long-running talks to resolve a range of issues that impact on our members jobs, their pay and working conditions and the safety of the services that they provide to the travelling public. 'The cuts, currently being bulldozed through, would de-staff whole areas of the Tube system at a time of surging passenger demand and would make evacuation and other basic safety procedures a physical impossibility. 'The axing of ticket offices and station staffing grades would render the Tube a no-go zone for many people with disabilities and for women travelling alone. The cuts ignore the realities of life that we saw when services broke down last week and the recent surveys which point to an increase in violence and sexual assaults. This photo was taken on the night before the February strike, where a London Underground ticket office worker appeared to be sleeping in her chair at Paddington station. Tube bosses want to shut them so staff can help people on the concourse . 'RMT will not stand back and allow Government-driven austerity cuts to hollow out the Tube system and leave it as a dangerous shell. We are also fully aware that the current cuts are just part of a multi-billion pound attack that will include such lethal ideas as driverless-operation. 'The strike action next week is designed to force the mayor to instruct his senior officials to back away from this toxic cuts package and engage in serious and meaningful negotiations.' Unions have been campaigning against plans to close ticket offices since they were unveiled last year. London Underground say few tickets are bought at offices now, arguing that staff would be better used by being stationed on concourses.","RMT calls on members not to go to work in row over ticket office closures .

"As a boy growing up in the shadow of a shipyard in Wallsend, Sting would watch majestic vessels being built, and being launched into the river to set sail to far-off, exotic destinations. This month he was welcomed on board one of the world's most revered cruise liners Queen Mary 2 in New York as a one of the most celebrated headliners to ever perform in the ship's Royal Court Theatre. The 16-time Grammy Award-winning musician honoured the community in which he was raised by performing songs from his musical The Last Ship, which arrived in New York last week from a debut run in Chicago. Returning to his roots: Wallsend boy Sting is honouring his youth growing up near the shipyards . Songs of the seas: The musician performed numbers from his musical The Last Ship on board Queen Mary 2 . 'I was born and raised in Wallsend in the shadow of the Swan Hunter shipyard,' the 63-year-old said. 'My earliest memories are of ships being built and launched into the river. 'You couldn’t escape Swan Hunter – there was a coal mine at one end of town and Swan Hunter at the other, so these ships loomed over our houses. 'With The Last Ship, I thought I would try and honour the community that I came from. Because everyone around me worked in the shipyard. My grandfather worked in the shipyard. All his brothers worked in the shipyard. My family has had things to do with the sea for many years.' 'Honouring my community': Sting will also perform to benefit shows in Gateshead next year with Cunard Line . In the shadow of a shipyard: The singer's whole family worked at Swan Hunter shipyard in Wallsend . Over the years, 15 of Cunard Line's ships were built in the Tyneside shipyard, including Mauretania and Carpathia. For this reason, Sting chose the Queen Mary 2 to perform his set, which included songs from the musical as well as tracks such as ‘An Englishman in New York’. The superstar will also team up with Cunard again to perform songs from The Last Ship in the UK at two sold-out benefit shows at the Sage Theatre Gateshead. 'It’s only right and fitting to take this story back in some form to the people who inspired it, so I’m really happy to do that,' he said. Stage debut: Sting's new musical The Last Ship arrived on Broadway from a preview run in Chicago . Premiere: The Grammy winner and wife Trudie attended a star-studded premiere performance last week . The Last Ship had its pre-Broadway premiere at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago over the summer for a short 33-day run. Last week, it made its glittering debut on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre, with stars including Robert de Niro, Liam Neeson, and Billy Joel turning out to support Sting. The musical charts the course of Gideon Fletcher, a shipbuilder's son who leaves his girlfriend, Meg Dawson, and his hometown of Wallsend in search of a better life. He returns 15 years later after his father's death to a town hit by recession, where the shipyard has closed and his lover has moved on.","Grammy-winner sang numbers from his new musical The Last Ship .

Livingstone, a Republican, doesn't think his extraordinary background or his list of controversial past clients harms his chances. He said: ‘Without going into detail that I can't, I have served as a liaison for my government and others in terms of dealing with most of the difficult people on Earth. ‘There is a necessity to work with some of the bad guys in the world. You are not going to find these people in church or wherever. ‘I am not recommending prostitution to anyone, nor did I say I engaged with prostitutes,’ Livingstone said of the yacht episode. ‘I took my wife. She was the only non-hooker on board.’ Mercenary: Leaked documents showed Neil Livingstone offered to help Gadhafi flee the revolution - in return for millions of dollars . This spectacular list of exploits was removed from his campaign website late last week after he decided that ‘salacious’ excerpts from his long biography could give people the wrong idea. Livingstone most recently ran a company he started in 2007 called Executive Action — the same term used by the CIA in the 1950s to refer to their assassination operations. He started that company after leaving another called GlobalOptions Inc., which billed itself as a ‘private CIA.’ Livingstone said in an interview that he wound down operations at Executive Action in order to return full time to his home state and run for governor. Two individuals with intricate knowledge of the business, however, told The Associated Press in interviews that Livingstone had no choice but to lay off staff and close the doors. The former associates, speaking only on the condition of anonymity due in part to the close-knit nature of intelligence-related businesses, said Executive Action's only substantial client stopped paying and it was unable to recruit other meaningful business. Not true, said Livingstone. Unwinding the company was a ‘conscious decision,’ but he couldn't delve into details for ‘reasons that are obvious.’ The front page of Livingstone's campaign website features revolving photos, including one of him and his running mate, former Navy SEAL and current state senator Ryan Zinke, standing back-to-back holding pistols.

"Governments' refusal to send troops and the World Health Organisation's bungling response to Ebola has cost lives, aid charities say. A catalogue of errors has led to the outbreak teetering on the brink of becoming the 'definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation', Oxfam said as it made a rare appeal for troops to be sent to west Africa. The charity accused world powers that did not send soldiers of 'costing lives', warning that there was a two-month window to curb the spread of the virus. Scroll down for video . A woman crawls towards the body of her sister as it is removed by Ebola burial team members in Liberia, but charities say the response could have been quicker . Oxfam added that while it was possible to stop the spread of the virus, there is still a lack of logistical support, making the task near impossible. A 'brain drain', which has seen medical staff leave the worst-affected nations to countries such as Britain, has left parts of western Africa ill-equipped to deal with the crisis. According to The Observer, Medecins Sans Frontieres executive director Vickie Hawkins said: 'We are angry that the global response to this outbreak has been so slow and inadequate. 'We have been amazed that for months the burden of the response could be carried by one single, private medical organisation, while pleading for more help and watching the situation get worse and worse. West Africa's 'brain drain': Most of the brightest medical students moved to wealthier nations, leaving the virus-hit nations ill-equipped. Slow to act: WHO and Western countries have been accused of reacting slowly to the crisis, with aid still only trickling through. Incompetent workers: Dr Peter Piot, who discovered Ebola, says WHO's regional office in Africa did not act when the virus began to spread. Lack of information: An internal report from WHO suggests people in the worst-affected nations were not made aware of how to deal Ebola. Bureaucracy: The same leaked document says 'politically motivated appointments' held up the UN agency's response. Not enough money: World powers, including Italy, have been accused of not donating enough aid to countries tackling Ebola. 'When the outbreak is under control, we must reflect on how health systems can have failed quite so badly. But the priority for now must remain the urgent fight against Ebola – we simply cannot afford to fail.' Ebola has claimed the lives of 4,500 people so far, with 8,914 infected, although the true number is far higher. The worst-hit nations are Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. According to a leaked internal report from WHO, who are organising the international response to the crisis, serious mistakes were made while dealing with the virus' spread. The report says the UN agency acted too slowly in its response to the initial Ebola outbreak and that 'politically motivated appointments' created too much bureaucracy. 'Nearly everyone involved in the response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall. A perfect storm was brewing,' it says. While many of the richest countries have donated aid to the crisis-hit region, people have called on some nations to up their efforts. The UK has donated £75million to the cause, more than all except the U.S., and David Cameron has called on other European countries to double their contribution. The Prime Minister has also sent 750 troops to western Africa. More than 4,500 people have died from Ebola in western Africa, and this number will continue to grow until world leaders send more troops to the region, Oxfam said . Shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy said Ebola was an 'existential threat to some of the countries that are affected by it' in Africa. Speaking on Sky News, he said: 'This has taken the entire world, including the United Kingdom, far too long to get to a position of dealing with this as effectively as it should. 'The early warnings of this were in March and April of this year and it's now taken the world until this moment to see the scale of the disaster.' He said the UK was 'doing well' in the scale of its response but other countries had to do their bit. 'The fact is the founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has given many more times the donations than countries like Italy. Ikea, the furniture warehouse, has given more or about the same as Italy. 'So there are countries that aren't doing enough and we have to say that publicly and we have to try and persuade them. But if countries like Italy won't do their bit we have also got to embarrass them.' Dr Peter Piot, who discovered the Ebola virus, said WHO had acted far too slowly. He said: 'It's the regional office in Africa that's the front line. And they didn't do anything. That office is really not competent.' WHO refused to comment.","Oxfam says the world's slow response to the Ebola crisis has 'cost lives'

"The Liberal Democrats achieved the lowest share of the vote of any major party in a by-election since 1948. Nick Clegg’s party lost its deposit for the seventh time since 2010 with Andrew Graham clocking up just 1.4 per cent of the ballots cast in Clacton. As well as being the Lib Dems’ worst performance this Parliament, it is the second worst for any major party since the Second World War. In the Clacton by-election, Nick Clegg's party lost its deposit for the seventh time since 2010 - candidates lose their money if they get less than 5 per cent of the vote, a major humiliation for a governing party . Only the Liberal hopeful in the Glasgow Camlachie by-election of 1948 fared more poorly. He got 1.2 per cent of the vote. Candidates lose their deposit if they score less than 5 per cent of the vote: a major humiliation for a party of government. In Clacton, the Lib Dems slumped to fifth place, amassing just 483 votes and a 1.4 per cent share – down from 12.9 per cent at the 2010 election. On Thursday they came behind Ukip, the Tories, Labour and the Greens – although they did manage to beat the Monster Raving Loony Party. In Heywood and Middleton, the Lib Dems narrowly managed to save their deposit – with their vote share at 5.1 per cent. At the last election, they got 22.7 per cent of the vote. They totalled 1,457 votes on Thursday. Andrew Graham (far right) picked up just 1.4 per cent of the vote last night. Only the Liberal hopeful in the Glasgow Camlachie by-election of 1948 fared worse with just 1.2 per cent . Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik tweeted: ‘In Middleton & Heywood by-election, Lib Dems seemed to lose larger proportion of vote to Ukip than Tories did. Am I the only one to notice?’ He attacked Lib Dem ‘inertia, leaving a vacuum that Ukip are filling’. Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: ‘The Lib Dems once performed incredibly strongly in by-elections. They were outsiders. 'Now, however, they are a party of government and it is much more difficult for them. 'They are haemorrhaging votes in seats that aren’t theirs. We have never had a government party perform so badly.’ The Lib Dems’ worst performance in terms of votes since the general election was in South Shields in May 2013, where they got 352 votes – seventh position – and a tiny 1.4 per cent share.","Lib Dems got just 1.4 per cent of vote compared with 12.9 per cent in 2010 .

"November 20, 2014: With the news of Mike Nichols death, the MailOnline is re-running this article originally published in September . When Diane Sawyer met Mike Nichols, the Oscar, Grammy and five-time Tony winning director was a drug addict, hooked on the sleeping pill Halcion, and floating in a black depression. He was having a nervous breakdown and lost in ‘Halcion madness’ with thoughts of going crazy, losing all his money and dying. For that brief moment in time in 1986, when they first met in a Concorde lounge at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, they professed to be each other’s hero and it was profound love at first sight for both the Ice Princess and the Golden boy. Golden couple: When they first met in a Concorde lounge at an airport in 1986, Diane Sawyer and Mike Nichols they professed to be each other’s hero and it was profound love at first sight . Diane's choice: Always asked why she didn't have children, Diane responded that she would have had them under different circumstances ‘but I chose Mike and Mike already had three children with two other women, and he was fifty-eight when we married' Isn't it romantic: 'I think one of the most romantic things is simply the way he reaches for my hand all the time, ' Diane says of her director husband . He was fifty-four and Sawyer, then a 60 Minutes correspondent, was forty-one. They were swept up into each other’s universe within moments, made a lunch date that confirmed their affection. But then Nichols disappeared. Diane was in disbelief and hurt. She had achieved so many of her ambitious dreams but now it seemed like the most desired dream of all had evaporated and she had no control, reveals a sensational new book, The News Sorority: Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour – and the (Ongoing, Imperfect, Complicated) Triumph of Women in TV News by Sheila Weller, published by Penguin Press . Mike Nichols didn’t want Diane to see his madness. ‘I didn’t want her to see me as I was. I went totally crazy. As soon as I was okay, I called her up’, the author quotes Nichols. The director had been introduced to the medication that is used to treat insomnia while in the hospital for a minor heart procedure. He was quickly addicted and then his world began to fall apart. Hallucinating that he was losing all his money, he began selling his prize collection of Polish Arabian horses he kept on a farm in Bridgewater, Connecticut. Diane was the impetus for Nichols getting help. He had another bombshell secret to confess. He was left permanently hairless after a botched whooping cough vaccination at age four. He’s always worn a wig, fake eyebrows almost his entire life. There is not a hair on his body. One of the first things Nichols did was break up with an unnamed media professional he had been involved with for two years after his third divorce. At the time, Diane was living with Richard Holbrooke, a former assistant Secretary of State for Asia who was an investment banker with Lehman Brothers. With an impressive Foreign Service career, Holbrooke was a ‘superbly connected high achiever’ as well as being Diane’s ‘primary guidance counselor’, writes Weller. Green with envy: Jackie Kennedy dated Nichols herself. 'She was possessive. She didn't like him dating Diane,' according to a friend . He was shocked and devastated by his sweetheart’s sudden decision to move into her own unfurnished apartment. She owned no furniture, bought no furniture. ‘I have no taste’, Sawyer admitted. ‘When I’ve had the option of going to a movie or looking at [furniture fabric] swatches, that wasn’t even close. I’d rather send out for pizza and sit on my floor pillows’. Nichols, the director of such iconic films as The Graduate, Carnal Knowledge and Working Girl, was shocked by her style of living at the height of her glamour and success. But that all changed when the couple moved into a Park Avenue hotel penthouse apartment. Nichols took care of furnishing it with an exquisite collection of art and furniture while ‘Diane stayed proudly un-domestic for years, leaving niceties to Mike. She learned how to cook --- in a way. She cut out multiple versions of a recipe and they sometimes cooked together but it wasn’t something she had a desire to master. Twenty-eight years later, she is now the vegetable police making sure Nichols eats well. The couple married in April 1988 on Martha’s Vineyard where they have a second home when not in residence at their Upper East Side Manhattan apartment. ‘My ultimate happiness began in 1988 when I married Diane. She is the perfect wife’. It was the director’s fourth marriage. ‘In the first ninety seconds’ of meeting the iconic director in the airport lounge, she knew ‘that my life was changing’, and that ‘he was the center of the dance’. But she wasn’t considered the perfect wife for Nichols by his erudite theatre friends. ‘The arts circle thought that Diane was not up to Mike and they still feel that way’, Weller quotes a long-time friend of Nichols. Say cheese: Barbara Walters referred to Sawyer as ‘That Girl’. Diane was always one step ahead in booking wars, writes the author. Three's a crowd: ‘I don’t have a husband who’s a Hollywood director! I don’t have what she has! That Girl can book everybody,' Walters complained . Add Jackie Onassis to that list of disapprovers. ‘Mike was a love of her life. Jackie was very covetous of Mike. She was possessive. She didn’t like him dating Diane,' according to a friend. Lila Diane Sawyer was born in Glasgow, Kentucky, in December 1945 but the family soon moved to Louisville, where the little girl was enrolled in talent classes at an early age to prep for future beauty pageants staked out for her by her mother. She captured the crown for America’s Junior Miss in her senior year at Seneca High as well as ‘most likely to succeed’, which she viewed as embarrassing. But the Junior Miss title won her a cash prize that allowed her to pay tuition at Wellesley College, an elite, liberal women's college in Massachusetts. It was a major transition into a sophisticated arena for the 5’9” southern blonde. In the 1970s, she worked for the Nixon Administration and after the president’s disgraced resignation in 1974 following the Watergate scandal, she headed out to his hometown in San Clemente, California, to help him research and write his memoirs. Media liberals in New York had a hard time coming to terms with her loyalty to Nixon in the early years. Diane’s work ethic and successful lifestyle infuriated Barbara Walters who referred to Sawyer as ‘That Girl’. Diane was always one step ahead in booking wars for the big-get interviews. Barbara put in her request only to find out that Diane had already requested that person. Balancing act: Diane learned how to juggle her two worlds – ‘the sweatpants and Nellie Bly stories in the office, the sophisticated evenings with Mike and his friends,' write Weller . Barbara talked about Mike Nichols. ‘I don’t have a husband who’s a Hollywood director! I don’t have what she has! That Girl can book everybody! I don’t have these dinner parties. I don’t go to Martha’s Vineyard. I don’t even have a house’. But it was an exaggeration because Barbara had her own ‘axis of connections’ and at one time had been married to Merv Adelson, one of Hollywood’s most successful network television show producers. ‘There was a New York media elite, and Barbara always felt like an outsider, and that feeling is what drove her’. Diane was in the media elite with a style so different from Walters. She was part of the team and willing to go to the edit room and work with the producer on a script. Diane learned how to juggle her two worlds – ‘the sweatpants and Nellie Bly stories in the office, the sophisticated evenings with Mike and his friends, sometimes with campy repartee’. This was Diane’s element. She could be working up until midnight in the editing room, eating plastic-bagged okra, collard greens and salty potato chips – Southern comfort snack food. A quick trip to the bathroom, she’d emerge in fresh makeup and high heels to go home to her husband. They became a media power couple. If a high profile friend of Diane’s was being pursued by Katie Couric for an interview, Mike Nichols picked up the phone and told their friend ‘that he and Diane would essentially cut off all social contact if they appeared on Today’ with Couric, the author claims. Always asked why she didn’t have children, Diane responded that she would have had them under different circumstances ‘but I chose Mike and Mike already had three children with two other women, and he was fifty-eight when we married. And I chose him’. ‘He is my only marriage’. The spark in their love affair has not diminished. She admits he is more romantic that she is. ‘He puts little notes in my sock drawer or in my suitcase before I leave for a work trip. 'I think one of the most romantic things is simply the way he reaches for my hand all the time’. ‘We rarely fight and I remember once when we were arguing he stopped in the middle of it and said, ‘Well, this is sort of fun, too’. And it was! 'It was good to know that we could get out our strong feelings but that we were indestructible at the same time’. ‘Falling in love really does have a sort of going-over-to-the other-side feeling to it. Giving something up. Dying. Giving up balance, equilibrium, some kind of safety, and just sliding through this unknown and slightly terrifying country, where you become unnervingly like the enemy’, Weller quotes Nichols. ’The other side. Just belonging to somebody: the end of all games’. ‘I had loved other women before but not like this’.

"David Miscavige, the ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion, first announced plans to build an 'Ideal Advanced Organization and Continental Base for Australia and the Asiatic region' in October . The Church of Scientology has spent millions of dollars purchasing land in Sydney for the development of an enormous new facility that will serve as an Asia Pacific headquarters for the religious group. David Miscavige,  the Chairman of the Board ReligiousTechnology Center and ecclesiastical leader of the Scientology religion, announced the organisations plans to build an 'Ideal Advanced Organization and Continental Base for Australia and the Asiatic region' during a church celebration on October 17. Mr Miscavige revealed the plan to build a '130 thousand square feet' facility overlooking Sydney's Lane Cove National Park to over 7500 guests, according to Scientology.org. 'Here, Scientologists from Tasmania to Tokyo will traverse the upper realms of the Bridge to Total Freedom.' At least three properties in Chatswood West on Sydney's north shore have been purchased by the church for the new facility. The sites, at 126 Greville Street, 23 and 25 Millwood Avenue, were bought up for over $37 million, according to News Limited. The president of the Church of Scientology, Vicki Dunstan, confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that the organisation had purchased the sites. Ms Dunstan said the new facility would provide 'more advanced theological studies' than those available at the existing Sydney church on Castlereagh Street. 'The Church is developing a plan that allows for administrative functions, ancillary uses and theological studies for parishioners and staff. The site provides more advanced religious studies and services for existing members of the Church,' she said. A development proposal for the sites on 126 Greville Street, 23 and 25 Millwood Avenue at Chatswood West in Sydney's north have been submitted to the local council . 'In addition to providing spaces for Scientology religious services, the new site will house the management arm of the Church with offices which work on developing and running our community and social reform programs.' However, Terry Fogarty, the Secretary of the Chatswood West Progress Association, told Daily Mail Australia that Willoughby City Council was unlikely to approve the organisation's development application until early 2015. Prior to lodging their application a month ago, Mr Fogarty said that church members had informed local residents in the area of their development plans, and assured them 'that they're not door-knockers'. 'There will be no development on the site – they'll be doing an adaptive reuse of the existing building,' Mr Fogarty said. 'The building is something like a big concrete block building with massive walls and aromatic chambers at the bottom of the building, a big foyer area and a big auditorium. Australian singer and cabaret star, Kate Ceberano, was awarded one of the Church of Scientology's highest honours during the IAS's October 17 event that also commemorated the organisation's 30th anniversary . 'They said there will be three 40-seater buses that will be used to bring people from their residential facility in Dundas and the residential blocks will be used as bus drop-offs.' 'The feeling we have from residents is that it might be better than some of the other options that might occur on the site – originally it was going to be 350 units, but that got knocked back and reduced.' The headquarters will be open to the public as a place of worship from 8 am until about 9:30 pm each day, according to Mr Fogarty, but also be used for ecclesiastical teaching and office administration. Australian singer and cabaret star, Kate Ceberano, was awarded one of the church's highest honours during the IAS's October 17 event that also commemorated the organisation's 30th anniversary. The third generation Scientologist received the International Association of Scientologists' Freedom Medal Award in a lavish two-day ceremony. 'It has taken a tribe to help keep the show on the road. And by that, I mean three generations of my family, all supporting the IAS and who will continue to do so until society has all the tools necessary to bring about sanity and an improved culture,' she said upon receiving her award.","The International Association of Scientologists has purchased at least three properties at Chatswood West in Sydney's north .

"An Iraq War veteran accused of jumping a fence at the White House pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges that he ran into the presidential mansion while carrying a knife. A lawyer for defendant Omar Gonzalez, David Bos, entered the plea on his client's behalf in a 20-minute proceeding that grew contentious because of a disagreement between Bos and US Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson. Wearing a standard prison-issue orange jump suit, Gonzalez sat attentively at the defense table but did not address the court. Scroll down for videos . Hearing: This courtroom artist rendering shows Judge Deborah Robinson, left, presiding during White House fence jumper Omar J. Gonzalez's , center, case in court in Washington Wednesday . Robinson wants Gonzalez to undergo a forensic screening to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. Bos opposed that, telling reporters he does not want to provide the government with an extensive amount of information about his client that would be revealed by a forensic screening. Bos said Gonzalez is competent to stand trial, an assertion that marked the start of a dispute over whether Gonzalez will have to undergo the screening. Relatives have insisted that Gonzalez, who served three tours of duty in Iraq, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. He retired in 2012 after losing part of his foot in an IED explosion. A three-count federal grand jury indictment issued Tuesday accuses Gonzalez of unlawfully entering a restricted building while carrying a deadly weapon, a federal charge. Security breach: The 42-year-old Iraq war veteran Omar Gonzalez is accused of jumping a fence at the White House on September 19 armed with a knife and running through much of the main floor . US Marshals and officers from the Federal Protection Police guard the outside of The United States District Court for the District of Columbia during Gonzalez's preliminary hearing . He also was indicted in the September 19 incident on two violations of District of Columbia law — carrying a dangerous weapon outside a home or business and unlawful possession of ammunition. Following Gonzalez's arrest, investigators recovered more than 800 rounds of ammunition, a machete and two hatchets in his car. The indictment said the ammunition consisted of eight types, including 12 gauge shotgun shells and .45 caliber rounds. The judge handling the case will be US District Judge Rosemary Collyer, who was nominated for the post in the first term of President George W. Bush. Omar Gonzalez, of Copperas Cove, Texas, was captured inside the White House September 19 with a knife after he jumped the fence on the north side of the presidential mansion, ran past five rings of security, burst through the front door after overpowering a Secret Service officer and ran about 130 feet into the East Room, used for events and receptions. According to a report by The Washington Post, Gonzalez was able to single-handle elude a plainclothes surveillance team outside the gates; a Secret Service officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn; a Belgian Malinois attack dog, and a guard standing on the door of the White House. Warrior: In this undated photo provided by Nancy Hoover, Omar Gonzalez poses for a photo in his Army uniform with his former wife Samantha, prior to an overseas deployment . The incident occurred shortly after 7pm, only minutes after Obama and his daughters, along with a guest of one of the girls, left the White House aboard Marine One on their way to Camp David. At a congressional hearing Tuesday on the breach, lawmakers asked Secret Service Director Julia Pierson how Gonzalez escaped greater scrutiny. In July, he was arrested in Virginia for reckless driving, eluding police and possessing a sawed-off shotgun. In August, he was stopped, but not arrested, while walking along the south fence of the White House with a hatchet in his waistband. On high alert: Secret Service agents stand watch on the roof of White House September 30 in the aftermath of the breach more than a week earlier . Ousted: US Secret Service Director Julia Pierson (C), pictured during a Congressional hearing Tuesday about the security breach, submitted her resignation Wednesday . On Wednesday afternoon,  Pierson resigned in the face of multiple revelations about bumbling in her agency and rapidly eroding confidence that the president and his family were being kept safe. President Barack Obama 'concluded new leadership of that agency was required,' said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.","Omar Gonzalez, 42, from Texas, entered a not guilty plea through his attorney to charges stemming from September 19 incident .

"Trinity College's May Ball is one of the biggest events of the year at the elite university, and, for some students, it's also the perfect excuse to invite their favourite popstar to visit. The #TaylorAtTrinity campaign, spearheaded by undergraduate Harriet Gordon, consists of a playful recreation of Taylor Swift's hugely successful single 'Shake It Off' - filmed at some of the most iconic spots on campus. Aside from the video, students have also launched a widespread social media campaign across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, in hopes of getting Taylor's attention. Cambridge students have launched a #TaylorAtTrinity campaign, complete with 'Shake It Off' music video . Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off' music video, uploaded on August 18, has received over 240 million views . 'The idea started when a group of us were listening to her new album in the library,' Harriet told the MailOnline in an email. 'We absolutely loved it and couldn't concentrate on our work, so we decided to send her a photo with an 'I love 1989' sign, as she often replies to fans. 'It kind of snowballed from there. 'Everyone was in a bit of a slump - halfway through term tends to do that - so I thought it would be great to do something different and fun.' The #TaylorAtTrinity video, conceptualised by ndergraduate Harriet Gordon, has almost 10,000 views . The idea to record a music video first started while listening to Taylor Swift's new album in the school library . The filming of the video itself was completed in just two and a half days, though Harriet admits that it was 'quite tricky organising everyone in between lectures.' The picturesque Trinity College provided the perfect backdrop for the brilliant video, which wound up involving about 60 students from start to finish. 'It's such a beautiful place to live and none of us want to take it for granted, so it was a great opportunity to show our pride for the place,' the second-year Human, Social and Political Sciences student added. Filming - on the iconic Trinity College campus -  took just two and a half days and involved about 60 students . 'Shake It Off' has been certified 2x platinum in the United States and certified gold in the United Kingdom . 'We want her to appreciate how many dedicated fans she has here,' Harriet says . Though the ultimate goal is for the pop superstar to perform at the college's May Ball, Harriet insists that she'd be happy simply to learn that Taylor had seen the video. 'We want to her appreciate how many dedicated fans she has here who wanted to do something special for her,' she said. A sought-after student event, the first official First and Third Trinity May Ball was held in 1866 and has evolved significantly in the last 148 years. This year's May Ball will be held on June 15, 2015 - and as of right now, it does look like Taylor just might be available. She’s scheduled for a performance on June 13 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and her next 1989 World Tour date isn’t until June 20 in Cologne, Germany. Perhaps she'd fancy a day off in the English countryside?","Undergraduates launch video campaign for popstar to perform at May Ball .

"The search for an Australian grandmother, who has been missing for more than a month in India, has been ramped up, as local authorities investigate her 'unusual' disappearance. Toni Anne Ludgate, 75, was on a regular trip to India doing charity work in an ashram when her family became concerned after they had lost all communications with her. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra have sent consular officials to Bangalore, where Ms Ludgate was last seen, to help local police with their investigation. Toni Ludgate (pictured right) with daughter Traci Harding (pictured left) Traci last spoke to her mum on her birthday on August 28 . Toni Ludgate (pictured) with two of her grandchildren was last seen getting out of a cab in Bangalore with an older lady on September 23 . The Sai Baba search team (pictured) have been on the ground, following leads to sourced as much information about Toni Ludgate's disappearance as possible . Her daughter, best selling author Traci Harding, who last spoke to her mother on her birthday on August 28, says she was reportedly last seen getting out of a cab with an older lady on September 23. 'The landlord of the lodge she was staying at, had reported she paid an extra five days rent before leaving in a cab with an older lady in Bangalore. After that we never heard from her,' she said. Ms Ludgate's bank account had also not been touched and her ticket home to Sydney  was found in the apartment. 'I think when she didn’t get back to unit there were alarm bells.' 'That part of India has recently been hit by a tornado, communications have been down, so there's a lot going on.' Friends of Ms Ludgate at the Prasanthi Nilayam (Abode of Supreme Peace) ashram, where she regularly did volunteer work, have been on the case to find her since concerns were raised. Ms Harding says they took up the case, followed up on leads and even got their legal team involved. 'They really have been fantastic,' she said. She said they felt the crime scene, where her mother was last seen, had not been handled properly as the local authorities didn't have the capabilities to do an extensive search. Toni Harding's (pictured centre) family have been looking for her since September 23 when she was last seen. DFST consular officials and India's head of state have now got involved in an investigation to find her . Toni Ludgate (pictured right) with her daughter Traci Harding (pictured left) who says she couldn't ask for a better reaction with the past few days authorities in India and Australia getting involved in the search for her mother . That's when the call for help came out, for higher authorities to get involved. 'DFAT Canberra have come to the party,' said Ms Harding. 'Also a couple of days ago, Indian officers were notified and are seeking answers.' 'Head of the state (India) is looking at the case himself, sending his own team to reassess information. They have had a meeting with the police commissioner but I haven’t heard the outcome, just waiting on the investigation to advance,' she said. 'The past few days what they've been doing in India and Australia, I couldn't ask for a better reaction.' 'Consular officials are overseas in Chennai dealing with it, they have gone to Bangalore with the commissioner to be on the ground.' Earlier Ms Ludgate's family created a petition on change.org to persuade Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to ­approach the Indian government and try to get Indian federal police involved. It clearly worked with the government department now doing everything they can to follow on on the grandmother's disappearance. 'She was a complete sweetheart, when we were young everybody came to our place, they were always welcome, she was always taking care of people,' said Traci Harding (pictured right) of her mother Toni (pictured middle) A facebook page called 'Find Toni Ludgate' has also been put up to inform friends and loved one of any information that comes forward . A facebook page called 'Find Toni Ludgate' has also been put up to inform friends and loved one of any information that comes forward. 'Mum touched the lives of so many people, so we wanted to create somewhere for people to express their concerns, for people who knew her,' said Ms Harding. 'She was a complete sweetheart, when we were young everybody came to our place, they were always welcome, she was always taking care of people.' While not knowing what has happened to her mother, Ms Harding says she's trying not to panic and think positively that they will eventually find her. 'You can't just collapse into misery, your useless to everyone, I am dealing with it, like it is as a case.' 'There's been a huge outpouring of emotion from other people, which really gets you, but I've been dealing with it day by day and really staying calm,' she said. 'I hope we hear from her soon, that’s the hope.'","Search for Toni Ludgate, 75, who has been missing in India for more than a month, has ramped up .

"The deep red wine in my glass was tempting me. But this time I didn't just say 'Cheers!' and take a sip, swiftly followed by another. Four words from Susie Barrie, Master of Wine - best known for pairing wine with food on the TV show Saturday Kitchen, were ringing in my ears… 'Stop. Look. Sniff. Taste.' The previous evening, Susie had given an entertaining and informative talk on how to enjoy wine at its best. Now here I was, at the end of a tour of the vineyards and cellars of family-owned Chateau Siaurac, using my new knowledge on a splash of Chateau Le Prieure, a St-Emilion Grand Cru Classe, admiring its legs, swirling, sniffing, swilling to discover fruit, spices, mineral and floral notes. Bigger, better, faster, more: Viking has just launched a new fleet of river cruisers, serving several countries . Susie and I were aboard Viking Forsetti for a few days, taking a taster of Viking's new Heart Of Bordeaux cruises, which sail from the city on one-week itineraries on the Gironde estuary and Garonne and Dordogne rivers. Two days before our trip, Susie had helped set a new Guinness World Record for the most ships inaugurated within 24 hours by one company, when she became godmother to Viking Heimdal (named after the Norse guardian of the gods) in a triple christening in Avignon on the Rhone. The day before, Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry had swung the champagne to christen Viking Alsvin (a mythological Norse horse) in a ceremony in Amsterdam during which nine new ships were named. With four more half-built ships christened via satellite in a shipyard in Rostock, the number of new vessels totalled 16. And by the end of the same week yet two more Viking ships, Torgil and Hemming, were launched in Oporto, Portugal, to sail on the Douro. Although Viking's presence on the rivers of Europe has rocketed, cruises for 2014 are almost sold out, mostly to American visitors. And Viking aren't stopping there - their first ocean ship, Viking Star, sets sail next year. The new 'longships' with their difficult names (such as Gullveig, Hlin and Ingvi) sailing on the rivers of France, the Danube and Rhine are all very similar. They all have tasteful, understated Scandinavian-style decor using natural fabrics and wood finishes. There is a choice of four cabin styles - mine was an airy two-room suite with a full balcony in the sitting room and a French balcony in the bedroom - but no pools, gyms, beauty salons or bicycles. The emphasis is on going ashore, and the food and wine. Rather than safe, international fare, as I had expected, I was delighted to find French dishes, such as soupe de poisson and boeuf bourguignon on the menu, served with Bordeaux wines (drinks with meals are included in the fare) and regional specialities such as local cheeses and pastries. Duck and sturgeon, smoked on board, were some of the adventurous appetisers. On shore, we had time to take escorted tours and explore on our own. I enjoyed a walking tour of St-Emilion down a steep street cobbled with pebbles from the beaches of Kent. They had been picked up and transported here in the Middle Ages as ballast by ships returning to France after trading wine. Raising a glass: Caroline learned how to taste, test and savour a fine drop of wine on her latest river cruise . I visited the eerie and unusual monolithic church, carved out of a cliff by a returning crusader, and tasted local macaroons - not the brightly coloured type stuck together with goo that are so popular now, but delicious brown, chewy ones, similar to the traditional ones at home. One day there was an option (for an extra charge of £145) to join a whole-day excursion to Cognac, to tour a historic distillery, blend our own brandy and take the unique bottle home in a handsome wooden box. Just the thought of brandy mixed by me gave me a hangover, so instead I spent a pleasant morning on board cruising from Bordeaux up the estuary to Blaye on the right bank. Blaye, I discovered, is a small town with a big citadel, commissioned by Louis XIV to protect Bordeaux from the British. Tucked inside its great walls is a tiny village, with craft shops, restaurants and a wine cellar in the quaint buildings. Grassy lawns scattered with daisies were strewn with children, taking a break from their clip boards on a history field trip. From the ramparts I had sweeping views of the estuary and the impressive form of Viking Forsetti moored below, waiting to take us back to Bordeaux. Viking River Cruises (www.vikingcruises.co.uk, 0800 319 6660) offers an eight-day Heart Of Bordeaux river cruise from £1,545 in 2015 if you book by the end of the month. This includes return flights, full-board accommodation with wine, beer and soft drinks, and five guided tours.","River cruise specialist has just launched a range of new luxury longboats .

"Israel denied deliberately targeting hospitals in the region as rockets continued to blast the Gaza Strip on the second day of fighting since the collapse of the three-day ceasefire yesterday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government said that it started targeting 'terror sites across the Gaza Strip' in response to Hamas rockets fired in the early hours of Friday - shortly before the ceasefire collapsed at 6am UK time. Meanwhile, the White House joined the UN . in condemning the collapse of the truce, which ended in the deaths of . five Palestinians, including a 10-year-old boy. Israel launched more than 30 aerial attacks in Gaza on Saturday, while Palestinian militants fired rockets at Israel as the conflict entered a second month - defying international efforts to negotiate an agreement for an extended ceasefire. The renewed fighting shattered a brief calm in . the month-long war which has claimed more than 1,960 lives, and dealt a . blow to Egyptian-led efforts to secure a long-term cease-fire between . the territories.

Israeli forces said that more than 70 have been fired from the region since the end of the ceasefire . The Israeli government's comments come as the White House joined the UN in condemning the collapse of the truce. The White House urged Israel and the Palestinians to do what they could to preserve civilians after having failed to extend their ceasefire. Spokesman John Earnest said on Friday 'the United States is very concerned' about the renewed violence. While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . expressed 'deep disappointment' at the failure to extend the cease-fire . and urged the parties to swiftly find a way back to the negotiating . table, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said. Earlier, . Amnesty International claimed it has evidence that Israel's military . forces have specifically targeted hospitals, health workers and . ambulance personnel during the conflict. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told Sky News: 'We don't target hospitals, we don't target civilians.' He . added: 'What we've had to do on a number of occasions is to hit . terrorist targets in the immediate vicinity of hospitals and things like . that, where they've abused them.

Elsewhere, residents returned to bomb-hit homes to see the devastation caused by the more than 30 rockets fired at the Gaza Strip since Friday morning. Hamas have fired more than 65 rockets at Israel, . military officials said, with one injuring two Israelis on Friday. Meanwhile, the UK, which has already contributed . over £17 million to help those affected by the conflict in Gaza, has deployed a world-class team of NHS staff directly to the region within the next 48 hours . to help treat hundreds of those affected by the crisis. Announcing the decision today, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'The . conflict in Gaza has taken a terrible toll. The UK has been at the . forefront of humanitarian efforts to help those affected and it is right . that we see what more we can do.

A . ten-year-old boy is believed to be among three Palestinians killed in . an airstrike near a mosque in Gaza City on Friday, in which five other . children were injured, health officials have said.

Three . bodies were found under the ruins of the al-Qassam mosque in Gaza, . including that of senior Hamas official Moaaz Zaid. Meanwhile, two . Palestinians were killed when their motorcycle was struck, according to a . senior Palestinian official. A . rocket that hit the Sdot Negev regional council of Israel injured a . civilian and a soldier, according to a tweet from the Israeli military. It took to the social network to declare that it had struck 33 sites in . Gaza, though it did not specify where they were, while six rockets had . hit southern Israel. The military said that more . than 70 rockets have been fired from Gaza since the end of the . ceasefire. Israeli tanks also fired into northern Gaza and Israeli gunboats targeted the central area of the strip, according to reports. Tensions . have also been growing in the West Bank where protesters have clashed . with Israeli troops. Reports say two Palestinians have been shot dead, . one on Friday and one on Saturday. A . Palestinian man died of a bullet wound during a confrontation with . Israeli soldiers in the city of Hebron, health officials said on . Saturday.

The Israeli military took to Twitter to say that they had struck 33 targets in the Gaza Strip since midnight after the truce collapsed yesterday morning . Israel . disputes that breakdown, saying more militants have been killed. Sixty-seven people have been killed on the Israeli side, including three . civilians from rocket fire. The . war grew out of the killing of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in . June. Israel blamed the killings on Hamas and launched a massive arrest . campaign, rounding up hundreds of its members in the West Bank, as Hamas . and other militants unleashed rocket fire from Gaza. On . July 8, Israel launched an air campaign on the coastal territory, . sending in ground troops nine days later to target rocket launchers and . cross-border tunnels built by Hamas for attacks inside Israel. Gaza . militants have fired more than 3,000 rockets into Israel. Hamas, . which violently seized control of Gaza in 2007, rejected several . cease-fire offers throughout the fighting. Its primary demand is the . lifting of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after they seized power. Militants had warned they would resume fighting after the cease-fire . expired unless there was a deal to ease the restrictions. The . blockade, which Israel says is needed to prevent weapons from reaching . Gaza, has led to widespread hardship. Movement in and out of Gaza is . limited, and the economy has ground to a standstill and unemployment is . over 50 percent. Israel has said that the militants must disarm first, a demand dismissed by Hamas. Hamas entered the Cairo talks from a position of military weakness, as Israel has said Hamas has lost hundreds of fighters, two-thirds of its rocket arsenal and all of its tunnels under the border with Israel during the war. Egypt also has destroyed a network of smuggling tunnels that was once Hamas' economic and military lifeline. A delegation of Palestinian negotiators remained in Cairo in hopes of salvaging the talks. But participants said the negotiations were not going well. The Palestinian delegation met again late Friday with Egyptian mediators. Azzam al-Ahmad, head of the Palestinian delegation, said the delegation would stay in Egypt until it reaches an agreement that 'ensures' the rights of the Palestinian people. 'We told Egyptians we are staying,' he told reporters. The Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks left Egypt on Friday morning, and it was not clear if it would return. 'There will not be negotiations under fire,' Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said. Egypt's Foreign Ministry urged restraint by both sides and called for a new cease-fire to resume negotiations. The ministry said progress had been made in the talks but did not explain.","Israel denies deliberately targeting hospitals in the Gaza Strip, saying attack is focused on 'terror sites'

"Mike was a rock in the England team I was privileged to coach and was always one of the first names on the team sheet. I dropped him just once — that was for the 2003 World Cup semi-final which was totally a tactical call because I particularly wanted two ball players in midfield against the French, so I brought in Mike Catt. Come the final against Australia, Mike was straight back in alongside Will Greenwood because, among other things, I wanted him to sort out Stirling Mortlock, which he did in style.

Crunch: Mike Tindall flies into Australia's George Gregan during England's 2003 World Cup win . Joy: Mike Tindall (second right) celebrates winning the 2003 World Cup final with his team-mates . VIDEO Tindall last 2003 World Cup winner to retire . That semi-final week in Sydney demonstrated the full measure of the man. Mike was totally supportive of the team and unquestioning of my difficult call, despite the disappointment. He remained just as energetic and committed in training and as vocal in the changing room, in fact more so. He was the complete model professional. Mike came into the England team when we started to rebuild after the 1999 World Cup, and his partnership alongside Greenwood served us magnificently well. He was sometimes under-rated but not by me or any of the England guys who played alongside Tinds. He was very strong, ran a nice outside curve, had a big clearing kick, was hugely brave in the tackle and contact area and had a much better passing game than he was given credit for. For a few years, Mike was as good as any centre in the world, right up there with Brian O’Driscoll. Take a look at the recording of England’s 2003 Grand Slam decider against Ireland at Lansdowne Road and watch their battle carefully. Much to learn: Sir Clive says Manu Tuilagi (centre) is not yet in the class of Mike Tindall . Setting the standard: but Mike Tindall in his pomp was as good as Brian O'Driscoll (centre) Tindall, in his pomp, would walk into the current England team in that problem outside centre spot. I rate him above Manu Tuilagi although Manu is still fairly young and has the potential to take his game to another level yet. The ultimate team man, Mike was always at the heart and soul of the group. At meetings he was generally fairly quiet and attentive, but as the game approached he would always start to energise proceedings and he was a strong, confident voice in the dressing room. He was hugely respected by his peers. When Mike was called before the RFU Disciplinary Board after the 2011 World Cup, I had no hesitation in appearing as a character witness for him at the hearing at Twickenham. I was very proud to do so. I believe what happened in New Zealand was blown out of proportion, and I thought it important that somebody reiterated his complete devotion to England over a long career. Watching on: Mike Tindall was assistant coach for the Barbarians against England earlier this year . New hobby: Mike Tindall poses for pictures during his celebrity golf classic in Newport earlier this year . Early days: Mike Tindall goes over for Bath as they beat Wasps 36-12 at Loftus Road in 2000 . Mike will make an exceptional coach and I’m encouraged to hear he might be looking in that direction. He listens, absorbs and learns, and those are great traits when you match them with his love of the game and instinctive understanding of what makes players tick. He’s the last of the 2003 squad to hang up his boots but I don’t lament that passing of time. We all sort of drew a line in the sand at England’s 10-year reunion last November, which was a great occasion but I suspect possibly the last time we will ever all get back together in the same room for a function. Everybody is out there now living their new, busy, ‘different’ lives, heading off in different directions, which is how it should be. Everybody becomes an ex-player eventually.","Tindall retired from rugby after 17 years in the game on Tuesday .

"A mother of a student whose body was found on a motorway in Germany 12 years ago believes he was tortured by a right wing cult in the days before his death. Erica Duggan says her 22-year-old son Jeremiah, from north London, died after attending a youth event organised by the far-right 'cult'. The German police concluded that his death was 'a suicide by means of a traffic accident'. But the Jewish student's family have never accepted that ruling and in May 2010 the High Court ordered a fresh UK inquest after judges said evidence of possible foul play must be investigated. Today it was announced the inquest will start next March. Campaign: Jeremiah Duggan, 22, was found dead on a German motorway in 2003 in an apparent suicide but his mother Erica has successfully fought for a new inquest . Jeremiah, a student at the British institute and the Sorbonne, went from France to Weisbaden in Germany to join what he believed was a protest against the war in Iraq. His mother believes Jeremiah began to be aware and criticise the virulent anti-Semitic views of the group. Mrs Duggan struggled to hold back tears as she told a pre-inquest hearing what she had learned about the 'dangerous' techniques used by groups like these to control their members, and the unwillingness of the German investigators to look into it. Jeremiah, a student at the British institute and the Sorbonne, went from France to Germany and was staying in this apartment block Weisbaden before he died . She told North London Coroners Court: 'In the past 11 years there has been an unwillingness to look at the danger that can cause an innocent person like Jeremiah to become a victim. This is a danger I was ignorant of. 'There has been an unwillingness to look at what the danger is. This is the danger that leads to extremism, which is particularly common today, the danger that leads young people to become suicide bombers and destroys communities . 'This is what is called in France mental manipulation and subjugation, and which with the rise of social media and new techniques becomes very dangerous. 'Trying to find out what happened to Jeremiah might help people shake off this fear and its different forms. 'There has been an unwillingness to look into the psychological harm caused to him.' During the hearing, she also accused the German investigators of 'time wasting' in order to ensure the case was not properly investigated. She said she had asked repeatedly for Germany to send a mutual aid request to France to allow the courts to access evidence into Jeremiah's death, but during a recent visit to France she discovered the requests had not been received. She said: 'There has been terrible time wasting. The case started in France, there is a law in France, Picard's Law, which makes what happened to Jeremiah in terms of the mental manipulation a crime. 'I spoke to the highest French authorities to see if they had received the mutual aid request from Germany, they had heard nothing. 'They are hoping to delay the inquest by dragging the investigation on. The same person who destroyed evidence in the first investigation is holding this one up.' Coroner Andrew Walker ruled there was enough evidence for an inquest to be carried out and set a date for March 17 next year. Tragedy: Mr Duggan died in Germany in 2003 and was found here on Route 455, the Bundestrasse, near Weisbaden . He said: 'I have no doubt the inquest should proceed. But I am not here to investigate the investigators. I am here to determine the circumstances behind Jeremiah Duggan's death.' Mrs Duggan expressed her relief that, after nearly 15 years since her son died, she might finally have answers. She told the court: 'This inquest will expose the dangers of what happened to Jeremiah and will mean his family won't have to go on struggling and will allow his family to come to terms with his death.' After the hearing she added the German legal system was 'broken'. She said: 'It is clear his death has not been investigated. In my view Germany's higher court has no method of ensuring the investigation will be carried out. 'I am glad the inquest will be held and the time has come to expose the danger he faced.' Speaking after the hearing she claimed: 'My son was subjected to sleep deprivation, mental manipulation and other coercive techniques. I have evidence Jeremiah was subjected to that from his lecture notes and briefings.'","Jeremiah Duggan, 22, killed himself in 2003, the German authorities said .

"More than 5,000 servicemen and women have perished fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade. Each one of them has left behind grief-stricken parents, siblings, spouses and children - as well as bedrooms frozen in time. In his new book Bedrooms of the Fallen, award-winning photographer Ashley Gilbertson reminds us that those young men and women were not just statistics reported on CNN - they were full-fledged individuals with hobbies, interests and passions reflected in the haunting black and white images of their old rooms. The parents of the fallen have left the . bedrooms just as they were, creating the unsettling illusion that at any . moment, their son or daughter could come through the door and resume . their lives. Long Island pride: Marine Cpl. Christopher Scherer's room in East Northport, New York, is filled with stickers and pennants celebrating his college, Hofstra University, and local sports teams . Far-flung locales: New York City-based photojournalist Ashley Gilbertson has travelled to more than a dozen cities in the U.S., Canada and Europe, including Bitetto, Italy, where he captured Corporal Luigi Pascazio's old bedroom . Rare glimpse: Each room in Gilbertson's collection is a window on the life of the soldier who once occupied it, among them Army Spc. Ryan Yurchison's childhood room in Middletown, Ohio, with an American flag shaped into a triangle sitting on his bed . Each room in Gilbertson's collection is a window on the life of the soldier who once occupied it, with high school diplomas adorning the walls, football helmets, old pictures, knickknacks and childhood toys. So far, the New York City-based photojournalist has travelled to more than a dozen cities and towns in the U.S., Canada and Europe, capturing the rooms of 40 men and women between the ages of 18 and 27 who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bedroom of Corporal Luigi Pascazio in his native Bitetto, Italy, which he likely once shared with a sibling, has a pair of beds with pillowcases bearing a photo of the 24-year-old who was killed by a roadside bomb in May 2010 near Herart, Afghanistan. Army Pfc. Karina Lau died when her . helicopter was shot down by insurgents in November 2003, in Falluja, . Iraq. She may have been a warrior on the battlefield, but the . 20-year-old was also just a girl: her old room in Livingston, . California, contains plush animals on the bed covered with a flowery . spread, and whimsical figurines lining the bookshelves. Never forgotten: Marine Cpl. Christopher G.

He was from East Northport, New York; Corporal Luigi Pascazio (right), 24, from Bitetto, Italy, was killed by a roadside bomb in May 2010 near Herart, Afghanistan . Tragic final act: Army Pfc. Richard P. Langenbrunner (left), 19, committed suicide on April 17, 2007 in Rustimayah, Iraq. He was from Fort Wayne, Indiana; Army Spc. Ryan Yurchison (right), 27, from Middletown, Ohio, returned from a tour of duty in Iraq suffering from PTSD and died from a drug overdose in his dealer's house in 2010 . Marine Cpl. Christopher Scherer, 21, was a true Long Islander. Inside his room in East Northport, New York, the walls are plastered with stickers and pennants celebrating his college - Hofstra University - and local sports teams. In Army Spc. Ryan Yurchison's childhood room in Middletown, Ohio, an American flag shaped into a triangle sits on his bed next to a stuffed Kuala bear, surrounded by music posters, a photo of the soldier with his comrades and an assortment of bubbleheads. The 27-year-old returned from a tour of duty in Iraq suffering from PTSD, which resulted in his death from a drug overdose in his dealer's house in 2010. The parents of Marine Cpl. Jennifer Parcell have been lovingly watering the plants filling their daughter's bedroom in their home in Bel Air, Maryland. On her bedstand sits a small Buddha figurine next to a vase with fresh flowers; on the adjacent wall hangs a poster celebrating the U.S. Marines. Girly girl: Army Pfc. Karina Lau may have been a warrior, but the 20-year-old was also a just girl: her old room in Livingston, California, is filled with plush animals seated on the bed covered with a flowery spread . Hallowed ground: Gilbertson said in the beginning it was difficult to convince grieving parents to open their homes to a stranger and allow him into their late child's room. Here is pictured the bedroom of Marine Cpl. Jennifer Parcell, 20, in Bel Air, Maryland . Team player: Army Cpl. Matthew Emerson's room in Grandview, Washington, is lovingly decorated with photos of his high school football team . Jennifer was only 20 when an explosion set off by a suicide bomber claimed her life in 2007 in Anbar, Afghanistan. Looking at Army Cpl. Matthew Emerson's inner sanctum in Grandview, Washington, there is no doubt that this greatest passion was football. The 20-year-old, who died when his vehicle rolled over on September 18, 2007, in Mosul, Iraq, decorated the walls with photos of his high school football team, and even his bedspread is striped like a gridiron. It was not by accident that Ashley Gilbertson chose to do a project focusing on fallen soldiers. In 2002, he traveled to Iraq to cover the looming war for the New York Times. But taking photographs for the newspaper left him unsatisfied because he felt that the public back home was disengaged from what was happening in the Middle Eastern country thousands of miles away. After he returned home, Gilbertson came across a series of photos published in the Times featuring pictures of servicemen and women who died fighting in Afghanistan. Women at war: Army Pfc. Karina S.

Speaking to Slate Magazine, Gilbertson said in the beginning it was tough to convince grieving parents to open their homes to a stranger and allow him into the private space of their son or daughter. ‘The job of parents when their child was alive to protect the child any way they could. When parents lose their child all they have is a memory and they turn to protecting that memory,’ he said. ‘Having someone come into the home and sharing that memory with the rest of the world is a huge leap of faith.’ Some of the rooms featured in the book were left exactly as they were, while others were tidied up by the parents. Private shrine: Gilbertson said he made sure not to touch anything in the rooms so as not to disturb the peace of the fallen; here pictured is the bedroom of Air Force Airman First Class Carl Anderson Jr, 21, in Georgetown, South Carolina . A different kid of tribute: Ashley Gilbertson was inspired to create the book of photos because he wanted to show the real flesh-and-blood people behind the casualty count, among them Army Lt.

Richard Langenbrunner, 19, from Fort Wayne, Indiana, was obviously a sci-fi and fantasy fan, as the posters on the walls would attest . Self-editing: Gilbertson has learned from soldiers that they often tidy up their rooms before deployments to remove items they would not want their parents to find if they do not come back . Gilbertson said he has learned from his soldier friends that they often do some cleaning themselves before deployment, removing items they would not want their parents to find should they be killed. The photojournalist explained that the decision to photograph the rooms in black and white was inspired by his desire to make them seem as neutral as possible, thus allowing each soldier's personality to shine through. Fearing to disturb the peace of these hallowed spaces, Gilbertson said he made a point of not touching anything inside - not even the light switches. 'I felt I was in some historic memorial,' he told the magazine.","Photojournalist Ashley Gilbertson photographed the bedrooms of 40 fallen servicemen and women in U.S., Canada and Europe .

"An 83-year-old dementia sufferer has been mauled to death by four pit bulls - including two puppies - after they attacked her at her North Carolina home. Alameanor Dial, who lived with her granddaughter in Robeson County, was sitting on a chair on her porch last Thursday when the animals suddenly pounced and dragged her to the ground. She was rushed to New Hanover Medical Center with head, arm and leg injuries, before being airlifted to UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill. But despite medics' best efforts, she died on Sunday night. Tragic: Alameanor Dial (pictured), 83, who suffered from dementia and used a walker,  was mauled to death by four pit bulls - an adult male and female and two puppies - after they attacked her at her North Carolina home . Ms Dial's daughter-in-law, Linda Dial, said she arrived at the house on the 1900 block of Gaddys Mill Road in Rowland with her husband and son after receiving a phone call from a horrified neighbor. '[The neighbor] heard hollering and screaming for help. He then saw her on the ground. You can see where the dogs dragged her off the porch and across her flower garden,' Linda said. When the trio arrived, they found Ms Dial lying in the nearby garden. She had reportedly been badly mauled on her head, arms and legs. The pit bulls - a three-year-old male, a two-year-old female and two puppies, owned by the victim's granddaughter - had run away, according to The Robesonian. Scene: Ms Dial, who lived with her granddaughter in the 1900 block of Gaddys Mill Road (pictured) in Rowland, Robeson County, was sitting on a chair on her porch last Thursday when the animals suddenly pounced . 'It seemed like she wasn’t aware of what happened to her, which is good. She wasn’t screaming or anything. She just said, ""hold my hand I’m cold"",' said Linda. Following the mauling, one of the pit bulls was shot and killed by Ms Dial's grandson. The others were then caught by animal control officers, before being tested for rabies. Despite gaining negative results, they were euthanized, CarolinaLive.com reported. Bill Smith, health director for Robeson County, told WMBF News that officials were investigating the cause of the attack, but added that the dogs were 'cared for and had shelter and food'. However, Linda claimed her mother-in-law's relatives and neighbors had repeatedly asked officials to restrain the animals, which were known to be vicious and roamed in a large fenced-in area. 'Nobody foresaw this, but everybody knew it was a dangerous situation,' she said, adding that the victim suffered from dementia and used a walker to get around. 'Everybody said, ""something has got to happen, we just hope they don’t bother Miss Dial"".’ Attack: Following the mauling, one of the pit bulls was shot and killed by Ms Dial's grandson. The others were then caught by animal control officers, before being tested for rabies and euthanized (file picture) When sheriff's deputies and animal control workers arrived at the scene, Linda reportedly told them that her family had been trying to 'get someone to intervene for months'. 'They said, ""we know, we’re so sorry, we’re so sorry"",' she said. The attack remains under investigation.","Alameanor Dial, 83, was sitting on porch at her home in North Carolina .

"Daniel Morcombe’s killer Brett Peter Cowan will appeal his murder conviction in a hearing next month. However, the attorney general will also appeal Cowan’s sentence at that time, arguing that 20 years non-parole is ‘manifestly inadequate’ for Cowan’s crime, which could see the 45-year-old’s prison time extended. In March, Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse, after abusing and killing Daniel in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop. A covert police operation culminated in Cowan’s arrest in August 2011, after Cowan unknowingly confessed to Daniel’s murder on camera to an undercover detective. Cowan’s defence will now claim that showing his video confession was illegal, with Cowan’s lawyer arguing ‘they should never have been played to the jury’. Scroll down for video . Daniel Morcombe's killer Brett Peter Cowan mugshot, four months into his prison sentence in July this year . Daniel Morcombe parents Denise and Bruce and brothers Bradley and Dean leave Brisbane court after Cowan was found guilty for the murder of Daniel in March . Daniel Morcombe was only 13 when he was abducted and murdered in December 2003, waiting at a bus stop to go Christmas shopping . The appeal will be heard on November 27 and 28. The defence is reliant on a Canadian precedent, which saw a convicted murderer re-trialled after the jury was shown his confession video in the High Court trial. ‘Really the centre-point of the whole argument is the admissions that Brett made to the undercover officers should never have seen the light of day,’ Cowan’s lawyer, Tim Meehan told Nine News. ‘If that evidence is out, the case against Brett becomes particularly weak.’ Mr Meehan says that Cowan, currently in isolation at maximum security prison Wolston Correctional Service, is in good spirits due to his upcoming appeal. ‘He’s very happy that he’s got a date, he’s very keen for the appeal to run.’ ‘It could change his life incredibly if he got a retrial. The high fences and tough security that keeps high-profile inmates, such as Cowan, locked behind the Wolston Correctional Centre . The first images from inside Cowan's cell - complete with a toilet, shower and bed . How Brett Peter Cowan looked - a frail and gaunt figure - before he was locked away in Wolston Correctional Centre . Daniel’s parents, Denise and Bruce Morcombe, desperately searched for their son for almost eight years before Cowan’s arrest. They are not concerned, telling Nine News that they were prepared for Cowan to appeal his conviction. ‘To be honest, we’re quite comfortable with the appeal process, we knew it was always going to happen,’ said Bruce Morcombe. They are also not concerned with the precedent at the Canadian High Court, maintaining that international rulings ‘bear no relevance’ on proceedings in Australia. The Morcombes are preparing for the 10th annual Day for Daniel on Friday, a day held to raise awareness about child safety and educating children so they know how to protect themselves. Daniel's parents Bruce and Denise are comfortable with the appeal process as they 'always knew it was going to happen' Cheeky boys: Bradley Morcombe (left) and twin brother Daniel as young boys. In 2003 at the age of 13, Daniel, was abducted and murdered although his family did not know what had happened to him until his remains were uncovered in 2011 after a long police investigation and the family was able to lay him to rest. Bradley said of his twin this year, there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of him . When Cowan was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower. He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates. In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor. He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside. Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars. In a message to Cowan, Mr Morcombe told the father of three neither he nor his wife 'feel sorry for sorry him.' 'Suck it up,' he said. Bruce and Denise Morcombe speak after the first photo of Brett Peter Cowan from behind bars emerged of him looking fit and healthy .","Daniel Morcombe's killer is set to appeal his murder conviction next month .

"Montpellier was underwater today as devastating flash floods created a ‘natural disaster’ across the south of France. The city, which is hugely popular with British expatriates and tourists, was hit with almost 10 inches of rain in just over three hours on Monday. By 8pm, up to 12 inches of rain had fallen – almost 50 per cent of Montpellier’s average rainfall for the entire year. Montpellier was underwater today after being hit with almost 10 inches of rain in just over three hours . A boy looks out the window at flooded streets in the town which is popular with British expatriates and tourists . Montpellier received almost 50 per cent of its average rainfall for the entire year . It meant canoes were out in force on the streets, as numerous roads were blocked and public transport was suspended. The town’s airport was also hit, with all approach roads submerged – leaving hundreds stranded. Around 4000 people had to be taken into emergency centres overnight across the Herault department, as Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve declared a ‘natural disaster’. He said ‘all forces available will be mobilised’ to rescue people, and to care for particularly vulnerable members of society including the old and the very ill.

Local mayor Philippe Saurel said more than 1000 firemen were being drafted into the area from other parts of the country to deal with evacuations. The exceptionally heavy rain caused the river Lez to burst its banks, causing chaos in dozens of towns and villages nearby. Some 22 major roads were blocked in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, of which Montpellier is the capital. There included the A75 autoroute,which links the city of Clermont-Ferrand with the Mediterranean coast. Meteo-France, the weather agency, issued a rare red alert for flooding and heavy rainfall, warning that it was likely to continue. Last week, severe weather left four people dead in the south of France, when they were swept away in raging flood waters which hit camp sites.","Montpellier hit with almost 10 inches of rain in just over three hours .

"There can be few sights more welcome first thing in the morning than a turquoise sea, a white sandy beach and palm trees swaying in the wind. At Thomson's Sensatori resort - on the eastern, Caribbean side of the Yucatan Peninsula in the south east of Mexico - you're greeted by this sight every morning. The resort is on its own beautiful stretch of beach, protected from some of the fiercer waves you get further down the coast, and the wind is more of a breeze. Come on in, the water's lovely: The Sensatori resort sits on Mexico's Caribbean coast, on the Riviera Maya . Straw-topped cabanas dotted across the sand provide the ultimate way to while away the day, either in the shade or on a lounger just in front of it. As you relax in the cabana, all that lies between your feet and the sparkling water is a few yards of perfectly manicured sand. The first thing that strikes you when you arrive at the resort, on the Riviera Maya, is the abundance of pools. There are three main ones and a series of 'swim-up' pools attached to some rooms, which mean you can laze in the water without having to leave your accommodation. Each room also has its own Jacuzzi, perfect for an evening drink as the sun sets - or, as my friend Jo and I discovered during a rare cloudy period, ideal for sitting in and reading a book. One of the pools is definitely geared towards those who want to take advantage of the array of cocktails on offer as part of the all-inclusive deal. Making a splash: The resort has a series of pools - including swimming options on your room's very doorstep . Though the resort is quiet during the day and even the night time, if you do fancy a daytime drink, this is the place to do it. There's a swim-up bar and the friendly bar men will fix up anything. For some inexplicable reason, Baileys seemed to be the most popular drink while I was there - not my first choice in 30C weather, but what do I know? The occasional cocktail aside, our daily routine at Sensatori was pretty much set in stone. The day kicked off with breakfast at one of the six restaurants. The buffet had everything you could want in gargantuan amounts: continental and cooked, and unlimited fruit and fresh juice meant you were definitely full until lunchtime. One of the best things about being in an all-inclusive is that you don't have to carry anything around with you. The restaurant staff simply take your room number and you can eat and drink as much as you like. Change of pace: The resort offers plenty of room for relaxation - but Jennifer was not sure about the Baileys . There are lots of choices when it comes to the food. There are Mexican, Italian, Caribbean and American restaurants and also fine-dining at Le Cirque, the only one where you need to make a booking, and it isn't included in the all-inclusive deal. We'd become so used to our routine of relaxation and eating that we really didn't want to go home. But it was only a short journey to Cancun airport, and stepping on to a new Dreamliner made the end just about bearable. Thomson (www.thomson.co.uk, 0871 230 2555) offers 11 nights at the Sensatori Resort Mexico on an all-inclusive basis from £1,728 per person.

"At least four people are confirmed to have died near Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport after a light aircraft lost an engine during takeoff and plowed into a flight simulator building on Thursday morning. Five injured people were transported to Via-Christi Hospital and four people are currently unaccounted for, including the pilot, said fire Chief Ron Blackwell. By afternoon, one patient was described as being in serious condition, one in fair condition and three in good fair condition, according to a hospital spokeswoman. The roof of the FlightSafety International building - which houses 100 people - burst into flames described as 'horrific' when the twin engine Beechcraft King Air 200 came down shortly after 10am.

Firefighters try to put out a fire at Mid-Continent Airport in Wichita after a small plane crashed into the building killing several people including the pilot . Officials say at least two people are dead after a small plane reported losing engine power and crashed into a building at a Kansas airport . Only the pilot was on the plane, but it wasn't immediately clear how many people were in the building at Wichita Mid-Continent Airport, Fire Chief Ronald D. Blackwell said. Four people remained unaccounted for hours after the crash, but a search was halted at midday after a portion of the building collapsed. Wichita Fire Marshal Brad Crisp assured onlookers the search would resume as soon as the building was deemed stable. 'We understand that this is a very difficult time, especially for folks who have family members who are working out here and they don't know,' Crisp said. 'This is also a very difficult time for first responders.' Huge plumes of smoke that could be seen for miles around the city billowed in the aftermath of the accident. 'I would imagine that there was probably a bit of panic in the early stages of the incident. We are grateful at this point that a large number of people appeared to have gotten out at this point but certainly saddened by the loss of life and anybody who might have gotten hurt,' said Chief Ron Blackwell, Wichita Fire Department according to KSN.

Emergency crews are on the scene at Mid-Continent Airport, and federal officials have confirmed the incident is not believed to be related to terrorism. At least 50 to 60 firefighters from the Wichita Fire Department battled the raging fire. The FAA said that just before the accident the pilot declared an emergency, saying 'we just lost the left engine'. FAA investigators are now at the scene and the National Transportation Safety Board has been notified of the crash. Emergency crews were headed to Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport after huge plumes of black smoke were seen rising into the sky . 'The airport crews arrived first. Seeing smoke and flames and what appears to be a plane striking the building. Firefighters engaged in a horrific fight for several minutes. We have the fire under control. We are in the process of trying to determine if all the employees and visitors who may have been in the building are accounted for,' said Wichita Fire Chief Ron Blackwell to KSN. Brian Youngers, a witness, told Kansas.com he was across the street from the building when the crash happened. 'We heard this 'vroom,' ' he said. 'It was way too loud, way to close. We were like, 'Holy crap.'

Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Tony Molinaro says a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air reported trouble just after takeoff Thursday morning . Ryan Weatherby said he and several other employees at Yingling Aviation, across the street from the airport, ran outside when they heard the crash and saw rolling black smoke and wreckage. 'It wasn't that loud. It was more like a screech or something,' Weatherby said. Jay Boyle, who works at the airport as a senior field technical adviser, said he saw people standing outside and pointing, then spotted the crash site. 'I could see from a distance the cutout in the side of the building where it looked like a wing had gone through and you could actually see the aircraft landing gear through a hole in the building,' he said. The crash did not appear to be significantly disrupting passenger traffic at the airport as planes could be seen taking off from other runways. Located several mile west of downtown Wichita, a longtime aircraft manufacturing hub, Wichita Mid-Continent is used by private aircraft and served by several airlines and their regional affiliates, including American, Southwest, Delta, United and Allegiant. It saw more than 13,000 departures and about 1.4 million passengers last year, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

"A coastal cafe is bringing back good manners just one coffee at a time. Owners of Seven Mile Beach Kiosk in Gerroa, on the New South Wales' south coast, have put up a sign which is not only encouraging customers to be more polite, but it is putting a smile on their faces. For about two months, the sign which reads 'A coffee: $5, A coffee please: $4.50, Good morning, a coffee please: $4' has been greeting coffee drinkers. Cafe owners Kev Chilver and wife, Kylie Pickett, own the Seven Mile Beach Kiosk on the NSW south coast . Owner Kev Chilver said he and his wife, Kylie Pickett, wanted to bring back good manners after one of their employees saw a similar sign elsewhere. 'Common courtesy is ... becoming less and less common, and we're trying to bring it back,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We are in service industry but we’re not servants. We deserve as much respect as anyone else. 'Please and thank you go a long way.' Mr Chilver (pictured here with chef Megan Jones) said he and his wife wanted to bring back common courtesy with the sign . Chef Megan Jones said the sign's purpose has been fulfilled, saying customers having been noticeably more polite to staff . Mr Chilver - who has owned the kiosk with Ms Pickett for four years - said reactions to the sign had been good. 'It gives people a smile and starts their day off,' he said. 'We have some people who try it on and say ""please"", thank you"" and ""have a nice day"" and then ""Can I have it [coffee] for three dollars?"".' And the sign's desired effect has been panning out. Chef Megan Jones said people were going out of their way to be nicer. 'People have been saying keep the change and they've been a lot nicer and we saw a change in the customers,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'People tended to come in and say ""Coffee thanks"" and there was no ""Hi, how are you?""' Mr Chilver and Kylie Pickett have owned the kiosk for about four years, penning the sign about two months ago . Mr Chilver said the sign was a gimmick and the kiosk did not enforce it but it put a smile on people's faces . But Mr Chilver said they did not go as far as enforcing the sign. 'It’s just put up there as a gimmick to cheer people up. We never enforce it,' he said. 'We couldn't take it that far.' This campaign to bring back 'good manners' comes after a Newcastle business owner told parents with noisy children to steer clear of her cafe and a Brazilian-born Australian barista was denied work because he was black at Darlinghurst premises earlier this year. The Little French Cafe owner Jodie Morris in Broadmeadow, near Newcastle, north of Sydney, asked customers to refrain from bringing their unruly offspring into her establishment in a Facebook post. The post, which was made about a week ago, sparked such a backlash from people that it has since been removed. But Ms Morris said business had never been better despite the negative comments. Two months before that, Nilson Dos Santos was rejected from a job at Forbes and Burton café in Darlinghurst - in Sydney's inner-city - with owner Steven Hu citing he 'had not seen African baristas' before. Mr Hu has apologised to Mr Dos Santos but said he stood by his decision to not hire the 39-year-old.","Seven Mile Beach Kiosk on NSW's south coast have put up the tongue-in-cheek sign .

"The World Health Organisation spent £1million on a tobacco conference hosted by Vladimir Putin, while having to beg to secure funding to battle Ebola, it has been revealed today. Delegates dined on caviar and drank champagne during a week-long Conference of the Parties in Moscow to discuss tobacco control and e-cigarettes. This comes after the organisation was criticised for failing to help countries in West Africa affected by the Ebola crisis. Caviar for all: Britain sent two top-level delegates to the week-long £1million tobacco conference hosted by Vladimir Putin in Moscow . The conference for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which is funded by the WHO was held for one week in Moscow, and attended by representatives from 175 countries. The conference was boycotted by the U.S. and Canada, who withdrew their participation after hearing that the conference would be hosted by the Russian President. Britain sent two delegates, which included David Black, the Department of Health's head of tobacco policy, who stayed in luxury hotels, including two five-star stays owned by the Russian government. Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, West Yorkshire, is set to question Parliament why Britain sent delegates to the lavish conference when the WHO lacks funding to stop Ebola. Luxury treatment: The WHO delegates stayed in luxury hotels and dined on red and flying fish caviar . 'It's quite worrying that, when we have an emerging Ebola crisis in the world WHO sees fit to waste money discussing tobacco controls,' Mr Davies told Sunday Express. The lavish menu, obtained by the Sunday Express, included red and flying fish caviar, three types of salmon and Vitello Tonnato beef, all washed down with champagne. When the WHO collaborated with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the three countries most affected by Ebola, they were forced to plead for funding, and were saved by the World Bank, the newspaper writes. Earlier this month, the WHO was criticised by Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres) for their lack of action on the ground in battling Ebola. Mariano Lugli, deputy director of operations for MSF Switzerland, who treated Ebola victims in Guinea, said saw no sign of a WHO official in charge of handling the escalating outbreak. Health specialists work in an isolation ward for patients at the  Doctors Without Borders facility in Guékedou, southern Guinea, as the organisation criticizes the WHO for lack of action on the ground . 'In all the meetings I attended, even in Conakry [capital of Guinea], I never saw a representative of the WHO,' said Lugli. 'The coordination role that WHO should be playing, we just didn't see it. I didn't see it the first three weeks and we didn't see it afterwards.' Some aid workers and U.N. officials blame a lack of WHO leadership in the emergency response, particularly in the early stages when it would have been easier to contain. On several occasions, WHO officials played down the outbreak, they say. MSF International President Joanne Liu, who warned that her organisation could not cope with the rising number of Ebola victims, has accused the WHO of failing its mandate to help member states cope with health emergencies.","World Health Organisation spent £1m on a tobacco conference in Moscow .

"A new smartphone app has unearthed one of the biggest real estate secrets in the industry - proving agents regularly underquote properties going to auction to attract unassuming bidders. Property pricing app realAs, which was launched by buyer agent David Morrell,Hawthorn Football Club Chairman Andrew Newbold and Josh Rowe, aims to rid the industry of the dirty tactic. According to data from the app, agents consistently underquote properties going to auction by up to 33 per cent. A new smartphone app has unearthed one of the biggest real estate secrets in the industry - proving agents regularly underquote properties going to auction to attract unassuming bidders . The app promises to predict the real selling price of any residential property in Australia  to its best ability, hanging agents' underpriced predictions out to dry. A study carried out by the app identifies the difference between the actual sale price of the property and the agent's previously quoted price.

Underquoting  has become rife in the industry, with agents using it as a way to attract lower end bidders to an auction. Agents then hope that potential buyers will get caught up in the excitement of the event and bid well over their budget. Speaking to The Weekend Australian, RealAs Chief executive Josh Rowe expressed how his app wants to put some honesty back into the real estate business, however strict laws are preventing real justice for buyers. 'From the point of view of the buyer, underquoting clearly wastes their time. They are spending a lot of money on research, appraisals, building and pest inspections, then they find that the property goes for way over the estimate,' Mr Rowe said. According to data from the app, agents consistently underquote properties going to auction by up to 33 per cent . 'Buyers are frustrated and angry… There are laws against it but the problem is that it is practically unenforceable.'  realAs was the brainchild of David Morrell, Australia's first buyers' agent. David knew that it was buyers who decide how much they will pay for a property. If buyers knew the sale price, it would even up the playing field and put an end up agen manipulations. Speaking to the Financial Review Mr Morrell said the he thought of the idea for the app while on a trip to George Mason University in Washington DC. 'They had just come up with a predictive algorithm. At the time I was lamenting how hard it was to get the real price from estate agents. I asked the professors: 'Could this be adapted to predict real estate prices?' The answer was yes,' he said. Passionately talking about the realAs, Mr Morrell said: 'It's very clever and its going to be very disruptive. It will put underquoting to bed.'","Real estate agents regularly underquote properties going to auction .

"When they were hellraising as one of the Swinging Sixties’ most glamorous couples, they are unlikely to have given much thought to what they’d be doing 50 years later. But those decades have passed and, while most people will have noticed that Mick Jagger is still  strutting the stage, fewer will realise that his old flame Marianne Faithfull is too. Admittedly Miss Faithfull, who shot to fame in 1964 with her version of the Rolling Stones song As Tears Go By, is confined to rather more modest  venues than Jagger. The Stones have been playing to sell-out crowds at five hugely lucrative concerts to celebrate their 50th anniversary. Scroll down to watch . Strutting her stuff: Marianne Faithfull on stage in show in Austria; Marianne is appearing at the Landesteater in Linz Austria in a ballet called seven deadly sins . She, meanwhile, is playing the lead role in Bertolt Brecht’s ballet The Seven Deadly Sins at a theatre in Linz, Austria – backed by male dancers dressed only in leather shorts. While Jagger, 69, is playing to fans who have paid up to £1,000, tickets for Miss Faithfull’s ballet start at £9.70. The singer, who turns 66 later this month, admits performing has become a necessary struggle – but is worried she would become ‘bored and lonely’ in retirement. She dated Jagger for four years and after they split in 1970 she attempted suicide and spiralled into heroin addiction and poverty, ending up sleeping rough in Soho. In 1979 she released a comeback album, Broken English, which established her as a formidable musical force. She has been recording and performing ever since, most recently with Jarvis Cocker and Nick Cave. Still going strong: Marianne Faithfull, left, in her heyday, and right, Mick Jagger performing at the O2 Arena recently are still entertaining modern audiences . But Miss Faithfull, who will celebrate 50 years in music with a world tour in 2014, confessed that performing has become more difficult with age. ‘It is a struggle,’ she said. ‘I find songwriting much harder than I used to. But I still have more to say. And I still work for my living.’ Five years ago she admitted that she had never saved any money for her old age. ‘The problem with living life as if there is no tomorrow is that you get to this age and realise it isn’t true,’ she said. It is not a problem Jagger is likely to have. He, along with the rest of the Stones, is expected to net around £4million from the five concerts. Back in the day: Marianne Faithfull and Mick Jagger had, and still have, a strong stage presence . And while he appeared far younger than his years on stage at the O2 arena in London, Miss Faithfull’s endless performing seems to have taken its toll. The singer suffered a severe cold last month, which forced her to miss one  of her shows in Linz. She struggled through the next performance, coughing and appearing a little unsteady. At one point, one of her dancers handed her a glass of water so she could clear her throat. Another had to support her during the ovation to make sure that she did not stumble.","Faithfull is is playing the lead role in Bertolt Brecht’s ballet The Seven Deadly Sins at a theatre in Linz, Austria .

"David Cameron today revealed he would demand 'more control' of Britain's borders to restrict European immigration – in 'one last go' at staying in the EU. The Prime Minister said he would unveil further benefit restrictions for migrants and block free movement for workers from new countries joining the EU. But Mr Cameron - speaking in Rochester ahead of next month's by-election sparked by the defection of rebel backbencher Mark Reckless to Ukip - added that he would push for 'further action' on migration as Britain's price for staying in the EU. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, in Strood, Kent, campaigning today ahead of next month's by-election in the town sparked by the defection of the former Tory MP Mark Reckless . The Prime Minister, pictured with Kelly Tolhurst (right) one of the Conservative's candidates to fight the seat, is desperate to retain the seat in the November 20 poll . Mr Cameron promised to 'bring immigration under control'. He said that would take 'action outside the European Union' – but also much tougher Brussels restrictions. He said: 'It means some action inside the European Union, including things like use of the benefits system, including making sure that when new countries join they can't all come here which is what happened when Labour were in Government. 'But, also, further action in addition to that to make sure we have more effective control on migration. It's not going to be easy.' Mr Cameron said winning concessions from Brussels would not be easy. But he said: 'Frankly, I think that Britain can say, as a country that has contributed massively to European prosperity and progress, not just in the last few years but over centuries, that we should have one last go at negotiating a better deal.' The PM's remarks come amid reports he is ready to campaign to leave the EU if they do not agree to his demands to curb migration. David Cameron met staff at  Swain Group haulage company in Strood, Kent today where he was campaigning for the forthcoming Rochester  by election forced by the defection of Mark Reckless to UKIP last month . The Prime Minister spoke to staff at the Swain Group haulage company on his first campaign stop in Rochester. He has asked Cabinet minister to visit the Kent town five times before the November 20 poll . Nigel Farage suffered a setback in Brussels today after his political group in the European Parliament was dissolved. EU rules require groups to have at least 25 MEPs from at least seven of the EU's 28 member states. Until today, Mr Farage's Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group qualified with 48 MEPs from seven countries. Latvian MEP Iveta Grigule was the grouping's only Latvian MEP and her decision to quit the EFDD brought the number of nationalities represented down to six. Mr Farage blamed Ms Grigute's departure on pressure from European Parliament president Martin Schulz and the chairman of the main centre-right EPP grouping, Manfred Weber. The Ukip leader said his group's MEPs had been 'systematically excluded' from positions in the European Parliament. Mr Farage said the EU was like 'a banana republic'. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Cameron and his party were 'in a complete blind panic' and a 'total flap' about Ukip. He told LBC Radio: 'No Conservative has put any proposals to me, they haven't breathed a word of this within Government. The Conservative Party has got a fundamental problem. They are running after Ukip in a complete panic.' He added that the Conservatives would 'become interchangeable with Ukip' if they continued with the tactic. Mr Clegg said: 'This constant shilly-shallying, where every week they say, 'We'll edge a little bit closer to Ukip', I think is a disastrous political strategy. The Prime Minister told MPs yesterday that he plans to set out 'all those issues' that will form the basis of Britain's demands 'in the months ahead'. Senior ministers are pushing for an 'emergency brake' on immigration from the Continent. The system would allow the UK to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by key Conservative figures. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron's former leadership rival David Davis asked: 'Will the Prime Minister tell us his intentions as bringing to this House the red line issues that will feature in his renegotiation and can he give us a preview of some of those issues today?' Mr Cameron said Britain's demands would include 'safeguards for the single market, the ability to block new regulation, making sure Britain comes out of ever closer union, and crucially as I said in my conference speech, we have to address the issues of immigration'. 'I am looking forward to addressing all of those issues in the months ahead,' the Prime Minister added. The Prime Minister's Official Spokeswoman would not confirm any details of the reported plan this morning, saying no 'final decisions' had been taken. A Number 10 spokeswoman said Mr Cameron had 'already been clear that he recognises people have concerns about migration from the EU and that he intends to address these as part of reforming our relationship with the EU.' She added: 'He said that in the House yesterday and he said more on it in his conference speech. So there's speculation out there about how and what the Prime Minister will do on that, no final decisions have been taken.' Conservative ministers want fundamental reform of the EU's founding principle of free movement, which allows people to move between countries, Government sources say. They are proposing new rules to apply to all new member states ensuring that their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed. The change would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones. Anna Firth is one of two women vying to be the Tory candidate in the Rochester and Strood by-election . Britain's immigration system is not 'sensible' and should be restricted to those with skills not 'fruit pickers in Romania', according to one of the Tory candidates in Rochester. Former barrister Anna Firth, one of the two women vying to be the next MP, called for an Australian-style points system for all migrants, including those within the European Union. Her inflammatory comments - at a meeting for local residents from which the national media was excluded - go far further than what is currently Conservative party policy, and are in line with Ukip's immigration policy. In a hustings in the town on Wednesday evening, Mrs Firth said only migrants with 'skills we need' such as brain surgeons should be allowed to settle in the UK. Britain has a points-based system for immigrants from outside the EU, but Mrs Firth, who is running against local businesswoman Kelly Tolhurst, said the same criteria should apply within Europe as well. According to a recording of the meeting, she said: 'I think we need the same immigration system that we have, the five points system, which currently applies to people coming to this country from outside the EU. 'We need the same system to apply to those who come to this country from inside the EU. 'Once we have that system in place then I think we will have a sensible immigration policy. One that says if you come to this country with skills we really need – say you’re a brain surgeon or something in Australia as opposed to someone who has no skills, a fruit picker in Romania – then we say yes. 'If you come into this country with a job, we say yes. If you come into this country because you’ve got the money to support you and contribute to this country, we say yes. But otherwise need to say we can’t support you. That would be my policy.' Her comments illustrate the pressure David Cameron is under to secure fundamental reform to the principle of free movement between EU member states during his renegotiation of Britain's membership if he wins the next election.","PM vows 'further action' on EU migration as Britain's price for staying in .

"A pensioner couple branded trespassers in their own home by a High Court judge claim they have been left homeless after they were kicked out by council bailiffs. Janet and Michael Beech, aged in their 60s, were ejected from their family's home of 47 years in Druids Heath, Birmingham, at 10.30am on Monday morning. They planned to spend two nights at the nearby Best Western Metro Maypole Hotel, at a cost of £100. There is, they stress, nowhere to go after that. 'We will be homeless': Michael and Janet Beech outside the home in Druids Heath, Birmingham, that they were evicted from on Monday morning. They say temporary accommodation offered by the council is unsuitable . Temporary hostel accommodation offered by the local authority is unsuitable, they insist. But the council maintains it has offered the couple alternative properties of a 'suitable' size. 'This is killing me,' said Mr Beech, 65, as he queued at the council's Northfield housing office hours after the eviction. 'I'm 65 and don't want this. I just want to be left alone.' Mrs Beech, 62, said: 'We will be homeless, and that makes me angry. We have been shown no kindness.' The eviction is the heartbreaking final chapter in a long, bitter court battle that, claims Mrs Beech, has cost £200,000 - a £90,000 cost to the council and the rest in the Beechs' legal aid fees. Heartbreaking: Mr and Mrs Beech embrace each other in the front garden of the council property where they have lived for the past seven years . The average price of a house on their road, Tilshead Close, is just £72,0000. Mrs Beech's mother and father, Norman and Rita Warren, moved to the three-bedroom council house in 1967. Mr Warren died of a heart-attack some years ago and seven years ago the Beeches moved in to care for Mrs Warren, a dementia sufferer who passed away in 2010. When Mrs Warren signed away her tenancy, the couple were left with no legal right to stay at the address. However, they took court action, claiming a city council housing officer exerted 'undue influence' to encourage Mrs Warren to sign away the tenancy. The officer was cleared of any wrongdoing by the High Court last year and that decision was upheld at the Court of Appeal. The judge, Sir Terence Etherton, dubbed the couple trespassers with no right to stay. Taking a last look at her home, where they left their beloved cat Leo behind, Janet said: 'My dad is turning in his grave. He wouldn't have taken this. 'The council has shown no spirit of kindness. They have admitted we are good tenants. Our gardens have always been beautiful, but not now. We just couldn't face working them.' The saga has taken its toll on Mrs Beech and her husband, a former welder, who suffers from emphysema. Their only child lives in London. 'It's the stress,' said Mrs Beech. 'I feel sick and just can't sleep. Now I'm beginning to get angry, very angry. Our belongings are being stored in three garages, but my husband's too ill to lift anything. 'Someone has offered to let us rent a property in the same area, but it's not ready yet. It needs refurbishing. The council offered a place at a hostel, but that's no good to us.' Mr Beech said: 'The bailiff was just doing his job. He wasn't menacing or nasty, but we were broken hearted. 'We need to live close by. Someone's looking after the cat, but we need to go every day to see to him. Leo was completely lost when all the furniture was taken out.' Sad: Mrs Beech is comforted by a neighbour after she and her husband were kicked out by council bailiffs . The legal row centres on a visit to Mrs Warren by a council housing officer in February, 2010, when she signed a notice to quit her home. Last year judge Mr Justice Keith granted the council a possession order. And he threw out claims there should have been a formal assessment of Mrs Warren's mental capacity before she signed. 'I'm very disappointed in the way the judges think,' added Janet. 'It's like they're talking about a number instead of people. The comments are very harsh.' A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'This case went to court six months ago where the judge found for Birmingham City Council. 'Demand for social housing in Birmingham is extremely high and our challenge is to match properties with the needs of people on our waiting list. 'Mr and Mrs Beech have been offered alternative properties of a suitable size.'","Janet and Michael Beech were evicted at 10.30am on Monday morning .

"Nathan Greenaway, 33, from Aldershot, died from multiple organ failure after allegedly brushing against the poisonous aconitum plant at Millcourt House, in the  Upper Froyle near Alton, Hampshire . A 33-year-old gardener who tended the manicured lawns and flower beds on a businessman's £4million estate died after apparently handling a highly-poisonous plant, a coroner heard. Nathan Greenaway was one of several staff employed at Millcourt House, in the exclusive Upper Froyle near Alton, Hampshire, which is owned by former venture capitalist Christopher Ogilvie Thompson and his wife Katherine. The groundsman, from Aldershot, was experienced at looking after the gardens at the mansion but collapsed and died after apparently brushing against the deadly flower aconitum - also known as devil's helmet and monkshood - which was growing in the grounds. A pre-inquest hearing in Basingstoke, Hampshire, was today told that Mr Greenaway died in hospital from multiple organ failure. After mysteriously falling ill in September, the gardener was taken to hospital but despite frantic analysis of his blood, doctors were unable to diagnose him. He died of multiple organ failure  five days later. The coroner heard that it was only after his devastated father, Richard Greenaway, carried out hours of tireless research in an effort to find out what happened, that the link with the aconitum plant became apparent. North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley heard a report from histopathologist Asmat Mustajab, who concluded it was 'more likely than not' that Mr Greenaway died after coming into contact with the deadly purple flowering plant. Mr Greenaway was employed by South African-born Mr Ogilvie Thompson and his wife to maintain the manicured gardens of their sprawling estate. Millionaire Mr Ogilvie Thompson is a consultant for high-end technology companies and formerly worked as venture manager for operations at Element Six Ventures, a fund focusing on early and growth phase investments in material science companies. The inquest was told that the gardener was thought to have handled the highly-toxic plant, which is a member of the buttercup family of ranunculaceae, while working on the estate. He died on September 7. Poisioning from the aconitum plant can occur if it is ingested or handled without gloves. In severe cases, the poisoning causes heart arrhythmia, paralysis of the heart and respiratory problems. Other symptoms include vomiting, dizziness and diarrhoea. Aconitum is also known as monkshood and devil's helmet due to its resemblance to a drawn hood, and is known by some as wolfsbane, because its poison is so toxic that it was once used to kill wolves. The aconitum plant, which is also known as monkshood and devil's helmet, can cause heart arrhythmia, paralysis of the heart, vomiting, dizziness and diarrhoea if it is ingested or if it is handled without gloves . The attractive plant has been responsible for several high-profile human deaths, including that of Canadian actor Andre Noble, who died on a camping trip in 2004 after accidentally consuming the plant. In 2009 Brit Lakhvir Singh, dubbed the 'curry killer', poisoned her lover Lakhvinder Cheema with a curry dish laced with Indian aconite, from the same plant family. Barrister Tim Sharpe, representing the Ogilvie Thompsons, told the pre-inquest that an expert on plant toxicology was needed to establish whether or not coming into contact with aconitum was the definitive reason for Mr Greenaway's death. Coroner Mr Bradley said that, while blood samples taken after Mr Greenaway's death were still available for analysis, the sample taken at the time of his admission had since been destroyed. Dr Maggie Bloom, representing the family of Mr Greenaway, said: 'There's even a note in the medical records where it says all samples are to be retained.' The hearing was also told that the plant's deadly toxin works so quickly that it would have caused huge damage to Mr Greenaway's internal organs within hours and would have been out of his blood system altogether within a day. The inquest heard  Mr Greenaway worked at the £4million estate of Christopher and Kathy Ogilvie Thompson . Nathan Greenaway worked at the £4million Millcourt House estate in Upper Froyle near Alton, Hampshire . The Grade II-listed Georgian house lies at the heart of a complex of outbuildings, cottages and tennis courts . The gardener's widow, Tegan, and his parents, Richard and Marian, listened intently to the proceedings with other members of the family. Addressing them at the end of the hearing, Mr Bradley said: 'I'm sorry that we are not progressing this today. I am acutely aware of the difficulties that go with these cases and we will achieve what we can.' Mr and Mrs Ogilvie Thompson's Grade II-listed Georgian house lies at the heart of a complex of outbuildings, staff cottages and tennis courts at the end of a long gravel drive, next to the River Wey. At the back there is a veranda with seating room for at least a dozen guests. A member of staff, who asked not to be named, today described Mr Greenaway as 'a really nice guy who was really good to work with.' Mrs Ogilvie Thompson said the couple did not wish to comment on the inquest or the circumstances leading to their gardener's death.","Nathan Greenaway was the gardener at £4million estate in Alton, Hampshire .

"An enraged cat owner who blamed the vets for his pet's death has been arrested after allegedly stabbing staff at two separate animal hospitals. Charles A. Smith, 57, first tried attacking the veterinarian who treated his cat at the Maplewood Animal Hospital in Bellingham, Washington, at about 8:15 a.m. The unnamed female veterinarian was able to knock the knife out of Smith's hand before escaping with only a cut on her hand.

Smith, 57, first tried attacking the veterinarian who treated his cat at the Maplewood Animal Hospital at about 8:15 a.m. KOMO News reports that on his way out of Maplewood, Smith pulled a second knife, threatened the desk staff, then drove off for the Fountain Veterinary Hospital. Upon arriving there ten minutes later, he walked into the building and wordlessly stabbed an employee in the neck before speeding off yet again. That unnamed victim was treated at the scene by paramedics. By that time, police had alerted area animal treatment centers there was an attacker on the loose. Smith was finally taken into custody when a Bellingham officer pulled him over on E. Bakerview Road and he surrendered. Smith admitted he was the man authorities were looking for. He is now being held at the Whatcom County Jail on investigation of assault and weapons possession. Smith is now being held at the Whatcom County Jail on investigation of assault and weapons possession . After the attacks, Smith's three remaining cats were removed by the Whatcom Humane Society. They also seized seven birds from his RV parked behind a Trading Post Pawn and Gun on the 5200 block of Guide Meridian. Pawn shop employee Brad Bruland said Smith had long been concerned with the cat's health. 'He loved that cat and he'd been trying to get it help,' Bruland told KOMO. Smith had come into the pawn shop on Wednesday, weeping, and telling the staff that the animal hospital had given him his cat back in a box then taken him out the side door. 'That's all he cares about it his cats,' Bruland said. 'When you lose something that means a lot to you people tend to lose sense of reality.'","Charles A.

"Lindsey Leslie bit the victim's face and blamed the attack on 'severe PMT' A mother bit a woman's face in a bar in a violent vampire-like attack and blamed the horrific assault on premenstrual tension. Lindsey Leslie attacked her boyfriend's sister in a pub in Carmarthen, Wales, when she came out of the toilet. The 35-year-old pushed Janey Davies's head against a jukebox before biting her on the cheek during the attack on June 21. She was arrested the following day after DNA swabs were taken from the victim's face. Pleading guilty to common assault at Llanelli Magistrates' Court, the mother-of-three said she was suffering 'severe PMT' which caused her to be 'aggressive'. She was given a 12-month community order with a supervision requirement, and told to attend 10 aggression management sessions. The court heard how Leslie threatened: 'I'm going to gouge you' as Miss Davies came out of the bathroom at the Boar's Head pub after their boyfriends had a disagreement. She slammed the woman's head against the a jukebox and bit her on the face. Prosecutor Ellie Morgan said: 'Leslie shouted “I’m going to gouge you” before biting the victim on the face. 'Miss Davies went to the toilet and when she came back her partner said he had tried to speak to her brother and got a barrage of abuse back. 'After a quick word with her partner Leslie approached his sister. Miss Davies's head was then pushed with force against the pub jukebox. 'Miss Davies was very scared. She tried to push the defendant away and thought she was really going to hurt her. 'Leslie was shouting in her face. 'A swab was taken of her cheek and later found to contain traces of Leslie’s DNA.' The 35-year-old told the court she suffered severe PMT which caused her to behave aggressively . The attack happened at the Boar's Head Pub in Carmarthen on June 21 after the women's boyfriends had a disagreement . Leslie was given a 12-month community order and told to attend 10 aggression management courses at Llanelli Magistrates' Court . Robyn Reed, defending, said: 'She had been diagnosed with severe PMT. 'This can cause her to be aggressive when she comes into contact with people she does not know.' Leslie was given a 12-month community order with a supervision requirement and a requirement that she attends 10 aggression management sessions. She was also fined £100 and ordered to pay £85 in court costs, a £60 victim surcharge and £75 in compensation to Miss Davies for the injury to her cheek.","Lindsey Leslie attacked her boyfriend's sister in a pub in Carmarthen, Wales .

"A toddler drowned in the swimming pool of his family's £3million mansion after his father left him alone for five minutes, an inquest has heard. Arthur Belmonte was dragged from the water by his father after he was found floating face down in the deep end. The one-year-old, who could not swim and usually wore a life vest and arm bands in the pool, was taken to hospital where he was declared dead. One-year-old Arthur Belmonte was dragged from the pool at the mansion in Ascot, Berkshire, by his father . Arthur was last seen in the television room of the five bedroom property, watching a cartoon with his older brothers, aged six and five. The inquest yesterday heard his father, Luis Felipe Belmonte dos Santos, left the boys alone for just five minutes to fetch a camera when the tragedy occurred. On July 6, the family were throwing a picnic party in the sprawling grounds of the mansion they were renting, but planning to buy in Ascot, Berkshire. A marquee had been erected in the garden and Arthur's half-sister, Julia Ramos, 19, removed the cover from the pool to allow the water to heat up in the sun. Mr Belmonte dos Santos, an investor, left the three brothers in the television room watching cartoons after spending an hour outside playing football with them. 'I was away for no longer than five minutes,' said the father-of-three in a statement read to the inquest at Reading Civic Court. 'When I returned to the television room I saw only the two elder boys and I did not see Arthur.' The inquest heard the family were throwing a party at the five bedroom property they were planning to buy . Mr Belmonte Dos Santos raced into the kitchen where his wife Paula and a number of helpers were preparing food and asked, 'where is Arthur?' 'I didn't wait for a reply, I went into the living room and then out into the garden as quickly as I could,' he said. 'I went straight to the swimming pool and saw Arthur's body, he was in the deep end face down in the water.' It was believed Arthur had got outside after travelling, unnoticed, through the property's expansive kitchen. Patio doors in the television room were left permanently locked, the coroner was told. Arthur's grandfather, Luiz Paro, who was visiting from Brazil, was in an upstairs bedroom when he realised that something had happened. 'I became aware of my son-in-law screaming,' he said in a statement. Mr Paro recalled hearing desperate voices as people rushed to the pool and seeing Arthur's body being pulled from the water by his son. Arthur's mother performed CPR on the toddler while they waited for the emergency services to arrive. The toddler is believed to have climbed onto the pool's rolled-up cover and tumbled in. Coroner Peter Bedford recorded a verdict of accidental death . An air ambulance and road ambulance were sent to the Ascot property and crews described finding Arthur in full cardiac and respiratory arrest. The toddler was taken by road ambulance to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and after 11 cycles of CPR, he was declared dead. A special paediatric post-mortem examination concluded the toddler died as a result of water immersion. Arthur's family said he knew the dangers of the swimming pool and never jumped in. They believe he had climbed onto the rolled-up cover and tumbled into the water. A police investigation concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances involved in the child's death. Senior coroner for Berkshire, Peter Bedford said: 'The family gave a very comprehensive and consistent description of what all parents would identify as every parent's worst nightmare, which is a tragic, tragic incident for the Belmonte family.' He recorded a verdict of accidental death. Arthur's family did not attend the hearing and were said to have been in Brazil.","Family were throwing a summer party at the property in Ascot, Berkshire .

"The trial began today for Robel Phillipos, seen here on September 29 . A college friend of alleged Boston marathon bomber Tzhokhar Tsarnaev isn't guilty of lying to the FBI because he was too 'high out of his mind' to remember what he did on the day in question, his defense attorney has claimed. Robel Phillipos, a 21-year-old resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of three people who prosecutors say went to accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth on April 18, 2013, after the FBI released images of the Tsarnaev brothers, and removed a backpack containing empty fireworks shells. U.S. prosecutors said in their opening statements that Phillipos had repeatedly lied to FBI interviewers about his actions that day. His attorney, Derege Demissie, contended that his client had no memory of his actions that day. 'There will be ample evidence, much of it is undisputed, that Robel spent he entire day of April 18 smoking marijuana, highly intoxicated, with several friends,' Demissie said. 'His memory is jumbled, confused and completely discombobulated.' Demissie said that Phillipos used a vaporizer for two hours and also smoked in a car with the windows rolled up - a practice known as 'fish bowling' or 'hot boxing.' Authorities also revealed that Phillipos' friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, will testify against him in court. Tazhayakov was convicted of tossing the backpack. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Capin painted a contrasting picture, arguing that Phillipos lied after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a request for the public's help in identifying them. 'What did these three men do when they recognized their friend as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation? They went to his dorm room,' Capin said. The other two friends were Kazakh exchange students Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev. Tazhayakov was found guilty of obstruction of justice for taking the backpack and tossing it into a dumpster, and Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty to the same charges. Phillipos, a U.S. citizen who has been largely confined to his home since his arrest last year, could face up to 16 years in prison if convicted of lying to investigators. The slightly built man appeared at U.S. District Court in Boston dressed in a suit and tie, and did not speak during the early part of proceedings. Phillipos, seen here walking into court on Monday, has pleaded not guilty to charges he led to the feds . Convicted: Azamat Tazhayakov (left) and Dias Kadyrbayev (center) have already been convicted of throwing away Tsarnaev's backpack. The trio are seen here on a trip to Times Square in New York . Prosecutors contend that he initially denied entering Tsarnaev's dorm room hours after the FBI released photos of the two brothers, who the authorities say set off the two homemade bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. Around the time of the visit to Tsarnaev's dorm room, the brothers were preparing to flee Boston, and they shot dead a university police officer in an unsuccessful attempt to steal his gun, prosecutors say. Later that night, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a shootout with police. Phillipos, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev are not charged with playing any role in the bombing. The surviving Tsarnaev, 21, faces the death penalty if convicted of carrying out the bombing. His trial is set to begin in January. Twin bombs placed near the marathon's finish line killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev is awaiting trial on 30 federal charges. Lawyers for Phillipos say he was a frightened 19-year-old when he was questioned, and did not intend to mislead investigators.","Robel Phillipos is accused of lying to the FBI about whether his friends removed evidence from Tzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room .

"Televangelist Ernest Angley has been accused of running an Ohio church where men are forced to get vasectomies and women abortions, and where children were sexually abused. Self-proclaimed prophet Angley has been described by some of 21 former members as a closeted-homosexual Jim Jones who's turned a blind eye to sexual abuse. But the 93-year-old has defended the allegations, saying he is simply an instrument of God. Televangelist Ernest Angley has been accused of running an Ohio church where men are forced to get vasectomies and women abortions, and where children were sexually abused . Angley was described as a closeted-homosexual Jim Jones who turned a blind eye to sexual abuse. He told the Akron Beacon Journal: 'I'm not a homosexual. God wouldn't use a homosexual like he uses me. He calls me his prophet, and indeed I am,' Angley it is said to have played an active role in encouraging male followers to undergo vasectomies, and also monitored the results. He said of his role: 'I would look at them, their privates — I, so I could tell how they were swelling.' Women were also heavily influenced. Former member Angelia Oborne says a friend of hers underwent four abortions under Angley's direction. Another pregnant woman was told to think of her fetus as a tumor to make the process easier, Ms Oborne claimed. While Angley was said to encourage vasectomies and abortions to save his member's offspring from the perils to today's society, former member Greg Mulkey said in reality the pastor was motivated by selfishness. He said: 'He doesn't want people to have kids because it would take their time and money away from (the church). Angley said if a sexual predator made a habit of targeting children the church would 'get them out' Angley, 93 said he wasn't a homosexual as 'God wouldn't use a homosexual like he uses me. He calls me his prophet, and indeed I am' 'He really forced people into abortions through scare tactics, as if he were a medical doctor. It turns my stomach.' Former church member Shane McCabe claimed he was molested as a teenager by a close associate of Angley, who did nothing to address the matter. Mr McCabe said Angley told him to keep his claims secret. Mr McCabe later learnt his wife, Kim McCabe, had also been sexually abused while at the church as a teenager. Again, when the matter was raised with Angley, it is claimed he responded by saying it should be kept secret. The couple say they later approached Angley about what happened to them. They said Angley was only interested in what had occurred with Mr McCabe and asked him to recall the abuse he suffered at least four times. Ms McCabe said her husband was told, 'I'm sure it felt good'. When asked about the sexual abuse claims Angley said if a sexual predator makes a habit of abusing children, 'we get them out'. He said it wasn't his place to report the abuse to police.","Vasectomies and abortions encouraged to save offspring from today's evils .

"MY AGE OF ANXIETY by Scott Stossel (Windmill £8.99) Think you’re one of life’s worriers? Step aside for Scott Stossel. As the editor of one of the world’s most prestigious magazines, The Atlantic, he is an alpha male in real life, but in the world of anxiety, he’s the alpha’s alpha. He says he is ‘buffeted by worry’. On ordinary days, doing ordinary things, he is regularly stricken by ‘a pervasive sense of existential dread’. He is overwhelmed by nausea and vertigo, stomach aches and headaches. He starts to shake uncontrollably. He sweats to the point of dehydration. Occasionally, as when his wife was giving birth to their first child, he passes out. He has some phobias too. Enclosed spaces (claustrophobia). Heights (acrophobia). Fainting (asthenophobia). Being trapped far from home (a species of agoraphobia). Germs (bacillophobia). Cheese (turophobia). Speaking in public (a sub-category of social phobia). Flying (aerophobia). Vomiting (emetophobia). And, of course, vomiting on aeroplanes (aeronausiphobia). He has tried everything: every imaginable type of therapy, meditation, acupuncture, yoga, alcohol and 27 named drugs. Think you’re one of life’s worriers? Step aside for Scott Stossel (right). As the editor of a prestigious magazine he is an alpha male in real life, but in the world of anxiety, he’s the alpha’s alpha . None of it has made any difference. So, as a last resort, it seems, he has written about his anxiety. His therapist, Dr W, thinks it might work. Or at least, he tells Scott Stossel he thinks it might work. This is a big shambling splurge of a book, partly a quasi-academic history of the subject, partly a scientific investigation, and partly a record of Stossel’s own extreme fretfulness. We are, he says, more anxious than ever before, and: ‘Though some have argued that anxiety is a particularly American affliction, it’s not just Americans who suffer from it.’ According to one report, 15 per cent of Britons suffer from an anxiety disorder of some kind, and 37 per cent of us say we are more frightened than we used to be. The world is going mad with worry. It’s not new, though. In the fourth century BC Hippocrates recorded that one of his patients was terrified of cats. Rather later, Freud used his acute fear of trains to construct his theory of psychoanalysis, while Darwin was housebound by stress-related illnesses after the voyage of the Beagle. According to one report, 15 per cent of Britons suffer from an anxiety disorder of some kind, and 37 per cent of us say we are more frightened than we used to be . But what is anxiety exactly? How do we distinguish it from full-blooded depression? Stossel likes his therapist’s definition, and so do I. ‘Anxiety,’ writes Dr W, ‘is apprehension about future suffering — the fearful anticipation of an unbearable catastrophe one is helpless to prevent.’ For Dr W, the defining characteristic of anxiety is that it’s geared towards the future. Animals have no abstract concept of the future: they can experience fear, but not anxiety. In the U.S, of course, mental health is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Anxiety has become a battleground between the big pharamaceutical corporations, which seek to medicate everyone with highly profitable drugs, and the traditional holistic approach of therapists, who argue that merely talking about it will do far more good. At the heart of all this is an old, old argument: is nature or nurture to blame? Are we genetically programmed to become anxious, or did our upbringing give us all the lessons we needed? The actor Richard Burton could not bear to be in the same room as honey, even if it was sealed in a jar, even if the jar was shut in a drawer . Not wishing to blame his parents, Stossel seems drawn to the genetic argument, but he acknowledges that the true answer is six of one, half a dozen of the other. His own story is really something, though. Stossel has a pathological fear of vomiting, even though the last time he threw up was March 17, 1977. An astonishing proportion of his life since has been spent trying to avoid being sick and preparing for the eventuality that he might. Stossel is a pro. He steals sickbags from aircraft and stashes them all over his home, car and office, just in case. He carries anti-emetic medication everywhere he goes. And, ‘like a general monitoring the enemy’s advance’, he keeps a detailed mental map of incidences of norovirus and other stomach bugs, using the internet to track outbreaks all over the world. One day he complains to his father that there is no central clearing house for information about norovirus outbreaks the way there is for influenza. ‘Yes there is,’ interjects his wife. ‘You.’ My Age Of Anxiety also teems with glorious stories. (The actor Richard Burton could not bear to be in the same room as honey, even if it was sealed in a jar, even if the jar was shut in a drawer.) It’s a book so deranged in its intensity, you end up feeling remarkably sane and well-adjusted.","Think you’re one of life’s worriers? Step aside for Scott Stossel .

"Researchers  have developed the first genetic strain of mice that can be infected with Ebola and display symptoms similar to those that humans experience. The breakthrough could significantly speed up the development of vaccines for the killer virus, researchers say. Until now, researchers have struggled to test vaccines effectively. Researchers were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential Ebola vaccines and treatments. Typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human-like Ebola disease, including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans. Researchers were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential Ebola vaccines and treatments. This model system more accurately reflected the human experience when infected with the virus. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, work, published in the current issue of Science, will significantly improve basic research on Ebola treatments and vaccines, which are desperately needed to curb the worldwide public health and economic toll of the disease. 'You can't look for a cure for Ebola unless you have an animal model that mimics the Ebola virus disease spectra,' said study co-author Ralph Baric, professor of epidemiology at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and UNC School of Medicine. 'For the first time, we were able to produce a novel platform for rapidly developing new mouse models that replicate human disease for this virus, as well as other important emerging human pathogens.' Typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human-like Ebola disease, including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans. So the researchers asked whether all mice are immune to Ebola, or whether some strains of mice are susceptible; and if some are susceptible, could they harness the power of mouse genetics to figure out what genes make someone susceptible to the disease. Typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human-like Ebola disease, including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans. To find out, the team, including researchers from the University of Washington and the NIH Rocky Mountain National Laboratory, where the research took place, were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential Ebola vaccines and treatments. This model system more accurately reflected the human experience when infected with the virus. The team was able to show that a combination of genes were involved in producing a range of disease symptoms, such that the genetic variation of the mice directly led to the variety of symptoms that the disease produced. What's more, the researchers pinpointed a single gene that accounted for much of that variation – a gene responsible for encoding a protein known as TEK. William Fischer II, MD, an assistant professor of medicine who has treated Ebola patients in Africa, said, 'A basic understanding of how our genetics influence susceptibility to viral infections and affect disease development is absolutely critical to creating much needed therapeutic interventions.' Fischer, who was not part of this research project, added, 'We can decrease Ebola fatality rates with intensive critical care but this is difficult to do in places with limited human and material resources. 'Rationally designed treatments and vaccines are desperately needed.'","Researchers were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants .

"U.S. military efforts to construct treatment facilities, set up more labs, conduct testing and training in Africa to deal with the Ebola crisis are expected to cost $750 million over six months, the Army general who commands U.S. troops in Africa said on Tuesday. General David Rodriguez said the U.S. has been asked to set up four more testing labs, in addition to the three already there. He said three or four highly trained U.S. troops work in each of the labs. The U.S. troops in the labs are testing specimens drawn by local hospitals and health care workers in order to help determine whether patients have the deadly Ebola virus. The troops do not come in contact with the actual sick patients, but handle only the samples. Scroll down for video . An Ebola inhumation team carry the body of a recent Ebola victim to be buried on Tuesday in Magbonkoh, Sierra Leone. Some 4,000 military personnel are being deployed to Africa to help deal with the crisis . Commander of U.S. Africa Command General David Rodriguez speaks during a news briefing on the Department of Defense's response on Ebola today . Asked whether the military response to the crises has been slow, Rodriguez said one of the challenges has been the ability of Liberia to absorb the influx of people and infrastructure changes. 'Their whole nation is overwhelmed. Their health facilities are overwhelmed,' said Rodriguez, head of U.S. Africa Command. 'Their infrastructure and their capacity to house people, to feed people and all that is limited. So it's all going to have to come in, in a very, very carefully orchestrated — based on the demand out at the front.' He added that U.S. officials 'don't want to overwhelm them and press things in there that cannot — they can't absorb at all.' The U.S. has authorized the deployment of up to 4,000 U.S. forces to help deal with the crisis, and Rodriguez said he doesn't expect to need more than that, but didn't rule out expanding the effort. He also said he is confident that the troops will be sufficiently trained and equipped with protective garments in order to avoid getting infected. The troops are providing logistics, training, diagnostic labs and engineering support as part of a broader U.S. effort. In particular, he said the troops staffing the labs are highly trained in biological, chemical and nuclear warfare and will be monitored and tested continually. He said the testing is critical now as officials try to differentiate between people who have the Ebola virus or those that may have the flu or malaria. Women suspected to be infected by Ebola are pictured in a hospital, on October 6 in Foredugu, Sierra Leone. Ebola may only be present in a few African nations, but fears over the crippling outbreak are infecting economies across the continent and may put its envy-inducing growth prospects at risk . He said the U.S. has enough protective equipment for the troops being sent in. Forces from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, are preparing to go to Africa. Rodriguez said troops will be living at defense ministry facilities or in tent cities with their own food and water. 'When you go in one of these Ebola treatment units, you're going to wash your hands and feet multiple times. You're going to get your temperature taken in and out. And then there is a checklist of things to ask each personnel based on the — the virus or any other sickness, quite frankly, that could be coming up,' Rodriguez said. The military expects to finish the construction of 17 treatment centers by mid-November, but Rodriguez said troops could be in the region for as long as a year, based on how long it takes for the transmission of the virus to begin to decline. 'We're going to stay as long as we're needed, but not longer than we're needed,' he said. Ebola has claimed close to 3,500 lives in West Africa since the outbreak began last year. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are the hardest-hit countries. The 101st Airborne Division (pictured here in Afghanistan in 2013) are preparing to go to West Africa to assist in the Ebola crisis . President Obama said on Monday that some foreign countries are not doing enough to confront the Ebola crisis in West Africa. He says the international community has not been as aggressive as it needs to be to help contain what he's calling a top national security issue for the United States. Obama says he intends to put pressure on other foreign heads of state to 'make sure that they are doing everything that they can to join us in this effort'. He said the chances for an Ebola outbreak in the United States are low, but he says his administration is working on additional screening protocols for international airline passengers both in the U.S. and overseas. US officials have refused to close US borders to travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - the three countries where Ebola continues to spread like wildfire. On Friday, Centers for Disease Control director Thomas Frieden said closing to borders to West Africans would only make the Ebola outbreak worse by cutting off the supply of aide and strangling the local economies. No U.S. airlines fly to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, but Brussels Airlines and other European carriers are still offering service from the West African capitals.","General David Rodriguez  said a very small number of highly-trained troops are testing people for Ebola .

"A band of self-styled 'Robin Hooders' has sparked outrage in a small New Hampshire city by filling expired parking meters with coins and lambasting traffic wardens for 'stealing' from citizens. The six activists trail parking enforcement officers around the streets of Keene with video cameras, relentlessly questioning them as they try to issue tickets. Now, after two failed legal suits, their targets have taken the case to the state Supreme Court, calling on a judge to issue a restraining order. But the court claims it will likely be powerless to take action as it would infringe the protesters' First Amendment rights. Dispute: The activists that go by 'Robin Hooders' claim parking officials are stealing from Keene's citizens . Do-gooders? These are two of the six 'Robin Hooders' filling meters with coins in Keene, New Hampshire . The group claims to have saved citizens $80,000 dollars in 2013 by preventing at least 8,000 tickets. Jon Meyer, representing the six 'Robin Hooders', told Fox News: 'The Robin Hood protesters are expressing themselves on matters of public concern literally in the public square and holding government officials accountable. 'It's very important from a constitutional perspective that their expression not be undercut or restricted. They are doing this in a peaceful fashion.' Addressing the court on Wednesday, he added: 'The peace of mind of the parking enforcement officers is not a compelling interest.' When the group, which is also goes by Robin Hood and His Merry Men, finds an expired meter they refill it with change and then place a card notifying the car's owner what has happened. 'Your meter expired,' read the notes. 'However, we saved you from the king's tariffs, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Please consider paying it forward.' 'Harassment': Parking attendents claim the protesters are harassing them and call for a restraining order . Followed: The activists follow the traffic wardens around the streets with cameras questioning their morals . Widespread: They claim to have prevented at least 4,000 parking tickets from being issued in the city . Also on the note is an address where those inclined can send money to the 'Robin Hooders'. The city of Keene's lawsuit - which has yet to be concluded - alleges the group has 'regularly, repeatedly, and intentionally taunted, interfered with, harassed, and intimidated the PEOs [parking enforcement officers] in the performance of their employment.' 'What we're asking for is to please step back, out of the face,' said the parking attendents' attorney Stephen Buckley. The suit names six members of the group and formally requests the court bar them from coming within 50 feet of the PEOs while they are on duty. 'Robin Hooding is about saving people from getting parking tickets,' writes member James Cleaveland (aka James Robin Hood) on a website associated with the group called FreeKeene.com. 'The city has resorted to a civil case against me and others instead of a criminal one providing more evidence that no criminal actions were committed.' Cleaveland claims the group has stopped the city from issuing 8,000 tickets. Court case: The case has been taken to the state Supreme Court after the officers' two legal suits failed . Another member, Ian Freeman, told WMUR: 'They don't want to feel like they're doing a bad thing. I think they are.' The case has yet to conclude, and city attorneys claim they will be arguing that a buffer would not infringe the activists' rights. City attorney Charles Bauer told FoxNews.com: 'I believe in the First Amendment – that's what this country is built on. 'We're not trying to get them to stop their conduct – it's the proximity and duration. 'They're bumping into, swarming around within very close proximity [of the parking officials]… running up closely behind them, spooking or scaring them. 'They shout at them, calling them bad things, like ""bitch"" and ""racist"" and ""boy"".'","Six activists trail traffic wardens with cameras, questioning their morals .

Speaking on ITV's This Morning Ms Boyden, who sat beside pageant director Sara Collins, defended her decision to put her 19-month-old daughter on stage in a curled blonde hair piece and leotard. Ms Boyden, from Colchester in Essex, told the show that Bobbi loves to dance and her performance in pageants is innocent fun. 'A lot of negativity has come with it,' she said of the backlash, which has seen her receive hate mail from as far afield as the US. 'Originally i just wanted to promote Bobbi as a performing child, as she loves to dance and it has turned into this big pageant argument.' She also dismissed allegations that having Bobbi perform in such a manner risks her becoming over-sexualised at a very young age. 'I think its a load of nonsense if I'm honest,' she complained. 'It makes no difference to her, if we put music on now she would get up and dance to it. When the Beyonce hit is played in the ITV studio the toddler looks more bemused than enamored . Wearing a black leotard and curled hairpiece, beauty queen Bobbi Boyden shakes her hips and blows kisses to the audience as part of her 'Single Ladies' routine . Her mother Stephanie Boyden (middle), 32, has previously said that Bobbi is a 'diva' who runs to the stage when her name is called - and screams when she has to leave . 'She's not wearing a wig today because she didn't want it on. If she really doesn't want the wig on I don't make her wear it. Pageant director Sara Collins also stepped in to defend the young dancer, saying: 'They are competitions - in the same way you have dance and swimming competitions. 'You have winners and you have runners up. We don't have losers in pageants. It is a competition but it's very healthy.' She continued: 'My daughter Ella was horrifically bullied, as are most of the boys and girls who take part in pageants. Stephanie claims that many babies dance to 'Single Ladies' and she didn't teach Bobbi any moves . 'Their self confidence has been battered and that's what happened with my daughter. She decided to take part in pageants and it has literally saved her life.' However, despite both women insisting that dancing in competitions is what Bobbi loves, the toddler refused to dance when Single Ladies was played in the studio. Despite its risqué lyrics, Ms Boyden defended the choice of song. 'If you look on YouTube there are lots of babies dancing to that song,' she argued. 'And because of the little dance moves it's easy for her to do. I didn't teach her the moves, I just put the video on the telly.' Despite admitting her partner Anton, who works in the military, has concerns about Bobbi's performances, Ms Boyden told This Morning that 'if he really thought it would do any harm she wouldn't do it.' Ms Collins, who has signed Bobbi to  her talent agency, 'Sara's Stars', also reassured viewers that fears of perverts turning up to watch the pageants are unfounded. Her mother said: 'She loves the attention of being up on stage and she screams to get up there. She's definitely a diva. I have to hold her back' 'They are a ticket only event and only friends and family are allowed in the audience,' she explained. Despite her reluctance to dance in the studio, Ms Boyden insisted that Bobbi is a 'diva' who runs to the stage when her name is called - and screams when she has to leave. 'Bobbi's like a little Beyonce, a little madam really,' she added. 'She loves the attention of being up on stage and she screams to get up there. She's definitely a diva. I have to hold her back.'","Beauty queen Bobbi Boyden dances to 'Single Ladies' at pageants .

"Juan Mata hopes Manchester United will become less reliant on in-form team-mate David de Gea during the course of the season. Not for the first time in this campaign, De Gea put in an outstanding display at Old Trafford to help United record a 3-0 win over Liverpool on Sunday. The man of the match saved two close-range efforts from Raheem Sterling and also tipped Mario Balotelli's fierce shot on to the bar in the second half. VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal on David de Gea's improvement . Juan Mata has been delighted with the form of Manchester United team-mate David de Gea . De Gea raises his arms in triumph after making several saves during his side's win against Liverpool . De Gea stops Raheem Sterling from scoring by sticking his left leg out to block a shot . The 24-year-old won United all three points against Everton earlier this season with two stunning late saves and he also played a key role in the team's triumph over Southampton last Monday. Mata has been impressed by De Gea's form this season, but he would prefer it if his compatriot was not so busy. 'We won, among other things, thanks to the man of the match David de Gea, who has had yet another great performance,' the United midfielder wrote on his blog. 'He is in top form. Everybody's praising him and now we have to keep working so we don't need so many saves from him in the next few games; we have to get better in that regard.' Many questioned Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to sign De Gea in 2011 after he made a number of costly errors in his first season. But he is now regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world alongside the likes of Manuel Neuer, Joe Hart and Thibaut Courtois. 'It's tough to find anyone better than him,' Mata added. 'He's been in top form since the beginning of the season and has saved a lot of points for us. 'David gives us complete confidence. Liverpool created chances and they didn't score because of him.' De Gea is being likened to Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois . Balotelli blasts his first-time shot goalwards but Red Devils ace De Gea tips it on to the crossbar . The reflex save to nudge Balotelli's powerful volley on to the woodwork from point-blank range was impressive, but the pick of De Gea's saves came in the second half when he denied Sterling. The Liverpool forward picked up on a short backpass from Jonny Evans and attempted to round De Gea, but the Spaniard remained on his feet and jockeyed his opponent wide, forcing him into a weak shot. Former United defender Rio Ferdinand believes the former Atletico Madrid No 1 has a psychological edge over any opponent who runs at him. 'He is in imperious form,' said Ferdinand, who played 455 times over 12 years at United. 'He dictated to the striker in one-on-ones and now looks like he is in strikers' heads if he faces them. 'The way he trains is now being reflected in his performances. Dedicated hard work and an unbelievable confidence in his ability as a keeper. Greats traits.' De Gea's progress has not gone unnoticed by Real Madrid, who are keeping close tabs on his contract situation. United, however, hope the player will sign an extension to his current contract, which expires in 18 months' time. Mata has warned his Manchester United team-mates that they must keep working hard . Mata, meanwhile, is refusing to get carried away despite a sixth successive win, which keeps United in third place, eight points behind leaders Chelsea. 'The team has to keep working as we did in the last few weeks,' said Mata, who scored the second goal on Sunday. 'That's why we are improving. In just a few days we play against Aston Villa in a stadium with a very good atmosphere, where winning is always tough, and right after that we will be in Christmas. 'We have to maintain this positive streak and try to get as many points as possible this month.' Mata acknowledged he was offside when he nodded in United's second after a Robin van Persie flick-on. 'I was fortunate to score again,' said the former Chelsea man, who has scored five times this season despite not being a regular starter. 'To be honest, I watched the footage and it's true that I'm offside after Robin's header. That is something you don't realise when you are on the pitch.'","David de Gea was awarded the Man of the Match award after Liverpool win .

"The father of wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay has denied testing positive for traces of marijuana while visiting his son in prison. The family's lawyer told Daily Mail Australia: 'Nigel Baden-Clay and his family do not use illegal drugs'. The denial follows a report in the Courier Mail which claimed drugs tests were carried out at Wolston Correctional Centre, in Wacol, Queensland on four different occasions and allegedly returned traces of the cannabis plant ingredient Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on Nigel Baden-Clay's clothing. Visitors at the jail are reportedly usually banned for three-months from visits if they test positive three times but the bans are still at the discretion of the jail. However, lawyer Peter Shields said: 'I know from professional experience the jail scanners are unreliable and have a history of returning false positives.' Scroll down for video . Father of Gerard Baden-Clay, Nigel (left), pictured here leaving the Supreme Court with his wife Elaine, has been aaccused of testing positive for traces of drugs . Gerard Baden-Clay (left) was jailed for life after murdering his wife Allison. He is locked up at Wolston Correctional Centre (right), in Wacol, Queensland, which his father has been visiting him . ION scanners are used in jails as a non-intrusive search tool for inmates, staff and visitors, as well as for incoming mail and parcels. Mr Shields said he had spoken to the journalist who wrote the Courier Mail article and told him 'there is no real evidence to justify the story and there was no public interest in the story'. 'In the circumstances I have advised Nigel Baden-Clay and his family to consider court proceedings against the journalist for defamation,' he added. There is no suggestion that Nigel Baden-clay handles or uses marijuana and he is said to have told the Courier Mail he had ‘no reason’ why traces had been found on him. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Wolston Correctional Centre for comment. Gerard Baden-Clay killed his former beauty queen wife Allison on 19 April 2012 and dumped her body by Kholo Creek, about 13k from their Brisbane home. Allison’s badly decomposed body was eventually found by a canoeist. The former real estate agent was sentenced to life for his crime and is currently serving a non-parole period of 15 years at the high-security prison, which houses 722 inmates – many of whom are paedophiles, sex offenders and murderers. Nigel Baden-Clay, pictured outside his home in Kenmore in Brisbane's north-west, allegedly tested positive to traces of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), part of the cannabis plant . Nigel and Elaine stood by their son Gerard while he appeared at the Supreme Court in Brisbane . Gerard Baden-Clay is the great-grandson of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the world-wide Scout Movement. When he was sentenced the court heard that the 43-year-old was having an affair on the night his wife disappeared and had also fallen into debt. Crown Prosecutor Todd Fuller, QC, told the court that Baden-Clay had 'efficiently and effectively' killed his wife, probably by smothering her, as she fought for her life at their home. During the struggle, he said Mrs Baden-Clay scratched her husband’s face as she tried to fight him off. Gerard Baden-Clay (left) is thought to have killed his wife Allison (right) by smothering her . Crown Prosecutor Todd Fuller, QC, told the court that Baden-Clay had 'efficiently and effectively' killed his wife . ‘They are fingernail marks, they are on his face, they occurred after his children went to sleep and before his children got up,’ said the prosecutor. ‘There was a struggle between the two of them and she left her mark upon him.' Baden-Clay’s mistress Toni McHugh later appeared on 60 Minutes and revealed how terrified she now is of the man she thought she was going to marry and once loved 'unconditionally'. She appeared on the Channel Nine show to make it clear that Baden-Clay didn’t kill his wife Allison for her. ‘I loved him already he didn’t need to, he already had me – he killed for himself,’ she said. In an emotional interview with 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown, Ms McHugh broke down as she explained: ‘I want this man to never, ever, ever enter my life ever again.’ 'I believed I was in a loving, caring relationship that did have a future,' she told the show. 'He had told me that he would marry me one day.'

"Korean carmakers . Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp . will have to pay $350 million in penalties to the U.S. government for overstating fuel economy ratings in what . officials said on Monday was the biggest settlement of its kind. The deal comes on top of $395 million the automakers agreed . to pay last December to resolve claims from the owners of the . vehicles, bringing the companies' total cost for the mileage . overstatements to more than $700 million. Monday's settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection . Agency, the U.S. Department of Justice and the California Air . Resources Board resolves an investigation of the South Korean . carmakers' 2012 fuel economy ratings. Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia will pay the U.S. government a $350 million in penalties to end a two-year investigation into overstated gas mileage figures on window stickers of 13 models (file photo shows Hyundai Accent, foreground, and Elantra) The penalties were the largest ever under the Clean Air Act. 'This will send an important message to automakers around . the world that they must comply with the law,' said Attorney . General Eric Holder. Under the accord, which involved the sale of 1.2 million cars and SUVs, the South Korean car firms will pay a $100 million penalty, spend around $50 million to prevent future violations and forfeit emissions credits estimated to be worth more than $200 million. The greenhouse gas emissions that the forfeited credits . would have allowed are equal to the emissions from powering more . than 433,000 homes for a year, the EPA said. 'Businesses that play by the rules shouldn't have to compete . with those breaking the law,' said EPA Administrator Gina . McCarthy. McCarthy said Hyundai and Kia had committed the most . egregious violation of the reporting standards. She declined to . say whether other violators may also be fined. Attorney General Eric Holder said the penalties would send an important message to other automakers, while Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy, left, declined to say whether other violators might also be fined . Under the accord, the South Korean car firms will pay a $100 million penalty, spend around $50 million to prevent future violations and forfeit emissions credits estimated to be worth more than $200 million. 'Every automaker will be looking carefully at its current . testing procedure to avoid a similar penalty in the future,' said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com, . who noted 'frustration in the gray area between automakers' stated MPG numbers and the real-world results experienced by car . owners'. In November 2012, Hyundai and Kia conceded they overstated . fuel economy by at least a mile per gallon on vehicles after the . EPA found errors for 13 Hyundai and Kia models from the 2011 to . 2013 model years. Hyundai said at the time that the affected . cars' reported fuel economy would be adjusted by 1 to 2 miles . per gallon. Hyundai Motor shares fell as much as 4.4 percent in trading . in Seoul on Tuesday, extending a slide that has dragged them to . their lowest in over four years. The decline also knocked Hyundai from its perch as South . Korea's second-most valuable company after Samsung Electronics . Co Ltd, a spot it had held since March 29, 2011. Hyundai and Kia both increased their shares of the U.S. new-vehicle market in the past decade, particularly during the . economic downturn of 2008 to 2010 when consumers craved . fuel-efficient and relatively low-priced vehicles. However, Hyundai has lost U.S. market share in the past . couple of years, as U.S. and Japanese rivals made a comeback. Hyundai said on Monday that its U.S. vehicle sales fell 7 . percent in October from a year earlier, lagging the market's 6 . percent gain, with weaker sales of the Sonata sedan offsetting . demand for its Santa Fe sport utility vehicles. Kia's U.S. shipments rose 12 percent in October. 'We are pleased to put this behind us,' said Hyundai U.S. chief David Zuchowski. The company added that it believes its . process for testing vehicle fuel economy meets U.S. guidelines, . and the overstatement was a result of a data processing error. Hyundai's U.S. chief at the time, John Krafcik, stepped down . after his contract expired at the end of 2013. Kia in a statement said its priority 'remains making things . right for our customers through our fair and transparent . reimbursement program'.","The South Korean car firms must pay a $100 million penalty to the U.S. government and spend $50 million to prevent future violations .

"A Mexican supermarket owned by the Wal-Mart chain could be forced to close after hosting a cock fight in the store in a bid to promote a drinks company. The incident came to light after outraged animal rights activists posted pictures from the event earlier this month in the city of Boca del Rio, on social media and demanded action against the retailer. Shoppers in the store at the time of the fight say people had been drinking beer they had purchased in the supermarket and had been gambling on the outcome of the fights. A cock fight taking place inside a supermarket owned by Wal-mart in Mexico to help promote a drinks company . Now it has emerged that the store, in the south-eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, could be fined for breaching alcohol and gambling rules, as well as animal cruelty and possibly even shut down. Police were called to the store after several shoppers inside complained about what they saw. Demian Reynoso, who was one of those to call the police said: 'There were children in the supermarket and I'm sure they were not impressed at seeing two cocks tearing each other apart in the middle of the aisles between the food. 'There is a reason why gambling on cockfights is illegal here in Boca del Rio. It is a nasty and violent and a totally cruel activity.' However, a spokesman for Walmex, the Mexican firm owned by parent company Wal-Mart said that the event was not technically a cockfight because the birds were not hurt or 'armed with blades' and no official bets were made. But now the company has to prove no official bets were made after animal-rights activists say people were standing around gambling on the results. People posted pictures of the event on social media with some demanding action be taken against the retailer for hosting the event . The company has until next Wednesday to prove that it was not a cockfight before the city considers fines as punishment. The local council's consumer affairs department boss, Jose Luis Hernandez Gonzalez, said: ""We are investigating over gambling, breaches over the rules on the consumption of alcoholic drinks and other offences regarding the protection of animals. 'We are currently waiting to see the company's response to the allegations. 'We were not impressed when we sent inspectors to check it out after getting complaints and the managers would not let us inside as it was private property.' The retailer could face fines of as much as 96,000 Pesos (US$7,000) if Wal-Mart Mexico, or Walmex, is found guilty of staging the event according to Mr Gonzalez, who added that it might also be possible to force it to close.","Cockfight said to have taken place inside a Mexican Wal-Mart store .

"Two children have been taken to hospital following an E.coli outbreak at a nursery school, it has been revealed. Specialists from Public Health England and environmental health officers are investigating the cases of E.coli O157, which are linked to Little Brook Children's Nursery, in Great Harwood, Lancashire. Two more 'probable' cases are also being investigated at the facility and experts are speaking to the families of those involved in an urgent bid to trace the source of the outbreak. Experts are investigating the cases of E.coli O157, which are linked to Little Brook Children's Nursery (pictured), in Great Harwood, Lancashire . Testing is being carried out on staff and children who may have come into contact with the bacteria, and children have been asked to remain at home until they have tested negative. A spokeswoman for Public Health England said that although staff were at the nursery on Monday, it would effectively be closed to children until those with negative samples begin to return. But a worker at the facility told MailOnline this morning that the facility was open. E. coli O157 is a bacterium that can cause infection of the bowel. It is usually spread by contact with animals or infected meat products, but it also spreads from person-to-person. Those who are suffering from an E.coli infection will experience symptoms ranging from mild diarrhoea to more serious illness with bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, a raised temperature and shivering attacks. Parents with children at the Blackburn Road nursery, which was rated Good by Ofsted in August, said staff had been quick to respond to the outbreak. Grainne Nixon, Nurse Consultant in Health Protection from the Cumbria & Lancashire PHE Centre said: 'Investigations are still on going and all public health measures are being put in place to help prevent further infection. 'A group of other children and staff at the nursery will be screened for the infection as a precautionary measure. We are collecting faecal samples for testing from children and staff to be absolutely sure that no one is carrying an infection that could spread from person-to-person. 'We are also asking parents of children who are being screened to keep their children at home until they have produced a clear specimen after which they can return to nursery.' Testing is being carried out on staff and children who may have come into contact with the bacteria, and children have been asked to remain at home until they have tested negative . One of the youngsters with a confirmed case is understood to have left hospital. Coun Pam Barton, Hyndburn Council's portfolio holder for Health and Well Being said: 'The council's environmental health officers are assisting Public Health England in investigating E.Coli in Hyndburn and any additional resources that may be required from the council by Public Health England will be made available.' Health expert, Dr Tom Smith, warned that E.coli infections can be very serious, particularly for young children. He said: 'Sadly it's quite serious, for children particularly. 'It can give rise to kidney problems and even, in severe cases, multiple organ failure. 'Hopefully these two children will be all right, but mortality is associated with E.coli. 'Some children die from it, it can be really serious. According to Public Health England, E.coli O157 is a bacterium (germ) that can cause infection of the bowel. It is usually spread by contact with animals or infected meat products, but it also spreads from person-to-person. The incubation period is usually 1 to 6 days, with an average of 2 days. Symptoms include diarrhoea which is usually mild and settles within 2 weeks. E-coli is usually spread by contact with animals or infected meat products, but it also spreads from person-to-person . However, some people may have more serious illness with bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, raised temperature and shivering attacks. Patients are advised to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Antibiotics should not be given for this illness. If diarrhoea persists, or if blood or slime is present, patients should seek urgent advice from their GP. The spread of infection can be prevented by thorough hand washing by everyone in the household, especially after using the toilet, before handling food, after handling raw food and before eating. Hand-washing after contact with animals, even domestic pets, is vital. Young children should be supervised when washing their hands, or have their hands washed for them. 'You've got to find the source of the contamination, it comes mostly from contaminated food or lack of hygiene after toiletting. 'The nursery must make sure the children all wash their hands after they've been to the toilet, and that food is properly cooked and stored, and that separate cutlery is used for raw stuff and cooked stuff - it usually comes from contaminated beef or prepared meat. 'You can always trace E.coli back to some mistake in hygiene - from a butcher, or from people in kitchens not following the rules.' The number of cases of E.coli reported by East Lancashire NHS Hospitals Trust have remained fairly constant over the past year. In August 2013 there were 23 cases, and in August 2014 there were 25. Nursery staff and East Lancashire NHS Hospital Trust declined to comment on the outbreak. When Ofsted inspectors visited in August they praised the nursery and said: 'Managers, leaders and staff demonstrate a good understanding of their responsibility for safeguarding and protecting children from harm. 'As a result, children's needs are well catered for and they are kept safe at all times.'","Experts examining cases of E.coli linked to Little Brook Children's Nursery .

Few shops were open and schools and many offices were closed due to poor telecoms and no power for the second day in a row. Officials in Andhra Pradesh, which reported 21 deaths, said initial surveys found that thousands of houses had been damaged and there was widespread destruction to banana, sugarcane and rice crops in the districts of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, East Godavari and Vijaynagaram. Tens of thousands of people spent a third night in cyclone shelters due to damage to their home or a lack of food or clean drinking water in their villages, officials said. Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu, who visited Visakhapatnam on Monday, said he was fully confident that response to the disaster would be quick. 'Visakhapatnam is a place I like very much. But, it is painful to see the city this way today,' Naidu told reporters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would visit the area on Tuesday. 'Have been constantly taking updates on Cyclone Hudhud ... Will visit Visakhapatnam tomorrow and take stock of the situation,' Modi tweeted.

A fisherman walks near the anchored fishing boats as strong winds blow a day after a powerful cyclone pounded the Bay of Bengal coast . Authorities in Visakhapatnam, locally known as Vizag, said 19 helicopters had been dispatched to drop food and water packets to affected villages. Four naval ships were also being readied to sail to the coast, carrying relief material for 5,000 people, and four more ships were on standby if required. The relatively low death toll reported so far followed an operation to evacuate more than 150,000 people to minimise the risk to lives from Hudhud - similar in size and power to cyclone Phailin that struck the area exactly a year ago. According to India's weather office, Hudhud has weakened into a deep depression but is expected to dump heavy rains in northern and northeastern India and, eventually, snow when it reaches the Himalayan mountains. Aid workers warned the rains were likely to inundate large tracts of farmland, comparing it to Phailin's incessant rains last year which caused major rivers and tributaries to overflow, submerging villages and stranding hundreds of thousands of people for days after the cyclone had passed. In the coastal fishing village of Mangamaripeta, 15 miles from Visakhapatnam, where scores of thatched homes had been swept away by storm surges, inhabitants waited for aid. 'We do not know how we manage for the next few days,' said N. Bangaramma, housewife and mother of three. 'Our house was damaged. Whatever we had was washed away.'

Yesterday, television footage from Visakhapatnam showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and massive debris strewn in the streets. Electricity lines were disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official. Four districts in Andhra Pradesh that are home to more than 14 million people - Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari - were expected to be worst hit, including about 350 coastal villages. Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, said that while the early evacuations had saved lives, the cyclone caused 'huge damage' to buildings and crops in the coastal districts. The cyclone's wind speed dipped to about 100mph, but was expected to pick up later on Sunday. Above, Visakhapatnam is hit .

India's meteorological department said Sunday afternoon that the cyclone would weaken over the next 12 hours, with wind speeds gradually decreasing. But heavy rain was expected to lash Andhra Pradesh and Orissa for another three days. Other parts of central and northeastern India were also expected to see heavy rain. The Indian Ocean is a cyclone hot spot. Of the 35 deadliest storms in recorded history, 27 have come through the Bay of Bengal - and have landed in either India or Bangladesh.

Vongfong made landfall on the southern island of Okinawa and was aiming at the island of Kyushu, where authorities told 150,000 people to evacuate. It is expected to reach Tokyo by Tuesday. Strong winds from the storm knocked out power lines and toppled traffic signals and signposts on Sunday, and bullet train service was halted for several hours on Kyushu island. Authorities issued landslide warnings. West Japan Railway Co., which operates trains in central Japan in the area surrounding the ancient capital of Kyoto, said that some train services would be shut down starting Monday afternoon because of the typhoon, and that the disruptions could continue through Tuesday. The U.S. military on Okinawa, where last week's typhoon killed three U.S. airmen who were washed out at sea, instructed personnel and their families to remain indoors Sunday until strong winds and rain subsided.","Cyclone Hudhud had 120mph winds when it made landfall in southern India after sweeping through the Bay of Bengal .

"A Sydney woman spent a year ignoring a condition that made her stop breathing every two minutes while she slept. Fiona Bond, from Belrose in the Northern Beaches, suffered from severe snoring - a symptom of sleep apnea - but did not think much of it until she drove a barn-full of 14 people outside because it was so loud. For a year, the 55-year-old said her undiagnosed condition - which causes people to stop breathing during sleep - was 'ruining her life'. Fiona Bond (pictured right with her partner) suffers from sleep apnea and was left undiagnosed for a year . 'I started getting a terrible tiredness and I would get up in the morning and didn't feel refreshed and didn't feel like I slept at all,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I sort of stopped breathing in my sleep and then jump and wake myself up. 'Literally 10 minutes after I got up in the morning I wanted to go back to bed. Throughout the day, I could be sitting somewhere and fall asleep. 'Because I was so tired my head was kind of foggy all the time and I could not concentrate very well and my memory wasn't good.' Ms Bond was so exhausted that she feared getting behind the wheel of a car for more than 10 minutes, just in case she fell asleep. But unfortunately her story is not unique. New research has found one of two Australia women aged between 20 to 70 years old living with sleep apnea often remain undiagnosed or are diagnosed with other conditions. The study done by sleep medicine research scientist Dr Carmel Harrington - the author of The Complete Guide to a Good Night's Sleep - also showed 77 per cent of Australian women were exhausted and unknowingly putting themselves at risk of chronic health conditions. These conditions include type 2 diabetes, depression and cardiovascular disease. But Ms Bond's story is not unique as new research has found one in two Australian women are living with sleep apnea and do not know it . 'We do know from scientific research that women require 20 to 30 minutes more sleep than men,' Dr Harrington said. 'That doesn't sound like a whole lot but... if you're constantly not getting enough sleep for an entire month you'll feel exhausted by the middle of the day.' Dr Harrington said her research also showed almost twice as many women were experiencing more headaches in the morning than men, and this indicated they were not getting enough sleep or they were living with an undiagnosed sleep condition. 'A lot of women do admit to snoring which is a sign of sleep apnea but about one in eight women denied they were snoring and 15 per cent of them were embarrassed to do anything about it,' she said. 'Bottom line is it's not normal to feel exhausted and not meet the challenges of the day. 'You either need more sleep and if you aren't, your mental well-being will suffer. 'Prioritise it with nutrition and exercise, but often we don't do that.' The study done by sleep medicine research scientist Dr Carmel Harrington also showed 77 per cent of Australian women were exhausted and unknowingly putting themselves at risk of chronic health conditions . And Ms Bond is a prime example of this research as she denied that anything was wrong for a long time. Her severe snoring was first brought to her attention when her daughter recorded her sleep when she got fed up with hearing her mother snoring from her bedroom on the other side of the house. 'We all kind of thought it was funny,' Ms Bond said. 'She said my snoring was so loud and I thought it was rubbish. 'It didn't really bother me... I just thought you get to this age and everyone starts snoring.' But a trip to Italy sparked Ms Bond to seek help. She and her partner were staying in a barn during a pilgrimage with 12 other people. 'I woke up probably 4am in the morning and the whole room was empty,' Ms Bond said. 'I got up, went outside and people were sleeping on the ground. 'When I asked them why they were there they said ""Fiona was snoring so loudly no one could sleep"". I was so loud I cleared the barn.' A few months after she returned to Australia, Ms Bond finally sought advice from her doctor who sent her to get a sleep study done. Ms Bond (third from the left) did not seek help for her condition until after a trip to Italy where she drove a barn-full of people outside because her snoring was too loud . The study on her sleeping pattern found she was waking up every two minutes during her night's rest. 'That's why I was so worn out and my body was not getting any rest,' Ms Bond said. 'It can affect your mind...and that sort of dawned on me how dangerous it was if I just kept going. 'When [my specialist] did diagnose [my sleep apnea], I just couldn't believe it. I was just over the moon.' Since she got a CPAP machine which helps open her throat during sleep, Ms Bond said she felt like 'a different person within a few days'. 'I woke up in the morning and started bouncing out of bed again... and I would get through the whole day and not think of sleep once. It was amazing,' she said. The treatment from the machine was so effective, Ms Bond said her specialist told her she was sleeping like a 20-year-old. Ms Bond encourage women who had similar concerns to what she had experienced to seek help. 'I know a few women who have been diagnosed and won't do anything about it and they don't know what a better quality of life they would have,' she said. 'They think it's not a lot but it's not good to keep going through life like that your quality of life is not like that anymore.'

"A special undercover squad of Metropolitan Police officers tasked with infiltrating a range of left-wing organisations may have duped more than 100 women into having affairs. The Special Demonstration Squad which operated between 1968 and 2008 has been heavily criticised because officers attached to the unit had sexual relations with some of their targets. The Metropolitan Police has already paid out more than £400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child fathered by undercover officer Bob Lambert. Undercover police officer Bob Lambert, pictured, was tasked with infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front . While undercover during the 1980s, Lambert fathered a son with a woman while using the Bob Robinson alias . Lambert, who used the alias Bob Robinson, began a relationship with the woman, known only as Jacqui after he was tasked with infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed that it deployed 147 SDS officers in undercover roles over a four-decade period. It is feared that compensation claims against the force could run into a mulit-million pound bill for damages and legal fees. According to a source who spoke to The Mirror: 'In nine out of ten cases we know about, SDS officers have had sexual relationships while undercover. There were nearly 150 of them, so it would not be unreasonable to suggest there are many more out there who don't realise they are victims.' Jacqui is reportedly to receive £425,000 and in an interview with the Guardian and the BBC, she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children. She said: ‘The legal case is finished but there is no closure for me. There is the money, but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong, there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers.’ ‘I don't know why I was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with Bob Lambert. ‘I don't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour I went through giving birth to our son. I feel violated.’ It is feared that undercover officers may have slept with more than 100 women over a 40-year period . In August four former SDS officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences. The Met was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘neither confirm nor deny’ (NCND) in response to the damages claims. As a result, the force confirmed Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers. Jules Carey, Jacqui's lawyer, told the Guardian and BBC that Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner, should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships. Undercover police officer Jim Boyling, also known as Jim Sutton was part of the covert surveillance squad . So far 12 woman have lodged cases against the Met over the actions of its undercover surveillance officers . Mr Carey told them: ‘The Metropolitan Police are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer, Bob Lambert. They are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself. ‘It is time for the commissioner of Metropolitan Police to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice’. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force ‘unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with Bob Lambert, an undercover officer, has had on this woman’ but said that it had ‘never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing’. He said: ‘We recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son. From the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity, completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances. We regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress. ‘We want to be, and have tried hard to be, as open as we possibly can. Arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing, but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic.'","The Metropolitan Police deployed 147 officers in deep cover over 40 years .

"David Cameron is preparing to issue a grovelling apology to the Queen in person after claiming she 'purred' when Scots rejected independence. It is understood the Prime Minister will say sorry in his weekly audience at Buckingham Palace tonight. Mr Cameron is said to be 'very embarrassed' about the gaffe, after he broke protocol to divulge the private conversations with the head of state. The Queen, pictured at Buckingham Palace today, will hold her weekly audience with Prime Minister David Cameron tomorrow, when he will apologise for discussing her reaction to the Scottish independence referendim . In a separate gaffe, Mr Cameron told Tory MPs about a private conversations with the Queen during a visit to Chequers earlier this year . Mr Cameron was left red-faced after being caught on camera revealing details of his conversations with the Queen over Scotland. On a visit to New York last month, the PM was filmed boasting to former mayor Michael Bloomberg about the call he made to the Queen at Balmoral. As the Prime Minister and Mr Bloomberg arrived for a press photo-opportunity, Mr Cameron smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the Queen it was 'all right' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the No camp. 'The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying 'Your Majesty, it is all right, it's okay',' Mr Cameron said. 'That was something. She purred down the line.' Last week Mr Cameron vowed 'never again' to discuss his conversations with the Queen after being challenged whether he was ashamed to have been overheard saying she had 'purred' when told the result of the Scottish independence referendum. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: '(It is) one of those moments when you look back and kick yourself very hard. 'It was not a conversation I should have had, I am extremely sorry and very embarrassed about it. 'I have made my apologies and I think I'll probably be making some more.' Asked if he felt ashamed, the Prime Minister added: 'I'm very sorry about it... I'm not going to ever discuss my conversations with the Palace ever again.' In an extraordinary sequence, David Cameron was today heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote . Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state . In the video recording, David Cameron could clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: . 'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something.... 'She purred down the line... 'But it should never have been that close. 'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt… . 'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through. 'It was very nervous moments.' But it later emerged that Mr Cameron had breached protocol a second time, after allegedly cracking a joke with Tory MPs at Her Majesty's expense. It was revealed that Mr Cameron told a gathering of top Tories how the monarch once had to be corrected for wrongly claiming that she owned the real version of a painting hanging in the PM's country retreat – when in fact she was looking at the original. The Prime Minister told the story to a group of Tories invited to Chequers in the wake of the Scottish referendum. But  it was confirmed later that the Queen was right all along about the painting. The portraits by Van Dyck are in the Royal Collection, owned by the Queen, art experts said. After the first gaffe in New York, Downing Street contacted Buckingham Palace to offer the Prime Minister's apologies. However, with the Queen on holiday in Scotland and then the onset of the party conference season, Mr Cameron has not yet made peace in person. After a bitter two-year campaign, 55 per cent of people in Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. It mean that First Minister Alex Salmond resigned, announcing hours after the result was declared that he would be stepping down in November. Mr Cameron has previously said his weekly meetings with the Queen help him to ‘sort out the problems’ in his own head – but doubts she gets much out of it. The Prime Minister said that after 60 years on the throne, the Queen has ‘literally heard it all before’. Prime Ministers are granted an ‘audience’ with the monarch every week, when Parliament is sitting, to update the head of state on the major issues the country faces.

Spooky: Dash camera footage shows him slowing down to avoid the cones, when all of a sudden a man wearing a hoodie comes out of the shadows . Ominous feeling: After a brief conversation with the man, Mr Tukhtin speeds off weaving around the cones . Mr Tukhtin is heard asking if he can help with something. The man replies 'yes' before walking over to the driver's door. At that point Mr Tukhtin accelerates and speeds off, weaving around the cones. He said he didn't think there was anything sinister about the man until he saw him reach into his pockets. 'Scary to think what could have happened,' he reflected. The third-year law student later pulled over and called 911 to report the incident. State police captain Stephen Jones told ABC News that the cones were gone by the time officers responded. However, they found the man Mr Tukhtin saw along with another man and learned their car had run out of gas. It's believed they were using the cones to get help. Both were arrested, with 37-year-old Kareem Walston from Orange, New Jersey, facing charges for driving under the influence and 36-year-old Hashen Clark from Jersey City for hindering. The incident remains under investigation.","Ivan Tukhtin, 24, was traveling along the I-78 just after midnight on Sunday morning when he spotted cones blocking the road .

"Police have found a body at the bottom of a cliff just a few kilometres away from Taylor Almond's house after nearly a month of searching for the missing teenager. Detectives investigating the disappearance of 16-year-old Miss Almond discovered the body in Awabakal Nature Reserve in Dudley, south of Newcastle, at about 11am on Wednesday. The body was badly decomposed and a crime scene was set up, but police do not believe there were suspicious circumstances. It is understood that nail polish was found on the body, the Daily Telegraph reported. Taylor Almond (pictured), 16, was last seen at her Dudley home, a southern coastal suburb of Newcastle in New South Wales, at about 1.00pm on Sunday October 12 . Police will conduct an autopsy expect to formally identify the body on Friday. Taylor was last seen at her home address at about 1.00pm on Sunday October 12. Her family had said her disappearance was completely out of character. They have been searching Kotara, Adamstown area, Newcastle Beach and Kempsey area, after receiving information on her possible whereabouts. Police say the teenager was last seen wearing a white sleeveless shirt and blue denim shorts. Over the last week, it is believed Miss Almond may have been in the Kotara, Adamstown area and Newcastle Beach areas in New South Wales . Taylor is of Caucasian appearance, about 160 to 170-centimetres tall with a slim build, long blonde hair and blue eyes. Last month, police urged her to contact them or her family after information received suggested she was safe and well. 'Even though we think Taylor is okay, it is crucial that she makes contact with us or her family,' Detective Inspector Brett Greentree said. Anyone who has seen Taylor or may know her whereabouts are urged to call triple zero (000) immediately. Miss Almond's family say her disappearance is completely out of character .

David James Archer, from Rhyl, North Wales, was arrested in Llandudno on Sunday afternoon after he was spotted stealing a belt from a clothes and camping shop in Mostyn Street. When he appeared before magistrates on Monday it was Archer’s 266th appearance on a theft charge. The 59-year-old admitted theft when he appeared from custody at Caernarfon magistrates court yesterday, but sentence was adjourned. The court heard Archer’s 265th appearance before a court was only last Friday when he was handed a six-week jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, by magistrates at Wrexham. Bench chairman Peter Lunt Williams said they were looking at a suspended sentence and securing probation service support for Archer. He was granted conditional bail and he will appear before magistrates at Prestatyn next week. Diane Williams, prosecuting, said at about 2.25pm staff at the Trespass store saw him enter the shop and then leave. CCTV cameras saw him put something around his waist. It turned out to be a belt costing £2.99 he had stolen from the shop. Ms Williams said: 'When approached by police he claimed he had bought it from a friend for £5. 'But enquiries with the shop revealed it was from their stock.'

Slap on the wrist: Bench chairman at Caernarfon Magistrates Court, Peter Lunt Williams, said they were looking at a suspended sentence and securing probation service support for Archer . Huw Roberts, defending, said it was a difficult task to defend a man who had such a lengthy criminal record. He said: 'He has just come out of a 30-year heroin addiction and he is anxious to change his ways. 'He has had no probation service intervention for more than eight years and he would benefit from their support.' Mr Roberts added Archer had obtained a flat in Rhyl and kept a dog and was anxious to return to the address. He said: 'He is putting some structure into his life.'","David James Archer, from Rhyl, admitted stealing a £2.99 belt from Trespass .

"Family doctors will be forced to publish details of their earnings online, it was announced yesterday. Each practice will be told to reveal the average earnings of its GPs by March 2016. Although individual salaries will not be published, it will give patients a much better idea of how much their doctor is taking home. Family doctors who are partners in their surgeries earn an average of £102,000 a year – and one in ten earns more than the Prime Minister’s salary of £142,500. Scroll down for video . Each GP practice will be told to reveal the average earnings of its doctors by March 2016 to give patients a better idea of how much their doctor is taking home . The measure is part of a major revision of GPs’ official working conditions, to iron out a series of problems which came out of Labour’s botched 2004 contract, which saw GPs’ salaries soar by a third – even though most ended up opting out of responsibility for their patients outside office hours. The new GP contract, unveiled by NHS England yesterday, also confirmed that every NHS patient in England will be able to access their medical record online free of charge from next year. At the moment, it costs them £10. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the measures would be brought in by April, and insisted England would be the first country in the world to ‘take this huge step’. Speaking at the conference, Mr Hunt said: ‘It means you will no longer have to pay to access your medical record. You will be able to see it and show it to anyone you choose. You will find it easier to do detailed research about your condition and easier to challenge decisions.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said the measures would be brought in by April . Mr Hunt used his speech to attack Labour, saying the party was ‘not fit to run our NHS’. He said: ‘Don’t you dare talk to us about running down the NHS. I simply say this to a Labour Party that still refuses to learn the lessons of poor care – until you do, you are not fit to run our NHS and if you won’t put patients first we will. ‘It will be the Conservative Party that completes Nye Bevan’s vision for an NHS that treats every patient with dignity and respect. We will finish the job.’ But doctors said yesterday that David Cameron’s plans for everyone to have access to a GP seven days a week were unworkable because of a chronic shortage of staff. The Prime Minister has pledged £400million over the next five years to pay for extended evening and weekend openings for GP surgeries. The Family Doctors Association said the plans had no basis in reality and the funding provided was ‘chicken feed’. And the Royal College of GPs said promises to employ another 5,000 GPs by 2020 would be nowhere near enough. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctors Association, said: ‘The problem with just making announcements like this is that there is no backing of reality. The general practice service is at the moment in the biggest crisis I’ve known in 30 years.’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘The Prime Minister has pledged that there are 5,000 more GPs in the pipeline. That is a good start, but we estimate that we will need at least 8,000 by 2020 just to continue to deliver services on the basis of the existing hours GPs are contracted to provide.’ Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘David Cameron made an almost identical announcement this time last year but, in the 12 months since, he has made it harder – not easier – to get a GP appointment.’","Plan will give patients an idea of how much their doctors are taking home .

"Little Eddie Sharp was given just 18 months to live when he was born with a rare and deadly metabolic disease known as 'childhood Alzheimer's'. The now four-year-old, who lives in Manly Vale in Sydney's north, was diagnosed at birth with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C - a genetically inherited disease that can cause irreversible brain damage. For now, Eddie's brain is slowly still developing but the deadly disease, which doctors say is similar to Alzheimer's, has already robbed him of his physical strength. Four-year-old Eddie Sharp was born with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C -  a genetically inherited disease that can cause irreversible brain damage . 'He was pretty good for the first 18 months. He had low muscle tone so he had difficulty walking, he had a small appetite and he didn't have a lot of language... he was delayed,' his mother, Ali Malone, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Now, physically he can't even sit up. He's in a wheelchair and we're really starting to notice the physical stuff more at the moment. 'His biggest challenges are not walking and a build up of fluid in his lungs.' This disease, often known as 'childhood Alzheimer's', has already robbed Eddie of his physical strength but his mother Ali Malone says his brain is still developing for now . Two years ago, little Eddie was dealt another blow. He was diagnosed with Leukaemia - a totally unrelated illness to Niemann-Pick Disease Type C . Physically, Eddie is unable to sit up on his own now with the disease robbing him of his gross motor skills . Ms Malone said while Eddie wasn't facing any mental challenges just yet, he could have similar problems to older people with Alzheimer's in the near future. But  there's actually no way of knowing what's in store for Eddie. Niemann-Pick Disease Type C is so rare there's only about 15 recorded cases in Australia. There is currently no cure and the disease is always fatal. 'They think it works in a similar way to Alzheimer's. It moves through the body and attacks different organs at different times,' Ms Malone said. 'There are roughly only five or six living cases in Australia, the others have already passed. 'We almost lost Eddie in April... the average lifespan is about seven years.' His mother said while Eddie wasn't facing any mental challenges just yet, he could have similar problems to older people with Alzheimer's in the near future . Niemann-Pick Disease Type C is so rare there's only about 15 recorded cases in Australia . But two years ago, Eddie was dealt another blow. He was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - a totally unrelated illness. 'He spent basically all of last year in hospital doing chemotherapy. It was horrendous, it wasn't great,' Ms Malone said. 'He knows he's sick but he doesn't understand, we don't even understand. 'Before he was diagnosed with leukaemia, he was pretty good but not perfect. He was younger so the gap wasn't as wide as it is now in terms of development. 'In those 12 months he was in hospital getting chemotherapy, we took our eyes off the physical deterioration (due to his other illness), so it's difficult to see how he's changed.' Eddie's family: Peter Sharp, Ali Malone and their three children Isabel, Tom and Eddie are remaining positive . Doctors initially said Eddie, pictured here with his dad Peter, would not live past 18 months . The 'cheeky' fou-year-old spent basically all of last year in hospital undergoing chemotherapy and has been in and out of hospital this year . His parents Ali and Peter Sharp remain positive despite the difficult times they've faced. 'We've got two other children so we have to get on with it,' Ms Malone said. 'Eddie has been sick his entire life. Even before his leukaemia he was a born patient. He actually loves the hospital, he thinks it's great fun. 'When he does go there's always someone from the family there with him and he loves the attention. 'He’s quite cheeky, he is very social and he loves big groups.' Eddie's mother says even before he was diagnosed with leukaemia, he was a 'born patient' Having spent most of his life in and out of hospitals, Eddie has grown to love it and the attention he gets . Between hospital appointments and raising their family, Eddie's parents spend time fundraising and raising awareness about Niemann-Pick research projects . The Sharp family are hosting the Cure4Ed Family Fun Day on Sunday, October 26 at Balgowlah Bowling Club . Between hospital appointments and raising their family, Eddie's parents spend time fundraising and raising awareness about Niemann-Pick research projects. The research could also lead to a breakthrough for Alzheimer’s patients with doctors saying the diseases are closely linked. The NPC Foundation, which is supporting the research, needs to raise $120,000 by the end of the year. Ms Malone is also working to obtain funding for music therapy programs for children diagnosed with Niemann-Pick. Eddie's family will host the Cure4Ed Family Fun Day on Sunday, October 26 at Balgowlah Bowling Club. For more information visit the Cure4Ed  blog  or the NPC Foundation website. What is it? A person with Niemann Pick Disease Type C is unable to process cholesterol properly. Excessive amounts of cholesterol accumulate in their liver and spleen and eventually their brain, doing irreversible damage. Symptoms . Enlarged spleen and liver, prolonged jaundice, progressive loss of motor skills, difficultly walking, slurred speech, swallowing problems, seizures and dementia. How is it inherited? A child with Niemann-Pick disease would have inherited one abnormal genes from each of their parents. These genes are recessive, which means the parents may not have any clinical signs. There is a 25 percent the child will inherit the disease.","Eddie Sharp, 4, was born with a metabolic disease known as Niemann-Pick Disease Type C .
