"(CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrives in Tokyo on Monday on the first leg of a major week long trip to Asia. Biden lands at a time of significant regional tension following Beijing's announcement last week of a new ""air defense identification zone"" situated between China and Japan. Since the declaration of the air zone, China has insisted that all aircraft must submit flight plans before entering. The United States has urged calm, and this will be a theme which Biden will emphasize during his visit. The zone includes airspace over islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, which both countries claim as their own. The dispute over these territories is not new, but has become more salient since the Japanese government decided to nationalize them last year. Since last week, Washington has recommended that U.S. commercial aircraft report their flight plans to Beijing, although U.S. military aircraft continue to operate without notification. Meanwhile, Japan (which also continues to operate flights in the zone) announced on Saturday that it has asked the UN organization that oversees civil aviation to examine whether the zone could undermine aviation safety. Tokyo's ambition here is to bring enhanced international scrutiny to this issue in a bid to undercut Beijing. While air zones of this nature are commonplace across the world -- Japan declared its own exclusion zone, which partially overlaps China's, in the late 1960s -- there is concern that China has both imposed this measure unilaterally and warned that it will take unspecified ""emergency defensive measures"" if aircraft do not comply with submitting flight plans (already, it has frayed some nerves by sending fighter jets to investigate U.S. and Japanese aircraft in the zone). Whatever Beijing's motives in declaring the zone, it will add to the growing international tide of suspicion and sometimes even outright hostility as China increasingly asserts its growing power. The central challenge the country faces here is that its soft power -- its ability to win the hearts and minds of other nations and influence their governments through attraction rather than coercion or payment -- has lagged far behind its hard power built on its growing economic and military might. In Japan, for instance, public favorability toward China fell from 34% to 5% between 2011 and 2013, according to Pew Global, largely in response to China's new international assertiveness. Meanwhile, in the United States public favorability toward China fell to 37% in 2013 from 51% in 2011. Issues such as Beijing's alleged currency manipulation, the large size of the U.S. trade deficit with China and the large U.S. financial debt held by Beijing, not to mention alleged Chinese cybersecurity attacks on U.S. interests, has taken its toll on U.S. public opinion. With distrust of China growing, many countries in Asia-Pacific are actively strengthening their diplomatic alliances, particularly with Washington, in a bid to balance Beijing's growing economic and military strength. This is a political headache the new Chinese leadership could do without and it must now think hard about how to enhance the country's image in the world. Most immediately, Beijing must restart a process of addressing concerns of foreign governments about its intentions. Here, it needs to intensify efforts to be seen as a responsible, peaceful power. And match this rhetoric with actions. President Xi Jinping made a good start toward this goal in his landmark summit with U.S. President Barack Obama last summer. He pledged to form a ""new model of co-operation"" and that ""China and the United States must find a new path ... one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past."" As the Pew Global data indicates, China's international image would also benefit from enhanced public diplomacy to win more foreign ""hearts and minds."" At a symbolic level, example measures might include utilizing the country's growing capabilities in space travel for high-profile international cooperation projects. Surveys underline that many around the world admire China's strength in science and technology. A related problem to be tackled is that international communications of Chinese state institutions often lack legitimacy and credibility with foreigners. One solution might be expanding the numbers of non-state groups -- including from civil society networks, diaspora communities, student and academic groups and business networks -- involved in the country's diplomatic outreach. For many foreign publics, there also needs to be stronger Chinese commitment to domestic political change, transparency and concrete steps towards democratization. Many in the international community are likely to remain wary of the country while it clamps down on its own citizens seeking domestic reform, including human rights activists. Taken overall, the challenges ahead for China are deep-seated and will require sustained investment and significant reform. However, unless they are tackled, the country's reputational problems will increasingly disable, rather than enable, its ambitions as a rising super power.

"(CNN) -- Courtesy of the U.S. government shutdown, Chinese President Xi Jinping finds himself in the box seat at his first Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as leader of the world's second largest economy. Usually the United States makes the running at the annual APEC get-together of China, the U.S., Russia, Japan and 17 other Asia-Pacific economies that between them account for half the world's output, 45% of its trade and 3 billion of its inhabitants. But U.S. President Barack Obama's decision to pull out of the APEC forum and leaders' retreat in Bali, Indonesia this week because of a domestic political brawl leaves Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin as the two most powerful men in attendance. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry now leads the U.S. delegation to Indonesia for APEC and to the East Asia summit and U.S.-ASEAN meetings that follow in Brunei starting Wednesday. Obama's cancellation was no surprise. He had already trimmed Malaysia and the Philippines from his Asia itinerary because of the failure of the U.S. Congress to pass a new budget. The possibility that the U.S. government shutdown could escalate into the almost-unthinkable disaster of a debt default later this month prompted him to drop the visit entirely. As Obama warned the world in remarks in Rockville, Maryland Thursday, ""As reckless as a government shutdown is, ... an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse."" Obama's comments have been dismissed by his Republican opponents as scare tactics, but the world economy can do without this sort of drama. As Putin said after the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, last month, the global economy is doing better than it was five years ago, ""but the risks are still very high."" Obama was scheduled to speak Monday, the last day of the APEC forum before the leaders' retreat on Tuesday, on a theme that now seems particularly pertinent -- ""America's leadership and priorities: What they mean for the world."" Obama's 2010 ""pivot to Asia"" policy was supposed to enmesh the U.S. ever more deeply into the region, as a counterweight to the rapidly growing influence of China. But he cancelled trips to Asia in 2010 because of domestic pressures, and in 2012 declined an invitation to attend the APEC forum in Vladivostok because of the timing of the Democratic convention. His cancellation statement on Thursday showed his frustration at another domestic issue getting in the way of his Asia-Pacific aspirations: ""This completely avoidable shutdown is setting back our ability to create jobs through promotion of U.S. exports and advance U.S. leadership and interests in the largest emerging region in the world."" Obama's withdrawal is a gift for Putin and Xi. Putin, who was scheduled to follow Obama on the APEC speaking agenda, has as his conversation theme the evocative ""Taking another look at the Asia Pacific: Where are the new opportunities for growth?"" Xi is APEC's final speaker and will deliver a keynote address entitled ""China in transition: What can the Asia Pacific expect?"" China's economy may have slowed a little in 2013 and its structural employment, environmental and social issues present big challenges ahead, but it remains very much the regional engine of growth and its Asian neighbors know their prosperity is intimately linked to what happens in China. The U.S., of course, has enormous commercial advantages as a consequence of its recent shale gas energy revolution, but the current political impasse is putting stress on its reputation, and a debt default -- however unlikely it may be -- would be an enormous setback. With Obama out of the APEC picture, Kerry is doing the heavy lifting in discussions with Xi, Putin and other key leaders such as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indonesian host President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. In particular, Kerry is pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations that have the ultimate objective of creating a free trade pact for Asia-Pacific nations. Twelve countries are in the TPP talks -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan (which entered in July this year), Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. Although some observers see the TPP as an U.S.-promoted exclusionary device aimed at China, Xi has already welcomed the ""mushrooming"" of regional free trade agreements (FTAs) as a ""positive sign."" In remarks released by his office last week, Xi referred to a Chinese saying, ""the ocean is vast because it admits hundreds of rivers,"" and said China supported the process of Asia-Pacific economic integration with an ""open attitude."" But, he said, ""at the same time, we believe that in developing FTAs, the parties should cherish the principles of openness, inclusiveness and transparency and, in particular, demonstrate flexibility for economies at different development stages, so as to offer more options for integration."" There is an expectation on the Chinese side that it will be a TPP member within three or four years, though issues such as restrictions on internet access remain a potential stumbling block. When Xi and Obama met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in St. Petersburg last month, the focus was on Syria, greenhouse gases, global economic growth, job creation and investment. In part, it was a continuation of their informal discussions in California in June this year, when Xi made it clear that he wanted to work with Obama on building what he called a ""new model of a major country relationship."" For Xi, APEC would have been another opportunity to talk to Obama about rebalancing the U.S.-China relationship, to give due weight to what Xi regards as China's role as a world power not just economically, but in strategic terms as well. Instead, he has more time this week to talk with Putin about the growing Sino-Russia relationship and with other Asia-Pacific leaders on regional free trade agreements, economic integration, expanded investment co-operation and sustainable long-term growth.","Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin speak at APEC Monday .

"(CNN) -- Two teenage high school students in Georgia face misdemeanor public indecency charges after a sex act allegedly was performed during lunch in the school cafeteria, a school official told CNN. The alleged incident occurred October 10 at Etowah High School in Woodstock, nearly 35 miles north of Atlanta. ""A female student allegedly made a sexual offer to a male classmate during lunch,"" Barbara Jacoby, a spokeswoman for the high school told CNN in a statement Wednesday. ""The male classmate later told administrators that he thought this offer was a joke, but when the female student began to act upon it, the male student said he stopped her,"" Jacoby said. The incident was recorded on the cell phone of at least two students, according to Jacoby, who said there is no evidence to suggest the video was shared or viewed by other students. CNN spoke to an unidentified student at the school who said the video was shared and viewed beyond the group involved. At least seven boys and one girl were involved, with one of the boys ""daring"" the girl to perform the act, the student said. But Jacoby said the students who recorded the incident on Wednesday reiterated to authorities that they deleted the video ""after realizing they might face charges for possessing it and did not distribute it."" She also told CNN that talk of distribution of the video was rumor. School officials who were present in the cafeteria at the time of the alleged incident became aware that something had happened after students began talking among each other about what happened, the student told CNN. Jacoby said students sitting at a cafeteria table ""blocked other students and staff from witnessing what occurred."" ""[School officials are in the cafeteria] but they usually just stand in the middle to make sure nobody leaves the cafeteria, but I guess they don't really monitor,"" one Etowah High School student told CNN affiliate WSB-TV. ""Appropriate school disciplinary action will occur for all students; the details of that action cannot be disclosed due to student privacy laws,"" Jacoby said. CNN's Divina Mims contributed to this report.","Two high school students face charges after alleged sex act .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Russell Peters has been a stand-up comic for 24 years, has a worldwide following and is one of the highest-earning comedians in the world, among Jerry Seinfeld, Louis C.K. and Chris Rock. He was the first comic to play at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, and has appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,"" ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" and Comedy Central. But in the United States, he is not a household name. ""I know how it goes,"" he said before accepting an award at the South Asians in Media, Marketing and Entertainment Summit last month. ""First (Hollywood) calls Aziz (Ansari), then Aasif (Mandvi), then me."" Peters may not have been on a mainstream network or cable American television show like Ansari of ""Parks and Recreation"" or Mandvi of ""The Daily Show."" But it hasn't stopped the comedian from filling arenas and setting his sights on more. His millions of fans around the world know that Peters' comedy is based on making the kind of cultural observations few can get away with in a politically correct culture. ""Who I am on stage is just an amped up version of who I am in real life, "" he said. The Anglo-Indian Canadian -- he was born outside Toronto to Indian parents -- has an insider-outsider act that manages to both unite and offend fans and critics. Case in point: His monologue about the Portuguese language, which he said sounds like badly pronounced Spanish spoken by a deaf person. The act did not endear him to Portuguese speakers. Then there's his take on stereotypes about Arabs: ""I don't do any Arab jokes in my act. It's not that I don't think (they're) funny, I just, you know, I don't wanna die."" His personal observations of his own family have drawn in a lot of fans, too. His act about his father -- a character created from stories about his own father and a friend's -- considered how different families approach discipline for their kids. Peters told audiences that before his father hit him, his dad would say ""Somebody gonna get hurt real bad!"" Peters jokes that he hated the line about ""somebody."" ""You knew it was you, but it gave you this hope,"" he said. The video of the act went viral and catapulted the comic beyond Canada to an international audience. Soon, his impersonations of Indian and Cantonese accents became his comedic signature -- earning laughs and criticism. Now, with the release of a four-part documentary and Netflix's first comedy special, ""Notorious,"" Peters' continues to ""go there,"" and bring viewers along for the ride. ""My intention is to make you laugh, that's all I want to do. My intention is never to hurt anybody's feelings,"" he said. CNN spoke to Peters in New York when he was being awarded a 2013 Trailblazer Award by the South Asians in Media, Marketing and Entertainment Association. In this edited conversation, he shares what he learned while doing stand-up, and how understanding his bullies prepared him for a career in comedy. CNN: How would you describe your voice in comedy? Peters: Frank, blunt, unapologetic and my intent is to make you laugh, not to do anything else. I'm not really trying to make you think too hard, but sometimes I say things just to see if you're paying attention. And that's how I gauge how up or down the intellectual scale I'm going to go. CNN: Take me back to growing up in Toronto. You've talked about being bullied, taking up boxing and being immersed in hip-hop culture to deal with that time in your life. Tell me how these forces shaped you and shaped, eventually, your comedy. Peters: When you're at a young age being reminded that you're not like everyone else, and you were called 'Paki' or whatever they did, or they'd spit on you or kick you ... I didn't understand. I couldn't figure it out, because obviously racism, prejudice is a learned behavior. It's not a natural instinct, you know. So the boxing gave me the confidence that I needed , and the hip-hop gave me the identity that I needed. CNN: What would you tell the younger Russell who was being bullied at that time? Peters: Here's the thing, I was never like, down... For me, I think it just goes to who you are inside. My goal was always to try and figure out what they hated about me. I was never like: ""I hate you, too."" It was more like, ""Well I don't really like what you're doing to me, but I would like to get into your brain to figure out why you're doing this to me."" So whenever I meet and go to different countries or meet different cultures I automatically try and think the way they think so I can approach them the way they need to be approached. CNN: That must have been really helpful in comedy. Peters: Well that's why we're here today, because that somehow has bled into my comedy and that's the way I approach it. I don't feel like excluding people. I want to include everybody. And the more people in on the joke the better it is, you know? CNN: What would you like your fans to know about you, that they don't know from your comedy? Peters: I think a lot of people mistake my confidence on stage for cockiness in real life, and that's actually farthest from the truth. When I'm on stage I'm that confident and that cocky, because I have a microphone in my hand, and there's a few thousand people staring at me. And I know they're there to laugh. But you take that all away from me, and I'm back to Regular Joe status, where I may have a little bit of confidence, but I'm not just gonna roll up on some chick because, you know, I think I'm somebody else. No matter where you are, the root of you is designed from a young age. So if my confidence was taken as a child, you can gain back a lot of the confidence, but that root of the cavity will still be there.","Comedian Russell Peters' releases the first original Netflix comedy special, ""Notorious""

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho and Andre Villas-Boas might be poles apart personally, but their teams could not be separated at White Hart Lane on Saturday as Chelsea drew 1-1 with Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League. Villas-Boas, who spent seven years working under Mourinho at Porto, Chelsea and finally Inter Milan, was facing his old mentor for the first time since their friendship dissolved. Most of the pre-match press conference questions on Friday had focused on the pair's fall out in 2009. Villas-Boas explained the men were once close, but didn't lose any sleep over the acrimonious split. Mourinho, meanwhile, steadfastly refused to talk about their relationship publicly. ""I don't discuss this with the media, it's a personal thing. I don't care what he says. I'm not here to do that. I'm not interested."" Mourinho said Friday. Read more: Gay soccer players want to come out . It was perhaps inevitable then that the two men exchanged a lukewarm handshake prior to the kick-off before what turned out to be a keenly contested affair. Villas-Boas' Spurs side drew blood first in the 19th minute with a well-worked goal. Christian Eriksen beat Frank Lampard before dashing forward and playing in Roberto Soldado. The Spanish striker then laid the ball off to Gylfi Sigurdsson, who fended off a challenge from John Terry before shooting past Petr Cech. The Icelandic midfielder could have doubled the lead four minutes later but was denied by a Branislav Ivanovic block as he was waiting to tap the ball in. At the start of the second half, Mourinho brought on Spanish midfielder Juan Mata for John Obi Mikel and Chelsea's fortunes soon started to improve. Read more: Messi testifies in tax trial . Oscar should have converted a Fernando Torres cross three minutes after the restart and Mata had the ball in the back of the net in the 57th minute, only for the goal to be disallowed for offside. Eight minutes later Chelsea scored again but this time the goal stood as John Terry flicked a Juan Mata free-kick past Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal. Chelsea were now in the ascendency with Lloris denying substitute Andre Schuerrle after Torres had playing the German in on goal in the 78th minute. But the game swung back in the home side's favor three minutes later when Torres was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for tangling with Jan Vertonghen for a second time in the half. Read more: Dortmund batter Freiburg . As the Spanish striker departed, so too did Chelsea's chances of winning and it was Spurs who were gunning for three points as the clock ticked down. Both Jermain Defoe and Sigurdsson had chances to win the game but neither could convert. As the final whistle blew, the master and his former apprentice shared a rather warmer-looking embrace, safe in the knowledge that any personal or professional rivalries can be put aside until later in the season. The return fixture at Stamford Bridge takes place in March, but two domestic cup competitions could still bring the Portuguese maestros together again long before then. City and United stunned . Last weekend, it was Manchester City fans who were cheering following a thumping 4-1 win over neighbors United. This week both sets of fans were reeling from shock defeats. United lost 2-1 to West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford while City went down to Aston Villa 3-2 at Villa Park. A 54th minute goal from Morgan Amalfitano saw the visitors take the lead but it was canceled out three minutes later by Wayne Rooney. The United of old may well have gone on to dominate the match after drawing level but it was West Brom's Saido Berahino who delivered the knockout blow in the 67th minute. The win is West Brom's first at the Theatre of Dreams since 1979 and leaves David Moyes' United stuck in mid-table with seven points from six games -- their worst start to a league season for 24 years. ""We didn't defend well in the second half, but when we got back in, I expected us to win it with the talent we have got,"" Moyes said. ""People come here expecting us to play well, but we didn't play well. We tried to pick it up in the second half, but we got done by it as well. You're always going to have bad results. It is how you deal with them. There are lots of games to come and it's about how you deal with them, so we look forward to them,"" Moyes added. After back-to-back defeats in the league, United now face a test of nerve in the Champions League when they travel to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. City, meanwhile, were stunned by a second-half assault by Villa after Yaya Toure had volleyed home the opening goal in the 45th minute. Karim El Ahmadi leveled the scores in the 51st minute before a Edin Dzeko header put City ahead again five minutes later. But two goals in two minutes from Leandro Bacuna in the 73rd minute and Andreas Weimann moments later sealed an improbable win against Manuel Pellegrini's multi-million dollar side. Arsenal top the table . Arsenal took full toll of the situation in the late kick-off beating Swansea City 2-1 at the Liberty Stadium. Second-half goals from Serge Gnabry and Aaron Ramsey earned the Gunners all three points despite a spirited late surge from the home side which saw Ben Davies half the deficit. After losing to Aston Villa on the opening day of the season, Arsene Wenger's side have now won five on the bounce and are two points clear of second-place Spurs. Liverpool will move up to second if they can beat bottom side Sunderland by more than two goals on Sunday. In the remaining Premier League fixtures on Saturday, Southampton beat Crystal Palace 2-0 to move up to fourth in the table. Hull City beat West Ham United 1-0 while Cardiff City beat Fulham 2-1 at Craven Cottage.","Jose Mourinho's Chelsea draw 1-1 with Andre Villas-Boas' Tottenham Hotspur side .

"(CNN) -- Both pro- and anti-government demonstrators mobbed British Prime Minister David Cameron as he visited northern Sri Lanka on Friday, CNN affiliate ITN reported. ITN's Bill Neely tweeted that there was ""full-scale chaos"" as Cameron left a library in Jaffna, with ""hundreds of screaming"" protesters and police pushing people to the ground. During Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war, Jaffna, the capital of Northern Province, was a stronghold of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and a frequent battleground for clashes with government troops. Cameron is in Sri Lanka for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The summit opened Friday amid concerns about the rights situation after Sri Lanka's war with the Tamil rebels, which ended in 2009. The prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius and India opted not to attend. Cameron issued a statement Thursday saying he saw his attendance as ""an opportunity to raise our concerns clearly and directly, and to focus the eyes of the world on Sri Lanka."" He also reiterated calls for an investigation into alleged human rights abuses during and after the war. Announcing Cameron's northern visit this month, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said four years after its war ended Sri Lanka is ""still a country where civil society is suppressed, where (nongovernmental organizations) and the media are routinely intimidated, where journalists and critics of the government have disappeared, and where no one has been held to account for alleged war crimes including rape and sexual violence."" The north, Hague said, was ""where some of the worst fighting and suffering occurred, and thousands of people are still displaced from their homes."" On Friday, Cameron tweeted: ""I'm the first PM or president to go to the north of Sri Lanka since 1948. I want to shine a light on chilling events there first hand. ""Political leaders in the north of Sri Lanka tell me they are glad I've come to help highlight what is happening here."" Read more: Sri Lanka envoy slams rights criticism . ITN's Neely said the protesters who surrounded Cameron included both mothers of Tamils who had disappeared and pro-government protesters with signs saying ""no interference"" and ""leave us in peace."" As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka's war. In its final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left a large number of civilians dead. The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and various nongovernmental organizations. In his statement Thursday, Cameron said: ""Together we must say clearly to the government of Sri Lanka -- our hosts -- that there must be accountability for the past and respect for human rights today,"" he said. ""Four years on from the end of the civil war and defeat of the 'Tamil Tigers,' a brutal terrorist organization, there has been nowhere near enough improvement. We need to see more progress: genuine freedom of expression and the media, an end to the intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders, action to stamp out torture, demilitarization of the north and reconciliation between communities. ""And of course we need to see a thorough investigation into alleged war crimes."" On Friday, David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, told CNN's Atika Shubert that calling for an international inquiry into what happened at the end of the war was one of the most important things Cameron could do. ""The Sri Lankans have their own process which is a bit of a joke -- there's a total lack of accountability -- so there needs to be an international inquiry. In addition to this, the UK needs to put real pressure on the ongoing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka today."" In an interview that aired Thursday on CNN's ""Amanpour,"" Sri Lanka's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Chris Nonis, denied that an independent international inquiry is needed. ""We respect the independence and sovereignty of your country, and we expect you to respect ours. We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years. We have perfectly educated people, and I think we're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry,"" he told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. Nonis pointed to the 2011 ""Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission"" report, which Sri Lanka's president ordered. ""It's a very holistic, very comprehensive, very impartial report. It had over 5,000 hearings, and it's set within the principle of international humanitarian law, incorporating the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality."" Nonis said the report had been released in full despite containing criticism of successive governments and the government had gone ""a substantial way"" toward implementing some of its recommendations. The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the British Empire. Its charter focuses on developing ""free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth.""

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the tragic shootings at Columbine High School, some schools across the country turned themselves into near-fortresses. Kindergarden students huddle beneath desks in a lockdown drill. Such drills have become common. They installed metal detectors and security cameras, banned backpacks, required students to carry IDs and posted police in the hallways -- all in the name of keeping students safe. Now, 10 years after those highly publicized shootings in which two young men killed 13 people and themselves, school security has taken another dramatic turn. Some of the noticeable security measures remain, but experts say the country is exploring a new way to protect kids from in-school violence: administrators now want to foster school communities that essentially can protect themselves with or without the high-tech gear. ""The first and best line of defense is always a well-trained, highly alert staff and student body,"" said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, an Ohio-based firm specializing in school security. ""The No. 1 way we find out about weapons in schools is not from a piece of equipment [such as a metal detector] but from a kid who comes forward and reports it to an adult that he or she trusts.""  See how many homicides have occurred in schools since 1992 » . The Obama administration plans to create secure schools indirectly, by improving overall education, getting kids more involved in their studies and strengthening school communities, said William Modzeleski, a high-ranking official in the U.S. Department of Education who handles school security. The trend is reflected in security funding, some of which comes from federal grants. Allocations for the Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools program were cut by a third between 1999 and 2008, to about $294.8 million last year. And a program that has put about 6,300 police officers in public schools since Columbine was scrapped by the U.S. Department of Justice after 2005, according to Corey Ray, a spokesman for the department. Ray said he's hopeful President Obama's stimulus package will put more police officers in schools. They act as law enforcement officers as well as counselors and mentors to students, he said. Meanwhile, money for a school counseling grant program has increased since Columbine, with $52 million set aside for this fiscal year, compared to $20 million in 2000, the first year the program was funded, according to budget numbers compiled for CNN by the Department of Education. So while there's more money available for counseling, there's still been a steady decline in federal spending for other aspects of school security. Some critics say a lack of available funding for high-tech security upgrades may be behind the shift toward less-costly and more indirect violence prevention measures. ""Right now, the economic situation is affecting [school security funding]. Particularly the technology components of security are going to suffer because there's just not going to be the money to do these kinds of things,"" said Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators. ""We're in the process of laying off teachers and staff."" Trump, the security consultant in Ohio, said schools have lost their focus on security since Columbine. But he added that many effective security programs cost little or no money -- only the time it takes to train teachers and students how to spot potential problems and how to react if a shooting were to occur. While metal detectors may not be the best tools to prevent school shootings, they still can be useful in some crime-ridden school districts and, along with security cameras, should not be abandoned entirely, Modzeleski said. Some evidence suggests strong school communities -- where kids feel like they can come forward with problems -- can prevent violent crime. A 2008 Secret Service report found that in more than 80 percent of instances of school violence, at least one person, usually a fellow student or peer, had knowledge of the attackers' plans. If people who suspect a problem feel comfortable enough in school to tell a teacher or a principal, then attacks could be prevented, Modzeleski said. After Columbine, many states and school districts made quick moves to increase school security, experts say. Modzeleski said this was a ""kneejerk"" reaction to the tragic, but rare, event; and a decade later, policies are settling into a middle ground. ""Immediately after any of these incidents I think there's the immediate rush for more security,"" he said. ""That's what I would call the kneejerk reaction to any type of these events: 'We need more cops; we need more metal detectors; we need more cameras.' After that settles in, I think people come to their senses and say, 'Hey, if we're going to keep our kids safe in schools, we need more than that.'"" iReport.com: How did Columbine affect you? After Columbine, some states started requiring schools to prepare for school shootings with lockdown drills, much in the way they prepare for fires or other disasters. About once a month in Fort Wayne, Indiana, public and private school students pull down window shades and huddle in the back corners of dark classrooms while their schools go into lockdown mode, said John Weicker, security director at Fort Wayne Community Schools. A school administrator roams the halls to make sure all doors are locked and all students are hidden from what might be a school shooter if this scenario was not a drill. ""You're training the kids,"" Weicker said. Similar drills -- which, in some states, are attended by armed and masked SWAT teams -- are now practiced routinely in nearly three-quarters of schools, according to a recent survey of 445 administrators funded by the American Association of School Administrators. It's difficult to say whether these policies are working, but by some measures, school safety has improved in the decade since Columbine.  Watch parents remember children lost at Columbine » . On average, there have been about half as many deaths per year since Columbine as in the seven school years before the tragedy, according to a 2007 report from the National Center for Education Statistics and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In the school year immediately following the Columbine shootings, the number of in-school homicides dropped from 33 in the 1998-1999 school year to 13 in the 1999-2000 year, the report says. Several experts say the tragedy brought awareness to the issue of school security, which on the whole has been positive. They worry, however, that attention has been waning in the past few years. A 17-year-old student in Fort Wayne, Indiana, however, said that while he is reassured by tight school security, it's a good thing that the Columbine shootings rarely enter his mind. ""There's a couple times that we'll talk about it in like a history class,"" said Travis Armstrong, a high school junior. ""Because that did happen back a while ago, and therefore it is considered history.""","10 years after Columbine, schools are taking a new look at security .

"(CNN) -- The separatist New Black Panther Party, described as a hate group by a civil rights organization, is standing by its $10,000 bounty offer for the capture of the man who shot Trayvon Martin, despite vehement opposition from, among others, Martin's family. ""We're here to make them do their job,"" organizer Mikhail Muhammad said on Monday. ""We will support Trayvon's family, but we are military."" Martin was shot February 26 by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, while walking back from a Sanford, Florida, convenience store. Zimmerman, according to friends and his attorney, Craig Sonner, said he killed Martin, 17, in self-defense. The fact he hasn't been charged in Martin's killing has outraged many in the United States, including people who believe Martin was considered ""suspicious"" because he was black. Zimmerman is a white Hispanic. Yet no one has gone as far as the New Black Panther Party, which on its website advocates a revolution for African-Americans. The group -- which is distinct from the better known Black Panther Party, founded in the late 1960s -- is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group and a ""virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization."" On Saturday, the party put out a wanted poster offering money in return for a ""legal citizen's arrest"" of Zimmerman. Muhammad said that same day that his group believed in ""a life for a life,"" an assertion that he reiterated on Monday. Martin family attorney Daryl Parks echoed comments by others associated with the family, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, condemning the apparent bounty offer. ""We don't condone those people whatsoever,"" Parks said. Speaking earlier Monday to city officials in a packed Sanford Civic Center, Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, said his family wanted to work through the legal system and spur changes in Sanford's police department and Florida law. ""We're not asking for an eye for an eye,"" Tracy Martin said. ""We're asking for justice, justice, justice."" Mohammad said the U.S. Constitution grants people the right to make a citizen's arrest, although he also said, a short time later, that he doesn't ""obey the white man's law, I don't follow the American law."" ""According to the street people's law, (George Zimmerman) has been charged with murder -- according to street law, according to God's law,"" Muhammad said. The city of Sanford earlier responded to the bounty offer, and the New Black Panther Party's push to have 5,000 men work together to go after Zimmerman, by calling for ""calm heads and no vigilante justice."" ""Attempts by civilians to take any person into custody may result in criminal charges or unnecessary violence,"" the department said. Joe Oliver, a friend of Zimmerman's, said such threats are weighing heavily on his friend, even if authorities and the Martin family are denouncing them. Zimmerman hasn't been seen or heard from in public since the shooting, . ""That's why no one knows where he's at,"" Oliver said. ""He should be concerned for his safety."" Oliver, a CNN anchor in the 1990s, said he's worried himself because he has spoken on several media outlets about the case. ""I now have to be concerned for my safety, not just for myself but for my friends and family as well,"" he said. ""Yet I wasn't there, I didn't pull the trigger. All I'm doing is standing up for a friend.""","New Black Panther Party offers $10,000 for ""citizen's arrest"" of George Zimmerman .

"(CNN) -- South Korean shop owners are launching a nationwide boycott of Japanese products over a territorial dispute between the two countries. The President of the Save Local Stores Alliances, Oh Ho-suk, claims most of the alliance's 7.2 million members will ultimately participate in the effort. They are pledging not to sell popular Japanese products like Mild Seven cigarettes, Asahi beer and Sony electronics. Some car mechanics are also saying they will refuse to repair cars from Japanese brands like Toyota, Honda and Nissan. ""We will continue this boycott until we get a sincere apology from the Japanese government,"" Oh says. His group is angry over Japan's continuing claim to a series of islands that lie between the two countries. Seoul calls the islands Dokdo, Tokyo calls them Takeshima. Both countries claim them, but they are currently under South Korean control. The dispute is the latest in a series of competing national claims to islands in the East and South China seas, where ownership can give exclusive rights to fishing, oil production and other commercial activities in surrounding waters. Large Japanese exporters like Toyota and Canon suffered declining sales in China last fall when a separate island dispute between those two countries escalated into a major product boycott. Protests turned violent in September after the Japanese government purchased the island chain -- known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan -- from private Japanese owners. This is the first such boycott to be launched over the recent flare-up in tensions between Japan and South Korea. Police say over 200 people participated in a protest today in Seoul to launch the boycott, chanting ""we will not sell or buy Japanese products."" They threw eggs at a sign featuring Japanese brand logos, waved South Korean flags and held signs reading ""Dokdo is our territory"" and the ""Japanese government must apologize."" Many of the women attending dressed in the traditional Korean garb known as the hanbok. The protests marched from Topgol Park to Gwanghwamun Square. Oh says they handed out 50,000 flyers about the boycott. March 1 is a public holiday in South Korea which celebrates the launch of the independence movement from Japan in 1919. Japan Tobacco, owner of Mild Seven, Winston and Camel, and Asahi Breweries declined to comment on the boycott. CNN's Junko Ogura in Tokyo contributed to this report.","South Korean shop owners are launching a nationwide boycott of Japanese products .

"(CNN)  -- The co-pilot of a Northwest Airlines flight that overshot the Minneapolis, Minnesota, airport by 150 miles says he and the pilot weren't asleep and they weren't arguing. However, Richard I. Cole, who spoke to CNN affiliate KGW-TV from his Salem, Oregon, home, wouldn't say much more Friday. He said an investigation will reveal what took place. After repeatedly saying he couldn't talk about the case, Cole said that contrary to media reports, ""Nobody was asleep in the cockpit. No arguments took place. ""But other than that, I cannot tell you anything that went on because we're having hearings this weekend, we're having hearings on Tuesday. All that information will come out then."" Cole said there's been ""a lot of misinformation that's going on. Things are being said that didn't happen, but I can't go into any details."" Northwest Flight 188 -- an Airbus A320 carrying 144 people and five crew members -- flew past the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport beginning about 7:56 ET Wednesday night while en route from San Diego, California. There were 78 minutes of radio silence. Air traffic controllers re-established radio contact after the plane had flown about 150 miles past its destination. Watch as a passenger wonders what was going on . Police who met the wayward jet said the pilots were ""cooperative, apologetic and appreciative."" The airport police report, released Friday, said officers asked flight attendants to keep passengers in their seats while they checked out the cockpit. The report identified the pilot as Timothy B. Cheney and Cole as the first officer. ""The pilot ... indicated they had become involved in conversation and had not heard radio communications,"" the report said. ""They indicated there had been no involvement from anyone in the cabin."" The report said, ""Both volunteered to a preliminary breath test with the result being .000 for both parties."" The lead flight attendant told officers she was unaware there had been an incident aboard, the report said. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, is hoping the plane's cockpit voice recorder will either confirm the pilot's account or provide evidence of another possible explanation, including whether the captain and first officer had fallen asleep. Earlier, the NTSB released a statement that said, ""The crew stated they were in a heated discussion over airline policy and they lost situational awareness."" Watch how the Flight 188 drama unfolded . The voice recorder is capable of recording only 30 minutes of audio, federal accident investigators said Friday. The plane was in the air for another 45 minutes after radio contact was restored, meaning that if the recorder was working properly, anything the pilots would have said during the time they were not answering radio calls would have been recorded over. But a former accident investigator said the voice recorder may still provide valuable information, because the pilots could have discussed the earlier events on the way back to Minneapolis. The separate flight data recorder also could prove valuable because it would have recorded actions taken by the pilots during the 78 minutes they did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers, the investigator said. Watch as a former NTSB official calls the long silence ""unacceptable"" The safety board said Friday that experts were reviewing the solid-state voice recorder. It said the recorder ""captured a portion of the flight that is being analyzed"" and added there would be no further comment.","Northwest Airlines co-pilot denies reports of cockpit argument .

"(CNN) -- Europe must stop being nationalistic if it wants to help a lost generation of workers, the regional boss of U.S. conglomerate General Electric says. Speaking with CNN's Max Foster, Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, chief executive officer of GE Europe, said: ""You have some areas of Europe where unemployment is 30, 40, 50%,"" he added, ""that drives the thinking that if you go nationalistic you're going to solve the problem.""

In February, the U.S. and the European Union announced that they would begin talks on a multi-trillion dollar free-trade pact -- known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership -- to boost economic growth.

"(CNN) -- Now that the urgent business of the government shutdown and the debt ceiling is over, it is a good time for Republicans to stop and think. Below is an excerpt from the strategy memo I shared with House Republicans Wednesday morning on the situation currently facing the Republican Party. I believe that with the right approach and an emphasis on a better future for all Americans, we can win and govern in 2014, 2016, and beyond, but that it will take some profound rethinking of how to make our case to the American people. The current situation . The left, broadly speaking -- President Barack Obama, most of the news media, left-wing interest groups, Democrats --believes it sees an opportunity to create a wave election similar to those of 1994, 2006, 2010 and retake majority control of the House of Representatives. Their goal is to describe the Republican Party as an unacceptably radical party and defeat individual candidates by suppressing Republican turnout, driving independents away from Republicans and maximizing turnout of the Democratic base. In particular, efforts to control spending in Medicare and Medicaid and to reduce or eliminate funding for left-wing activities will consistently be described as radical and unacceptable. Reading the polls after the recent government shutdown, the left believes (mistakenly, I think) that this model is now even more likely to succeed. Those same polls also reveal extraordinary opportunity for Republicans. The fact is that Americans are fed up with Washington, not just with Republicans. They believe America is on the wrong track, and Obama's approval rating is now among lowest of his presidency. While Republicans are currently on defense, the failures and costs of Obamacare, the continuing weak economy in jobs and take-home pay, growing government debt, and inevitable failures of bureaucratic big government will only make it more obvious that Washington and the bureaucracy is hopelessly broken. And the Democrats have very publicly reaffirmed themselves as the party of big government bureaucracy, most recently with the launch of Obamacare. Republicans could respond to these failures of government by becoming the Party of Austerity. But the Party of Austerity can rapidly reduce its supporters as people are told what the austerity means for them personally. Policies of pain almost never work in the absence of a large crisis. They might also play into the Democrat caricature of Republicans as radical and unacceptable. There is a different strategy, however, which could dramatically unlock the current policy gridlock in Washington and create a new conversation in which Americans find the Republican Party to once again be the party of hope and opportunity (as it was in the Reagan years and in the 1994 Contract with America campaign). GOP: Website woes create fresh opening to go after Obamacare . An historic opportunity . The dramatic breakthroughs in science, technology, and entrepreneurship are creating new policy opportunities for a better future with a better economy, more take-home pay, better health, more learning, greater national security, a better, smaller, modernized government, and a balanced federal budget. In Washington insider terms, this sounds like a fantasy or an impossibility. In the dynamic world outside Washington, all of these capabilities are increasingly obvious but outside the political news media, the political language, and the thinking of politicians and their staffs and their consultants. This historic opportunity requires a very substantial change in the thinking and behavior of Republicans, and there will be enormous resistance to the change. A key Republican goal should be to have 80% of all communications for the next four years be positive -- about exciting breakthroughs, exciting opportunities, and a better future for virtually all Americans. Nothing would do more to defeat the left's current strategy than a positive Republican Party focused on opportunities for the future. Opinion: Immigration reform would help GOP . Offering Americans a better future . Our premise is that new science, technology, and entrepreneurship can lead to: . ● A rapidly growing economy with more jobs, more take-home pay and more economic opportunity; . ● A new system of better learning at lower cost for your entire lifetime; . ● A dramatic improvement in health outcomes and reduced costs leading to longer lives, greater independence for the elderly, and a dramatic increase in high-value jobs marketing American health innovations throughout the world; . ● A modernized government that is much less expensive, more effective, and more reliable and accountable; . ● A better environment through sound science, entrepreneurship, and focused problem-solving; . ● A stronger, leaner, less wasteful national security system; . ● A balanced budget within a decade through a combination of: . -- greater economic growth; . -- more government revenues from a larger economy and from royalties from energy and other natural resources; . -- dramatic modernization of government to reduce waste and eliminate fraud; . -- breakthroughs in health dramatically lowering the cost of health care; . -- returning power to the states and to the people. Opinion: 3 ways to avert Washington's next disaster . Budget Conference strategy . Republicans in the Budget Conference should focus first on economic growth, second on increased revenue through increased energy royalties, third on modernizing government to reduce fraud and theft, and fourth on dramatic opportunities for better health outcomes at lower costs. A tax increase for entitlement cuts agreement is a pain-pain agreement and can't possibly achieve our goals or be supported by the American people. There is no democracy in our lifetime that has sustained an austerity-led reform program. We need a new model of budget breakthroughs and this formula creates a new focus on a positive, opportunity-oriented future. What we are proposing is to replace the argument of more versus less with an argument of better future versus failed present. Today we have Republicans who want more savings and less taxes versus Democrats who want less savings and more taxes. Neither side is arguing for rethinking the fundamentals, learning from non-Washington developments, and modernizing government systems and policies. Better future vs. failed present would be a profound change in the very nature of the national debate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: Democrats see an opportunity to win back control of the House .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Friday that he has decided to close the country's consulate in Miami after the United States expelled a Venezuelan diplomat in the same city. Officials in his administration had recommended closing the consulate, Chavez said. ""So we'll close it. There won't be a consulate in Miami,"" the president told lawmakers during his annual address to the National Assembly. ""What we will do is an administrative closing while we study the situation,"" he said. The president called the U.S. decision to expel Livia Acosta Noguera, who headed Venezuela's consulate in Miami since March, ""unfair"" and immoral."" She had simply been doing her job, he said. Acosta was declared persona non grata and told to leave the United States, a State Department spokesman said this week. He declined to comment on specific details behind the move. Last month, a group of American lawmakers said they had ""grave concerns"" about Acosta. They called for an investigation after the Spanish-language TV channel Univision aired a documentary alleging that she was among a group of Venezuelan and Iranian diplomats who expressed interest in an offer from a group of Mexican hackers to infiltrate the websites of the White House, the FBI, the Pentagon and U.S. nuclear plants. The evidence that the plot was real, according to Univision, includes secret recordings with diplomats who ask about what the hackers can do and promise to send information to their governments. Univision interviewed a purported Mexican whistle-blower, a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico named Juan Carlos Munoz Ledo. The student told Univision he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyberattacks on the United States and its allies. Munoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Chavez. The Venezuelan president has called the report ""lies.""","NEW: Chavez says the expulsion of Livia Acosta was ""unfair"" and ""immoral""

"San Diego (CNN) -- On Election Day, Latinos stood up to the Republican Party that has tormented them for years and said: ""No mas!"" They gave the GOP, in state after state, a merciless beating and helped re-elect President Obama. They also sparked a family feud within the party -- about where to go from here. Convinced that Democrats have a record with Latinos that isn't much better, and that Obama -- because of his immigration enforcement record -- didn't deserve their support any more than Mitt Romney did, I advised Latinos to skip the line and vote for every office on the ballot except the one at the top. Instead, about 11 million Latinos voted for president. According to exit polls, Obama got 71% of the Latino vote, compared with just 27% for Romney. And they delivered three critical battleground states -- Colorado, Florida and Nevada. Although both parties need to be taught a lesson, I'll settle for half a loaf. The Democrats got some votes they didn't deserve, but the Republicans got exactly what they deserved. Opinion: GOP voter suppression fueled black turnout . It's a punishment that was a long time coming. It was in 1994, after California voters approved Proposition 187, a ballot initiative that sought to deny services to illegal immigrant, that Republicans learned that they could scare up votes and win elections by tapping into fear over changing demographics and offering shelter to racists and nativists who were anti-Latino. More recently, it was Republicans who gave us those do-it-yourself immigration laws in states like Arizona, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina that require local police to enforce federal immigration laws and make likely the ethnic profiling of Latinos. And, finally, it is Republicans who, when they're running for president, compete to see who can be toughest on illegal immigrants. Latinos watch all these dramas play out. They take notes. And they don't forget. And, in more bad news for the GOP, this is no small tribe we're talking about. With Latinos making up 16% of the U.S. population and projected to reach 30% by 2050, and with Latinos now representing 10% of the U.S. electorate and adding 2 million more voters in every presidential election, Republicans can either make peace or march toward extinction. Politics: What the election teaches us about ourselves . Personally, I hope they choose the former. Democrats have it too easy with Latinos, and Republicans have it too hard. And, the result is that these voters don't get good service from either. But you can't fix something until you know why it's broken. Republicans aren't sure. After Romney's defeat, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh scoffed at the idea that the only way for the GOP to have a shot with Hispanics is to turn itself inside out and embrace a full amnesty for illegal immigrants. In fact, Limbaugh's fellow radio talker Sean Hannity and conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer both say that they now support that view. Yet Limbaugh isn't sold. Backtracking on immigration would only backfire on the GOP, he argued on his radio show, by leading conservatives to desert the party. Wrong, wrong, wrong. When it comes to Latinos, Limbaugh knows nada. Worse, he jumped to all the wrong conclusions. He insists that the real reason that Latinos vote for Democrats isn't because of immigration but because they like government handouts and don't want to work hard. Latinos don't want to work hard? Is he kidding? My Take: 7 ways religious diversity played in the election . Besides, I thought the nativist complaint du jour was that Latino immigrants take jobs from U.S. citizens. How do they do that while standing in a welfare line? Here are three things that help explain where Republicans went wrong with Latino voters to begin with. And following that, here are three things that they can do right to start making amends and live to fight another day. What Republicans do wrong: . -- They pander to racists and nativists. At the very least, they remain silent when extremists in their party go off the rails by comparing illegal immigrants to dogs, insects or pigs. All of which has been done by Republican elected officials. -- They fall into what has been the familiar pattern in this country of portraying immigrants, illegal and legal, as inferior, defective, dishonest or predatory. One popular narrative is the one advanced by Limbaugh: immigrants as takers. -- And they don't ask for advice or take it when it's offered. Republican Latino consultants report being turned away by the Romney campaign, which either didn't care about getting Latino votes or were confident they could do it without any help. What Republicans could do right: . -- They need to learn to talk about immigration as an economic issue and not a cultural one, and channel their anger and frustration over a broken system at the system itself and not at desperate human beings who come here for a better life. Opinion: Both parties must lead on immigration . -- They need to support and help advance the careers of the GOP's current crop of Hispanic rock stars: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Senator-elect Ted Cruz, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez. -- And they need to turn the tables and put the other party on the defensive on those issues, such as education reform and expanding trade in Latin America, where Republicans are more in sync with Latinos than Democrats are. Or they could do nothing. They could write off Latino votes and declare that things are fine the way they are. They could remain rigid in their thinking, and declare that a small tent is roomy enough. They don't have to change. They don't have to seek out Latinos; they can just wait for Latinos to come to them. That seems to have been the Republicans' strategy in this election. How'd that work out?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","On Tuesday, President Obama received 71% of the Latino vote, says Ruben Navarrette .

"(CNN) -- A compromising video has appeared on the Internet of an investigative journalist who has been extensively reporting on government corruption in Azerbaijan. Khadija Ismayilova, a radio talk show host, is afraid the sexually explicit images could ignite religious rage against her in the conservative country. The video of her and her boyfriend was recorded via a hidden camera in her bedroom and then posted anonymously on a website imitating the homepage of the New Equality Party, a rival of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party. Social mores in the Muslim society are not as strict as they are in neighboring Iran, Ismayilova says, but they're ""similar to rural Turkey."" Honor killings for behavior outside of accepted morals are a reality in Azerbaijan. The video surfaced a week after Ismayilova received a threatening letter by mail ""containing photos of a personal nature,"" according to a news release from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a democracy advocacy organization that broadcasts her shows and publishes articles that she writes. ""I received a package with pictures suggesting I have a sexual life,"" Ismayilova said, ""and the note saying: 'You whore, behave. Or you will be defamed.' "" People in high places could have reason to be angry with Ismayilova for her reporting. She has written articles implying that the daughters of President Ilham Aliyev could have a secret ownership stake in Azerfon, the country's major mobile telecom company. She has also connected the president's family to the ownership of a bank and alleged that the relationship was used for shady dealings. Presidential spokesman Elnur Aslanov declined to comment on Ismayilova's stories, but he condemned the video a day after it surfaced, blaming it on ""subversive forces who try to violate the stability in Azerbaijan."" Aslanov also said Thursday that authorities ""will make all efforts to identify and punish the persons who are behind this dirty action."" Ismayilova, however, calls the spokesman's statements ""absolutely insincere ... absolutely outrageous."" She believes that the government is punishing her for her stories. After all, the ruling party has raked her over the coals in print, she said, tying her ethnic background to Armenia. Tensions run high between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed breakaway region Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as Armenia's military occupation of adjacent Azerbaijani territory. Creating the impression that Ismayilova is connected to Armenia can easily stoke additional passions against her with the Azerbaijani public. ""They've been accusing me of working for the enemies of the country,"" she said. One day before the contentious video of Ismayilova surfaced, an article appeared on a pro-government news website, again bringing up questions about her ethnic background. It also attacked her private life: ""Khadija is a permanent resident of Baku's expensive bars and clubs. She never hid her affection for alcohol and fast living. She often makes fun of the upbringing and values of Azerbaijani women."" A day after the video appeared, a pro-government newspaper called Iki Sahil wrote, ""In her articles very often Khadija would say 'give me a freedom' and it looks like she got enough 'freedom' now,"" according to Radio Liberty's translation. The article went on to describe salacious details of the video and pointed out where it could be found on the Internet. The video has triggered support for Ismayilova from human rights activists but also from an unlikely group. Religious conservatives, who are usually among her critics, have come to her aid. The elders in the conservative town of Nardaran, while pointing out that they often disagree with Ismayilova, said in a statement that they ""strongly deplore this blackmail against Khadija and demand it stop."" Ismayilova believes that the support from mosque communities and other conservatives ""could have saved my life."" Journalist advocacy groups across the world have also called on the personal attacks to stop. ""Azerbaijan must halt smear campaign against reporter,"" read a news release from the Committee to Protect Journalists on the day the video appeared. Reporters Without Borders opened its reaction statement with the word ""despicable."" They say this has happened before. ""Journalists in Azerbaijan are frequently subjected to smear or intimidation campaigns as punitive action and are sometimes forced to leave the country,"" the journalism group said, citing its own research. Nina Ognianova, the committee's program coordinator for Europe and Central Asia, said Azerbaijan is one of the most authoritarian countries she has covered. ""In 2009, it was the leading jailor of journalists in the region, with 11 behind bars,"" she said. She recalled a similar case to Ismayilova's, one that involved sexual claims being spread about an independent journalist. The journalist was portrayed by pro-government media as being homosexual. ""The labeling put the journalist in peril,"" Ognianova said. ""He almost died in a stabbing attack, and someone tried to push him under a train."" The government, however, disputes accusations that it represses journalism. ""Azerbaijan is an open democratic state with free media,"" said presidential spokesman Aslanov, who is also head of the country's Political Analysis and Information Department. The Aliyev family has held on to power for nearly four decades. The current president's father, Heydar Aliyev, was in office for almost 30 years before he died. The current president ascended to the office in a landslide election that was boycotted by opposition parties and criticized as below standards by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors elections internationally. The former Soviet republic has recently raised its profile on the international stage. It was elected to the U.N. Security Council in October and has put in a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. But Transparency International, which tracks the perception of corruption in countries around the world, ranks Azerbaijan slightly worse than Pakistan, on a level with Belarus and Nigeria. It used to be lower. In May, Azerbaijan will host the Eurovision Song Contest, with participants coming from Europe, North Africa and parts of the Middle East. Journalists from about 40 countries are also expected, which will mean increased global press exposure. Azerbaijan has a reputation at stake and seems to respond to intense, constant international pressure -- ""but with a lot of resistance,"" Ognianova said. ""The country has become more sophisticated in their repression of critical voices,"" she said. ""The government tactics of sneaky punching in the gut has happened before."" The website featuring the Ismayilova video was traced back to a Web hosting company based in Texas called HostGator. CNN contacted the company to ask about who posted the website with the video. Despite multiple requests, a customer service representative refused to connect CNN with its press office or give out its telephone number. An e-mail to multiple recipients at the company remains unanswered. Ismayilova says that although she is now in danger, she wants her story told. ""It needs to be made public,"" she said. ""It needs to be turned to embarrassment for those who are doing it."" On her Facebook account after receiving the initial photos, she wrote, ""I am convinced and determined that I can withstand any blackmail campaign against me."" At that time, she had sent an official letter to the prosecutor's office, requesting an investigation. She received no response. ""They never called me,"" she said. ""They never asked for additional materials. They never asked for the envelope."" On Friday, two days after the video appeared, the prosecutor's office called her to question her about her request. Officials agreed to open a criminal case on charges of violation of privacy, but she also had asked for an investigation into her allegation about efforts to hinder her work as a journalist and is still awaiting a response. The same day, Ismayilova to a gathering of civic society groups supporting her, and Radio Free Europe streamed it live on its home page. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty receives funding from the U.S. government to practice critical journalism in countries where it is perceived to be less free. Also Friday, the explicit Ismayilova video disappeared from view in the U.S. and elsewhere. ""It's still available in Azerbaijan, but not in the Czech Republic,"" said Kenan Aliyev, who runs Radio Liberty's Azerbaijani service from Prague. ""They are targeting Azerbaijan.""","An investigative journalist in Azerbaijan is under fire for a sexually explicit video .

"(CNN) -- Less than a month ago, gun control seemed destined for its day in Congress. In the wake of the shooting of 20 schoolchildren and seven adults in Newtown, Connecticut, a major revision to the nation's gun laws appeared, to many observers, inevitable -- a sure thing, even. ""This awful massacre has changed where we go from here,"" longtime gun rights supporter Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, tweeted three days after the shooting. ""I think,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, ""we could be at a tipping point."" Indeed, with bullet-riddled bodies of 6- and 7-year-olds being carried from a first-grade classroom, opposition to tighter gun laws could hardly seem to withstand the deluge of media attention and outrage from a horrified public. Yet congressional opposition has not wilted. And this week, as the grim one-month anniversary of Newtown approaches, Vice President Joe Biden signaled that the White House might be prepared to enact reforms through executive order rather than risk a fight for comprehensive legislation on Capitol Hill. To look at the polls, opposition in Congress seems puzzling. Although support for an assault weapons ban is not high, clear majorities of Americans support a variety of other measures proposed by gun control advocates. In a recent USA Today/Gallup Poll, 92% said they favored a law that would require background checks at gun shows. More than six in 10 Americans support a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips. Even many gun owners embrace reforms. The political influence of the National Rifle Association, which strongly opposes any new gun laws, helps explain why some members of Congress don't support measures that large majorities of Americans want. But the dynamics of media and public attention are also crucial to understand what's happening. The gun control debate illustrates what is known as the ""issue-attention cycle."" This occurs when a dramatic event -- in this case, the Newtown shooting -- causes the media and public to become intensely interested in a policy issue for a brief time, before moving on to other problems. Following high-profile mass killings in the United States, there often is a surge in news coverage about gun control. But within a few weeks, coverage reverts to where it was before the shooting. This was evident following the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and last year's attack at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. Newtown, for all its unique dreadfulness, has so far been little different. In the week beginning a day after the tragedy -- from December 15 through December 21 -- 2,472 stories in the nation's newspapers mentioned gun control. These data come from a search of more than 500 news outlets indexed in the LexisNexis ""U.S. Newspapers and Wires"" database. In the next week, the number of gun control stories fell by more than half, to 1,192. The week after -- from December 29 through January 4 -- it was down to 962. Meanwhile, journalists found a new object of attention. From December 29 through January 4, the LexisNexis database included 3,636 stories mentioning the fiscal cliff -- nearly four times as many as mentioned gun control in that same week. The economy didn't tumble over the cliff, but gun control did. These patterns have consequences for public opinion, which tends to take its cues from the media. Without sustained attention to gun control, Americans are not likely to view the issue as particularly salient. Even in a Gallup Poll fielded in the days after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, just 4% of Americans said guns were the country's most important problem. Most mentioned the economy, which has dominated the news for months. As a result, there is less pressure on gun control opponents, most of whom are Republican, in Congress to strike a deal with those seeking stronger gun controls, most of whom are Democrats. Opposing gun reforms that might be popular with Americans, but not important to them, may be less risky for many politicians than running afoul of a powerful interest group such as the NRA. This doesn't necessarily mean that gun legislation is moribund. Perhaps the efforts of the anti-gun violence organization founded by Giffords -- a decidedly compelling advocate for gun control -- may sustain the media's attention. That could make the issue more important to voters, which might create a greater incentive for Congress to act. But with the coming political fight over the debt ceiling, media attention to guns may remain in relatively short supply, especially as Sandy Hook recedes in the rearview mirror. The reality of the issue attention cycle suggests that gun control advocates' best hope may lie in executive action, not the legislative process. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Hayes.","Danny Hayes: After Newtown shooting, it seemed time was ripe for new gun control laws .
But congressional opposition has not wilted, Hayes says .
He says after mass killings, media attention surges, public follows; both quickly drop .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two things motivate House Speaker John Boehner in his showdown with Democrats and President Barack Obama, sources close to him say -- one personal, one philosophical. The personal one is evident through how he deals with his caucus of 232 Republicans, especially the unruly tea party group. Boehner originally did not want to tie a contentious effort to defund Obamacare to spending legislation needed to avert a shutdown. He expressed that sentiment as far back as March. ""Our goal here is to cut spending. It's not to shut down the government,"" Boehner said. ""I believe that trying to put Obamacare on this vehicle risks shutting down the government. That's not what our goal is."" But ultimately, there were enough House Republicans demanding the two issues be linked that Boehner changed his mind. Why? ""He has been seen people rise and fall,"" a source close to him said. In fact, he was one of them. When Boehner was House Republican Conference chairman, he was part of a small group of House Republican leaders who met in 1997 to discuss ousting their fellow Republican speaker, Newt Gingrich. Opinion: No good options for Boehner . The coup failed and Boehner claimed he was only gathering information, not conspiring. But by the next year, his fellow Republicans had ousted him from leadership. Upon hearing the bad news, he told an aide, ""We are going to smile, we are going to work hard, and earn our way back."" And he did just that -- from exile through various top positions on committees to the leadership of House Republicans and then his election as speaker. ""You could never have predicted in 1998 the recovery of John Boehner,"" said Gingrich, now a host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""So I think first of all his discipline, his focus on getting the job done, being a very effective insider, raising resources, campaigning for members. ""He managed to recover, which is historically not abnormal -- Speaker Longworth had the same kind of experience, so it happens occasionally. But it takes an unusual amount of willpower to be defeated by your colleagues, and make a comeback with the same colleagues,"" Gingrich said. The lesson learned? Listen to party members and try to adapt to what they want -- sometimes leading them, sometimes following, sometimes protecting them from themselves, and sometimes -- as with the government shutdown -- letting them learn the lesson that if you touch a pot on a hot stove, you will get burned. ""When he was sworn in as speaker, he had 15 rebels vote against him on the House floor. He has this group of 30 to 40 hardcore conservatives who are more than willing to dump John Boehner any chance they can,"" said John Feehery, a consultant and former aide to Republican leaders. Congress still gets paid . ""From Boehner's perspective, he's learned from what happened with Newt Gingrich. That's why he's more disciplined, listening more to his caucus, less likely to freelance than Newt was. Going through this process for him is more of a step-by-step process,"" Feehery said. Not enough House Republicans yet see that this path is likely one that will hurt them politically. When that changes, Boehner will pursue a path out. But he will not be exiled again. ""Listen. We've got a lot of divergent opinions in the caucus and the key to any leadership job is to listen,"" Boehner said two weeks ago. ""You know, I was here during the Gingrich era. He had a little plaque that was in his office. And it was a management model: 'Listen, learn, help, and leave.' We listened to our colleagues over the course of the last week. We have a plan that they're happy with."" The philosophical part of this equation is Boehner's concern about the debt and his belief that Obama doesn't get it. ""The president told me in the Oval Office back in December, 'We don't have a spending problem, we have a health care problem,' Boehner said in an interview in late March. ""And as long as the president continues to cling to the fact that we don't have a spending problem, and clings to the fact that we're not taxing the American people enough, it's going to make it hard to get to an agreement."" But it's not like the House Republicans' budget balances. ""Our budget is a vision of how we would go,"" Boehner said. ""And clearly we believe that Obamacare is bad for the country, it's going to drive up the cost of health insurance for the American people. It's going to hurt employers building to hire more people. It's not in the nation's interest."" Democrats, Republicans and the insane leap into the abyss .","House Speaker John Boehner originally didn't want to tie spending bill to Obamacare .
Boehner was involved in failed coup when Newt Gingrich was speaker after last shutdown .
In the aftermath of failed ouster of Gingrich, Boehner lost his leadership post .

"(CNN) -- Uganda is one of the poorest countries on earth with an economy based on agriculture but there is one industry that's booming -- international child adoptions. Extreme poverty combined with one of the world's highest birth rates is creating a pressure cooker where many children are abandoned or put up for adoption. And there are also fears that as the adoption numbers grow more needs to be done to prevent children being exploited. Children -- sometimes orphans, sometimes just with parents unable to care for them -- find themselves taken into Uganda's child welfare system. For some this can mean foster care or a temporary home. For others it is the first step on a road that will lead to adoption and a new life. While traditional adoption hotspots are becoming less attractive -- Russia has banned Americans from adopting children, and it can take years to navigate China's adoption bureaucracy -- Uganda is seen as a quick and easy alternative for prospective parents. Opinion: Russia's adoption ban harms kids . In Uganda, the adoption process can take just a few months to complete. The country is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, a treaty which provides a blueprint for safe international adoptions. Many of the children adopted from Uganda are given a better shot at life overseas - certainly in material terms -- but the speed and ease of the process has many observers worried. Freda Luzinda worked at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, for two years processing adoption visas. She is now the Uganda national director of the A Child's Voice, an NGO promoting child rights and welfare. She says that many birth parents in Uganda don't fully understand what adoption actually means and that there is no word for 'adoption' in the local Luganda language. ""I can say that about 60% of the birth parents that I spoke to didn't understand adoption,"" said Luzinda. Many birth parents do not understand that adoption is permanent. They believe they may get their children back later. These misconceptions are part of the problem, but not the only problem. The rise in Ugandan adoptions over the past few years has created a growing number of orphanages and adoption agencies to meet the demand. ""When I first started processing visas at the embassy... there were probably between seven and 10 orphanages that were putting children up for adoption. And the numbers grew, and they grew, and they grew. By the time I finished, and this was two years later, we had a count, and we were dealing with about 100 orphanages."" said Luzinda. The explosive growth of the adoption industry in Uganda has fueled fears that children are being exploited for profit and that the best interests of the child is not paramount. ""Orphan creation does happen a lot in Uganda, and this is done by adoption facilitators who will go and scout the slums, find vulnerable families and talk them into giving up their children,"" said Luzinda. In the 12 years from 1999-2010 there were just 311 adoptions from Uganda to the U.S. In 2011 alone -- the last year for which State Department numbers are available -- 207 children were adopted to the U.S. from Uganda. Brothers Zach, age about 4 and Philip, about a year older, have found a loving family in the U.S. but their early life was typical of Uganda's estimated 2.4 million orphans. Both boys were found abandoned in different places in Kampala, both were left in conspicuous places and both were found by police officers. Now Zach and Philip have a new life in the U.S., both are in school and having loving new parents. In 2008, they were adopted by Lisa and Tague Harding of Minnesota through the Amani Baby Cottage, one of the respected, religiously-affiliated orphanages. ""There is always a tragedy at the beginning of a story that makes adoption a necessary step,"" said Lisa. As their children grew up and left home, the Hardings saw an opportunity to provide a stable home for children who would otherwise grow up in poverty. Internet reveals secrets of 'closed' adoptions, report says . The Hardings became interested in international adoption after traveling to Uganda with a church group. ""I love that in our faith, adoption is part of the story -- that Baby Moses was adopted and there was Samuel in the Bible that was adopted and baby Jesus. Joseph was not his birth father."" said Lisa. Danyne Randolph Bharj, director of the Amani Baby Cottage, understands the fears concerning the exploitation of children, but says that given the options for Ugandan children, in many cases adoption is the best solution. ""I don't think it's right to say the West is the way to save Uganda at all. I don't think that's the answer. But I think if there's people in the West that can give these children a family when no one else can, I do think it's more important,"" said Bharj. But James Kabogoza, assistant commissioner of Children's Affairs for the Ugandan Government, feels that Ugandan children should stay in Uganda. ""It's not right what they are doing. I know for them they get something out of it, but it's also wrong to defraud parents and Ugandans of their children,"" he said. Kabogoza's fear is that by leaving Uganda, many of these orphans will lose sight of their cultural identity. He also believes that regardless of the circumstances, many of these children would be better off with their birth parents. ""That is the biggest thing that ever happens to a child. If the child remains with the family, they are able to grow up with them,""said Kabogoza. He added: "" know they feel what is done in America and what is proper in America is a better life. But you could provide that better life to the child here, within the family ... You can change the life of that child within the family here, if you support them."" Zach and Philip' adopted father, Tague Harding, understands that his sons will lose some of their cultural heritage by growing up in the United States, but he also sees the advantages. ""It's better that Ugandan orphans stay in Uganda as much as possible but perhaps by us bringing two boys home or other people bringing Ugandan children back internationally, we can raise awareness to say, there is a need."" Lisa Desai, Sarah Gross, Yasmeen Qureshi of Three Strands Media produced ""Adopting Africa"" for CNN. The film was made possible with funding from The African Child Policy Forum.","International adoptions from Uganda are rising .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's administrative court said Tuesday that it has lifted a three-month state of emergency in the country, though the nation's military and police said they're still enforcing it because they'd yet to receive the court's ruling, state-run media reported. Because of the security forces' stance, it wasn't immediately clear when the emergency rules -- which include curfews intended to limit public gatherings after deadly clashes in August -- would truly be canceled. The emergency was ordered in August, during a period of intense unrest after the July coup that ousted President Mohamed Morsy. Clashes flared in August when security forces broke up huge Cairo sit-ins led by Morsy supporters; hundreds died, and thousands were injured. Mohamed Morsy trial interrupted by defendants' chanting . The administrative court announced Tuesday that the state of emergency would be lifted in the afternoon, two days earlier than expected, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. But Tuesday night, the military said on Facebook that the nighttime curfews would continue until the court officially notified it of its order. The Interior Ministry also said it hadn't received the court order, state-run newspaper Al-Ahram reported. Egypt's Cabinet had said previously that the emergency would be lifted on Thursday. The military ousted Morsy on July 3 and installed an interim government, saying Morsy was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Morsy supporters, including the Muslim Brotherhood, have said the coup was an illegal power grab by the military and elements of the regime of longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak. Morsy is awaiting trial on allegations that he ordered supporters to attack protesters in December, while he still was in power. Morsy became the country's first democratically elected president in June 2012, more than a year after protests prompted Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for three decades with the military's support, to step down. Mubarak faces a retrial on charges involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 uprising that ousted him.

"(CNN) -- On the sweltering evening of April 12, 2009, as dusk deepened over the Indian Ocean, several hundred miles off the coast of Somalia, three shots rang out. All the bullets found their targets -- three Somali pirates in a small lifeboat bobbing on the darkening sea. For the past five days the pirates had taken hostage Richard Phillips, the American captain of the Maersk Alabama container ship. President Barack Obama had authorized the use of deadly force if Phillips' life was in danger. Unbeknownst to the pirates, days earlier a contingent from SEAL Team 6 had parachuted at night into the ocean near the USS Bainbridge warship, which was shadowing the pirates in their boat. The SEALs had taken up position on the fantail of the Bainbridge and were carefully monitoring Phillips while he was in the custody of the pirates. One of the pirates had just pointed his AK-47 at the American captain as if he were going to shoot him. That's when the SEAL team commander on the Bainbridge ordered his men to take out the pirates. U.S. terror raids: 2 operations. 2 outcomes. 5 questions . Three U.S. Navy SEAL sharpshooters fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall, killing them all. Obama called Vice Adm. William ""Bill"" McRaven, the leader of Joint Special Operations Command and of the mission to rescue Phillips, to tell him, ""Great job."" In the eyes of Hollywood at least, the American public can't get enough of these kinds of operations. ""Captain Phillips,"" a movie starring Tom Hanks playing the rescued sea captain, will be in theaters on Friday. The flawless rescue of Philips was the first time that Obama, only three months into his new job, was personally exposed to the capabilities of America's ""Quiet Professionals,"" as they sometimes refer to themselves. They are the secretive counterterrorism units of special operations, made up of units including the Navy's SEAL Team 6 and the Army's Delta Force, whose well-oiled skills Obama has come to rely upon increasingly with every passing year of his presidency. African raids . This was underlined over the weekend in Africa when operators from Delta and SEAL Team 6 carried out raids in Libya and Somalia -- more than 2,000 miles apart -- targeting a longtime alleged member of al Qaeda in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and the leaders of one al Qaeda's affiliated groups in the Somali port of Barawe. In Tripoli, Delta operators seized Abu Anas al-Libi, who is wanted for his alleged role performing surveillance on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, which was destroyed by an al Qaeda truck bomb in 1998, while in Barawe SEAL Team 6 operators went ashore to attack a house frequented by commanders of Al Shabaab, the group that launched the attack on the mall in Nairobi two weeks ago where at least 67 people were killed. The Delta raid in Tripoli went off flawlessly, but the SEALs encountered heavy resistance in Barawe and the SEAL team retreated. Details of what exactly happened during the Somali operation are still murky. The two raids over the weekend show that President Obama remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the United States is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups, just as he is comfortable with the use of CIA drones for the same purpose in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen. For the White House, part of the appeal of special operations and drones is that they do not, of course, consume anything like the blood and treasure that are expended on conventional military operations such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, the SEALS have had considerable experience working in and around Somalia in recent years. Six months after the rescue of Phillips, Obama's national security team authorized a mission to take out Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a leader of al Qaeda in Africa. Nabhan was killed by SEAL Team 6 in a helicopter raid on September 14, 2009, as he was driving south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. The SEALs landed briefly to take Nabhan's body, and after they had confirmed his identity through DNA samples, he was buried at sea. U.S. official: Raid's target was Al-Shabaab foreign fighter commander . Home of SEAL Team 6 . It is quite challenging to enter the SEALs, but an even greater challenge is to be selected for the SEAL's premier counterterrorism force, the innocuously named Naval Special Warfare Development Group based at Dam Neck, Virginia, near the bustling resort town of Virginia Beach. It's known inside the military as ""DevGru"" and more popularly as ""SEAL Team 6"" and is an elite within the SEAL elite. The men of DevGru, around 250 in total, are battle-hardened and are usually in their mid-30s. DevGru is divided into squadrons that are named by color: Red, Blue and Gold are the assault squadrons, Grey handles vehicles and boats, and Black is the sniper team. These squadrons scout other SEAL teams, which number around 2,000 men, for those with the particular skills they need. DevGru's base at Dam Neck does not announce itself. Behind the high wire fence that seals the SEALs off from the rest of the world is a large dog pound where the highly trained dogs that accompany the men on their missions live. There is a giant wall to sharpen climbing skills and a hangar full of exceptionally fast boats. Other hangars house experimental Mad Max-like dune buggies suitable for driving in the deserts of the Middle East and weapons rooms loaded with exotic firearms. 'Somalia-ized' SEAL Team 6's greatest coup, of course, was the 2011 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which Osama bin Laden was killed. However, SEAL Team 6's integral role in the war against al Qaeda and its allies would not have been easy to predict before the 9/11 attacks. Just recall the debacle that has come to be known as ""Blackhawk Down."" In Mogadishu, Somalia, in early October 1993 a daytime helicopter assault -- by pilots of the Special Operations Air Regiment and elements of SEAL Team 6, Delta Force and the 75th Rangers -- to snatch Somali clan leaders who were attacking U.S. troops stationed in Somalia turned into a fiasco in which two Blackhawk helicopters were shot down by rocket propelled grenades. Eighteen American servicemen died. Scarred by Mogadishu, the Pentagon was resistant to using SEAL Team 6 and Delta to take on al Qaeda in Afghanistan once the terrorist group had rebased itself there in 1996. Indeed, after the 9/11 attacks, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was deeply frustrated that the first American boots on the ground in Afghanistan were from the CIA and not the highly trained counterterrorism units of SEAL Team 6 and Delta Force. On October 17, 2001, ten days after the U.S. campaign against the Taliban had started, Rumsfeld wrote a secret memo to Gen. Richard Myers, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressing his irritation: ""Does the fact that the Defense Department can't do anything on the ground in Afghanistan until CIA people go in first to prepare the way suggest that the Defense Department is lacking a capability we need? Specifically, given the nature of our world, isn't it conceivable that the Department (of Defense) ought not to be in a position of near total dependence on CIA in situations such as this?"" Officials working for Rumsfeld commissioned Richard Shultz, an historian on special forces, to find out why special operations units were not deployed to hit al-Qaeda before the attacks on New York and Washington. After all, fighting terrorists was why these units were founded in the first place. Schultz concluded that in the years before 9/11 the senior officers at the Pentagon had become ""Somalia-ized."" Then-special operations boss Gen. Peter Schoomaker recalled, ""Special operations were never given the mission. It was very, very frustrating. It was like having a brand-new Ferrari in the garage and nobody wants to race it because you might dent the fender."" The attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon allowed Rumsfeld to push special operations to the center of the ""Global War on Terrorism."" And on September 6, 2003, Rumsfeld signed an order known as an ""EXORD"" that empowered Joint Special Operations Command to hunt al-Qaeda in as many as 15 countries. Wife: Captured 'most wanted terrorist' al Libi had left al Qaeda . Military's own army . In the decade after 9/11, JSOC became a small army within the military with its own drones, its own air force (known as the Confederate Air Force) and its own intelligence operations. The rise of JSOC was inextricably linked to the vision of Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a brilliant workaholic from a military family who was beloved by his men; during the Iraq War he who would go out with them on missions to capture/kill insurgents. It was McChrystal who took the special operations Ferrari out of the garage and drove it to become a killing machine of unprecedented agility and ferocity. JSOC went from mounting half a dozen operations a month in Iraq in the spring of 2004 to 300 a month by the summer of 2006. It was McChrystal's five-year command of JSOC between 2003 and 2008 that helped turn its core components of SEAL Team 6 and Delta into what is arguably the most agile and deadly force in history. One of the key officers under McChrystal was Bill McRaven, who took over command from McChrystal as head of JSOC when McChrystal went to take a senior job at the Pentagon. McRaven is a strapping, dark-haired, blue-eyed Texan in his mid-50s. In conversation as he chugs a Rip It -- a heavily caffeinated beverage popular with American soldiers in Afghanistan -- he speaks in well thought-out paragraphs, but he also peppers his speech with the occasional ""doggone,"" as well as other, more robust swear words. A battle-hardened colleague says McRaven reminds him of the comic book superhero Captain America, while another says he ""is reputed to be the smartest SEAL that ever lived. He is physically tough, compassionate and can drive a knife through your ribs in a nanosecond."" Even as a three-star admiral, about once a month in Afghanistan, McRaven went out with his teams on snatch-and-grab missions. It was McRaven who planned the bin Laden raid down to the last details. Now he commands Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, which oversees special operations by the Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines. According to its mission statement, SOCOM's job is to ""synchronize planning of global operations against terrorist networks."" A sign of where the Obama administration is placing its bets about what it believes to be the future of warfare is that while there are major cuts planned for all four of the armed services, SOCOM is one of the few places in the military where the force is actually growing.","Peter Bergen: After 'Blackhawk Down' disaster, U.S. stopped relying on special forces .

"(CNN) -- Surveillance footage shows other minors inside a Georgia high school gym at about the same time authorities say Kendrick Johnson suffocated in a rolled-up mat while reaching for a sneaker, an attorney for the school told CNN on Friday. The attorney's acknowledgement came in a response to a CNN open records request asking whether other minors were recorded in the footage inside the Lowndes County High School gym on January 10 between 1:09 p.m. and 1:20 p.m., a span of about 10 minutes after Johnson entered the gym. ""I answer your pointed question with 'yes,'"" L. Warren Turner Jr.. the attorney, wrote in the letter. CNN made the request after the school declined to release certain surveillance photos or video, citing state law that exempts the release of ""education records of a minor child."" It's the latest revelation in a case that has seen Kendrick's parents challenge the account of authorities and demanded an inquest into the teen's death. Attorneys for Kendrick's family have called for the release of the surveillance video. Kendrick Johnson's parents want answers . Johnson, 17, was found dead at the gym in Valdosta on January 11, his body resting headfirst in the rolled wrestling mat, according to authorities. A few still pictures, taken from surveillance cameras at the gym, are perhaps the last known images of Kendrick alive. They show him walking across the bare floor. Those images were released by the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office. The next pictures of the teenager are far more horrifying: His body, clad in jeans and layered orange and white T-shirts, is wedged in the wrestling mat. His face is bloated with pooled blood, some of which poured out of his body and soaked his dreadlocks and spilled onto the floor. A pair of orange-and-black gym shoes were found a few yards from the teen's body. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation autopsy found that he died from positional asphyxia, and the sheriff's office determined the death was accidental. Second autopsy: Kendrick Johnson's body stuffed with newspaper . The sheriff has declared the case closed, and the U.S. Justice Department said in September that it wouldn't open a civil rights investigation. But Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney for the district that includes Valdosta, is reviewing the case and weighing whether to open his own investigation. Dr. Bill Anderson, the private pathologist hired by Johnson's family to conduct a second autopsy, found that Johnson had a blow to right side of his neck ""consistent with inflicted injury."" A January 25 report by the Valdosta-Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited ""no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body."" And the original autopsy results released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation May 2 identified ""no significant injuries."" Johnson's death no accidental, family's autopsy finds .

"(CNN) -- Alex Rodriguez will never be remembered as the greatest slugger in baseball, or as the greatest third-baseman, and -- despite the recent headlines -- probably not even as the biggest cheater. But he will go down in record books for something: Having the worst contract in American professional sports history. This is not a title that we hand out lightly, because teams have handed out some doozies over the years. Michael Vick got $135 million over 10 years from the Atlanta Falcons, and for that money, they got a quarterback who completed 54% of his passes and went to prison for animal cruelty. Jerome James signed with the Knicks for $30 million, then averaged a grand total of three points a game. Barry Zito got $126 million from the San Francisco Giants and essentially forgot how to pitch. Rick DiPietro signed a $67 million contract with the Islanders, but now the goaltender couldn't stop a beach ball -- which is an issue because that deal doesn't run out until 2021. And then, there is Bobby Bonilla's deal with the Mets. The money-strapped baseball team in Queens is still paying the retired outfielder more than 18 players on their active roster and will continue paying him $1.2 million through 2035 (when Bonilla is 72) as part of a mind-blowing buyout deal. Still: The Rodriguez deal tops them all for its sheer size and stupidity. On December 13, 2007, the Yankees signed him to a 10-year, $275 million contract loaded with incentives that, five years later, is an anvil on the payroll for even the richest team in baseball. Why is it the worst? Let us count the ways: . 1. The Yankees had a chance to move on. They had moved on, in fact, if you believed the strong words that came out of the team's Tampa, Florida, offices during a tumultuous two weeks. Scott Boras, who was Rodriguez's agent at the time, announced in the middle of a World Series game that his client would void the remaining three years and $72 million of the massive and ill-fated $252 million deal he had signed with the Texas Rangers as a free agent. In some corners of the Yankees organization, the news was met with a sigh of relief. Rodriguez was productive in his time with the team, but controversial. And he had, at that point, wilted in the postseason. The idea that the team would bring him back was scoffed at. The Rangers were still paying $7 million a year from the original contract as part of the trade terms to the Yankees, and GM Brian Cashman insisted that the team had no intention of losing that subsidy. ""If a player doesn't want us, we don't want them,"" said Hank Steinbrenner, who had assumed control of the team as his father, George, had started to decline. ""That chapter is closed."" But Rodriguez, who had 54 home runs and 156 RBI in an MVP season in 2007, was a big star the team wanted for its profitable YES Network and its new $1 billion stadium. So that chapter was reopened. 2. They had no competition. Bringing back Rodriguez, in itself, wasn't an awful move. He was still a productive player in his prime. But somehow, the Yankees were given all the cards in the negotiation and still tossed them face-up onto the table. All around baseball, teams were scoffing at the idea of giving A-Rod a reported $350 million deal. The White Sox didn't want him. The Angels didn't want him. There were so few landing places, it seemed entirely possible, if not probable, that Rodriguez's gamble to opt out of the deal would backfire. So what did the Yankees do? They crawled back to the table and gave him a raise, a deal that would pay him $27.5 million a year with a series of $6 million bonuses for climbing up the all-time home run list. To quote Newsday at the time: ""(Hank Steinbrenner) wanted Rodriguez back so badly that he not only reversed a very loud and public proclamation, he wound up bidding against no one but himself in his mad rush to secure A-Rod's services."" All it took was an apology from Rodriguez (who says it doesn't pay to say you're sorry?), and A-Rod had his 10-year deal. 3. His production failed to meet the salary from the start. Make no mistake: The numbers were very good. A-Rod earned $95 million in the first three years of his deal, and for that he batted .286 with a .537 slugging percentage, 95 home runs, 256 runs and 328 RBI. And the Yankees won the 2009 World Series, with Rodriguez a driving force during an epic postseason run. Some will say that one October justified the entire contract. Still, the decline began quickly. In 2011-12, Rodriguez missed 103 games to injury and saw his batting average dip to .274 with 34 home runs and just 119 RBI in the two seasons combined. Despite his 647 career home runs, he was so bad in the postseason last October, Yankees manager Joe Girardi dropped him from the lineup entirely, and he hasn't played since after offseason hip surgery. Nobody is sure when he'll be ready again. Which is bad enough. But the Yankees still owe Rodriguez, who turns 38 next month, $28 million in 2014, $21 million in 2015 and $20 million each in 2016 and 2017. If he can't get on the field now, what can the team possibly expect to get from him in his early 40s? And that doesn't even factor in ... 4. The cheating scandals. Note that the word scandal is plural here. After insisting for years that his success was not a product of the ""Steroids Era"" in baseball, a Sports Illustrated report reveal that he had, in fact, failed a test for illegal substances in 2003. Bleacher Report: Rodriguez responds to latest allegations . So more than 200 journalists packed a news conference in Tampa in February 2009 to listen as Rodriguez explained that, from 2001 to 2003, he had used steroids while with the Texas Rangers. But only with the Rangers. ""My mistake was because I was immature and I was stupid,"" Rodriguez said. ""I blame myself. For a week here, I kept looking for people to blame, and I keep looking at myself."" He insisted that he was clean during his time with the Yankees. But now, according to an ESPN report, Major League Baseball plans to suspend him 100 games for his alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs obtained through a Miami-area anti-aging clinic. The Yankees? Disappointed is the word managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner used. ""There have no doubt been times when we've been disappointed in him and we've conveyed that to him and he understands that,"" he said. ""But look, everybody's human and everybody makes mistakes. If you've got a guy over the course of 10 years, there's going to be times any of us make mistakes. ""It's a big contract,"" Steinbrenner said. ""We all hope he's going to act like a Yankee and do the best to live up to it."" The founder of the clinic, Tony Bosch, is reportedly set to meet with baseball officials Friday. Does he have enough credibility or evidence to support the suspensions of a reported 20 players? Many people around the sport aren't sure. For the Yankees, the question is something else entirely: If A-Rod actually is suspended, will it be enough to get them out from under the worst contract in professional sports history?

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Classic pop rock band Chicago and Grammy-Award-winning songwriter Bill Champlin have parted ways after nearly three decades together. Bill Champlin is leaving Chicago. ""This music is callin' me,"" he says of his new solo venture. ""Bill Champlin is no longer in Chicago. He was a long-time band member and we wish him all the best as he embarks on his new solo project, for which he's worked long and hard.,"" a statement from Chicago's management said Monday . ""After 28 years with Chicago, singer-songwriter-keyboardist Bill Champlin is parting ways with the classic jazz/rock band to focus once again on his solo career,"" Champlin's publicist Judi Kerr said of the split. ""This music is callin' me,"" said Champlin, whose new solo album ""No Place Left to Fall"" was released last week on the DreamMakers label. ""I'm really looking forward to playing more intimate venues and hearing what fans think of the new music. I can't wait to spend some one-on-one time with my old and new fans!"" Champlin has scheduled a string of concerts along the West Coast in November to promote the new album. Champlin joined Chicago in 1981 at a pivotal point in the band's history. After a string of 12 platinum and multiplatinum albums, Chicago was struggling for direction in the years after the death of original guitarist Terry Kath in 1978. The appearance of the new vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist on ""Chicago 16,"" along with the production skills of David Foster, marked a new era of chart success for the band. Champlin was most prominently featured on ""Chicago 19,"" where he sang lead on three of the album's four hit singles, including the chart-topping ""Look Away,"" which ranked No. 1 on Billboard's 1989 year-end Hot 100. Before joining Chicago, Champlin picked up a pair of Grammy Awards for tunes he penned for other artists: ""After the Love is Gone"" for Earth, Wind & Fire and ""Turn Your Love Around"" for George Benson. Champlin also occasionally performs with the Sons of Champlin, a horn-heavy band he helped found during the late-1960s San Francisco, California, psychedelic scene. Chicago is on a co-headlining tour with Earth, Wind & Fire this summer, with the next show scheduled for August 21 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Lou Pardini, a Grammy-nominated keyboardist who has played with Stevie Wonder and Santana, will replace Champlin, according to Chicago's management. Chicago formed in 1967, committed to the concept of a rock 'n' roll band with horns. First called The Big Thing, the group was known as Chicago Transit Authority on its debut album before taking its present name. In more than four decades, Chicago has sold more than 122 million recordings. It had five consecutive No. 1 albums and has had more than 50 Top-40 singles.","Singer-songwriter-keyboardist Champlin joined Chicago in 1981 .

"(Mental Floss) -- Most guys pull them on every morning when they step out of the shower. In fact, at this very moment, there's probably nothing closer to you than your underwear. It's taken thousands of years to perfect the boxers or briefs that you're wearing right now, though, so here's a brief and incomplete look at the history of men's underwear: . Loincloths offer some coverage . The first known underwear dates back almost 7000 years, when prehistoric man used leather to cover and protect his loins while running prehistoric errands. For several millennia, not much changed. Ancient Egyptian art shows everyone from the pharaohs on down the line decked out in loincloths of their own. The pharaohs even wore a sort of specialized kilt/loincloth called a shendoh, and took extra supplies of the garment into their pyramids for use in the afterlife. Codpieces become all the rage . Variations on the loincloth seem to have persisted into the Middle Ages, when loose-fitting trousers called braies came into fashion. These linen duds extended from the waist to around mid-calf, and once the wearer stepped into his breeches he had to lace them tight around his waist and shins. Although all of the tying wasn't so convenient, these braies had the advantage of offering a lot of coverage, so if a laborer got too hot he could strip down to his skivvies while still maintaining some sense of decorum. On the other hand, all of the lacing and cinching made answering nature's call a bit of a hassle. Enter the codpiece. A codpiece that opened at the front using buttons, snaps, or laces enabled men to urinate without removing their braies, which really came in handy when you'd had a bit too much mead. Mental Floss: 6 articles of clothing that caused riots . These early codpieces were practical, but as hemlines rose, they started to take on a decorative function, too. When Henry VIII began to pad his codpiece in the 16th century, all of his loyal subjects followed suit. (Nevermind that scholars later speculated that Henry VIII's bulging codpiece may not have actually been male overcompensation -- it may have been oversized to accommodate medication-soaked bandages to alleviate some of the pain from a suspected case of syphilis. It's worth noting that modern scholars have mostly dismissed this theory.) Codpiece padding and growth continued throughout the mid-sixteenth century before tailing off around 1590. Prizefighters get stretchy . ""Boxers or briefs?"" Before the 1920s, this question would have gotten you little more than a blank look, mostly because neither boxers nor briefs had been invented yet. From Victorian times into the 1930s, men had mostly worn tight-fitting knee-length flannel ""drawers"" beneath their pants and donned similarly snug flannel tops as undershirts. This state of affairs doesn't sound too comfy, but things got a little more breathing room in 1925. Jacob Golomb, the founder of the venerable boxing equipment company Everlast, started to tweak designs for the trunks worn by pugilists. Golomb realized that the leather-belted trunks fighters had been wearing weren't totally ideal, so he replaced the leather with more flexible elastic waistbands. Boxer shorts weren't an immediate success as underwear, though. They lacked the support that drawers and union suits had offered, so men weren't crazy about them. It really wasn't until after World War II that boxer shorts took off to challenge their younger siblings, the briefs. Mental Floss: A brief history of shaving . Postcard ispires tighty whities . Underwear drawers changed forever in 1934 when Arthur Kneibler, an executive and designer at the Wisconsin hosiery company Coopers, Inc., received a postcard from a friend who was visiting the French Riviera. The postcard depicted a man in a bikini-style bathing suit, and ""apparel engineer"" Kneibler had an epiphany: couldn't this type of swimsuit be converted into underwear? After some experimentation, Kneibler introduced a new kind of snug, legless underwear with an overlapping Y-front fly. Coopers dubbed the new product ""Jockey shorts"" because the high level of support the garment offered was reminiscent of jockstraps. Coopers took its first batch of Jockey briefs to Chicago's landmark department store Marshall Fields on January 19, 1935. Although the weather was awful?Chicago was in the grip of a blizzard?the entire load of 600 pairs of Jockeys sold out on the first day. Within three months, the company sold 30,000 pairs of Jockey shorts. Coopers kept making and marketing its wildly successful underwear, and in 1971 the company changed its name to Jockey. Secret Service gives Joe Boxer a boost . Designer underwear became all the rage in the 1970s and 80s as labels like Calvin Klein began to transform our drawers from something we hid under our pants into the sort of fashion and lifestyle choice one could flaunt in a bad music video. Cuts became tighter and sexier, and underwear designs became flashy, loud, and often humorous. One of the main beneficiaries of this new obsession with snappy underwear was Joe Boxer, which started making skivvies in 1984 when it filled an order for Macy's that included a design with a Velcro-attached removable raccoon tail. Joe Boxer really jumped into the spotlight in 1985, though, when it made boxers printed with the image of hundred-dollar bills. The Secret Service decided that these duds violated forgery laws and confiscated 1,000 pairs of the offending underwear. Instead of simply hiring lawyers, Joe Boxer turned the seizure into a lighthearted news event, and the image of boxers as a playful alternative to stolid briefs grew. Mental Floss: Symbolism and the $1 bill . Underwear takes the nation's economic pulse . Although there haven't been many huge underwear breakthroughs since the introduction of boxer briefs in the early 1990s (and even those are sort of a throwback to the union suits favored by pre-1930s men), boxers and briefs found their way onto the financial pages in early 2008. That's when former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan revealed that the state of the men's underwear industry is an important indicator of the economy's health. The logic Greenspan outlined regarding underwear was both simple and elegant. Most guys have a drawer full of fairly ratty underwear that they'll wear until the elastic is dead and the boxers are riddled with holes. Since coworkers and friends generally don't see a guy's underwear, replacing these frayed undergarments often seems like a discretionary purchase for men. As such, when men start fearing the economy is in a downturn and need a place to save a little cash, they simply stop replenishing their underwear drawer with fresh Jockeys. Sounds reasonable enough, right? Sure enough, when the economy started to tail off in 2008, annual men's underwear sales dropped by 12 percent. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Outraged Pakistani Christians took to the streets of Lahore on Sunday, protesting a rash of violence against their community over the weekend. Demonstrators denounced the burning of more than 100 homes of Christians on Saturday -- a spree spurred by allegations that a Christian man made remarks against the Muslim prophet Mohammed. Some of the hundreds of protesters Sunday threw stones at police, saying the government failed to adequately protect Christians, Lahore senior police official Rai Tahir said. Tahir said video footage of the fires helped lead to the arrests of more than 150 attackers. He said charges of terrorism have been filed against the suspects. The violence that tore through Lahore's Badami Bagh community Saturday followed the arrest of Sawan Masih, a Christian in his 20s accused of blasphemy. But Masih's arrest wasn't enough to appease an angry mob of Muslims irate over the alleged crime. ""(The) mob wanted police to hand them over the alleged blasphemer,"" said Hafiz Majid, a senior police official in Badami Bagh. The mob also looted some shops run by Christians, he said. Majid said Christians have fled the area for fear of being killed. If convicted, Masih faces the death penalty. He denies the allegations made by the two men who filed the blasphemy complaint against him with police on Friday, Majid said. Masih said the three got into an argument while drinking and that the other two men threatened to publicly accuse him of blasphemy, according to Majid. ""The attack is yet another shameful incident against a vulnerable community and further confirmation of the slide toward extremism in society on the one hand and, on the other hand, the apathy and inaction that has become the norm among the police,"" the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said in a statement. The group accused police of arresting Christians in the incident ""while those who went on a rampage and can easily be identified from television footage have gone scot-free."" Pakistan's blasphemy laws were first instituted to keep peace between religions. But they have been criticized by human rights advocates who say the laws enable legal discrimination against religious minorities. At time, the laws have been misused to settle personal differences between Muslims and Christians. There have been about 1,400 blasphemy cases since the laws were first enacted in 1986, according to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. There are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan, and more than 50 people have been killed while facing trial for the charge, according to the organization. Last year, a Pakistani court dismissed blasphemy charges against a Christian teenager whose case prompted international outrage. Her detention stirred up religious tensions in the predominantly Muslim country. It also generated fierce criticism of Pakistani authorities and renewed debate over Pakistan's blasphemy laws. President Asif Ali Zardari issued a statement Saturday on the most recent ""unfortunate incident."" He noted that the country's constitution protects the rights of all Pakistanis, and that ""such acts of vandalism against minorities tarnish the image of the country.""","Some throw stones at police, saying the government isn't adequately protecting Christians .

"London (CNN) -- The cleanup operation continued Tuesday, a day after a major Atlantic storm pummeled England, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, killing at least 13 people. Hurricane-force winds early Monday caused major disruption to travel and power supplies. In Britain, 61,000 homes remained without electricity Tuesday, after power was restored to 100,000 properties overnight, said Tim Field, a spokesman for the Energy Networks Association, which represents British and Irish power operators. Overall, 605,000 properties have been reconnected, he told CNN. Energy companies said they were working to restore power as quickly as possible. Rail services were largely running again across southern England on Tuesday, a day after fallen trees caused chaos as they blocked rail lines and roads. London's Heathrow Airport, where the number of flights was reduced Monday because of the severe weather, said operations were returning to normal Tuesday. At least two storm-related deaths were confirmed Monday in England, and a third person was missing after being swept out to sea. Police in Kent said a 17-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on the home where she was sleeping in Hever, south of London. A man in his 50s was killed when a tree fell on a vehicle in Watford, northwest of London, according to Hertfordshire police. Authorities suspect two other UK deaths may be related to the storm. A man and a woman died -- and a third person was hospitalized -- as a result of a gas explosion in Hounslow in west London, London's Metropolitan Police said. Investigators were checking whether a fallen tree damaged gas pipes and caused the blast. Deaths were also reported elsewhere in Europe. Seven people were killed in Germany, German media reported, some by fallen trees. A woman in the city of Heiligenhafen was killed when a wall supporting a terrace fell on her. A tourist was killed by a falling tree in Amsterdam, police said. In France, the body of a woman was found on a beach near Belle-Ile. Witnesses said she was swept away by a wave. Officials said 42,000 homes in northern France were without electricity. Overnight, the number of homes in France without power peaked at 75,000. High winds also tore across Denmark, where at least two people were killed, according to the Copenhagen Post. Search suspended . As the storm approached, UK rescuers had to suspend their search for a missing teenager believed to have been swept out to sea. The unidentified teenager disappeared from Newhaven, East Sussex, on the southern coast, according to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The strongest wind gusts in England -- 99 mph -- were recorded on the Isle of Wight, which is off the southern coast, the Met Office said. Network Rail, which manages Britain's rail infrastructure, said Monday that more than 100 trees were on rails in the network across the southeast. Weather forecasters had said before the storm arrived that it could be the region's worst in a decade. But conditions were not as severe as those during the Great Storm of 1987, which was responsible for the deaths of 18 people in Britain and four in France. In 1990, the Burns Day Storm left a trail of destruction from the Isles of Scilly to Denmark, killing 100 people, including 47 in the British Isles, according to the Met Office. CNN's Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Power is restored to many UK homes, but 61,000 remain without electricity .

"(CNN) -- NATO forces patrolling the Gulf of Aden foiled a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker this weekend, a NATO spokesman said. The Canadian navy's HMCS Winnipeg helped foil a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker Sunday, NATO says. Pirates attempted to capture the MV Front Ardennes at 6 p.m. Saturday and were apprehended seven hours later, Commander Chris Davies told CNN. A NATO-supported Canadian navy ship, the HMCS Winnipeg, was returning from escorting a World Food Program vessel in the gulf when it saw the Norwegian ship under attack, Davies said. A British Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, the Wave Knight, was also in the area. The pirates were captured at 1 a.m. Sunday after they threw weapons, ladders and scaling equipment overboard, Davies said. Several rounds of ammunition were found on the pirates' boat. The pirates were detained, but allowed to go free after questioning. There is currently no formal procedure for NATO personnel to follow once they have apprehended pirates, Davies noted. Their weapons are confiscated and they are then typically given provisions and released. The Sunday incident is the latest in a string of hijackings off the Horn of Africa, which have received more attention since pirates attacked a U.S.-flagged cargo ship on April 8 and took its captain hostage.

"(CNN) -- Ronaldinho rounded on critics who said he was finished after he helped lead Brazilian side Atletico Mineiro to the Copa Libertadores title after a penalty shootout victory over Olimpia. The 2002 World Cup winner and two-time world player of the year helped his side edge past their Paraguayan opponents via a penalty shootout to land their first ever Libertadores crown -- the premier club competition in South America. Atletico had to rely on an 87th minute equalizer from Leonardo Silva in the second leg of final to force the tie into extra time, which remained goalless. This came just moments after Olimpia defender Julio Cesar Manzur had been sent off. Once again, as he had been in both the quarter and semifinals, Atletico's goalkeeper Victor was hailed as hero. Having saved penalties to help his side past Tijuana and Newell's Old Boys, he made a crucial penalty save after the match had gone to a shootout, Atletico winning 4-3 to land their first major international title. ""This is why I came back to Brazil,"" Ronaldinho told reporters. ""Not long ago people were saying that I was done but we showed today that isn't the case. Let them talk now."" Trailing 2-0 from the first leg in Paraguay, Atletico halved the deficit with a goal from former Manchester City striker Jo moments after the second half began. Olimpia missed a golden chance to restore their two-goal lead late in the game when Ferreyra dribbled past Victor but stumbled in front of goal, allowing the goalkeeper to recover. But with three minutes remaining Leonardo Silva headed into the far corner to send Atletico's 60,000 fans into raptures. After a goalless extra half an hour Victor saved Olimpia's first spot kick in the shootout, from defender Herminio Miranda, as Atletico went on to convert all four of their penalties. It capped a remarkable triumph for Atleitco in their first Libertadores final. Victor saved a stoppage time penalty in the quarterfinal against Tijuana to help his side stay in the competition. Their semifinal against Newell's Old Boys, of Argentina, was interrupted by a floodlight failure, Atletico scoring late on to force another shootout in which Victor again starred. ""When it's written, it's written -- this was meant for us,"" said Atletico coach Cuca.","Brazilian club Atletico Mineiro win the Copa Libertadores by beating Paraguay's Olimpia .

"New York (CNN) -- Four people have been charged in connection with a fight between fans caught on camera at an NFL game on Sunday, including the woman who was seen in the video being punched in the face, according to police. Amanda MacDowell, 25; Jaclyn Nugent, 26; David James Sacco, 28; and Kurt Paschke, 38, were all charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct on Tuesday, according to a statement released by New Jersey State Police. In a video of the incident that was posted on YouTube and Deadspin.com, MacDowell, Nugent and Sacco were seen getting into a verbal argument with Paschke inside MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during Sunday's New York Jets vs. New England Patriots game, police said. MacDowell and Nugent then began kicking and punching Paschke in the body and head. After the video of the incident was posted online, it quickly made headlines. A commentator on Deadspin said the fight started over a rivalry between the fans of the opposing teams. The Jets won the game 30-27. MacDowell, Nugent and Sacco, all from Massachusetts, are seen in the video wearing Patriots colors: red, white and blue. Paschke, a New York resident, was wearing a Jets jersey. ""Even a quick review of the video and just talking to a couple witnesses, you can see Kurt was defending himself and (he)shouldn't have been charged at all and certainly won't be convicted,"" said Paschke's lawyer, Bruce Barket. MacDowell and Sacco could not be reached for comment. A family member of Nugent said she did not have a comment. Paschke was convicted in 1995 of negligent homicide after fatally stabbing 17-year-old Henry Ferrer in a fight behind a pizzeria, according to records from the Suffolk County District Attorney's office. Paschke served three years and was placed on parole. He has been arrested twice since then, both times for disorderly conduct, records showed. He is now a Long Island bartender. Colleen Paschke told CNN affiliate WCBS that her son was ""set up by a white supremacy group, and unfortunately, he ended up taking the blame for the stabbing of another youth."" The video of the football game incident shows Paschke being pulled away from a fight. A blond woman then steps forward to confront him, and Paschke punches her on the left side of her head. Police say that Paschke punched Nugent in the face. In the video, it also appears that a bystander hit Paschke in response. ""We are aware of the situation and we do not tolerate that behavior,"" a Jets spokesman said. ""Parties involved were detained and this matter is now in the hands of the New Jersey State Police."" CNN's Jillian Martin, Leslie Bentz and Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","Two women, two men charged with simple assault, disorderly conduct, police say .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government for the first time has provided legal notice that it plans to prosecute a defendant using information gathered by a controversial National Security Agency surveillance program. The Friday notice to lawyers in a terror case against Jamshid Muhtorov is significant because it allows the defendant to have court standing to challenge the program and its use in his prosecution. Previous legal challenges to the program failed because they couldn't prove the warrantless surveillance was used in a prosecution. The government has used such surveillance information for investigative purposes before, but without public notification, according to U.S. officials and lawmakers who have come to the defense of the NSA. But civil liberties groups have pushed the Justice Department to publicly disclose any use. Friday's announcement is expected to trigger a constitutional challenge that could land in the U.S. Supreme Court. The program is authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has become the subject of scrutiny since disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Court records show that federal investigators monitored phone calls and Internet activity by Muhtorov. ""The government intends to offer into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in proceedings ... information obtained or derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978,"" Friday's court filing said. Muhtorov has been charged with providing and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. Muhtorov, who resided in Aurora, Colorado, was taken into custody in January 2012 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. He is a refugee from Uzbekistan and is accused of planning to travel overseas and fight on behalf of the Islamic Jihad Union, authorities said. The IJU, a Pakistan-based extremist group with an anti-Western ideology, opposes secular rule in Uzbekistan and seeks to replace the regime there with a government based on Islamic law, the U.S. Justice Department said. Government officials say the IJU is known for conducting suicide attacks in Uzbekistan. The group has also claimed responsibility for numerous attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan, a Justice Department statement said last year. Muhtorov allegedly has sworn allegiance to the IJU, stating that he was ""ready for any task, even with the risk of dying,"" the department said. However, Muhtorov has not been linked to any plots or attacks on targets inside the United States, the statement said. Muhtorov also uses the names Abumumin Turkistony and Abu Mumin, authorities said.","Feds say for first time it will use NSA surveillance against a criminal defendant .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Britney Spears received the loudest, longest applause at the start of her first taping as a judge on Fox's ""The X Factor"" on Thursday, but it was fellow newcomer Demi Lovato who appeared ready to steal the spotlight during the second season of the popular talent search show. During the first of two days of tapings in Austin, Texas, the panel of four judges -- Spears, Lovato, producer L.A. Reid and series creator Simon Cowell -- listened to 31 singers and groups audition for a chance at a $5 million recording contract, with the four music industry vets critiquing the performances and deciding who should advance to the next round in Los Angeles. Spears' addition to the show -- along with Lovato, she was announced as a new judge at television upfront meetings with advertisers earlier this month, with a rumored $15 million contract -- has drawn plenty of speculation about how the pop star would mesh with the other judges. Wearing a tight, fluorescent salmon pink dress, Spears was the last judge introduced to the 4,000-plus crowd at the Frank Erwin Center. She received sustained cheers as she sat down to the right of Cowell, the departed creator of Fox's ""American Idol"" (and normally the biggest star at the judges' table). When her turn came to critique singers, Spears remained encouraging and positive, giving the most ""yes"" votes of any of the judges and keeping her comments short and declarative instead of engaging with contestants. Of a teenage male performer she offered, ""You could be bigger than the next Justin Bieber,"" and in complimenting a moving, soulful female singer on her confidence she said, ""You were flawless."" When a performance demanded critical remarks from Spears, she replied with a simple ""pass,"" or ""I think you need someone to teach you to sing better."" After a sub-par song from a rapper who bore more than a passing resemblance to her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, Spears said only, ""I like your hat."" While Cowell talked to Spears off microphone between many of the performances and asked her to lead off critiques several times in an apparent attempt to draw her into exchanges, the 19-year-old Lovato needed no such prodding. Playfully flirting with male contestants (""she is single now"" became a common refrain from Cowell) and giving insightful comments at every chance, the teen star drew laughs and cheers from the crowd, along with several stunned, open-mouth stares from Cowell as the two verbally sparred. It was those times when the interaction between the contestants and the judges produced the types of moments that show executives hope will increase ratings following the ouster of first-year judges Cheryl Cole, Nicole Scherzinger and former ""Idol"" judge Paula Abdul. Take the moment when Cowell, 52, admitted to taking a liking to a charismatic 22 year-old contestant, who returned his affection. ""It's too bad we didn't meet 10 years from now,"" Cowell said with a wink before Lovato drily countered, ""More like 30 years."" Startled and momentarily silenced, Cowell responded, ""Demi, you're going into the naughty chair."" It was the first of at least three such utterances on the day that Cowell lobbed at Lovato, suggesting viewers and audiences can expect many more charged jabs between the two this season.

"(CNN) -- ""Trauma Alert! Trauma Alert! Gunshot Wound."" The announcement comes through the overhead speakers in an operating room in Tampa, Florida, and a team of doctors and nurses spring into action. Dr. Robert Benjamin takes the vital signs of the patient who was just rushed in and shouts orders to his team. ""Do we have his blood pressure yet?"" asks Benjamin. This trauma scene is like the ones Benjamin has been through a lot over the years. Yet, no matter how many times you do it, he says, you can never quite prepare for what the next emergency may be. ""We get about 1,200 traumas a year,"" he said. ""I'm ex-military and did a deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, and these scenarios were on par with what I would see out there."" But today's trauma alerts were different. The patient was bleeding and had rapidly changing vital signs, but he was never in danger of dying -- because he was never alive. At a glance it looks just like a mannequin. But this is no dummy. It is a high tech patient simulator. It's equipped with robotics that allows it to move, hemorrhage and provide vitals for doctors. ""The mannequin did look very realistic,"" Benjamin said. ""You were able to do a neuro check, move extremities, look at his eyes, and his breathing and respirations were very accurate."" The patient simulator is a product of a company called Trauma FX. It was designed to help doctors prepare for trauma cases like war-zone injuries, car crashes, gunshot wounds and amputations. But it's not just about looking real. It also provides detailed feedback on the team's performance. ""They just performed the chest tube properly,"" said Carolyn Hollander of Trauma FX. ""All of these are indications that the learner has performed the intervention. He lost a total of 1,500 millileters of blood and respiratory is back up."" Hollander was controlling the patient simulator from a control room overlooking the operating room. From there, a group of doctors monitor the training sessions, keeping the teams on their toes with their ability to change the scenarios at any second. ""If you think you are doing great, I'll switch the scenario. I'll drop his blood pressure. What are you going to do now,"" said Dr. Luis Llerena of the Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation, where the training session is taking place. The center is a 90,000-square-foot state-of-the-art health training and education facility. It's designed to help health professionals, students and residents train under pressure. ""You have a mannequin that has breathing, vocalization and you can do invasive treatments,"" said Llerena. ""That is what changes someone's mind and says, 'OK, now I'm really in a situation.' You get ultimate learning from that point."" Never knowing when the next tragedy will strike has hospitals turning to technology like this so teams can learn what an emergency situation could look and feel like. ""When we do debriefing, we ask them what are you feeling,"" Llerena said. ""Give it one word, and you saw the group say this is difficult, chaotic, intense, someone said scary. ""One person felt overwhelmed. Overwhelmed here is fine because now they can go back and know how to deal with that feeling."" For Benjamin's team, the lessons learned could turn out to be life-saving. Today, however, was just a good run-through. ""The team-building type aspects is what medicine needs to go through, instead of focusing on individual skills,"" he said. ""That will be better for the patient because we'll have better outcomes. ""Today went exceptionally well,"" he added. ""The mannequin did not die.""","A line of high-tech dummies is used in simulations of trauma surgery .

"Washington (CNN) -- Small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment -- banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- will once again be allowed in U.S. planes, the head of the Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday. Knives with blades that are 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) or shorter and less than a 1/2 inch wide will be permitted on U.S. airline flights as long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place. Razor blades and box cutters are still not permitted. Two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks or pool cues -- will also be allowed in carry-on luggage. Transportation Security Administration head John Pistole said the changes will take effect April 25 and will bring the United States into alignment with international rules. Some security experts say security improvements since the attacks -- most notably reinforced cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers -- have made the strict prohibition of small pen-knives unnecessary. Pistole said the changes are in keeping with his ""risk-based security"" initiative and will permit airport screeners to focus on looking for bomb components, which present a greater threat to aircraft, instead of lesser threats. But a union representing 90,000 flight attendants called the measure ""a poor and short-sighted decision by the TSA."" ""Continued prohibition of these items is an integral layer in making our aviation system secure and must remain in place,"" according to a statement by the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions. Although it was widely reported that the 9/11 hijackers used ""boxcutters"" in their attack, the weapons were not recovered, and investigators believe other types of knives were used. At a January 2004 hearing of the 9/11 Commission, a commission staff member said, ""Our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying -- permissible under the regulations in place at the time -- permissible utility knives or pocket knives."" The commission displayed a Leatherman knife, saying, ""We know that at least two knives like this were actually purchased by the hijackers and have not been found in the belongings the hijackers left behind."" Immediately after the attacks, the TSA prohibited a wide range of items from aircraft, but it has gradually been reintroducing some banned items such as cigarette lighters and matches. On occasion, such as a liquid bomb scare in August 2006, the TSA has expanded the list, banning large containers of liquids and gels. Under the TSA's risk-based security, Pistole has sought to ""reduce the haystack,"" giving modified screening to travelers under age 12 and over age 75. It has also expanded its TSA PreCheck initiative, which expedites checks of known passengers. TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the changes announced Tuesday will not slow down the screening process by requiring screeners to measure knife blades and weigh plastic bats. Screeners will use ""common sense"" when applying the rule, he said. A major pilot's union on Tuesday declined to comment on the specific changes announced by the TSA, saying it had not had time to study them. But it applauded the TSA's efforts to harmonize U.S. rules with those overseas, and its embrace of risk-based security. ""Unfortunately, the reality has been that we've had this patchwork of regulations and systems that in some part... have been carried on the shoulders of the airlines,"" said Capt. Sean Cassidy, first vice president of the Air Line Pilots Association International. Cassidy said risk-based security benefits the industry, the airlines and travelers.","The TSA will allow certain knives and sports equipment on planes .
Better security, such as reinforced cockpit doors, allow for the change .

"(CNN) -- Yemeni authorities working with the U.S. Navy intercepted a ship carrying a ""substantial"" cache of ""illegal arms"" such as surface-to-air missiles, potent explosives and rocket-propelled grenades, a U.S. official and Yemen's government said Monday. The incident took place in Yemeni territorial waters in the Arabian Sea last Wednesday, according to a statement issued five days later from Yemen's embassy in Washington. The crew of the USS Farragut, a Naval destroyer, was working with Yemeni authorities when they spotted the vessel, said an official in the Obama administration. The ship had several flags onboard, but no reliable documentation showing where it came from, the official added Monday. After the ship was intercepted, Yemeni coast guard officers boarded it and ""found a large cache of illegal arms,"" according to the Yemeni embassy's statement, which was also posted on the website of the Arabian country's state-run SABA news agency. The firepower included anti-aircraft missiles, C4 military-grade explosive, ammunition and bomb-making equipment such as circuits, remote triggers and various handheld explosives, the Yemeni statement said. There were eight Yemeni crew members aboard the vessel. The Obama administration official described the effort as a joint operation, and said U.S. forces joined their Yemeni counterparts in boarding the suspect boat. High-ranking AQAP leader killed .

"(CNN) -- It was certainly an unprecedented surprise when Saudi Arabia announced -- on 18 October, only a day after its election to one of the 10 rotating seats on the U.N. Security Council -- that it was turning down the chance to participate in the world's top forum for discussion of international issues. After all, the last few years have, if anything, seen an increase in Saudi Arabia's international profile -- particularly as a member of the G20 -- and in its regional activism. Traditionally, Saudis have preferred to work behind the scenes to promote their vision of regional stability, and to push back against what they see as the growing Iranian threat. They have been the leading proponent of greater Gulf Cooperation Council cohesion -- sometimes labelled as a ""circling of the Sunni wagons"" -- and they have recently ensured that a Saudi Arabian will take the top slot at the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Moreover, all the signs had been that they had seriously prepared for their role on the Security Council, including training their New York team in how best to make an impact. So what happened? The Saudi statement turning down the seat spoke of international double standards and the international community's failure to resolve key conflicts, homing in on the Syria crisis, the long-running sore of the Palestinian issue, and the failure to achieve a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction. The Saudis demanded reforms to the Security Council, and said they would refrain from membership until that body was capable of discharging its responsibilities to maintain international peace and security. Of course, many countries outside the magic circle of the Permanent Five (the UK, U.S., France, Russia and China) have wanted to see Security Council reform, and some of the P5 countries have themselves worried that the Council's failure to reflect changing patterns of world power -- and the wider ability to open up the government of international bodies to new players -- will inevitably eat into the legitimacy and credibility of the U.N. And there is no mistaking the anger, however generally slow-burning, in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Arab world about the international community's failure to resolve the Palestinian issue and achieve the establishment of the long talked about Palestinian state. That ire is particularly focused on the West, above all Washington, and is driven by a sharp sense of Western double standards. How can it be, the Saudis ask, that the West supports self-determination and democracy everywhere except when it comes to the Palestinians? Given the extent of U.S. aid to Israel, surely if the Americans were serious the leverage exists to persuade the Israelis to make concessions? And how come Barack Obama talked such a good talk in his Cairo speech at the start of his first term, only to fail so spectacularly to deliver? Not far below the surface there is also a sense of Saudi vulnerability. The Kingdom is, after all, an ally of the West, especially when it comes to anything connected with Iran. So they feel particularly uncomfortable when the Iranians claim to be the leading flag-wavers of the Palestinian cause, with the message to the Arab street that Arab leaders are in hock with the West and only playing lip service to that cause, or have even betrayed it. The Saudis may generally be pragmatic international players, but there is no doubt that the Palestinian cause is for them a sacred one, and that they care deeply about the fate of Jerusalem and the Haram al-Sharif in particular. While one can also point to Saudi unhappiness with Western policy towards Egypt, it seems clear that it is above all the Saudi sense of Western failure over Syria which has driven their decision, as it did when Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud declined to address this year's U.N. General Assembly. At the start of the Syrian crisis, the Saudis hoped that President Bashar al-Assad would go far enough to meet the demands of the Syrian people so as to avoid a crisis. When Assad -- never in any case one of their heroes -- chose repression instead, there was no mistaking the note of genuine moral outrage which came from the very top of the Saudi system, from King Abdullah himself. The Saudi argument that steps should be taken to arm the Syrian opposition was driven by a belief that those being oppressed had a right to self-defence. But they were also keen to prevent a further hardening of the ""'Shia Crescent"" stretching from Iran via Iraq and Syria to Lebanon and Hezbollah. I believe nevertheless that they have tried to target their assistance towards non-extremist groups, having learnt better than almost anyone else the lesson of Afghan resistance against the Soviets -- that arms in the wrong al Qaeda hands will one day become a threat to the Kingdom itself. It is however also hard to guarantee in whose hands weapons will end up in such murky situations. From a Saudi perspective, the message the West and above all the Americans have sent through their handling of the chemical weapons crisis is that it is has lost the will to get tough (a message which they think will not have been lost on the Iranians); that it lacks consistency (not all that long ago Western spokesmen would say that Assad was toast, and now even Kerry is praising his government for its cooperation with the OPCW inspectors); that it is not concerned about the strategic consequences of the conflict and the risk of refugee flows and other pressures destabilizing Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq; and that it lacks morality. Surely, they would argue, the signal conveyed to Assad is that it is acceptable to shoot protesters, but not to use sarin against them. They remain to be convinced that the West will put in a serious effort to achieve a result at the Geneva II conference now scheduled for late November. They worry too -- inevitably, and ironically like Israel -- that Western limpness on the Syrian agenda prefigures a willingness to accept a less than satisfactory deal with Iran, cutting Tehran too much slack in the regional strategic equation. It could -- and I think should -- have been argued that the Saudis would have done better to make their voice heard in the Security Council. But the shock decision has certainly sent their allies a strong, and public, message about their feeling of betrayal. And it is a message to which the West should listen, if only in engaging with the Saudis in a more sustained and strategic way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Phillips.","Saudi Arabia blasts U.N. Security Council, rejects offer to join .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former vice president Dick Cheney told a special prosecutor in 2004 that he had no idea who leaked the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame, according to newly released FBI documents. Cheney was questioned as part of an investigation on how journalists came to know the identity of Plame, the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who was a critic of the Iraq war. In the interview, Cheney responded to many questions with ""I do not recall."" However, he took a few stabs at the CIA in its handling of White House allegations that Iraq was attempting to purchase uranium from Niger to manufacture nuclear weapons. Wilson was dispatched to Niger on a CIA assignment to explore the charges and later said that the Bush administration was twisting facts to support an invasion of Iraq. He implied in a newspaper article that his trip was at the behest of the vice president. Cheney's reaction to the article was that it was ""amateur hour"" at the CIA, according to the FBI documents, released after the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, a watchdog group in Washington, sued under the Freedom of Information Act. The 28-page summary of the Cheney interview was made public more than five years after it took place. Cheney, his chief of staff, Scooter Libby, and presidential adviser Karl Rove, were named in a 2006 federal civil lawsuit by Plame and Wilson. Plame contended she was the victim of intentional and malicious exposure and that both she and Wilson suffered a violation of rights. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2007. Only Libby was tried and convicted of perjury, obstruction and lying to the FBI about the Plame leak. President George W. Bush later commuted his sentence. Cheney told the FBI he did not recall discussing Plame with Libby prior to her name being published in a column by Robert Novak in July 2003, and said he had no knowledge of Libby's meeting with New York Times reporter Judith Miller a week before Plame was identified. In closing arguments at Libby's trial, special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald said ""a cloud over the vice-president"" persisted. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, said: ""Mr. Cheney's near total amnesia regarding his role in this monumental Washington scandal -- resulting in the conviction of his top aide -- shows why.""","FBI: Dick Cheney didn't remember details of CIA agent Valerie Plame's outing .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's claim that terrorists ""can run but they can't hide""  following two operations in Africa over the weekend is a reminder that America's military is increasingly active on the continent. It also raises questions about the international legality of such operations, and their long-term impact, especially in weak African states. In some cases U.S. military engagements in Africa have already caused further instability rather than reducing the risks for international peace and security? Read more: Should U.S. fear Boko Haram? The U.S. Army's Delta force seizure of alleged al Qaeda leader Abu Anas al Libi, who was born Nazih Abd al Hamid al Ruqhay, in Libya is significant for U.S. counter-terrorism efforts. A few months ago, President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush attended a memorial service in Dar es Salaam on the anniversary of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 220 people. Al-Libi was allegedly the mastermind behind these bombings and has been one of the U.S.'s wanted men for the last 15 years. A second U.S. military operation by Navy Seals in Somalia was aimed at capturing Islamist militant leader said to be Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, who also goes by Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of Al-Shabaab, the group that claimed responsibility for last month's attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya. The operation was aborted under heavy armed fire during their amphibious assault. Analysis: Al-Shabaab breaks new ground . The Somalia operation is a reminder of how technically difficult such operations are and how accurate U.S. intelligence needs to be. Such operations though fit into a bigger picture of U.S. and Western counter-terrorism strategy in Africa, and how these poorly governed, fragile states provide havens and laboratories for terrorism franchises. Listening to the difficulties that the U.S. Navy Seals encountered in Somalia, reminded me that October 3, marked 20 years since 18 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somalis died in a battle that saw two Black Hawk helicopters shot down over Mogadishu. This was seen at the time as one of the worst disasters in American military history. The result in 1993 was that U.S. and international community left Somalia to its own fate -- which over two decades has brought it back into the front-line of international counter-terrorism efforts. While the outcome in 1993 was disengagement, U.S. engagement policy under President George W. Bush in Somalia to remove the Islamic Courts Union in late 2006 resulted in deepened radicalization and the rise of Al-Shabaab. Similarly Western policy toward Libya in 2011, interpreting a narrow civilian protection U.N. mandate for pushing for regime change resulted in the instability of Libya today, and the knock-on effects in the Sahel, including the radical Islamists capturing northern Mali until a French intervention loosened their hold on power earlier in 2013. Counter-terrorism policies live on the edge of international law: extrajudicial killings by drones or proxy hit squads are clearly contentious and extraordinary renditions -- suspect-grabbing operations -- are unlawful. Known extraordinary renditions in Africa have occurred in many African countries, including Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Kenya, Libya, Malawi, Morocco, Mauritania, Tanzania, Somalia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The Obama administration has not publically stated if such operations continue. Today the U.S. military brief congress with maps showing an arc of instability by Islamist terrorists from Somalia and the Gulf of Aden across the Sahel and Sahara to the Atlantic Ocean and Mauritania. Analysis: What's behind Nigeria's wave of violence? The mistake would be to regard this as a homogeneous threat. Boko Haram in Nigeria is very different from Al-Shabaab, which is different from AQIM. What is similar is that all these groups thrive in weakened and poorly governed states but the solutions are much more costly and long term: institution building, good governance and job creation. Building up professional and accountable African militaries is only part of the solution and Western efforts in Somalia in support of the continental body the African Union have had success in combatting Al-Shabaab and significantly weakening them, despite the Westgate attack in Kenya. It is though also pursuing policies that do not cause greater harm and radicalize further, as U.S. strategy toward Somalia in 2006 did and arguably US, French and British policy did toward Libya in 2011. If we are to advocate good governance, and rule of law as the ultimate remedies, we should more assiduously find ways of ensuring our policies are values-led, rather than by interests. Not forgetting the lessons learned from Somalia and Libya about the unintended consequences of non-intervention and intervention is important if international efforts to counter terrorism in Africa in the long term are to be successful. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Vines.","Counter-terrorism policies live on the edge of international law, Alex Vines writes .

"(CNN) -- A College of the Holy Cross basketball player accused her coach of being ""verbally, emotionally and physically abusive"" in a lawsuit filed this week in a New York court. And on Wednesday, that coach, Bill Gibbons, announced to the team that he would ""step back"" from his duties while the college reviews the allegations. Ashley Cooper, 20, was a student athlete at Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, on a full athletic scholarship from 2011 to May. During that time, she claims Gibbons shook and struck her, according to the complaint. Gibbons' behavior included ""violently yanking"" Cooper's shirt collar, squeezing her neck and hitting her on the back hard enough to leave a red hand-print on her skin during one basketball game in January 2012, the complaint says. During one basketball game, Gibbons' behavior prompted players on the opposing team to comment, ""Your coach is crazy,"" according to the complaint filed Tuesday. In 2011, a psychological professional who was brought in to discuss team chemistry revealed that the only issues the team had were related to Gibbons' abuse, according to the complaint. After several incidents, Cooper and her teammates complained to the athletic director's office, but their coaches retaliated for ""going over their heads,"" according to the lawsuit. The complaint also alleges that school officials were aware of the abuse but did nothing to address or stop it. ""Ashley was told, 'stop complaining',"" Elizabeth Eilender, Cooper's attorney, told CNN Tuesday. ""Eventually we realized nothing would happen and took the next step."" Holy Cross will review the allegations in the lawsuit, a spokeswoman said. ""The physical, mental and emotional well-being of our students is our highest priority at Holy Cross,"" Ellen Ryder, director of public affairs at Holy Cross, said in a statement. ""We just received the lawsuit and are in the process of reviewing it. Ms. Cooper had brought her concern to the College, and we investigated at that time. The lawsuit we received includes a series of new allegations and we will now bring in outside counsel to review them."" Holy Cross said Wednesday that Gibbons had announced to the team that he would ""step back from his coaching duties while the college reviews the claims"" in the lawsuit. During that review, Gibbons will be on administrative leave with pay, the college said. Gibbons is currently in his 29th season as coach of the basketball team, and according to the school's website, he is the most victorious coach in Holy Cross' history. CNN's calls to Gibbons for comment were not immediately returned. Cooper is filing this lawsuit not only for herself, but for all women athletes who are abused by their coaches, the lawsuit says. ""This has been going on forever. It just takes somebody strong enough like Ashley to stand up to this coach and this institution,"" Eilender said. ""The real question is, why is this institution continuing to protect him?"" Eilender also noted that the majority of the women's basketball team at Holy Cross holds athletic scholarships, making them ""beholden to the school."" ""Everyone is on scholarships,"" Eilender said. ""They're not going to say anything."" According to Eilender, former players have now reached out to Cooper thanking her for taking a stand against something that has been going on for years without consequence. In the lawsuit, Cooper alleges that the behavior of Gibbons' exceeds that of former Rutgers men's basketball coach Mike Rice. Rice was seen on a tape that surfaced in April throwing basketballs at his players, shoving them, cursing and using a homophobic slur. He was fired shortly after the tape aired on ESPN. Rice later apologized for his actions. Cooper has since transferred this fall to New York University and is not playing basketball, according to Eilender. ""To transfer in the middle of her college experience is extremely traumatic to her, but she felt she had no other choice in light of Coach Gibbons' abuse of her,"" Eilender said.

"(CNN) -- Tamesha Means' water broke early on December 1, 2010. Just 18 weeks pregnant, she called a friend for a ride to Mercy Health Partners, the only hospital in Muskegon County, Michigan. During that visit, and two others the following day, Means was in excruciating pain. She was sent home twice -- given pain medication, told to return if her contractions became unbearable -- and was waiting to be discharged for a third time when she started to give birth. The baby died less than three hours after it was delivered. That's all according to a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union last week, which also said that Means' fetus had almost no chance of surviving and continuing the pregnancy posed serious risks to her health. Health care providers at the hospital knew those facts to be true, the suit alleges, but failed to tell Means about the risks and the option of ending her pregnancy because they follow directives from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which do not permit abortion. ""As a direct result of these religious Directives, Ms. Means suffered severe, unnecessary, and foreseeable physical and emotional pain and suffering,"" reads the lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. It accuses the USCCB and others of negligence ""for promulgating and implementing directives that cause pregnant women who are suffering from a miscarriage to be denied appropriate medical care, including information about their condition and treatment options."" It seeks damages and a declaration that the defendants' actions were negligent. 'Abortion ... is never permitted' At the center of the case is what is known as the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services -- a set of guidelines that advises Catholic health care providers and patients what to do. Specifically, the lawsuit mentions directives No. 27 and No. 45. Directive 27 states: ""Free and informed consent requires that the person or the person's surrogate receive all reasonable information about the essential nature of the proposed treatment and its benefits; its risks, side-effects, consequences, and cost; and any reasonable and morally legitimate alternatives, including no treatment at all."" The termination of a pregnancy would not be considered ""morally legitimate,"" as outlined in directive 45. ""Abortion (that is, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the directly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted,"" that directive reads. Still, the USCCB is not standing by doctors, whispering in their ears, telling them what to do, said Robin Wilson, a law professor at the University of Illinois who focuses on bioethics, health law and religious liberty. ""You would have to show some sort of control, or agency, or direct duty in order to reach up to them. ... What I read didn't seem to make the linkages that I would have wanted to see,"" she said, adding that she thinks the case will be difficult for the ACLU to argue. ""Creative claims win sometimes. It's just conceptually hard to get my mind around it,"" Wilson said. Don Clemmer, a spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, declined to comment on the Michigan case. A call to Mercy Health Partners was not immediately returned Monday. 'It's about medical care' Means' lawsuit raises issues similar to a recent case in Ireland. There, a woman died after being denied an abortion last year. Seventeen weeks pregnant, Savita Halappanavar, 31, went into a hospital complaining of back pain. The doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but refused to do an abortion even though she was in extreme pain, her husband said. Days later, Halappanavar died from a blood infection, leading lawmakers to call for an investigation into what role abortion laws may have played in her death. ""They knew they couldn't help the baby. Why did they not look at the bigger life?"" her husband, Praveen Halappanavar, told the Irish Times. According to the Michigan lawsuit, Means was diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes. At the time she gave birth, she had acute chorioamnionitis and acute funisitis, infections she developed after her membranes ruptured. When left untreated, both can result in infertility and cause other problems, the lawsuit states. It says that Means should have been told about her treatment options, including the termination of her pregnancy. She also should have been told about the risks associated with continuing the pregnancy and that even if she decided to go ahead with it, there was virtually no chance the fetus would survive, the lawsuit says. Had Means known the full extent of her condition, she would have opted to end the pregnancy, according to the lawsuit. The ACLU filed the suit to get relief for Means and to make sure that what happened to her won't happen to other women, said Louise Melling, national deputy legal director at the ACLU. ""We care about the right to practice religion,"" she said. ""But this case isn't about religious freedom. It's about medical care.""","The case centers around directives and a woman named Tamesha Means .
Means was only 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke .
The lawsuit alleges she was not told about treatment options, health risks .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Demonstrators massed amid tight security in central Athens on Monday for a protest to mark the second anniversary of the killing of a Greek teen by police. Police shut down the city center to traffic for 24 hours as the protest loomed.

"(CNN) -- Its coach, Lucio Antunes, is an air-traffic controller, but not even he would have predicted that the tiny island of Cape Verde would soar into the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations Sunday. The smallest ever nation to score and win at the tournament, Cape Verde defeated Angola 2-1 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. There are 10 islands -- with a population of just half a million -- which make up Cape Verde's archipelago. But in its first ever appearance at the finals, where most were expecting it to fail, the 'Blue Sharks' have captured the imagination of the watching world with its fairytale story. Mourinho mentors Cape Verde's 'Special One' Antunes, whose side defeated the might of Cameroon in the qualifying playoff, had drawn with host South Africa and Morocco in its previous two group games. And despite trailing 1-0 through an own-goal, the 'Blue Sharks' hit back with two strikes in the final nine minutes to see off Angola. ""My team and I dedicate this victory to the wonderful people of the Cape Verde Islands,"" he told reporters. ""Our objective at this tournament has been achieved. We wanted to reach the quarterfinals."" After earning independence from Portugal in 1975, Cape Verde had to wait 17 years before being able to play a competitive match. But Antunes, who revealed before the tournament in an interview with CNN's Human to Hero series that he had received advice from Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho, has created a team which is keen to make up for lost time. And it showed all its fighting qualities after falling behind in the 33rd minute when skipper Neves put the ball into his own goal. That setback appeared to rouse Antunes' side and after Gege had headed home an 81st minute equalizer, Heldon popped up at the death to fire home a dramatic winner.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's Supreme Court on Tuesday outlawed a leftist political party for its links to the Basque separatist group ETA, and ordered its immediate dissolution. Supporters of the BMA attend a demonstration in April 2008. Just hours after the ruling, a bomb was found attached to the underside of a Spanish national police officer's private car in Bilbao, the largest Basque city, a police spokesman told CNN. The bomb did not explode. The officer had driven it several kilometers to work at police headquarters in Bilbao, where the device was discovered Tuesday afternoon, the spokesman said. Bomb squad experts were trying to deactivate it. The court outlawed the Basque Nationalist Action party, or ANV, as it is known locally. It has about 100 elected town councilors in Basque city halls, and they are expected to lose their seats under the ruling, an analyst told CNN. A lower court judge suspended the party's activities last February, preventing it from running candidates in Spain's national elections last March, due to suspicions about its ties to ETA. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States. ETA has sometimes used limpet bombs attached to the underside of the cars of its victims. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Tuesday's bomb under the police officer's car. Spanish courts previously outlawed another political party, Batasuna, for its ties to ETA, and prosecutors and lawyers for the government argued before the Supreme Court that Basque Nationalist Action was a kind of successor to Batasuna. But a Basque Nationalist Action spokeswoman vowed that her group ""will continue its political work"" on behalf of the Basque left, according her comments played on SER radio. Spanish authorities --- from the government to the courts to the police -- have tried to choke off support for ETA in recent years, with numerous arrests of ETA suspects, convictions at trial, restrictions on political activities of known ETA supporters and a clampdown on clandestine ETA financing. The Supreme Court's chief justice, Francisco Hernando, told reporters Wednesday that in addition to outlawing Basque Nationalist Action, the court would also immediately consider a similar ban on another leftist party, the Communist Party for Basque Lands, or PCTV as it is known locally, also for suspected links to ETA, the court's press office said. The PCTV holds seats in the Basque regional parliament, and it activities were also suspended last February by a lower court judge. In March 2006, ETA declared a ""permanent"" unilateral cease-fire, raising hopes for an end to nearly 40 years of ETA violence. But an ETA bomb at Madrid's airport in December 2006 killed two men and caused heavy damage, and the Socialist government immediately ended the fledgling peace process. Yet ETA did not officially end its cease-fire until June 2007. There are about 500 ETA convicts or suspects in Spanish jails and more than 100 more in French jails, authorities said.","Spain's Supreme Court bans leftist party for links to Basque separatists ETA .

"(CNN) -- A woman who was found guilty of killing five patients at a Texas dialysis center by injecting them with bleach will learn her fate this week. A jury in Angelia County found Kimberly Saenz, 38, guilty last week of capital murder in connection with the deaths. On Monday, they will consider whether she should be sentenced to death or put in prison for life. The deaths took place in April 2008 when Saenz was an employee at DaVita Dialysis Clinic in Lufkin, about 120 miles north of Houston. Prosecutors said she killed five patients by injecting them with bleach. Five others survived. Two witnesses said they saw Saenz use a syringe to draw bleach from a cleaning pail and inject it into the IV lines of patients. And prosecutors said internet search queries on her laptop showed Saenz had looked up bleach poisoning and whether it could be detected in dialysis lines. Saenz did not take the stand at the month-long trial. Her attorneys argued she was being used as a scapegoat by the clinic to explain the unusually high number of deaths that April, according to CNN affiliate KTRE-TV in Lukfin. Medics were called to the clinic at least 19 times that month. The spate of deaths forced DaVita to close its doors until it met state requirements.","A jury finds Kimberly Saenz guilty of capital murder .

"(CNN) -- Venezuela accused the United States on Thursday of denying President Nicolas Maduro's plane permission to enter U.S. airspace -- a claim that a State Department official denied. Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said U.S. officials have blocked plans for Maduro's presidential plane to fly through Puerto Rican airspace on the way to China. He described the move as an aggression and called for an explanation from the U.S. State Department. A senior State Department official told CNN that Jaua's claim was untrue, saying that the Venezuelans have, in fact, been approved to clear U.S. airspace. In remarks broadcast on state television, Maduro called the situation ""a serious offense."" The Venezuelan president vowed to take action, adding that the United States had also denied visas for several members of his country's delegation scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York. ""If I have to take diplomatic measures against the U.S. government, I will take them to the most drastic level if it is necessary, but I am not going to accept any type of aggression,"" he said. The State Department official also called the visa issue untrue, saying the United States had approved them. Maduro is scheduled to travel to China on Saturday. Jaua said officials were evaluating alternate routes so that the trip could continue as scheduled. Maduro accused U.S. officials of being nervous about his country's growing relationship with China.

"ZURICH, Switzerland (CNN) -- Turkey and Armenia signed an agreement Saturday night establishing diplomatic relations after nearly a century of animosity. Armenian and Turkish ministers sign accord as dignitaries, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, look on. The signing was delayed because of Armenian objections to the wording of a final oral statement intended to be given after the signing. However, neither the Armenians nor the Turks gave a closing statement after the signing. No further details were immediately available. The agreement will open their common border within two months after it is ratified by each country's parliament. The border has been closed since 1993. Turkish-Armenian relations are often overshadowed by the dispute over the massacre of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, more than 90 years ago. Armenians accuse Ottoman Turks of committing genocide, killing more than a million Armenians beginning in 1915. Turkey vehemently rejects these allegations.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If FIFA president Sepp Blatter is to be believed, it's the biggest issue that faces football. No, not diving, or Premiership hegemony or even the tackle from behind but rather the naturalization of players from other countries, especially Brazil, becoming common currency in the international game. Brazilian-born Mehmet Aurelio was the first naturalized footballer to play for the Turkish national team. ""If we don't take care about the invaders from Brazil,"" Blatter controversially said at the draw for the 2010 World Cup. ""Then at the next World Cups... we will have 16 [teams] full of Brazilian players. It's a danger, a real, real danger."" Players born outside of their country of citizenship have always played for their newly adopted countries. Alfredo Di Stefano started life with an Argentine passport before turning out for Colombia and Spain. Ferenc Puskas also represented Spain after making his name for Hungary. Do you think you players should be able to adopt a new country and play for them? But two things have changed. The first is the globalized nature of the sport, which has allowed Brazil to sell arguably its greatest export -- talented footballers -- to every corner of the world. The second is the emerging power and wealth of smaller states willing to use their financial muscle to attract better players to their national team. FIFA has been extremely critical of countries that have handed passports--some after playing in their new country for less than two years-- to talented footballers. The problem FIFA has found is separating the naturalization of a player who has genuinely put down roots in their new country -- as with Eduardo who moved to Croatia when he was 15 -- and those whose allegiances are bought and sold in a rudimentary international transfer system. One country that has stretched the rules to breaking point is Qatar, who has used its vast gas wealth to attract and naturalize a host of players from Uruguay and Brazil. The Qatari FA even offered to pay Brazilian striker Ailton, then the top scorer in the German Bundesliga, $1million to come and play for Qatar in 2004, even though he had never set foot in the country. The move led to FIFA introducing emergency legislation banning naturalizations from taking place if there was no connection between the player and their prospective country. FIFA has tried to tighten up the rules. Last May FIFA agreed a rule change which stated that a player must live in their new country for five years before they can play for the national team. Have the rules on naturalization of footballers devalued international football? But for a country the size of Qatar, which has a population of fewer than one million, there are few other options. ""The only way Qatar or Bahrain are ever going to be competitive is to import players and naturalize them,"" explains Jesse Fink, an Australian writer on Asian football and author of ""15 Days in June: How Australia Became a Football Nation."" Yet ultimately Qatar's experiment in footballing naturalization looks to have paid off. They currently sit third in their Asian World Cup qualifying group and are on course for a play-off spot for South Africa 2010 thanks, in no small part, to the goals of their Uruguayan-born striker Sebastian Soria. If they qualify they will be the smallest country to ever make it to the finals. Even more established footballing nations -- like Spain with Marcos Senna and Turkey with Mehmet Aurelio -- have looked at naturalization to fill problem positions in their team. While English-born John Wilkinson swapped the vagaries of lower league football in the UK for Singapore after being released by non-league Exeter City. Five years later he married his Singaporean girlfriend after some gentle persuasion from the national team coach and now anchors the team's midfield. ""I didn't even know where Singapore was!"" he told The UK's Guardian newspaper last year. Arsene Wenger suggested that his Spanish goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, who qualifies for a British passport after living in the UK for five years, is the answer to England's goalkeeping problems. So will Brazilian imports really takeover the international game? Many are skeptical. ""Blatter is fearful that World Cups will be overrun with naturalized Brazilians and has proposed strict rules for naturalizing players, but these are just scare tactics,"" concludes Fink. ""At the end of the day people want to see the majority of the players in their national team 'represent' them."" What do you think? Let us know your views in the Sound-off box below.","A look at a team of naturalized players plying their trade in world football.

"Washington (CNN) -- What do you do for an encore after a landslide re-election victory? How about taking your show on the road. And that's just what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will do later this month, as he takes over as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, giving an already very visible governor with national aspirations even more visibility. While the high-profile position should enhance Christie's status as a leader of the GOP, he's already coming under attack from some potential 2016 rivals. Christie wins big . With three-dozen states electing governors in 2014, Christie will be crisscrossing the country, supporting some of the party's brightest stars. But he'll also be introducing himself to those who know only the larger-than-life figure on TV. ""I'm going to be traveling all over the country trying to elect Republican governors and that's a pretty good thing to do for the Republican Party,"" Christie said Tuesday in an interview with CNN anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper. The states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Nevada -- are among those holding elections next year. That itinerary works out well for someone who's got an eye on the White House. ""The chairmanship of the RGA allows a governor to run for president before he actually runs for president, building relationships with organizers in key states and expanding his network of national contributors,"" said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and veteran of numerous GOP campaigns. ""It can also warehouse staff that can later move over to a presidential campaign. He can also use the RGA to collect chits by helping fellow GOP governors whom he hopes will eventually help him. It is a great platform for a Republican governor who is being urged to consider a presidential bid."" But Christie could face intraparty sniping that he's using the position to further his chances of winning the party's presidential nomination. Then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who chaired the committee in 2006, ahead of his first run for the White House in 2008, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who chaired the RGA ahead of his 2012 bid for president, also got such quiet criticism. Already under attack . Christie is touting his conservative credentials. ""I'm a conservative,"" he said in his interview with Tapper, anchor of CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" adding ""I've governed as a conservative in this state."" But a couple of high-profile Republicans are already trying to define Christie as not being conservative enough. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a favorite of tea party activists and a likely rival in 2016 should Christie decide to run, seemed to be trying to tag Christie with the m-word. ""I think the Republican Party is a big party, and we need moderates like Chris Christie who can win in New Jersey,"" Paul told Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday on ""The Situation Room."" ""What that means about the national party, I'm not sure there's an answer. But we do need moderates like Chris Christie in the party."" Paul also took a not-so-subtle jab Wednesday at Christie for starring in ads aimed at promoting tourism in New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. In a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing to review the federal response to last year's deadly storm, Paul questioned Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan about whether Sandy relief funds should be spent on television ads. Paul said that ""people running for office put their mug all over these ads while they are in the middle of a campaign. In New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running for political office."" ""You think there might be a conflict of interest there? You know that's a real problem. That's why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayer dollars wisely they are offended to see our money spent on political ads. You know that's just offensive."" And Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another possible GOP candidate, seemed to suggest that the impact of Christie's landslide victory may be contained within the Garden State's borders. ""Governor Christie has certainly shown he has a way of winning in New Jersey, in states like New Jersey ... so I congratulate him on that,"" Rubio said in an interview with CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. Rubio: Don't jump to conclusions about Christie's win . Will Cain, a Republican analyst and CNN contributor, said he doesn't buy in to the idea that Christie is a moderate. ""Look, everyone is invested in defining Chris Christie as a moderate. Liberals want to ascribe his victory to a repudiation of conservatism. And his political rivals want to beat him in a primary. But I don't know that I can accept the premise,"" Cain said. ""His greatest conservative sin is participating in Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. On everything else -- guns, immigration -- he's given lip service to moderation, not governed that way. An establishment Republican strategist said that infighting and sniping won't help the party with those it's trying to appeal to. ""The best thing that anyone who has their eye on 2016 can do for themselves and the party right now is to work together, show the American people that Republicans can govern responsibly and work to make inroads with sections of the electorate that didn't support Republicans in the last two presidential elections,"" Brian Walsh, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director, told CNN. Ready to run? Christie's everywhere in the wake of his landslide re-election. The longtime Bruce Springsteen fan's on the cover of Time Magazine, with the headline ""Born to Run"" on the story, and he's scheduled to do four of the five Sunday talk shows this weekend. Asked Wednesday by CNN's Debrorah Feyerick if all the talk about his potential bid for the White House is becoming a distraction, Christie pushed back, saying, ""I don't get distracted very easily. It takes a lot to distract me, and I think the way it won't be a distraction is I simply won't let it."" Christie's re-election speech Tuesday night sounded like something more -- the governor touted his bipartisan successes to an audience far beyond the Asbury Park ballroom and the borders of the Garden State. ""I know tonight a dispirited America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington, looks to New Jersey to say, 'Is what I think happening really happening? Are people really coming together? Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers? Are we really all working together?' Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government our first job is to get the job done, and as long as I'm governor that job will always, always be finished,"" said Christie, to loud applause. What Christie's win says about 2016 . Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire,"" knows some things about running for the White House. ""I think it was an introductory speech,"" the one-time 2012 GOP frontrunner said. Castellanos added, It wasn't an acceptance speech, that was an announcement speech."" Numbers to brag about . Christie's victory was never in doubt. And as the polls in the Garden State closed Tuesday night, CNN and the other news networks rushed to project that the high-profile governor would win a second term in Trenton. But the big questions heading into Election Day 2013 were how large a victory Christie would capture over Barbara Buono, his little-known Democratic challenger, and how Christie would perform with voters who tend to cast ballots for Democrats. With just about all the ballots counted, Christie won 60% of the vote, the most by a Republican statewide in more than a quarter-century . And according to CNN exit polls, Christie performed well with groups that the GOP needs to win if it wants to win national elections. Christie carried nearly six in 10 women and won all age groups other than those 18-29, which he just missed winning. Christie also won the Latino vote and took just more than a fifth of the African-American vote, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections. Christie also grabbed two-thirds of independents and a third of Democrats in a state where Democrats and independents made up nearly three-quarters of Tuesday's electorate. Christie, McAuliffe took different paths to victory . The exit polls appear to bolster Christie's case that he's among the most electable of the potential GOP White House hopefuls heading into 2016. But if he runs for president, Christie will have to get through a battleground of conservative voters in the Republican primaries and caucuses similar to those he faced in blue-state New Jersey this year. CNN's Dana Davidsen and Ashley Killough contributed to this report .","Christie follows big re-election win with yearlong stint as head of GOP governors .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two weeks after losing his bid for the presidency in an electoral landslide, Sen. John McCain is beginning the thorny transition back to life out of the spotlight as he weighs his future role in the Senate. Sen. John McCain is looking forward to returning to the Senate full time, aides say. Aides say McCain is looking forward to returning to the chamber full-time after a nearly two-year hiatus. But the road from Republican Party standard-bearer to merely one of a hundred senators can be a bumpy one, political observers say, especially since the Arizona senator is without a leadership position as his party faces its slimmest minority in the chamber in nearly three decades. McCain's return to a lower profile is made more precarious by the fact that he has to grapple with a stinging public rejection and ongoing criticism from some Republicans who say his campaign was mismanaged. Other Republicans have said it was downright incompetent.  Watch: What's next for the GOP? » . ""When a campaign is over, there is this grieving process that everyone on the staff goes through, but the loss is so much more personal and public for the candidate. It's public repudiation and this death of your dream,"" said Carol Darr, a veteran of several Democratic presidential campaigns and an adjunct lecturer at George Washington's Graduate School of Political Management. But political observers and former McCain aides say the Arizona senator will resist retreating into the wilderness, as some presidential losers have, and is instead likely to seek an active role in the Senate when the new term kicks off in January. In that sense, he is likely to follow the lead of fellow Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat who after his narrow defeat in 2004 returned to the chamber energized and determined to remain a key player on Capitol Hill. Known for his ability to reach across the aisle, McCain could position himself as a powerful ally of the Obama administration while championing causes he's always held dear, including earmark reform, climate change issues and immigration reform. ""John McCain's days as a presidential candidate are over, and his chance now to leave a lasting impression in public life going forward probably involves working with the man who beat him for the presidency: Barack Obama,"" Time magazine's Mark Halperin said. The Obama administration is likely to reach out to McCain on key issues on which it hopes to forge a consensus, though with a nearly filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, the future commander in chief may have little need to do so. Still, the former Illinois senator won the White House largely on a promise to transition away from partisan politics, and he may see McCain as the ultimate conduit through which to do that. ""You could have a McCain as a centrist who plays the role of consensus-builder on a lot of issues,"" said Senate historian Donald Ritchie, who's seen several senators return to the chamber after failed White House bids. But it's unclear just how much political capital McCain has left in Washington, given the extent of his defeat and the GOP's desire to chart a new course, and McCain may find it difficult to corral his Republican colleagues on a set of issues important to him or ones being pushed by the Obama administration. That fact was made exceedingly clear in late September when McCain's active support of the economic bailout package failed to rally a significant number of Republican lawmakers. House Republicans' defeat of the bill in the first vote appeared to be a sharp rejection of the party's presidential hopeful, who had only days earlier suspended his campaign with the intention of shepherding the measure through Congress. ""He doesn't have any weight in the House Republican caucus and very few supporters,"" said Jeremy Mayer, an associate professor at George Mason University's School of Public Policy. ""In the Senate, he has some friends like [South Carolina Sen.] Lindsey Graham, but [minority leader Mitch] McConnell has never liked the guy, and he's never been successful at leading his own caucus."" McCain's standing in the party could further decrease if the Republican senator reverts to his tendency to buck the GOP establishment and speak his mind when he disagrees with the leadership. It's a pattern that has given McCain his maverick reputation but one that has often made him more of an ally to Democrats than his own party. But as he campaigned for the presidency, McCain found himself courting conservatives he used to criticize and serving up Republican red-meat speeches he used to avoid, in the process facing criticism from a host of former allies in the Democratic Party that the once independent-minded senator had changed his stripes. Now free of the demands required to win the GOP nomination, McCain may have an eye toward regaining his popularity among independents and burnishing his legacy as a straight-talker untethered to strict party orthodoxy. ""His reputation has been impaired. ... It took a beating,"" Mayer said. ""He may want to go back to the old straight-talk John McCain with no filters. And he'll stop feeding red-meat populist conservative sound bites, because he doesn't have to.""","John McCain likely to seek an active role in Senate, former aides say .

"(CNN) -- A vintage P-51 Mustang aircraft crashed in the Gulf of Mexico near Galveston, Texas, Wednesday, killing two people on the plane, authorities said. The World War II-era aircraft, owned by the Lone Star Flight Museum and known in recent years as the ""Galveston Gal,"" was used to give rides to people seeking a flying experience. According to U.S Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Steve Lehmann, the captain of a charter fishing boat called the Coast Guard about 11:40 a.m. (12:40 p.m. ET) Wednesday to report he had just witnessed a plane go down between Chocolate Bay and Galveston Bay. The Coast Guard sent a small boat and a helicopter and also called state and local authorities and a volunteer rescue group. They found the plane in about 3 to 5 feet of water, with both occupants dead, officials said. Names of the victims were not immediately released. Sgt. John Sampa of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said the plane crashed in an area known as West Bay. Federal Aviation Administration records say the plane was built in 1944. According to the museum's web site, the plane was converted to a two-seat, dual-control training aircraft while serving in the El Salvadoran Air Force in the 1960s. In recent years, it was painted with the ""Galveston Gal"" markings and was used to give people a flight experience for about $2,000 a flight. In 2011, a highly-modified P-51 Mustang crashed into a group of spectators at the Reno Air Races in Nevada, killing the pilot and 10 others, and injuring more than 60 people.

"(CNN) -- At the end of first grade, 7-year-old Cameron Hale, an easy-going, cheerful little boy from a tiny rural town in western Washington, suddenly didn't want to go to school anymore. When Cameron adamantly refused to have a play date with a good friend, his mom, Kim Hale, 36, knew something was wrong with her middle child. His change in behavior just didn't make sense. ""Cameron finally broke down in tears and told me that several boys at school had been teasing him relentlessly, making fun of his hair, his clothes, calling him names, and not letting him play at recess. And one of those boys was his good friend,"" Kim says. While the friend wasn't actively participating in the teasing, Cameron told his mom that he was doing nothing to stop it, which made it all even worse. At first Kim stayed silent, hoping the mean behavior would disappear over the summer. But when it picked up again at the start of second grade, Kim went to the principal with her concerns. Kim says that the principal dismissed the charge and convinced her that the behavior wasn't bullying, but instead, it was simply boys being mean. Unsatisfied, Kim visited the principal two more times -- now armed with both the definition of ""bullying"" that she printed from the website Bullying.org, as well as the Washington State statute on how it defined the term. Both times, Kim says, the principal (who declined to comment for this story) disagreed that Cameron was being bullied and refused to act -- the superintendent in Eatonville was no help either. Six months later the Hales moved to another town. With horror stories about girls who have been bullied dominating the news, some parents are asking whether we also need to focus as much attention on how boys respond to harsh or abusive interactions with their peers. Was the principal correct in assuming that the actions of 7-year-old boys were simply mean boy behavior, or did it constitute bullying? And does it make a difference? ""Even if the behavior didn't technically match up to the definition of bullying, if the kids were being mean and there was a pattern of the kids ganging up on him -- which, by the way, does constitute bullying -- that still shouldn't be condoned and supported by not addressing it,"" says Rosalind Wiseman, author of ""Masterminds and Wingmen: Helping Our Boys Cope with Schoolyard Power, Locker-Room Tests, Girlfriends, and the New Rules of Boy World."" ""The principal is literally telling those boys they have the carte blanche to not only continue the behavior, but increase the abuse because they can get away with it."" Are we too quick to cry 'bully'? With ""Masterminds and Wingmen,"" Wiseman set out to replicate with boys the success she had examining the social dynamics of girls in her book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes,"" the inspiration for the movie ""Mean Girls."" In her latest book, Wiseman reveals the ways boys think, uncovers their complicated emotional lives and explores how the power of their social hierarchies influences their emerging identity. Historically, bullying among boys has been complicated and sometimes tough to identify. The belief in a ""boys-will-be-boys"" mentality still persists, whether it's on a playground or in a college fraternity. And it isn't always about targeting the weakest kid. Cruel taunts and physical tests can be also be a form of bonding among boys. The term bullying has become so radioactive in recent years with its strong links to adolescent suicide and school shootings, it has prompted state legislatures to take serious action, making bullying a crime in many states. Officially accusing kids of bullying can carry serious, long-term consequences. According to stopbullying.gov the definition of bullying is: unwanted, aggressive behavior among school-aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. The types of bullying include: teasing, name-calling, taunting, inappropriate sexual comments, threatening to cause harm, leaving someone out on purpose, spreading rumors, trying to hurt someone's reputation, hitting, kicking, tripping, pinching, spitting, taking or breaking someone's things or making mean or rude hand gestures. Should parents be liable for their children's bullying? About 16% of students report being bullied, while 7% report bullying others, according to ""Bullying in U.S. Schools,"" a report published in 2013 by the Hazelden Foundation with research from the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program. Boys report they were most frequently bullied by other boys, while girls were bullied by both girls and boys. In almost all grades, girls and boys were victimized at similar rates. ""Boys consistently bully other students more than girls do, and they do so at higher rates as they get older,"" the survey found. In her research, Wiseman has found that while boys might get more physical than girls, the psychological hallmarks of bullying are similar. The playing field has been further leveled with the spread of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is when a child or teenager is harassed, humiliated, tormented, embarrassed or threatened using digital technology. Mean texts or e-mails, pictures, videos and fake profiles can all be forms of abuse. And the pervasive reach of technology can make the bullying potentially more devastating. Parents, beware of bullying on sites you've never seen . ""When you think of a child being bullied, maybe you think of a loner kid, the nerd, the geek, that's the picture that comes to my mind,"" says Janet Lymer of Calgary, Canada, and mom of 13-year-old Austin. ""But my son plays Triple A football and he's a competitive hockey player and he was being bullied for years."" Lymer says life got significantly worse for her son in sixth grade when the kids started ganging up on Austin on the popular app Snapchat. She says about half of the class, girls included, began making fun of Austin's clothes, his lunch, his hockey skills and the video games he liked. It got so bad that Austin announced to his mom one night that he wanted to kill himself and headed into the kitchen for a knife. The next morning Lymer went to school with Austin and headed straight for the principal. When Lymer shared with the principal that her son had threatened suicide, the school immediately jumped into action. The principal and teacher met with the students in Austin's class and they also sent a letter home to the parents discussing bullying and its effect on a classmate. Things at school did get better, but Austin switched to a middle school this year with none of his former classmates. ""He now has a great group of friends and he helps other kids deal with bullying. He's the first one who stands up to bullying and he stands a little taller now,"" says Lymer. ""But don't assume that if you bring the problem to the school they will handle it, parents need to stay involved. "" While many schools and parents are hyper-aware of the dangers and prevalence of bullying, have we gone too far in labeling what some may argue has always been normal aggressive behavior between kids? ""Every conflict is not bullying and if we call it that, then it loses the power of the word,"" says Wiseman. Not all conflict amounts to bullying and by overusing the word, we risk reducing the power of the word to describe real bullying, says Wiseman. She believes that, to a certain extent, allowing boys and girls to work out their own problems is useful training for resolving conflicts at every stage of life. The challenge is to stay on top of what's really happening in your child's life, particularly when kids routinely answer with an ""I'm fine"" -- even if they're not. ""There's nothing wrong with kids trying to figure things out on their own,"" she says. ""At the same time, there are kids who are being systemically denigrated and targeted in school and blown off by administrators and teachers.""","Bullying among boys can be tough to spot because of societal expectations around rough play .
Experts say boys might be more physical in their bullying but cyberbullying levels the playing field .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Top Bush administration officials are shifting into damage-control mode after a House committee narrowly approved a resolution that labels the killings of Armenians in Turkey during World War I as ""genocide."" The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the measure 27-21 Wednesday evening, even though President Bush and key figures lobbied hard against it. The Web site of Turkish President Abdullah Gul carried a statement calling the decision ""unacceptable,"" saying it ""doesn't fit a major power like the United States."" State Department spokesman Sean McCormack issued a statement expressing ""regret"" for the committee's action, warning the resolution ""may do grave harm to U.S.-Turkish relations and to U.S. interests in Europe and the Middle East."" The nonbinding House resolution says the deportation of nearly 2 million Armenians from the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923, resulting in the deaths of 1.5 million of them, amounted to ""genocide."" Turks strongly reject the genocide label, insisting there was no organized campaign against the Armenians and that many Turks also died in the chaos and violence of the period. Turkish officials had warned approval of the resolution could jeopardize U.S. relations with their country, a NATO member that has been a key U.S. ally in the Middle East and a conduit for sending supplies into Iraq. Undersecretary of State Nick Burns said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would call the Turkish leadership Thursday to express ""deep disappointment"" with the vote.  Watch why Rice and Gates oppose the resolution » . ""We want to convey to the Turkish people and the Turkish government a message of respect and a message of support for them and the hope we can continue to work together with them,"" Burns said. The president, Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates all warned against passing the resolution. ""We all deeply regret the tragic suffering of the Armenian people that began in 1915. This resolution is not the right response to those historic mass killings,"" Bush said at the White House. Rice and Gates said Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military officer in Iraq; U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker; and Adm. William Fallon, head of the U.S. Central Command, also raised concerns about the resolution. Gates said good relations with Turkey are vital because 70 percent of the air cargo intended for U.S. forces in Iraq and 30 percent of the fuel consumed by those forces flies through Turkey. U.S. commanders, Gates said, ""believe clearly that access to airfields and roads and so on in Turkey would very much be put at risk if this resolution passes and the Turks react as strongly as we believe they will."" Nabi Sensoy, Turkey's ambassador to the United States, said the resolution's passage would be a ""very injurious move to the psyche of the Turkish people."" He predicted a ""backlash"" in the country, saying there would be setbacks on several fronts: Turkish-American relations, Turkish-Armenian relations and the normalization of relations between the nations of Turkey and Armenia. But House Democratic leaders said earlier if the Foreign Affairs Committee passed the resolution, they intended to bring it to the House floor. The resolution's sponsor, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said the measure already had 226 co-sponsors, more than enough votes to pass ""and the most support an Armenian genocide resolution has ever received."" The resolution calls on the president ""to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing and genocide documented in the United States record relating to the Armenian genocide, and for other purposes."" A similar resolution passed the committee by a 40-7 vote two years ago, but it never reached the full House floor. House Republican leader John Boehner, noting the critical military and strategic alliance with Turkey, said bringing the resolution to the floor would be ""totally irresponsible."" ""Let the historians decide what happened 90 years ago,"" Boehner said in a written statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer met with Turkish officials in Pelosi's office Wednesday morning. Hoyer said he and Pelosi informed the officials that they support the resolution. Hoyer said he told officials that while he considers Turkey a strong ally, ""this was about another government at another time."" ""I believe that our government's position is clear -- that genocide was perpetrated against the Armenian people approximately 90 years ago and during the course of the First World War. And I believe that remembering that, noting that, is important so that we not paper over or allow the Ahmadinejads of the next decade or decades to deny a fact,"" Hoyer said. The term genocide is defined in dictionary.com as ""the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group."" But the description is hotly disputed in Turkey, the predominantly Muslim, but modern and secular, pro-Western ally of the United States. Turks argue that all peoples -- Armenians and Turks -- suffered during the warfare. But Armenians maintain there was an organized genocide by the Ottoman Turkish authorities, and have been campaigning across the world for official recognition of the genocide. The resolution arrives at a particularly sensitive juncture in U.S.-Turkish relations. The United States has urged Turkey not to send its troops over the border into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish separatist rebels, who have launched some cross-border attacks against Turkish targets. Observers of U.S.-Turkish relations have argued the House resolution could make Turkey less inclined to use restraint in dealing with its longstanding problems with the Kurdistan Workers Party. ""The United States has a compelling historical and moral reason to recognize the Armenian genocide, which cost a million and a half people their lives,"" Schiff said. ""But we also have a powerful contemporary reason as well. How can we take effective action against the genocide in Darfur if we lack the will to condemn genocide whenever and wherever it occurs?""

"(CNN) -- Use of tobacco in flavors like Dreamsicle and chocolate mint may be a growing problem among teenagers, according to a Centers for Disease Control report. More than two out of every five middle- and high-school students who smoke report using flavored little cigars or flavored cigarettes, according to the report. And the bigger concern may be that the majority of the kids who smoke the flavored cigars -- some 60% -- say they don't plan to quit anytime soon (compared to 49% of all cigar smokers). Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. The report was the CDC's first attempt to measure flavored little cigar and flavored cigarette use among kids. The data come from the 2011 National Youth Tobacco Survey. ""Historically what we know from other studies is that flavors can mask the harshness and taste of tobacco, particularly for a new person who has not smoked regularly and finds it difficult to handle,"" said the CDC's Dr. Tim McAfee, director of the Office on Smoking and Health. ""Flavoring makes it easier to use and more appealing to youth."" Cigars have become increasingly popular in the last couple of decades. Sales were up 240% from 1997 to 2007, according to the CDC. Flavored cigars account for 80% of those sales. Doctors support raising the smoking age . The problem is, studies show, kids' experimentation with tobacco often turns into a lifelong habit. Some 88% of adults who smoke say they started smoking by the age of 18, according to the CDC. Tobacco use overall among kids has declined over the past few decades. Some 18% of high school students said they smoked one or more cigarettes in the previous month, and 13.1% said they smoked cigars, according to 2011 data. ""Things were looking and have been looking good in terms of the decline in youth smoking,"" McAfee said. ""So we are particularly worried about little cigar use not declining."" In 2009, President Obama signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Control Act banning the sale of flavored cigarettes. The law did not, however, ban flavored cigars. The little cigars are really ""kissing cousins"" to cigarettes, McAfee said, and they resemble cigarettes when sold in a pack. They are similar in size and shape and have filters like cigarettes. The difference is little cigars are wrapped in leaf tobacco or another tobacco product. Cigarettes are wrapped in paper or some other non-tobacco substance. Little cigars may have already been more attractive to kids -- they are often taxed at a lower rate than cigarettes, which makes them more affordable. And unlike cigarettes, they can be sold individually. ""This allows kids to get little cigars for pocket change,"" McAfee said. ""You can go into a convenience store and buy some variation on little cigars for under a dollar."" E-cigarettes: Healthy tool or gateway device? Concerned about this issue, Rep. Harry Waxman, D-California, and the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 asking the FDA to stop tobacco companies from ""exploiting loopholes and continuing to addict youth."" Waxman's letter cited internal documents from tobacco companies that showed the companies were specifically trying to develop and market new products the letter characterized as taking ""advantage of tax and regulatory loopholes."" A memo from National Tobacco mentioned in the Waxman letter describes adding ""six explosive fruit flavors"" including ""Apple Blitz"" and ""Purple Thunder"" to Zig Zag cigar wraps. The Waxman letter warns ""tobacco companies are succeeding in developing a new market by selling flavored cigars to young smokers."" But ""we don't want kids to smoke,"" said Mark Smith, spokesman for Commonwealth-Altadis, a company that has a line of flavored cigars. He says the company doesn't make products for children. ""We don't have a clue what young people like, because we don't study anyone under 21,"" Smith said. The company makes cigars with flavors because adults like them, he said. ""Think about how many adults like flavored coffees and vodkas and other spirits. Americans like new products, and they especially like flavored products."" Commonwealth-Altadis is also a big supporter of the ""we card program,"" which encourages retailers to verify the age of people buying tobacco, Smith said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Federal Reserve banks need to better prevent conflicts of interest, according to a new government report that highlights transparency issues with financial executives serving on the banks' boards. All 12 reserve banks should more ""clearly document the roles and responsibilities of the (board) directors,"" according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit released Wednesday. The report focuses on scenarios in which executives pose apparent conflicts of interest by serving on boards that regulate financial houses where they also have business relationships. An example, it notes, occurred when then-chairman of the New York Fed's board of directors Stephen Friedman owned shares in the investment firm Goldman Sachs, but in September 2008 provided it and other banks billions of dollars in federal funding in response to the unfolding financial crisis. Friedman was granted a waiver by the Federal Reserve Board in January 2009, the report said. But the board was unaware that he had purchased additional shares in Goldman Sachs through an automatic stock purchase program. The former chairman, who resigned in May 2009, could not be immediately reached for comment. The GAO, meanwhile, said that ""without more public disclosure of governance arrangements, such as board of director bylaws and director eligibility and ethics policies, there may be continued concerns about Reserve Bank governance and the integrity of the Federal Reserve System."" It did not identify actual conflicts of interest. However, it indicated the appearance of a conflict could cast broader concerns about the health of the overall reserve bank system. The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress charged with examining matters relating to the receipt and payment of public funds. Sen. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont Independent, said the agency's findings point to ""exactly the kind of outrageous behavior by the big banks and Wall Street that is infuriating so many Americans."" ""The most powerful entity in the United States is riddled with conflicts of interest,"" he said in a written statement. Despite government regulatory efforts, Wednesday's audit says directors with affiliations and business relationships with banks ""continue to pose reputational risks to the Federal Reserve System."" The report also called for reserve boards to boost diversity levels by broadening their candidate pool. ""Specifically, in 2010 Reserve Bank directors included 78 white men, 15 white women, 12 minority men, and 3 minority women,"" it noted. The Federal Reserve Board said in a response included in the report that the recommendations ""all have merit"" and it ""will work to implement them."" The audit was conducted as a result of a mandate by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, an 848-page bill meant to root out causes of the 2008 financial crisis.","A government audit shows apparent conflicts of interest on Federal Reserve banks boards .

"(CNN) -- A new permanent span over Washington state's Skagit River reopened Sunday, some four months after a bridge collapse on Interstate 5.

"(CNN) -- Sometime around the mid-1990s, the reality show was born. Since then, the genre has taken the world by storm: Audiences continue to love these shows and they cost next to nothing to make (cheap video, cheap sets, amateur ""actors,"" etc.). So the profit margins are huge. If you're a producer, what's not to like? Of course, there are few who would have much positive to say about the artistic values involved. Still, we seem to find reality riveting. Until it comes to America's space program. Here, general audiences greatly prefer fiction. The much-anticipated film ""Gravity,"" for example, opened in the United States this past weekend to rave reviews and a record-breaking box office take of $55.8 million. Ask anyone on the street, and chances are they are aware of the film, or at least have heard something about it. 5 things that couldn't happen in 'Gravity' Then consider: Two weeks ago, a Soyuz rocket launched the next astronaut crew to the International Space Station and there was barely a collective yawn, because practically nobody in the general population knew or cared! Why do general audiences love ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" and other science fiction films, but don't seem to care about what is going on in real space exploration? Here is my take on it: . 1. We've made it look easy for so long that the only time people pay attention is when there is an emergency or an accident. People got used to everything going well. That's boring to them. I have to admit that I can't sit through films of myself doing spacewalks. We didn't mess anything up, or go floating off into space to a slow terrifying death, so where's the excitement? 2. Reality space exploration is done by professionals. The back and forth between astronauts and mission control is intentionally succinct and to the point, with no unnecessary emotion. Better to watch an exciting reality TV show with name calling, hair pulling and other tantrums! Who knows what will happen next? 3. Reality space hardware doesn't look cool enough. I was training for my third space mission when Michael Bay and crew came to NASA to film parts of ""Armageddon."" Later, I had a chance to visit a set in Southern California during additional filming. I have to say that their fake space suits, spacecraft and other hardware looked very cool indeed, much more cool than the reality stuff I was going to use! 4. The physics of reality spaceflight are also boring. Orbital mechanics can be quite complex. Maneuvers and orbit changes are performed precisely and deliberately, and take some time. Much more exciting to have spacecraft ""fly"" like winged jet fighters in space, like in ""Star Wars."" How boring would those battle scenes have been had their maneuvers been technically accurate? What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity' Nonetheless, the actual experience of spaceflight trumps all movie cool. There is nothing like working hard in a space suit helping assemble a space station, while every now and then stealing glimpses of the surreal view of continents and oceans rolling by below. There is nothing like riding a rocket to orbit, or watching the plasma glow envelop your spacecraft during entry, as bits of burning heat shield go flying past the porthole. There's nothing like approaching a space station and actually flying the spacecraft to a docking. I'll take reality space any day. Now, having said all that, I have watched ""Gravity."" Ignoring technical inaccuracies, I enjoyed it. And I am newly grateful that NASA had no such technical inaccuracies during my flights. Watch for my review! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leroy Chiao.","Leroy Chiao: Americans love reality shows. When it comes to space program, prefer fiction .
He says ""Gravity"" well known, but do people care a crew just rocketed to space station?
He says we're inured to space flight, movies make it look, sound cooler, less workaday .
Chiao: Truth is, space travel trumps all movie cool. Spaceflight surreal, thrilling ."
"(CNN) -- In the 1980 Clint Eastwood action comedy film ""Any Which Way You Can,"" prizefighter Jack Wilson (played by William Smith) assesses the strengths of his soon-to-be opponent, Philo Beddoe (played by Eastwood). ""You're fast, and you like pain,"" he says. ""You eat it like candy. I've seen a few cases like that in my time. The more they get hurt, the more dangerous they become."" That scene comes to mind whenever someone asks me what they should make of Ted Cruz. Who is he? And what's he up to? They put those questions to me because I've known Ted for a dozen years, since he was an anonymous lawyer toiling in the bureaucracy of the Federal Trade Commission. And -- despite what may be the most tumultuous and colorful 10 months for a freshman legislator in the history of the U.S. Senate -- I'm proud to call him a friend. For some of my readers, this seems an odd confession. After all, we're talking about the most hated politician in America. Keep in mind that much of the hate being directed at the junior senator from Texas is coming from other politicians. Ted Cruz: Democrats' new bogeyman . In fact, recently, an adviser to Sen. John McCain told GQ magazine that the Arizona Republican ""f***ing hates Cruz."" Republicans don't like the 42-year-old because he makes them look bad and they can't control him. Democrats don't like him because his jabs sting and he won't back down. Cruz doesn't seem to be losing any sleep. The more he gets attacked, the stronger he'll become -- and the more determined. It's not just because he'll get more popular with folks at the grass roots. That's a given. For those who are convinced that Washington is broken and that corrupt lawmakers are serve their own interests while fooling constituents into thinking they're serving them, Cruz is a refreshing break from the ordinary. It's the way Cruz is wired. Before entering the Senate, he argued for a living and was good enough at it to make a handsome living while building a reputation as one of the best constitutional lawyers. Harvard Law School Alan Dershowitz, no conservative, told the Washington Post that Cruz was ""off-the-charts brilliant."" Cruz has been named by American Lawyer magazine as one of the 50 Best Litigators under 45 in America in the country. In his 30s, he argued nine cases before the Supreme Court and won several of them. Whenever he is challenged, his energy level goes up, his backbone stiffens, and his wits sharpen. From that point, it's game on. Cruz doesn't care about being popular or part of the in-crowd. He's comfortable with conflict, and sometimes he even seems like a glutton for punishment. He can't be intimidated or scared off. He doesn't care if other senators isolate him, ignore him or attack him. He doesn't care if they let him into their club. So they have no power over him. Not that his fellow senators haven't tried, unsuccessfully, to beat him into submission. They gave it a go last week at a closed-door lunch meeting in the Senate's Mansfield Room. According to senators who attended the meeting, and who spoke anonymously to Politico and The New York Times, one Republican senator after another berated Cruz for -- as they saw it -- causing the government shutdown without a plan to end it. Opinion: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy . At one point, Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire -- who is one of the GOP senators targeted for defeat by the Senate Conservatives Fund, an outside group that aims to punish those who did not fight the good fight against Obamacare -- asked the Texas senator whether he would publicly renounce the attacks. Cruz's response, according to someone who was in the room, was short and sweet. ""I will not,"" he said. That's typical Ted. As he sees it, this is his colleagues' problem, which they brought upon themselves by breaking promises and straying from principles. It's not his job to save them. As one senator told the Times, Cruz's refusal to renounce the attacks on his colleagues ""just started a lynch mob."" Who knew the GOP senators still had some passion left in them, at least when re-election is at stake? One senator who attended the meeting told Politico, ""I just wish the 35 House members that have bought the snake oil that was sold could witness what was witnessed today at lunch."" Notice that the unnamed senator -- a real profile in courage -- wasn't so anxious for the proceedings to be witnessed by the scores of conservative voters outside of Washington who side with Cruz. For the GOP establishment, transparency is a concept that is best not carried too far. That hypocrisy from Republicans sticks in my craw. I believe that the shutdown was the right thing to do and that defunding, or at least delaying, Obamacare is the necessary thing to do. Opinion: Obstructing government, from Huey Long to Ted Cruz . It's not ready for America, and America is not ready for it. The arguments coming from House Republicans are more persuasive than the ones coming from the White House. I believe that Obama hurt his credibility by continuing to provide members of Congress and their staffs subsidies to purchase coverage and by agreeing to a delay in the mandate to provide insurance to those employers who are not already in compliance with the law. This is a spectacle that resembles employees who work in a restaurant vowing never to eat there. It's no wonder the public is skeptical. The fact that I believe all this has nothing to do with Cruz. I got here all by myself. Besides, I don't put stock in the popular media narrative that Cruz is singlehandedly responsible for shutting down the government. That's just smoke from Democrats and the GOP establishment. Scores of Republican lawmakers raised money by promising to repeal Obamacare. And then as soon as they got to Washington, they settled into their offices and didn't lift a finger to defund the program. In fact, they went on the attack against the one guy who led the fight to do just that. Of course, this double talk blew up in their faces. What did they expect? Congress is broken, but it was that way long before Cruz got there. My friend draws his staying power from the belief that he's right. As unpopular as he is within the Beltway, he is keenly aware that -- in the heartland and across the country -- his stance in defiance of Obamacare, and his willingness to rock the political boat, have transformed him into a rock star. He has lost the support of many, if not all, his Senate colleagues. But, judging from what you hear on talk radio and right-wing blogs, he is winning the loyalty and respect of many average Americans. And, in politics, that can carry you far. Ted Cruz will continue to be attacked. And like a fictional prizefighter, the more that others try to hurt him, the more dangerous he'll become. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette says Ted Cruz has shaken up Washington .

"(CNN) -- It was the question every player was ready for. ""Being a member of the German national side, how you do feel about playing in Israel given your country's history?"" A deep breath, a nod, a look of ""what can I say?"" Pierre-Michel Lasogga is used to thousands of fans shouting at him on the football field -- he's accustomed to the pressure of millions at home watching on their television sets. As one of Germany's most promising young players at the European Under-21 Championship Finals in Israel, he's used to being asked questions, being interviewed and having a camera stuck in front of his face. A giant of a man with a huge physical presence and arms adorned by tattoos, it is something of a surprise that he is so softly spoken. Six million dead . Germany's arrival in Tel Aviv was met with the usual questions over whether the current generation were aware of their country's darkest chapter -- the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis during World War Two. It is a subject which the players are keen to talk about -- there is no sign of sidestepping a question. Talking in English -- ""you have to speak slowly for me,"" he says -- Lasogga appears calm and confident when it comes to talking about such an emotive subject. Born in Gladbeck, in the northern part of the Ruhr area, he recalls learning about the Holocaust at school, but it was not until his trip to Israel that the enormity of the event sank in. ""At school it is different,"" he told CNN. ""You forget. ""Of course, we learned about what happened when we were younger. But when you come here, come to Israel and you learn even more ... it's just completely different."" Hitler . Under Adolf Hitler, Germany and its accomplices persecuted Jews across Europe in merciless fashion, with an estimated 2.5 million being killed from April to November 1942 alone. The German Football Associaton (DFB) has long brought its teams to Israel, with a trip to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem a regular fixture on the itinerary. Regardless of whether it's the senior team, youth or women's teams, all have taken part in a tour and educational guide of the center. Wreaths are laid, while a visit to the Children's Memorial, a room with five candles reflected by hundreds of mirrors to commemorate the 1.5 million or more who died, leaves an indelible mark. Pictures of those who were so brutally murdered hang on the walls, while the testimonies of those who survived share their harrowing tales. ""It was very moving to see the history again at the exhibition,"" said Lasogga, who visited the museum in March when the Germany U21 side went to Israel for a friendly match. ""It was very emotional for us. It touched us. ""We learned it at school but coming here and seeing it at Yad Vashem is completely different. It's something which gives you so much more than you see in school. ""It was hard to see what has happened in the past and I hope that this situation will never happen again. ""I hope that by us coming to Israel it can help with the past."" Israel . Lasogga is not alone in these thoughts -- his team captain Lewis Holtby, who plays for Tottenham in the English Premier League, was also moved by the experience. Holtby, who has an English father and German mother, says playing in Israel has been a ""privilege."" ""The trip was special for us,"" he said. ""We already knew about the history of Israel and the Holocaust, but to experience it here makes us think about so many things. It's a privilege to play here."" Germany and Israel's relationship on and off the pitch has grown immeasurably since the Jewish state attained full UEFA membership status in 1994. In 2008, the DFB launched a program which saw German national teams of all ages travel to Israel on a yearly basis to play friendly games and take part in an educational program. The following year it signed a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" with the Israel Football Association which has seen the countries work together on the development of referees, coaches and young players. Different pictures . Earlier this week, players visited the Hadassah Neurim Youth Aliyah Village where they posed for pictures and spoke to some of the 400 students who attend the local school. Germany, which last won the U21 competition in 2009, failed to progress from its group on this occasion, but the lessons learned off the field have given its players a new sense of perspective on life. ""We are very happy to be in Israel,"" said Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Sebastian Rode. ""We learned a lot about the country when we were here in March, a few months ago. ""We've experienced great hospitality and the country is beautiful from what we've seen. When you look at it on the television we see different pictures, but it's great to be here."" Controversy . Israel's hosting of the competition has been a topic of controversy, with campaign groups and some famous names within football calling for a boycott of the tournament due to the country's treatment of the Palestinians. A petition raised by pro-Palestinian campaign group, Red Card Israeli Racism, attracted over 8,000 signatures, while Archbishop Desmond Tutu was one of a whole host of names who signed an open letter in The Guardian newspaper in Britain in May. But according to the German players, this tournament has given Israel the opportunity to show a different side of itself on the international stage. ""It's a great opportunity for Israel to show another face of the country and not just the politics and what you see on the television,"" said Lasogga. ""When you see the conflict, it's not nice pictures. But when you come here you get a completely different picture of Israel, and this tournament can give people a completely new perspective. ""It was very important to come here before the tournament. It was nice to see Israel and it showed us some of the country and showed us how the people are here. ""All the places and people have been so friendly, helping us and making us welcome.""","German soccer players talk about their moving visit to Holocaust museum Yad Vashem .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York Police Department denies it is actively searching for the mysterious street and graffiti artist known as Banksy, according to a spokeswoman. Yet, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg suggested Banksy is breaking the law with his guerrilla art exhibits. Annette Markowski, an NYPD public information officer, told CNN police have not launched an investigation of Banksy because they have not received any complaints of vandalism related to the artist. Every day this month, Banksy has been unveiling new works of art around New York. The works are then announced on his website. Some of the surprise exhibits are stencils spray-painted on streets and walls of buildings. Others have included whimsical mobile displays transported on trucks, an animated YouTube video and, on Wednesday, a performance art piece involving a dirt-smeared boy shining the shoes of a life-sized statue of Ronald McDonald outside one of the fast-food chains franchises. Big-ticket graffiti artist Banksy says he offered paintings for $60 in Central Park . ""Graffiti does ruin people's property and is a sign of decay and loss of control,"" Bloomberg said at a press conference Wednesday, when asked by journalists about Banksy's street art. ""Running up to somebody's property or public property and defacing it is not my definition of art. Or it may be art but it should not be permitted. I think that's exactly what the law says,"" Bloomberg continued. He said the city's Department of Cultural Affairs would look into the matter. On Thursday, the unidentified artist published a photo on his website of the front page of the New York Post with the headline ""Get Banksy! NYPD hunts artist."" ""I don't read what I believe in the papers,"" the artist wrote in a caption below the photo.

"(CNN) -- The worst weather disaster in American history took place in Galveston, Texas, in 1900 when a hurricane estimated as a Category 4 intensity blew ashore, killing thousands of residents and obliterating the town. The unnamed storm was first detected in the Atlantic on August 27, reaching Cuba as a tropical storm on September 3. Like Ike, the hurricane crossed Cuba and entered the Gulf of Mexico, crashing ashore just south of Galveston on September 8. Galveston Island was completely covered by 8- to 16-foot storm tides. Estimates of the death toll range from 6,000 to 12,000, and property damage was estimated at $30 million. Galveston in 1900 was a rich shipping city, home to nearly 40,000 people, many of them made wealthy by Galveston's position as Texas' chief port. But they weren't prepared for September 8.  Watch how Ike and the 1900 hurricane are similar » . The flood waters began rising before dawn that morning, and initially the people of Galveston thought nothing of it. For the most part, they even ignored the warnings of U.S. Weather Service meteorologist Isaac Cline, who took to his horse and rode up and down the beach warning people to seek higher ground,  an urging that ultimately meant little to a city 8 to 9 feet above sea level at its highest point. ""In reality, there was no island, just the ocean with houses standing out of the waves which rolled between them,"" Cline wrote in his 1945 memoirs. Ironically, Cline had argued against building a sea wall in Galveston, saying it was unnecessary and that a storm of any significant strength, in any event, would never strike the island. The gargantuan storm tides collapsed houses along the beach front and turned them into a wall of debris that pushed further inland on the island. At its final stopping point, the debris kept buildings beyond it from collapse, but not from damage. In the aftermath, everything was bulldozed for 15 blocks from the beach. Photographs could only begin to tell the story of the destruction. Haunting black-and-white images show residents searching through ruins with only a peaked gable to indicate that it was once a home, a house picked up from its foundations and shoved 30 yards away, a body half buried in the debris. Several clips of film exist of the devastation, as well. Black and white and silent, they record the search for bodies and the complete devastation wrought by the hurricane. Many of the storm's victims were washed out to sea, and many more were taken out to sea and dumped. But those bodies came back to shore with the tides. The city set about burning the bodies on funeral pyres that blazed for weeks. News accounts at the time record the stench of death that hovered over the remains of the city. The destruction was so complete that word of the aftermath could not reach the outside world. Telegraph lines and bridges to the mainland were all down. Messengers aboard one of the few ships to survive the storm reached Houston on September 10, sending a short message to the Texas governor and U.S. President William McKinley. ""The city of Galveston is in ruins,"" the message said, estimating 500 dead. But Galveston was revitalized in the aftermath of the storm, as well. A sea wall was built. The city was elevated 16 feet at the seawall, sloping downward across the 32-mile-long, 2 1/2-mile-wide island to the bay on the other side. Today, Galveston is a vibrant city and a popular tourist destination with a population approaching 60,000. Although it never regained its high status as a shipping port, Galveston is still a port of call for cargo ships and now for cruise ships, as well.","Category 4 storm destroyed Galveston in 1900 .

"(CNN) -- Gross is everywhere. It's in the food we eat: in the cheese that shares chemical properties with bad breath and stinky feet and in the bread that is leavened by microbial excretions. It's in nature: in the viruses that make us sick, in the monstrous shape of reptiles and deep-sea fish and in the terrible parasites that torment them. Of course, we ourselves might be the greatest source of grossness. We carry it with us, in our blood and guts. Anytime someone's insides end up outside, you are definitely in the presence of the gross. It seems obvious that our repulsion from the gross is rooted in our fear of death. We may pretend that we are our own masters, but deep down we suspect we are really the victims of nature and fate. The things we spurn as gross are the things that rub that dismal knowledge in our face. 5 ways Japan will surprise you . But fear is only half the story. Old medical devices may look like implements of torture, but they were used for healing. Gruesome medical specimens show us the miraculous functioning of the human body. Horrific germs and grotesque insects embody nature's endless ingenuity, its ability to exploit any niche and fill the empty spaces with living things. If it's true that the universe can be known in a grain of sand, then it can also be known through the gross -- and that's much more entertaining than staring at a tiny bit of gravel. If you resist the impulse to flinch and take the gross on its own terms, you will unlock a universe of discovery and even enjoyment. Here are seven of my favorite gross places in America to jump start your own journey of ""grossological"" discovery. Hit the trail: 7 gorgeous hikes . Mütter Museum, Philadelphia . The nation's undisputed monarch of medical museums began with a donation from Dr. Thomas Dent Mütter to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia in 1858. In 1912, the enlarged collection was moved to its present location, where it continued to serve physicians as a pathological reference collection. Today it is a monument to 19th-century medicine. Its clubby, dark wood and brass interiors practically define the steampunk aesthetic. Within the glass cases is a Noah's ark of medical curiosities. Flier's alleged 50-day bender ends badly . There is a human skull collection; examples of diseased organs, either preserved in jars or cast in wax models of remarkable delicacy. Admittedly, the collection of teratological specimens (mutants) requires a strong stomach. But even the most sensitive can enjoy the Chevalier Jackson Foreign Bodies Collection, a cabinet filled with more than 2,000 swallowed objects removed by a single laryngologist. There are also examples of tanned human skin, which has no medical value, but is totally cool. My personal favorite is the Soap Lady, a woman whose body posthumously underwent complete saponification -- which means that all the fat in her body turned into soap. That can really happen. The museum is open daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. World's Largest Fungus, Malheur National Forest, Oregon . Don't be fooled by an ordinary looking mushroom. Beneath it broods an ancient horror that has been growing quietly for thousands of years. A Malheur National Forest cluster of Armillaria ostoyae, or honey mushroom, is part of the world's largest fungus, which engulfs 3.4 square miles -- that's 2,200 acres -- of Oregon's national parkland. This massive mushroom is estimated to weigh 7,567 to 35,000 tons, which would make it the largest living organism in the world. But that doesn't sound nearly as gross as being the largest fungus. Now for the letdown: The bulk of this behemoth resides underground in a stringy network of roots called a rhizomorph. The only visible traces are the mushrooms that sprout in the fall. They may not look like much but once you know their dark secret, you can't help but see them in a new, sinister way. The U.S. Forest Service website has more information about the fungus and its forest home. Necropolis by the Bay, Colma, California . In this community of 1,800 souls, the dead outnumber the living 900 to 1. Colma's demographic imbalance is the result of its unofficial role as San Francisco's necropolis. This relationship started in 1900, when land became so scarce in San Francisco that the City Council decided to remove all its dead and build on the decommissioned cemeteries. The dispossessed dead were transferred to new digs in Colma -- for a service charge of $10 a head. Those whose next of kin couldn't come up with the cash were less ceremoniously reinterred in collective, unmarked graves. With 73% of its land zoned today for memorial parks, Colma is less a city than a network of roads connecting its many cemeteries. (Even the number of cemeteries within city limits is debatable, although most sources place the count at 17.) The Colma Historical Association offers cemetery tours by appointment, and members will be happy to show you the final resting places of Wyatt Earp, Joe DiMaggio, Levi Strauss and other famous Americans who now call Colma home. Perhaps this attraction is more morbid than gross, but let's not split hairs: It's a pleasant Halloween-season outing in a beautiful part of the nation. Indiana Medical History Museum, Indianapolis, Indiana . How many medical museums are on the site of an old insane asylum? Built in 1897, the Old Pathology Building was the research wing of the Indiana State Hospital for the Insane. Physicians there studied the brains of deceased patients, trying to identify the physical causes of mental illness. Some of the more colorful diagnoses they came up with include: pathological jealousy, Mexican War excitement, religious anxiety and a little-known ailment called ""husband in California."" A significant number of patients, however, suffered from general paresis, a neurological condition caused by advanced syphilis. Today, the beautifully restored museum building is a perfect replica of a turn-of-the-century pathology laboratory. You can see a sampling of gruesome medical and autopsy tools in their native environment, but, of course, the grossest highlight is the human brain collection. This consists of some 80 samples, mostly sliced in cross section and preserved in glass slides, which display various neurological injuries. The Indiana Medical History Museum is open to the public Thursday through Saturday. Leila's Hair Museum, Independence, Missouri . Some things seem universally gross, say, the smell of rotting flesh. Other things elicit a variety of responses. Old hair gives some people in intense case of the heebie-jeebies. Leila Cahoon is not one of them. She is the proprietor of the nation's only museum dedicated entirely to hair art. Nearly forgotten today, hair craft was popular with Victorians, who wove jewelry and decorative lace out of human hair. Often these pieces were kept as mementos of dead or absent loved ones. Sometimes successive generations would add to the lacework to create a genealogical record, much like a family bible. The hair museum has more than 2,000 items that reach back to the 17th century. Creepy as you might find these pieces, you cannot deny their artistry. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Berkeley Pit, Butte, Montana . This unintended artificial lake is an expanse of tranquil water four miles around and tinted an impossible shade of rich cordovan red. As luminous and vast as the Montana sky above, it is a sight of unearthly, inhuman beauty. But it is undeniably gross. The secret to the Berkeley Pit's beauty is pollution. Lots of it. For 27 years, it was the site of intensive strip mining, which removed more than a billion tons of earth and valuable ores. When mining ceased in 1982, ground water began to rush into the pit, bringing with it an infusion of acids and toxic heavy metals. Today the Berkeley Pit is the crowning jewel in the nation's largest contiguous federal Superfund site. How dangerous is the pit? Back in 1995, a flock of misdirected snow geese alit on its banks. The next morning, 342 were dead. Remarkably enough, you can visit the pit. Obviously kayaking and water skiing are out of the question. But there is an observation platform where you can watch at a safe distance. It's open from March to November. For more information, go to www.visitmt.com and search for ""Berkeley Pit."" Morbid Anatomy Library, Brooklyn, New York . This library and private collection of weird art and antique medicine cum gallery and lecture space hosts occasional classes in anthropmorphic taxidermy. That's the resurrected Victorian craft of dressing dead animals in adorable little outfits and posing them in human activities. The bunny school houses and kitten croquet parties of a more genteel era, however, have been updated to mouse burlesque dancers, skateboarders and drunken poets. Visits can be scheduled to the library by appointment.","Gruesome medical specimens show the miraculous functioning of the human body .

"(CNN) -- A worker at San Francisco General Hospital alerted a supervisor about a body in a stairwell four full days before the facility announced that a long-missing patient's body had been found in the same locale, a lawyer for the patient's family said Thursday. Haig Harris, an attorney representing the children of the late Lynne Spalding, said an official at San Francisco General called him on Thursday to tell him about the October 4 incident. The 57-year-old Spalding was admitted to the hospital September 19. She was reported missing two days later. On October 8, the body found in an exterior stairwell in the building was identified as Spalding. Hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan confirmed that Dr. Jeffrey Critchfield, chief of the Division of Hospital Medicine, called Harris on Thursday, though Kagan did not elaborate on their conversation. Harris said Critchfield told him that around 7:20 a.m. on October 4, a senior female staff member on the hospital's fifth floor heard banging coming from Stairwell 8. She went to check and saw another hospital staffer, who told her there was a body lying between the third- and fourth-floor landings, Harris said. The senior staffer, a supervisor, then called the San Francisco Sheriff's Department to relay the report, Critchfield told Harris, according to the lawyer. The sheriff's department oversees security on the hospital's campus. It's not known what happened immediately after that. Review ordered after body found in stairwell . Sheriff's department spokeswoman Susan Fahey would neither confirm nor deny the call or any subsequent response. She said on Thursday that she could not discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation. Authorities have not detailed how Spalding died. She was admitted to the hospital for a bladder infection. When she disappeared on September 21, she was listed in ""fair condition,"" the hospital and sheriff's department said earlier this month in a joint statement. The statement added that hospital employees and sheriff's deputies searched for Spalding. On October 8, a member of the hospital's engineering staff, who was conducting a routine quarterly check, found her body in an exterior stairwell. The hospital and sheriff's department noted the alarmed stairwell, which exits to the hospital grounds at the bottom, ""is a fire exit that is not routinely used by staff, patients or the public.""

"(CNN) -- ""When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life,"" memorably proclaimed Samuel Johnson. Whereupon that man -- presumably -- is buried in London. Lucky him (or her). The city has some of the best, most atmospheric, cemeteries in the world. Luminaries from Karl Marx (Highgate Cemetery) to the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst (Brompton Cemetery) to Johnson himself (Westminster Abbey, which is really not your everyday resting place) are buried here. Being famous, though, doesn't guarantee an interesting gravestone. Some of the best tombs belong to the largely forgotten, people who nonetheless seemed to have had big plans for the hereafter. Tom Sayers: The big sleep . Highgate is the most famous of London's great Victorian cemeteries, bursting with big names and bombastic memorials. Yet in choosing her favorite gravestone, Catharine Arnold, author of ""Necropolis -- London and its Dead,"" picks someone removed from the worlds of literature and the arts, with which Highgate is normally associated. Tom Sayers' tomb, guarded by his ""immortal dog ... faithful to the last [is] a great example of Victorian animal memorial art,"" she says. Sayers was a bare-knuckle boxer, whose final fight is considered to have been in effect the first boxing world championship. It ended in chaos, but won him an army of fans. An estimated 100,000 people turned up to his funeral in 1865, with his dog, Lion, as chief mourner. Highgate Cemetery, Swain's Lane, Highgate.

Kensal Green is among the most formal of great London cemeteries, but it still has tombs wacky enough to get the deads' net curtains twitching -- or so you imagine. The flamboyant Victorian circus owner Andrew Ducrow -- the so-called ""Colossus of Equestrians"" -- couldn't decide which classical theme he wanted on the family tomb, so he went for them all. Egyptian sphinxes jostle with Greek capitals and Roman tablets lean against Gothic angels in what Catharine Arnold describes as a ""suitably OTT monument to a larger than life showman."" The Builder magazine merely calls it ""ponderous coxcombery."" Kensal Green Cemetery, Harrow Road, Kensal Green; +44 208 969 0152 . William and Agnes Loudon: Six feet above . The immaculate graveyard of St. John the Baptist church in the London neighborhood of Pinner, a former hamlet, has its fair share of carved skulls and weathered inscriptions to once-cherished octogenarians -- and one very odd memorial. The legend holds that William Loudon and his wife, Agnes, inherited some money, but the bequest would end when they were buried. The obvious solution was to stick their coffin in an enormous stone wedge, making it practically impossible to bury -- and also quite difficult to look at. It was erected in 1809 by their son, John Loudon, later an influential voice in the cemetery-preservation movement. Pinner Parish Church, Church Lane, Pinner, Middlesex . Sir Richard Burton: Kama Sutra forever . Sir Richard Burton is best known for his saucy translations of ""The One Thousand and One Nights"" and for publishing ""The Kama Sutra"" in English. Although his wife, Isabel, a devout Catholic, claimed to be mortified by his interests, she appeared to celebrate them on his death by erecting a mausoleum in the shape of an Arabian tent in the incongruous surroundings of a suburban churchyard. Throughout the rest of her life, Isabel would take afternoon tea and hold the odd sÃ©ance inside the tomb before joining her husband in there on her own demise. Nosy visitors can peer through a window in the roof at two dusty coffins surrounded by lanterns, camel bells and murals of the night sky.

Many London cemeteries have a lion -- animals of all stripes are well represented in its graveyards -- but perhaps the most elegant has since 1912 slept in the jungle that is overgrown Abney Park in Stoke Newington. The beautiful stone-carved creature commemorates menagerist Frank Bostock, who traveled the world with big cats, occasionally branching out to camels and hyenas. ""People stroke the Abney Park lion's left paw for luck -- the marble is bright and shiny as a result,"" says Catharine Arnold. Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington High Street, Stoke Newington; +44 207 275 7557 . Thomas Hardy: The tree of death . Acclaimed author Thomas Hardy's first job, in the 1860s, was at St. Pancras Old Church, where he helped to exhume thousands of skeletons from the cemetery in the way of the new Midland Railway line. The bones were reburied, but Hardy was left with the gravestones. He got rid of some by stacking them around a young ash tree. Whether or not he meant the solution to be permanent, roots and stone are today completely fused. The ancient churchyard, once a haunt of grave robbers, is now one of the most peaceful places in busy St. Pancras. St Pancras Old Church, Pancras Road, London . Hannah Courtoy: The spinster's 'time machine' ""It looks like Dr. Who's TARDIS as designed by the architects of the Death Star,"" says author and publisher Mark Pilkington, who's been investigating time machine claims about the mysterious last resting place of three Victorian spinsters. Like so many 19th-century British tombs, this one in Brompton Cemetery is Egyptian in style. What distinguishes it are the strange hieroglyphic carvings and a twisted monogram on the door.

"(CNN) -- A Long Island man was arrested Friday after investigators say he attempted to travel to Yemen to join al Qaeda and conspired with the terror group from the United States, according to an indictment from the U.S. Department of Justice. Marcos Alonso Zea, 25, also known as ""Ali Zea,"" was arrested at his home in Brentwood, New York, on charges of conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country, attempting to provide material support to terrorists and obstruction and attempted obstruction of justice, the indictment says. Zea has been on the FBI's radar since 2011, when authorities said he began plotting a trip to Yemen to ""participate in violent jihad"" alongside al Qaeda, a Justice Department statement says. Customs officials in the United Kingdom detained him while he was en route to the Arabian Peninsula on January 4, 2012, and returned him to the U.S. After his failed attempt to travel to Yemen, Zea continued his involvement with al Qaeda, authorities said. Investigators monitored conversations between him and another Long Island man -- 18-year-old Justin Kaliebe -- in which the two discussed traveling to the Arabian Peninsula to participate in jihad. ""I just hope, my story, my, the event that happened to me will help you guys move forward, inspire you,"" the FBI recorded Zea saying to Kaliebe, who attempted to travel to Oman on January 21, 2013, and was detained while boarding a flight at John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to the indictment. Zea also allegedly provided money to Kaliebe for his trip. In February, Kaliebe pleaded guilty to attempting to provide support to terrorists, and he will be sentenced in December, according to Justice Department's statement. He could face up to 30 years in prison. Once Zea realized he was under investigation in April 2013, he allegedly asked an acquaintance to erase several computer hard drives that contained incriminating information, investigators said, but his attempts were not successful. ""Despite being born and raised in the United States, Zea allegedly betrayed his country,"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said of the arrest. ""Aspirants with lethal intent who seek terror training abroad are of paramount concern,"" New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Zea is set to be arraigned Friday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Arlene Lindsay at the Federal Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, the Justice Department's statement said. Lynch has written a letter to the court requesting that Zea be held without bail.","Marcos Alonso Zea, known as ""Ali Zea,"" is arrested at his Brentwood home .

"Washington (CNN) -- With a series of potential disasters hovering over the nation like a demon storm, the most prominent words of a Washington-based word cloud would be: government shutdown, continuing resolution, debt limit and Obamacare. Although a potential shutdown and the need to raise the debt limit are different issues, they are interrelated and have one big thing in common: They are both products of a crisis manufactured by Washington. And both are being used for leverage in attempts to undermine Obamacare. So, what's the difference between them and why should you care? Government shutdown: Again? Seriously? First up, the shutdown . The federal government's fiscal year starts next week -- October 1. And Congress' one key duty laid out in the Constitution is to pass spending bills that fund the government. If it doesn't, most of the functions of the government -- from paying the military to funding small business loans to collecting the trash in Washington -- could come to a slow-motion halt. It shuts down. This time around, the House of Representatives, led by conservative Republicans, has linked this funding process -- known as a continuing resolution -- to defunding President Barack Obama's signature health insurance law, the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. It passed its bill last Friday and sent it to the Senate. This week, the Senate is expected to strip out the anti-Obamacare provision and pass its own ""clean"" version of the bill -- and then the drama begins. But more on that in a minute. What's important here is that if Congress doesn't pass the $986 billion continuing resolution, or CR, in the next week, the national parks could close, airport Transportation Security Agents might get furloughed and agents might be unable to process Social Security checks. 10 ways a government shutdown would affect your daily life . Next crisis, the debt limit . Remember that time when you maxed out your credit card? That's what the debt limit is all about. The U.S. is on the verge of maxing out its $16.699 trillion credit card. A maxed-out credit card doesn't mean you can stop spending. While you have to pay your credit card bill, you also have to continue to buy groceries and pay the electric bill, so you might have to open up a new credit card. That's similar to what the U.S. government must do. The government can't just stop paying on its previous debt or spending money, even though its credit limit is maxed out, because it has too many obligations to meet. It has to have access to money to pay for the interest on that debt, as well as pay soldiers' paychecks, doctors' Medicare reimbursements, expenses like bridge repairs, and so on. So the president must ask Congress to raise the limit of the country's credit card, or debt limit. But many think Republicans in Congress may also try to link raising the debt limit to defunding Obamacare. Sound familiar? Sometime around the middle of October -- unless Congress votes to raise the debt limit -- the U.S. government will be out of options. This past spring it already implemented ""extraordinary measures"" where accounts were reshuffled to enable the U.S. to continue paying its bills. But this time, once the debt limit is reached, there are no other tricks Treasury can use. It won't be able to meet 30% of its obligations, according to a report by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Although the government won't ""shut down,"" many say the consequences would be much, much worse. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew predicted that impacts on the global and local economy would be ""catastrophic."" While the U.S. operates at a deficit, the rest of the world purchases U.S. debt. It's considered one of the safest investments around, because it is believed that the U.S. will always pay its bills. But what if it doesn't? The U.S. will no longer be considered ""the most reliable creditor in the world,"" said Shai Akabas, senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center. In addition to potential financial panic because the most stable investment will no longer be considered safe, individual investors, hedge fund managers, other countries -- those who own U.S. Treasurys -- could start to turn to other countries for investments, and interest rates on Treasurys would start to increase. That means the benefits that U.S. consumers enjoy, including low interest rates on home loans, credit cards and business loans, would begin to erode. Fast. At home, it would also be devastating. That 80-year-old woman who relies on her Social Security check to pay her rent might not get paid. That means her landlord won't get paid. The doctor who sees Medicare patients won't get reimbursed, so he might not purchase that new flat-screen TV he was planning on buying next month. The government contractor who is owed for providing food at military bases won't get paid, and she will have to lay off line cooks. Obviously, this could be very, very bad. That's why each side thinks the other will blink on Obamacare to avoid such a calamity. What happens if the government shuts down . So what does Obamacare have to do with any of this? In short: a lot. While the health care law is not directly tied to funding the government -- the CR -- or paying bills already incurred -- the debt ceiling -- it is being used as a powerful bargaining chip. A group of Republicans, led by freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, despises the health care law so much that it is willing to risk government shutdown or default. While 41 previous attempts to repeal, defund or stop the law haven't worked, the group hopes efforts to link it to these two pieces of must-pass legislation will. That's why there's talk of a government shutdown. The House, which is controlled by Republicans, voted on a measure that would fund the government until December 15 -- but in exchange for keeping the government open, the health care law would be defunded. But the Democrat-controlled Senate vows that Obamacare defunding will have no part in efforts to keep the government running and is expected to strip that provision out of its version of the CR sometime this week. Cruz and his supporters aren't backing down. And neither is the president. ""I believe we should stand our ground, and I don't believe (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid or Barack Obama should shut down the federal government,"" Cruz said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""The House voted last week to fund the federal government. If Harry Reid kills that, Harry Reid is responsible for shutting down the government."" But many within the Republican Party think Cruz's idea is a terrible one. While Republicans have successfully extracted budget cuts from recent battles over government funding and the debt ceiling, most understand that a political poison pill like this is unlikely to succeed. Democrats control the Senate with their 54-seat majority. ""We are not about to shut the government down over the fact that we cannot -- only controlling one house of Congress -- tell the president that we are not going to fund any portion of this, because we can't do that,"" Sen. Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" If Democrats win the battle over government funding and Obamacare stays intact, Republicans indicated they will make similar demands when the president asks to raise the debt limit. But Obama has repeated numerous times that he will not negotiate on the debt limit either. ""We will not negotiate whether or not America should keep its word and meet its obligations. We're not going to allow anyone to inflict economic pain on millions of our own people just to make an ideological point,"" Obama said at the Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner this past weekend. And even if Cruz and his supporters somehow overcame the Democrat-controlled Senate and successfully sent a bill to the president's desk that defunds Obamacare, would Obama really sign a bill that guts his signature legislative achievement? And so we have the showdown.","The federal government is facing a potential government shutdown next week .

"(CNN) -- Alex Caizergues toasts danger with a glass of bubbly in one hand and a clenched fist in the other. The Frenchman has good reason to celebrate after smashing the World Sailing Speed Kitesurfing record over 500 meters, reaching an average speed of 56.62 knots (104.8 kph). The record was officially confirmed by the World Sailing Speed Record Council on Thursday. ""This record was something else,"" the ecstatic 34-year-old told CNN earlier in November. ""It was fantastic."" Facing fierce winds and unrelenting waves, Caizergues beat the previous record set by American Rob Douglas by 0.97 knots -- an effort achieved in a sport where danger is always lurking. ""It's an action sport, so of course, it can be dangerous,"" said Caizergues, who celebrated his achievement with a glass of champagne.. ""It's as dangerous as any other sport like cycling and you have to be careful not to make any mistakes because it can end with bad injuries. ""I've been lucky and only had one bad injury, which came in competition last season."" Ask Caizergues about his latest achievement and he gives a Gallic shrug and a small laugh, but this is no minor achievement for the Provencal-born star who has hunted down record after record. In 2010 he became the first man to break through the 100km/hr barrier -- an achievement which earned him no shortage of recognition. His latest triumph came in the salt marshes of Salin-de-Giraud where he was carried along by the Mistral -- a fierce cold wind which blows toward the Mediterranean Sea from the uplands in southern France. The wind speed can often reach up to 130km - making it the ideal place for breaking records. ""It is a very strong and powerful wind,"" added the Frenchman. ""It blows really hard. We had speeds of 55 knots sometimes. The wind can be really wild and you have to be careful. ""We've had days when its almost 60 knots and that can be too much."" After taking up the sport 12 years ago, Caizergues has excelled by winning three world titles and two national championships and he now plans to break more records. But before that, he plans a celebration -- or two -- with that champagne. ""The team have worked with me throughout this record and they deserve to celebrate,"" he added. ""Everyone has worked so hard to make this happen and I want to enjoy it with them.""","Alex Caizergues sets new world speed kitesurfing record .

"(CNN) -- An Oakland, California, police officer critically injured in one of two Saturday shootings that killed three fellow officers was pronounced brain dead on Sunday, a police spokesman told CNN. Clockwise from top left: John Hege, Sgt. Daniel Sakai, Sgt. Ervin Romans and Sgt. Mark Dunakin. Initially, Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason said John Hege, 41, was the fourth officer to die after a man being pulled over in a traffic stop opened fire and then battled SWAT officers at a nearby building Saturday.

"(CNN) -- Saudis have been awaiting October 26 anxiously. Organizers of an online campaign are hoping the date will mark a turning point in the history of Saudi Arabia, as women across the kingdom take their husbands, brothers or fathers' car keys and drive themselves across town in a show of independence, defiance and solidarity. While the issue of women driving is an important one in and of itself, some Saudis view it as just the latest in a series of struggles that have shaped the political trajectory of Saudi Arabia. These confrontations have pitted those who've embraced modernity and accepted the need for reform against ultra-religious and social conservatives who see most change as inherently destructive and as a ""deviation"" from the ""straight path"" of Islam. In fact, according to some conservative elements, Saudis should strive to emulate the traditions set by the forbearers of Islam who lived some 1,400 years ago, for it was they who practiced the ""correct"" Islam. Why Saudi Arabia can't ban women from driving forever . It was not by chance that the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, stressed Islamic mores, precepts and traditions as he brought the disparate regions of the Arabian peninsula under his political control; a process that took 30 years to complete. Ironically, it was the founder himself who first began the balancing act which tried to reconcile the ever-changing needs of a new nation with the instinctual rejection of change that some conservatives continue to display. The story of how the king convinced conservatives to accept radio wave technology is the stuff of legends. Upon hearing that some critics were convinced that the king's own private radio network must be inspired by the ""devil,"" the king came up with an ingenious plan: he made them listen to the radio as it beamed the Islamic call to prayer being made by someone several miles away. This segment of Saudi society, the size of which is difficult to determine, has resisted the introduction of just about everything people associate with modernity. Radio, the car, television and even girls' education and the Internet were all considered by some as a sinister attempts to erode the Islamic mores and the equally important tribal ethos of Saudi Arabia. Those opposing the right of women to drive are making the same arguments today. Not only did dozens of clerics hold a protest outside King Abdullah's palace in Jeddah to express their disapproval of any moves to lift the ban, but a lesser known cleric who fancies himself a modern-day Avicenna tried a more scientific approach when he claimed that driving does irreparable damage to a woman's ovaries! While some conservatives' protestations border on the comical, some ultra-conservatives have tried to forcibly steer back Saudi Arabia to the ""right path,"" as when militants stormed the Grand Mosque in Mecca in November 1979 and declared the coming of the Muslim equivalent of the Messiah. The irony is that their claim to defend Islam and uphold its strictures actually resulted in the deaths of dozens of Muslims and violated the sanctity of Islam's most hallowed ground. So how has the government managed to push through reforms that were advocated by progressive Saudis that they deemed necessary for a modern state to function in the face of such resistance? They compromised. When radio was introduced, authorities ensured it broadcast hours of religious programming. The same was true with television, which came under more scrutiny because of the visual images it beamed into people's living rooms. When the government introduced girls' education, it initially did so in limited areas of the more cosmopolitan region of Hejaz and then made sure that girls were segregated from boys when education went national. The same approach applied to the Internet, which is now widely available but heavily censored and increasingly monitored. Periodically, authorities have cracked down on staunch conservatives whose opposition to reforms bordered on incitement to violence and on some of the more outspoken advocates of reform who have argued that the government placates conservatives' demands to serve its own political ends and crossed well established red lines. Although some reform advocates do call for sweeping changes and their swift implementation, many more advise gradual reform. They argue that the tumult that accompanied the Arab Spring and the incredibly difficult transition that some nations are currently undergoing are proof that measured, incremental reforms are less likely to be destabilizing. The problem with the ban on women driving however is that it can't really be implemented gradually and therefore compromises will be difficult. No one is advocating that the ban be lifted only in certain regions or cities nor has anyone recommended that women be limited to driving at certain times of the day and rightly so. For its part, the government has issued a warning that seems aimed at both advocates and opponents of this issue, enjoining them not to ""disturb the public peace."" It will be interesting to see whether October 26 tilts the balance in favor of one camp over the other. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fahad Nazer.","Saudi women are preparing to defy a ban in the kingdom on women driving .

"(CNN) -- For a legendary gambler who thinks nothing of betting a million dollars on one horse, Irish businessman JP McManus is by all accounts a surprisingly reserved man. From humble beginnings as a bookmaker, McManus earned a reputation as the fearless man on the track who would take on any wager -- no matter how big. ""He's an absolute legend. He's got balls of steel when it comes to placing bets,"" says Barry Orr, spokesman for Betfair, the world's biggest online betting exchange. Now worth an estimated $1 billion, the 62-year-old property mogul and horse owner was a big player at this week's Cheltenham Festival -- one of the biggest betting events in the Britain. Described as the ""Olympics of jumps racing,"" more than $820 million is bet during the four-day festival, with many punters taking their lead from the almost-mythical McManus. ""McManus is a legendary figure because of how brave he is,"" Ladbrokes bookmaker David Williams says. ""He's one of those faces that when he walks into a betting ring, everyone is wondering what he's going to do. ""But you'd never believe he's such a big, brazen better -- he's very polite, very unassuming, a real gentlemen."" Nicknamed the ""Sundance Kid"" for his bold gambling, McManus famously won $1.3 million in just one day at Cheltenham in 2006, in series of wagers with similarly daring bookmaker ""Fearless"" Freddie Williams. As Cheltenham wraps up for another year on Friday, CNN's Winning Post takes a look at five of the most incredible horse racing betting stories of all time. Stable boy-turned-millionaire . This time last year, 29-year-old Conor Murphy was a stable boy -- until one lucky bet at Cheltenham changed his life forever. The Irishman could have been accused of letting his heart rule his head when he bet $75 on all five of his boss's horses winning. But Murphy happily proved the skeptics wrong, scooping $1.5 million in an accumulator -- a single bet which relies on all horses winning. Murphy placed the wager online three months before the race, giving him greater odds -- and greater returns -- than those betting on the day. The huge windfall helped finance his lifelong ambition of working as a trainer in Louisville, home of the prestigious Kentucky Derby, he told British newspaper The Telegraph. Against the odds . If ever there was an opportunity to step back in time and place a bet, it would surely be on the Kentucky Derby's 1913 winner Donerail. The three-year-old colt remains the highest odds winner in the history of the race, placed at 91-1, said the Kentucky Derby Museum. One hundred years ago, those putting $2 on Donerail would have collected $184.90 in winnings. By today's standards, it's roughly the equivalent of placing a $46 bet and getting $4,300 back. Surprise winner Donerail pulled away at the last stretch, setting a new track record with a time of two minutes and four seconds, beating his nearest rival by half-a-length. It was a rare victory for the thoroughbred, who won just 10 of his 62 races. The biggest loser . Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer wasn't known as ""The Big Fella"" of gambling for nothing, famously halving betting odds in a matter of minutes with his million-dollar wagers. Packer, who had an estimated fortune of $6.7 billion at the time of his death in 2005, was a legendary figure on the track who struggled to find individual bookmakers with enough money to take him on. In the late 1980s a consortium of Sydney bookmakers joined forces to accept Packer's awesome bets, which could be around $5 million on a single race. But the bookmakers were rubbing their hands at Sydney's Golden Slipper Stakes in 1987 when Packer lost around $7 million throughout the day -- including $2 million on his own horse, called Christmas Tree -- reported Melbourne newspaper The Age. Dettori's magnificent seven . In 1996, jockey Frankie Dettori left bookmakers in tears after defying 25,000-1 odds of winning all seven races at Britain's Ascot Festival. The Italian rider got the record-breaking day underway with a win on the aptly named three-year-old colt, Wall Street. One lucky punter, Darren Yeats, placed a £59 ($89) accumulator bet on all of Dettori's races -- despite being warned off by his wife. But the bold gamble paid off and Yeats left the track £550,000 ($830,000) richer. ""The atmosphere in the winners' enclosure was amazing,"" Nick Smith, head of public relations at Ascot, told CNN. ""We actually had champagne for him after the sixth win, and then after the seventh the whole place just erupted."" Five years later, Ascot erected a lifesize bronze statue of the jockey at the entrance of the famous racecourse, in honor of his historic wins. A Dream Come True . It's become one of the fabled wins in horse racing history -- and the elusive dream that lingers in the back of every punter's mind. It started with a horse called Isn't That Lucky and ended with one called A Dream Come True, for one lucky punter from Yorkshire in Britain. In 2008, the unnamed man placed just 75 cents on eight horses winning in an accumulator bet, said the BBC. Despite the 2,000,000-1 odds, every horse won, granting the gambler a whopping $1.5 million windfall. He became the first person in Britain to win £1 million ($1.5 million) in a betting shop.","Legendary billionaire gambler JP McManus big player at Cheltenham .

"(CNN) -- You know what's relatively easy? Fixing a website. You know what's really hard? Ensuring access to affordable, quality health insurance for every single American and improving our broken health care system in the process. In the back-and-forth about the Obamacare exchange websites, let's not lose sight of the ultimate goal of health care reform -- a goal that, even with the exchanges problems, we are steadily achieving. Less than 17 days into the signup period, the State of Oregon had already enrolled 56,000 people under the Medicaid expansion in Obamacare -- and reduced the state's percentage of uninsured by 10%. In New York, over 150,000 people have signed up for a private insurance plan through the state's exchange website -- including, by the way, me. In Kentucky, a state that has more than 640,000 residents without health insurance, the state insurance exchange is signing up 1,000 people per day, ""a great rate and a great success so far"" says Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear. In Washington State, 31,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid coverage, 4,500 have enrolled in private health plans and an additional 56,000 state residents have completed applications. Other states, especially those that worked to implement their own insurance exchanges and expand Medicaid under the health reform law, are seeing similar success -- contrasted with those states that have, mainly for ideological reasons, sabotaged implementation. And even still, the increased access to insurance through private market exchanges and Medicaid expansion is only one aspect of the larger reform law. Already, 3.4 million young Americans have been able to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26. Already, millions of Americans have benefited from the ban on insurance companies denying coverage because of preexisting conditions, a ban that will take full effect next year. Already, we're all benefiting from the law ending lifetime and annual limits on the amount of coverage health insurance provides, and ending the practice of insurance companies' arbitrarily canceling coverage in the wake of catastrophic illness. The Obamacare exchange websites can run fast as lightning or slow as molasses but, regardless, these reforms are already helping millions of Americans automatically. No hitting reset required. It's also helpful to put the exchange websites into some perspective. We're a little over one-tenth of the way through the current enrollment period. People have until December 15 to complete their applications if they want coverage to begin on January 1, 2014. And then we all have until February 15, 2014 to enroll in private insurance coverage before being subject to the individual mandate penalty. According to psychology studies, 20% of Americans are chronic procrastinators. At least 95% of Americans say they procrastinate regularly. Plus, to be clear, picking among multiple health insurance options is a bit more complicated than buying a new T-shirt. So if millions of Americans are waiting until the last second to enroll in Obamacare, we shouldn't just chalk that up to the law's failure or website problems but to inevitable human nature. The good news is, by the time most people seeking insurance get around to enrolling, whether by December 15 or February 15, the website kinks will undoubtedly have long been ironed out. eBay wasn't built in a day. And neither was any major government initiative. From Social Security to Medicare to the Peace Corps to the income tax, other significant government programs were initially as overrun with snafus as they were with critiques. But eventually, employers figured out how to include workers' names and Social Security numbers in their earnings reports and the website for Medicare Part D was successfully debugged. A few geeks locked in a room with a case of Mountain Dew will fix the Obamacare websites. But all the computer programmers and pundits and conservative nay-sayers in the land couldn't fix the fact that, three years ago, our health care costs were skyrocketing, tens of millions of Americans lacked health insurance and 14,000 more were losing their coverage every day. We needed a law to fix that. Thankfully, we now have one. And whatever the ups and downs of the websites, the Affordable Care Act is working. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: Health exchange site fix is easy; getting Americans covered is hard .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Raymond strengthened into a hurricane Sunday off Mexico's Pacific Coast, threatening to dump heavy rains. A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning were in effect from Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana, according to the National Hurricane Center. A hurricane warning was issued for Tecpan de Galeana to Lazaro Cardenas. As of Sunday night, Raymond was 155 miles west-southwest of Acapulco. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, with higher gusts, and was moving north at 6 mph. Raymond strengthened rapidly and was expected to continue to strengthen. The storm is forecast to near the coast within the hurricane warning area late Monday or Tuesday. It is predicted it will take a sharp turn west before it has a chance to reach land, the hurricane center said. Raymond is forecast to dump heavy rain along the south-central coast of Mexico, with between 2 to 4 inches and up to 8 over the state of Guerrero. The area was hit hard by another storm in September. The previous storm, Manuel, triggered deadly mudslides and left about 40,000 tourists stranded in Acapulco, a popular tourist destination.","NEW: A hurricane warning is in effect for Tecpan de Galeana to Lazaro Cardenas .

"(CNN) -- As Afghan President Hamid Karzai's calculated and risky backtracking on the U.S.-Afghan security agreement puts him on a collision course with most Afghans, the United States needs to demonstrate patience, take the Afghan public's side and be tactful at a sensitive time in a highly volatile part of the world. Observers describe Karzai's actions as erratic, arrogant or impulsive. Others suggest that he be ignored or bypassed. To some, he seems to be displaying signs of exhaustion and irrationality. These views miscast Karzai's motives and miss the point of his tactical political maneuvering. He is engaging in canny clan-style brinksmanship. Karzai's instincts are shaped by his place in history. He is bargaining with the United States over a popular deal to allow up to 15,000 foreign troops to remain in Afghanistan after the formal end of combat operations in 2014. What lies at the heart of his aggressive posturing is the future of his family's political and financial interests after his second term ends in 2014. That strategy has also been markedly shaped by 12 long and strenuous years of Machiavellian exploits, insecurity and frustration with his Western backers. But, Afghans, wary of Karzai's strategy and mindful of their destiny after 2014, are not in a mood to tolerate such antics so late in the game. As international forces start ending their decade-long combat mission, foreign aid is shrinking considerably and Afghan security forces are tested by a nagging proxy war with the Taliban. Most Afghans are not only concerned about the future, but also about preserving the gains of the past 12 years in education, health, gender rights, media, entrepreneurship and even political freedoms. For its part, Washington needs to be mindful of the stakes and not fall into Karzai's trap. Arm-twisting is neither advised nor helpful at this stage as Afghans exert increasing pressure at home to make the President think twice about his responsibilities and priorities. Anxieties are running high about Karzai's last-minute wheeling-and-dealing and domestic and regional spoilers are sharpening their knives, hoping to see the back of the Americans and NATO departing South Central Asia for good next year if the agreement is not signed. If it's not signed and foreign troops must withdraw completely, the situation is ripe for terrorist outfits to create and fill a security vacuum. It will be hard for needy Afghan forces to defend against these groups without strong logistical and financial backing. Training, advising and assisting the Afghan military and police forces over the next decade are essential elements for assuring long-term stability in the country and in fending off extremism and terrorism. Failure to sign the bilateral security agreement will diminish international commitments, lower business confidence and exacerbate an already significant economic crunch in Afghanistan. This does not mean that the Afghans, including Karzai, should blindly agree to Western terms. Karzai's frustration to a large part stems from the inability -- perhaps unwillingness -- of Western forces to confront terrorists and extremists who are based in cross-border sanctuaries, with the exception of al Qaeda and, lately, outfits like the notorious Haqqani network. The duality apparent in Islamabad between ""good"" and ""bad"" Taliban -- those who are protected as strategic proxies and those they fight -- has increased mistrust between Afghanistan and Pakistan, despite Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's recent day-long visit to Kabul. Karzai is traveling to Iran and India in the next few days to have a heart-to-heart with regional heavyweights, some of whom -- like Iran - are not too keen on seeing a continued American presence in the region. Regional politics aside, the root cause of Karzai's apparent insecurity lies in Afghan domestic politics. He wants to be kingmaker in next April's presidential ballot, but also master of the larger endgame that might involve certain Taliban elements who, in his mind, would agree to a political deal. The Taliban are also cashing in on Karzai's gamble. In an unprecedented move, they issued a statement Monday praising his stance on the security agreement and refrained from calling him an ""American puppet"" for the first time. Some have suggested the unlikely but not impossible scenario that Karzai may exploit the uncertainty to either delay elections or call for a state of emergency and take the country down an unsteady path. But Karzai has indicated that he would not interfere in the electoral process, knowing that would shatter his legacy, leave him stranded and cornered by all sides, with the exception of the armed militants. Instead, it is more likely that Karzai's latest risky gambit is more about style than substance; the subtle touch has never been his strong suit. Whether these last resort overtures will open any doors to a just and peaceful settlement or help his side with the upcoming elections has yet to be determined, but at least he will be able to make a case that he did not toe the U.S. line. It is a major gamble that could backfire if U.S. patience runs out or if other regional players increase their pressure through their proxies to put him off guard or disrupt elections. Complications could also arise if he is courted too warmly by the anti-security agreement circles inside and outside Afghanistan, at the detriment of the majority pro-agreement population. The United States should spell out its own red lines but be flexible with demands that are not deal-breakers. Afghans have given Hamid Karzai the benefit of doubt for many years, but their leader's overall record has been patchy at best. People are openly advocating reform and are concerned about the rise of entrenched cliques backed by the President that appear intent on holding the country hostage and manipulating the elections in their favor. The donor community needs to reassure the Afghan people in the face of these fears and extend the hand of friendship that has generated Afghan support for a continued international presence in the country. This can be best achieved by continuing to promote democratic governance, assist in the buildup of the Afghan national forces to help fight terrorism, protect women's advances and invest in the young and entrepreneurial.

"London (CNN) -- In a YouTube video produced by activists from #SupportYemen, a Yemeni civil society organisation, in March 2013, an interviewer asks people in Yemen's capital Sanaa what they think of their forthcoming national dialogue. They give a range of well thought-out answers, ranging from tempered optimism to near-total pessimism. The video cuts to a woman at the side of a dirt road near Hodeidah, one of Yemen's biggest industrial cities. ""We are hungry and we need jobs,"" she tells the blogger and activist Atiaf Alwazir: . The National Dialogue Conference, a six-month series of talks that should lead to the creation of a new constitution for the Arab World's poorest country, is aimed at closing the gap between the country's small military and tribal elite and ordinary people. The talks started on 18 March, and are the most inclusive political process Yemen has ever seen, bringing together established political players with southern separatists, Zaydi Shia Houthi rebels and youth activists. Read more: Yemen holds presidential election with one candidate . The conference was due to come to an end on 18 September, but has been held up by wrangling between members of a working group looking at ways to address the grievances of the country's marginalized south. Yemen's poor people -- around half the country's population -- do not have much of a voice at the talks. Like the woman in the video, many do not even know what the dialogue is. Instead, they are scrambling to make enough money to eat. If, as looks increasingly likely, the country's next government is made up of members of the elite who profited from the regime of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, their situation is unlikely to improve anytime soon. Yemen's poverty problem is not new. Even before the political crisis of 2011, well over 40% of the country's population lived below the poverty line while more than a third of all people aged 18-25 were unemployed, according to the World Bank. The protests, elite violence and ensuing security vacuum in 2011 caused the already weak economy to implode. By the end of the year, more than half the country's population lived below the poverty line, a study conducted by the Yemeni government and international agencies found. The situation has stabilized since 2011, and hundreds of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid has flowed into the country, meaning that the hunger crisis will be kept at bay for at least another year or two -- but not that living standards among the country's poor are likely to improve substantially at any point in the near future. With Yemen's population growing at 2.3% a year, (again according to the World Bank), and oil -- the source of 70% of government revenues -- running out, Yemen's economy needs a massive shake-up. The government needs to become less reliant on oil and to help build a diversified economy which provides a wide range of jobs for Yemenis, who in turn must be better educated (more than two thirds of all adults are illiterate) and healthier. Some of these issues were addressed during the dialogue conference: a working group at the talks tasked with producing recommendations on Yemenis' basic rights called in July for the state to provide at least a basic level of education and healthcare along with guaranteed welfare payments to the country's poor. But the question is how future governments are going to pay for any expansion in government services and welfare payments. In 2013, the country's transitional government passed not just the biggest budget in Yemen's history, but also its biggest deficit, of about $3.2bn. Most of the $12.9bn total spending package went to wages and overheads, with fuel subsidies in particular due to cost the government $3.5bn, or 8.5% of all economic output, in 2013 according to the IMF. The kind of deficits the government has been running up are simply unsustainable in the long-run, especially if oil output continues to decline. Falling oil production hits not just government revenues, but the volume of foreign currency coming into Yemen, which in turn helps prop up the value of the Yemeni Riyal and pay the country's import bill (Yemen is hugely import-dependent: some 95% of wheat and 100% of rice, staples in the national diet, are imported, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization). A fall in the value of the Riyal would push up the cost of living, hurting living standards among the poor even more. There are no quick fixes to these problems, but a good place to start would be the fuel subsidy. As the IMF notes in its most recent note on Yemen, the subsidies ""are not targeted and create major economic distortions and opportunities for corruption"". They benefit mainly the richest Yemenis, who consume the most fuel and electricity, encourage unnecessary consumption, and create huge opportunities for smuggling. The subsidy also encourages the use of diesel pumps to produce water, another huge problem for one of the most water insecure countries on the planet. Plans have been in place to cut the fuel subsidy and spend the savings on welfare and growth-boosting infrastructure projects since the mid-1990s. But each time someone actually tries to increase the cost of fuel and redirect spending towards the poor they meet huge resistance from established political, economic and tribal players. This is because Yemen's economic problems are equally political. In our new Chatham House report, ""Yemen: Corruption, Capital Flight and Global Drivers of Conflict,"" we argue that Yemen's former president Ali Abdullah Saleh used a huge system of patronage, involving everything from diesel allocations to access to military budgets and state contracts, to foster co-operation among members of the country's small tribal, economic, and military elite. This system ultimately benefited a small number of people and helped Saleh mitigate the threat of major internal conflict, but at the same time meant that the country's elite were enriched at the cost of development that benefited the wider public. Reforms like subsidy cuts ran counter to elite interests and so were impossible to implement. The levels of corruption seen in Yemen wouldn't have hurt the country quite so badly if the proceeds were being spent at home. But increasingly, they are not. Yemen's elite has invested their money abroad in property and other ventures, or left it nestled in secrecy jurisdictions far beyond the prying eyes of the Yemeni public. In our report we argue that when elections are held in 2014 the same people who took part in the Saleh-era system of patronage and corruption are likely to be in charge once again and that they will continue to be incentivized by self-interest rather than any sense of the greater good. Despite the rhetoric around the transition, they still control the government, the army, the tribes and the bulk of the Yemen's economic resources. New faces may appear, but their ability to implement the kind of economic reforms Yemen needs will be limited, as has become clear over the course of the transition, with the country's 'unity' government achieving little in the way of reform. As the transition period comes to an end over the coming months and new elections are held, there is likely to be a degree of self-congratulation among those who brokered the deal that led Saleh to step down in November 2011, avoiding the prospect of civil war. But if the transition is to be a success, the needs of ordinary people will have to be taken into account. The activists who took to the street over the course of 2011 must be supported in their quest for more transparent and accountable governance. And the voice of Yemen's poor must be heard. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Peter Salisbury.","Yemen's economic problems are equally political, Peter Salisbury writes .
The government needs to provide a wider range of jobs for Yemenis .
To succeed, the voice of Yemen's poor must be heard, he says ."

"(CNN) -- Sultry singer Ke$ha is known for her party anthems about binge drinking and dating. And maybe that was the reason Malaysian authorities pulled the plug on her concert set for Saturday at a Kuala Lumpur stadium. But whatever the reason for the show cancellation, Ke$ha wasn't happy about it. The singer took to Twitter to defend herself. ""To be clear. I did NOT cancel. I was not allowed to play. and then I was going to play anyways and was threatened with imprisonment,"" she wrote from her official Twitter account. Officials at Malaysia's ministry of communications and multimedia could not immediately be reached for comment. Promoters Livescape Asia said they tried to comply with Malaysian rules. They even worked with the artist to ""modify the show to suit the Malaysian culture and sensitivities, including having made adjustments to her song lyrics, wardrobe changes, and a set list that was modified to specifically adhere to the guidelines set forth by the authorities,"" the promoters said. The promoters said the decision to cancel the show could cost them more than $350,000. This is not the first time Ke$ha has dealt with a form of censorship. Last year, after an elementary school mass shooting in Connecticut that left 20 children dead, some radio stations temporarily stopped playing Ke$ha's popular song ""Die Young.""

"(CNN) -- The retrial of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resumed behind closed doors Saturday, state-run MENA news agency reported. Former intelligence and national security officials took the stand in the hearing. The autocratic strongman, who ruled Egypt for three decades with the military's support, faces charges involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 uprising that led to his ouster. Mubarak was convicted on the charges last year and sentenced to life in prison, but appealed the ruling and was granted a retrial. A court ordered him released in August and placed under house arrest while he awaits the retrial. A hearing scheduled for September was canceled. Mubarak, 85, had been held since shortly after he was removed from power. The ousted autocratic leader's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had said that he was physically unfit to stand trial. He has since appeared to be alert at his court appearances. Morsy trial . Mubarak's democratically elected successor, former President Mohamed Morsy, is scheduled to face trial in two weeks over the deaths of protesters killed during his own ouster. Morsy and his Islamist Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, had ridden into office in the wake of the popular uprising that pushed Mubarak out of power. But Morsy became unpopular with many Egyptians who feared the he would institute autocratic Islamist rule. Critics complained that the country's new constitution was pushed through by a one-sided committee. Human rights groups criticized Morsy's government over alleged human rights abuses, accusing it of hindering freedom of the press and keeping abusive structures in place from the Mubarak government. But Human Rights Watch also said that the rights abuses under Morsy did not compare with those committed under Mubarak's rule. The deterioration of Egypt's economy and a marked rise in crime and disorder contributed to the widespread dissatisfaction with Morsy's government. In a coup, Egypt's military forcibly deposed Morsy in July after a popular uprising against him and has detained him ever since. The fallout . Multitudes of Morsy's supporters filled the streets to demand his reinstatement into office. Hundreds have died in clashes with security forces. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. The United States cut hundred of millions of dollars in military aid to Egypt out of protest over the coup against Morsy and the bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters.","The former strongman was convicted of involvement in the killing of hundreds of protesters .

"(CNN) -- Right now, it's nothing more than an empty plot of land, covered by just a few shrubs and the odd Neem tree. But within a few years, these grass plains just outside Accra, Ghana, could be transformed into a fertile breeding ground for world-class innovation. Earlier this month, Ghanaian president John Mahama launched Hope City, a $10 billion high-tech hub aiming to foster technological growth and attract major players in the global ICT industry to the West African country. The ambitious project is the brainchild of Ghanaian businessman Roland Agambire, head of local technology group RLG Communications. Smart and futuristic, the hub's sustainable facilities will include an assembly plant for various tech products, business offices, an IT university and a hospital, as well as housing and recreation spaces, including restaurants, theaters and sports centers. ""What is lacking in the African continent is a place where you can have well-designed products, backed with concrete research and proper hardware and software developers to be able to create infrastructure for the telecoms industry,"" says Agambire, 39, whose company has acquired the land where the technopolis will be built. ""So the inspiration behind Hope City is to have an iconic ICT park where ICT players from all over the world can converge to design, fabricate and export software and everything arising from this country,"" he adds. Read this: Why tech innovators are Africa's future . Construction is expected to begin by June 2013 and when completed -- within three years, if everything goes as planned -- the technology park could house 25,000 residents and create jobs for 50,000 people. Agambire, one of Ghana's top businessmen, says his company is financing 30% of the project, while the remainder will be funded by a wide array of investors and through a stock-buying scheme. The entrepreneur says the IT hub has already attracted several partners, including Microsoft, with Microsoft corporate vice president Ali Faramawy among the guests at the Hope City launch event. Agambire adds that the Hope City project also has the support of the Ghanaian government, as it aims to create create thousands of jobs and help turn technology into one of the country's main economic drivers. ""What we want to do is to create the environment and the human resource base for the technology industry to be able to use that [environment] and tap that opportunity,"" he says. ""That's what has happened in China, that's what has happened in other places of the world."" 'Africa's highest tower' Hope City will be developed in an area of about 1.5 million square meters, located some 30 minutes west of Accra's city center. Designed by Italian firm Architect OBR, the technopolis will be made up of six towers of different dimensions, including a 75-story, 270 meter-high building that is expected to be the highest in Africa. A system of bridges at different heights will link the towers together, creating a circular connection between the buildings' functions and public amenities. OBR co-founder Paolo Brescia says the project's goal is to create a living place of discovery and exploration that reflects the tradition and culture of local people in a contemporary urban setting. Read this: Africa's 'father of technology' To achieve this, the architects designed Hope City with Ghana's traditional compound houses in mind. Originally made of mud brick walls and thatched roofs, compound structures have been a prevalent form of housing in the country for centuries, built to promote communal life and mutual assistance. ""We wanted to recreate, at a different scale, the same feeling of the compound house in a way that it could work as a compound cluster,"" explains Brescia. ""This place is designed to keep people together,"" he adds. ""We developed this idea, not as a campus, where you have buildings which are dedicated to single functions, but as a city which is developed in a vertical way so that everything could be interconnected."" 'ICT revolution' The launch of Hope City comes just a few months after Kenya broke ground on its own flagship tech mega project; located some 60 kilometers southeast of the capital Nairobi, Konza Techno City is being touted as ""Africa's Silicon Savannah,"" a major IT hub that aims to create some 100,000 jobs by 2030. Kenya has already experienced a major IT boom in recent years, spurred in part by a surge in the number of innovation centers, such as Nairobi-based iHub, which enable young coders and aspiring entrepreneurs to collaborate, network and develop their trailblazing ideas. Read this: How 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future . Similar spaces have also mushroomed across Africa in recent years, from Egypt and Nigeria to Tanzania and Madagascar. In Ghana, one such center is Accra-based Mobile Web Ghana, a vibrant tech space with more than 300 members. Florence Toffa, director of Mobile Web Ghana, welcomes the launch of Hope City. ""This city hopefully will bring the tech companies together and spark a new ICT revolution in Ghana,"" she says, adding that the project could equip local techies with the necessary skills to develop apps that would solve community problems, as well as provide a platform for tech companies to find new talent and opportunities to invest in. For Agambire, this is a project that will position Ghana at the forefront of African technology. ""Africa is hungry for development,"" he says. ""Want to make sure that in three years down the line, Hope City will be a reality and will be one of the biggest dreams that Africa has ever seen.""","Hope City is a planned high-tech hub outside Accra, Ghana .

"(CNN) -- They're young, fabulously wealthy and have blue blood coursing through their veins. Meet the ""20 Hottest Young Royals"" in the world, compiled by influential fortune tracker, Forbes magazine. Britain's Prince William has been named ""Hottest Young Royal"" in the world by Forbes magazine. The magazine used the ""winning combinations of looks, money, and popularity on the Web"" to come up with the list, it says. Only unmarried royals under the age of 35 were considered. The Forbes list proved to be a Royal knockout for British royalty. They came in the top four of hottest young royals in the world. With his piercing blue eyes and lantern jaw, reminiscent of a movie star, Britain's Prince William, perhaps unsurprisingly, came in at Number 1. The magazine describes him as having: ""international intrigue and unparalleled media attention,"" combined with a ""graceful public persona."" Although his crown slipped somewhat recently when he was accused of abusing his newly-acquired flying skills by ""joyriding.""  Watch who people on the street think is the hottest » . His relationship with girlfriend Kate Middleton is the subject of feverish speculation and an engagement announcement is eagerly anticipated by the British media. Seemingly always languishing in William's shadow,  his brother, Prince Harry, placed second on the list. Harry has always been known as the ""bad boy prince"" because of some rather unroyal behavior, such as brawling with paparazzi outside nightclubs and going to a fancy dress party dressed in Nazi regalia. However, he has latterly re-invented himself as the ""Hero prince"" after a tour of duty in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban in March. Sound off: Is Prince William the world's hottest young royal? William and Harry's cousins Zara Phillips and Princess Beatrice also came in at No. 3 and 4 respectively. The inclusion in the list should be good news for Princess Beatrice, who recently attracted unkind comments from Britain's newspaper columnists about her curvy figure and her dress sense. The sight of Beatrice, 19, pictured on holiday in a bikini proved too much for Daily Mail newspaper columnist Allison Pearson, who wrote: ""Can't someone buy that girl a sarong? For her sake, as well as ours."" This led to an angry counterattack from Beatrice's mum, Sarah Ferguson, who thundered at a news conference to promote a reality show: ""Touch me, fine, but don't touch my children."" The 20 featured on the list represent almost $60 billion in wealth and 15 royal lineages from around the world-- including some rather obscure names that even the most ardent royalist might be hard pushed to recognize. Princess Sikhanyiso of Swaziland anyone? Coming in at Number 20, the eldest daughter of King Mswati III of Swaziland, Africa's last absolute monarch, is currently a speech and drama major at Biola University in California. A controversial princess who raises eyebrows in her homeland with her Western-style clothes and a decision to hold a drinking party to celebrate the end of a chastity decree in 2005 resulted in a beating with a stick. Fourth in line to the Monaco throne, Charlotte Casiraghi, is the only non-Brit to make it into the top 5. A style icon, who is known for her impeccable taste in fashion and her good looks--much like her grandmother, Hollywood icon, Grace Kelly and mother Princess Caroline. Her brother, party prince Andrea Casiraghi, also makes an appearance on the list at Number 10. But it seems even his Hollywood lineage -- as well as his sun-kissed surfer looks were not enough to give William and Harry a run for their money in the pin-up stakes.","Prince William tops list of 'Hottest Royal' list compiled by Forbes magazine .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to believe, but TV veteran Bob Newhart has just snagged his very first Emmy. Newhart, 84, has been nominated seven times throughout his 52-year career, and on Sunday night he finally won at the Primetime Creative Arts Emmys. He was named Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on CBS' ""The Big Bang Theory."" He appeared as Professor Proton, the former host of a kids' science show, on an episode in May.

Given the breadth and impact of his career -- from ""The Bob Newhart Show"" of the early '60s and '70s to ""Newhart"" in the '80s and the short-lived ""Bob"" in the '90s -- it's curious how Newhart managed to go this long without a prior win. ""The best answer to that really is whenever I was nominated, there were better people in the category than me,"" the star told Entertainment Weekly. ""That's the truth. The best person wins.

"(CNN) -- The mother of the 14-year-old Massachusetts boy who allegedly killed his teacher said Saturday her ""heart is broken"" for the teacher's family and that she is struggling to understand the crime. Diana Chism, in a statement released by her son Philip's attorney, also asked for prayers for all involved. Philip was arrested late Tuesday, accused of killing his 24-year-old algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer, and dumping her body in nearby woods. ""Ms. Chism's heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer,"" the statement from attorney Denise Regan reads. ""Ms. Chism would like you to know that her son was born in love and is dear to her, very dear. She is struggling to understand this and respectfully asks for some time to process this. ""She asks that you know that she cares for the world's hurt over this and greatly hopes for your prayers for the Ritzer family, the Danvers community, for her son, and all those affected by this tragedy."" Chism killed Ritzer in the girl's bathroom of Danvers High School with a box cutter he brought to school, a source close to the investigation said. He then stashed Ritzer's body in a recycling bin, rolled it outside and dumped it about 20 feet into the woods behind the school's athletic fields, the source said. After changing his clothes, Chism went to a Wendy's restaurant and a movie, sources say. Chism was reported missing Tuesday evening after he failed to return home. As police searched for him, they received another missing persons call about Ritzer. Officers found Chism about an hour later and soon pieced the story together. Those who know Chism describe him as a quiet but normal teenager who excelled at soccer. He was a newcomer to Danvers, north of Boston, and this was his first year at the school.

Timothy Dwayne Tutterrow, a 46-year-old from Quitman, Georgia, faces felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious bodily injury, Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison said. ""After inspection of the ride, we determined that it had been tampered with and critical safety devices were compromised,"" Harrison said. Witnesses said the ride had stopped Thursday night and people were getting off when it restarted, resulting in five injuries. By Saturday, three of those hurt were still hospitalized at WakeMed Hospital in Raleigh, while two others had been released. Another ride operator was among the injured, though it wasn't clear whether he was among those still in the hospital this weekend. The victims included family members between the ages of 14 and 39. According to the sheriff's office, Tutterrow is an independent ride contractor for a company that only had one ride at the fair: the Vortex. More arrests in the incident are possible, said Harrison, who added that the investigation is ongoing. Brian Long, a spokesman for the state Deaprtment of Agriculture, said owners inspect the rides three times a day. State officials inspect them before the fair's opening and then conduct random spot checks while the fair is under way, he said. The 10-day fair ends Sunday.","More arrests are possible, sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- The mother of missing Maine toddler Ayla Reynolds on Tuesday disclosed new details about purported blood evidence discovered in the home where the 20-month-old was reported missing December 17, 2011. Trista Reynolds told CNN that police shared the information with her in confidence last January, but in revealing details of that information now, she says she felt it was time ""to let the world know"" about it. ""What I thought right off my head was it was a murder scene,"" Reynolds told CNN in a network exclusive interview, referring to police photographs. ""There was just like Ayla's blood ... everywhere,"" she added. Reynolds told CNN she was shown photographs of what appeared to be her daughter's blood discovered on the child's slippers and on a doll in her bedroom, and a silver-dollar-sized stain on a living room sofa. Mother reveals secret evidence . In the basement, where Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro, slept, Reynolds says police allegedly found more of Ayla's blood and on the walls, the floor, in a ""fist-sized stain"" on the mattress and sheets, on the tongue of DiPietro's sneakers and on a wood pallet leaning against a wall. An additional spot of what appeared to be Ayla's blood was found on a child's car seat in DiPietro's vehicle. Reynolds said police showed her some photographs of purported blood stains visible in the photos only because of chemical called luminal. She said those images in particular were so disturbing, she could bear to see only a few. ""I had to actually... I shut it off. I asked them to stop. And there were three or four more pictures that they wanted to show me, and I just...I...I couldn't,"" she told CNN, her voice trailing off. Publicly, Maine State Police investigators said in January 2012, that they had identified Ayla's blood in the basement, describing it as ""more...than a small cut would produce."" According to Ayla's mother, she is making the disclosures in frustration that her daughter hasn't been found, and she wants three adults who were in the home when Ayla vanished -- the child's father, his girlfriend, and his sister -- arrested. Reynolds posted details of the information police shared with her on her website devoted to her missing daughter. ""All three of those people were in that house that night ... all three of them know what happened to Ayla, and all three of them should be prosecuted for it,"" Reynolds told CNN. DiPietro and his family maintain Ayla was abducted. Is Ayla dead? Police say there is no evidence of an abduction from the house, which belongs to DiPietro's mother. They've also said they don't think Ayla will be found alive. Over time, authorities have repeatedly said they believe there was foul play and that the adults who were home that night haven't told everything they know. ""I've said it in the past, their versions don't pass the 'straight-face test.' That statement stands,"" Maine State Police spokesman Steve McCausland recently told CNN. DiPietro's mother and Ayla's grandmother, Phoebe DiPietro, stands by her son. ""Everyone's standards for what is or isn't believable is different,"" DiPietro said. She wouldn't comment on the alleged blood evidence. ""Trista can say and do what she wants,"" Phoebe DiPietro wrote in a statement provided to CNN. ""We choose to hold on to hope that Ayla will be found, "" she added. McCausland said because of the ongoing investigation, which he describes as the biggest in state history, he won't comment one way or another on Trista Reynolds's disclosures including whether they're accurate or could adversely impact the investigation. ""We understand her frustration. Trista has a right to be frustrated. She is Ayla's mom. At times during the past 21 months we're frustrated too,"" McCausland explained, ""but we remember who we are working for. And we're working for Ayla. And that reinvigorates the investigative team."" Organized by supporters of Ayla's mother, an online petition drive has been mounted urging Maine Attorney General Janet Mills to arrest Ayla's father, his sister, and girlfriend in connection with the toddler's disappearance. But Deputy Attorney General William Stokes said that is not how investigations are conducted. ""To allow this type of pressure to influence either the investigation or prosecution undermines the integrity of the investigation or any prosecutor's decision in the future, "" Stokes tells CNN. ""It simply cannot happen."" Items that might be linked to case recovered .","Toddler Ayla Reynolds was reported missing December 17, 2011 .

"(CNN) -- It seems everyone knows a college degree is important but few have a plan to keep it affordable. Just this past academic year, tuition went up twice as fast as inflation and the cost of textbooks rose faster than tuition. Meanwhile, The New York Times recently reported that ""wages have fallen to a record low as a share of America's gross domestic product.""Â . As a result, the average 2011 graduate left school with $26,600 in student loan debt, helping to push the country's total student loan debt past $1 trillion. Combine that with an unemployment rate for recent college graduates of 8.9%, and you see the impetus behind the First World question du jour -- ""Is college really worth it?"" That's a question that is easily answered by the 23% unemployment rate for folks without a bachelor's. Still, the threat of leaving school with crippling loan payments does bring up a more valid question: Should students continue to take out huge loans to pursue majors that don't have a clear path to paying that loan back? In other words, a job? In an ironic showing of big government, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, both conservatives, decided to introduce plans in which state institutions charge less for STEM degrees (science, technology, engineering and math) than liberal arts degrees. ""We're spending a lot of money on education, and when you look at the results, it's not great,"" Scott told a crowd in Tallahassee in 2011. ""Do you want to use your tax money to educate more people who can't get jobs in anthropology? I don't."" Â Â That's a pretty good zinger but it doesn't pass the smell test. First of all -- to borrow language from the GOP script -- I don't think the government should be picking winners and losers. And state officials massaging tuition costs to lure students away from fields they don't approve of does just that. There is a difference between an education and training. Just because the vocational outcome between the two might be different doesn't mean it's government's role to assign its value to society. Not to mention the initial outcomes are not always black and white. For example, recent college grads with a degree in architecture have a 13.9% unemployment rate, while English literature majors had a 9.2% rate, according to a study conducted by Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workplace. The report also found that communication majors had a lower unemployment rate than mechanical engineers and computer science majors. Recent information technology majors had a nearly 12% rate. Instead of coercing students into certain fields by saddling liberal artswith higher costs, Scott, Perry and others should concentrate on providing families with all the information they need to make informed decisions. During his State of the Union Address, President Obama announced he was launching The College Scoreboard, a website that consolidates costs, student loan debt and other financial variables for each school to help families get ""the most bang for your educational buck."" The information is useful but far from complete, according to Pauline Abernathy, vice president of The Institute for College Access and Success.""They don't tell you what percentage of the students at the school borrowed,"" Abernathy told me. ""So you can report a default rate at a particular school, but if you don't put that rate in context, it can be misleading. ""Also, the median debt number includes those that graduated and students that dropped out. So schools with high drop out rates and high borrowing rates come out looking far worse than what they actually may be."" Still, Abernathy credited the administration for giving parents a tool to help them make better decisions. The next step should be incorporating research on which majors offer the best opportunities for jobs, so if someone's daughter or son wants a degree that doesn't train for a specific job, they can see what they are getting into in the long term. Parents can joke about liberal art majors and kids coming back home after college, but it's an infringement on civil liberties for government to strong arm students into technical degrees by artificially manipulating costs. Any official who's concerned about higher education in this country should address the skyrocketing costs, not demonize degrees they don't appreciate.That's for parents like me to do. I was standing in a long Starbucks line recently and decided to strike up a conversation with a college student who said something rather interesting. ""What's your major?"" I asked. ""TV,"" she said. The student went on to tell me that part of her focus was studying the history of television programming. I kept smiling and nodding at the appropriate time all the while thinking ""I sure hope her parents are rich."" Normally I don't believe anybody should be telling folks what to study. But even I must admit the thought of kids borrowing tens of thousands to get a degree in ""30 Rock"" may require some intervention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","Florida, Texas governors want state colleges to charge less for STEM degrees .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thousands of people hit the streets of Bangkok Saturday, extending the weeks-long anti-government protests, police said. Police estimated that as many as 10,000 members of the group United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship were in the heart of Bangkok, blocking intersections near luxury shopping malls and a holy shrine. The opposition group, also known as the ""red shirts,"" is demanding that the prime minister dissolve the parliament soon. The protests Saturday come after Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva met with the leaders of the opposition group. Those meetings Sunday and Monday ended in a stalemate. Cheerful, dancing red shirt protests . Protesters are continuing demonstrations that began on March 14. A member of the group told CNN the group will continue to protest until their conditions are met. The protesters are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full term and remains hugely popular. He fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he say were politically motivated. The protesters say Abhisit Vejjajiva was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call elections. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Thousands of supporters of ousted Thai premier Shinawatra take to streets .

"(CNN) -- It's been more than 30 years since high-level officials from the United States and Iran sat down together to talk face-to-face. That drought ended Thursday. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met in New York as part of a meeting between the Middle Eastern country and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany. Both diplomats described as ""constructive"" the meeting, which explored the idea of restarting talks on Iran's nuclear program. ""We hope to be able to make progress towards resolving this issue in a timely fashion based on respecting the rights of the Iranian people to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment. And, at the same time, making sure that there is no concern at the international level that Iran's nuclear program is anything but peaceful,"" Zarif told reporters after the meeting. Kerry, likewise, sounded cautiously optimistic. ""I think all of us were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to the possibilities of the future,"" Kerry said. ""There's a lot of work to be done, so we will engage in that work obviously and we hope very, very much -- all of us -- that we can get concrete results that will answer the outstanding questions regarding the program,"" he added. Zarif made a 15- to 20-minute presentation, a senior State Department official told CNN, laying out what Iran's interests were and his nation's desire to reach agreement with other nations and fully implement that agreement within a year. The State Department official called Zarif's presentation ""thoughtful."" Outside of the larger meeting, Kerry and Zarif also had a short bilateral discussion. ""We stressed the need to continue these discussions to give it the political impetus that it requires, and hopefully to reach a conclusion in a reasonable time,"" Zarif said. ""I'm satisfied with this first step. Now we have to see whether we can match our positive words with serious deeds so that we can move forward."" Such a high-level meeting involving the United States and Iran hasn't happened since Iran's 1979 revolution, which sent relations between the two into a deep freeze. But the election of new Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, widely seen as more moderate than his predecessor, seems to have opened the possibility of a thaw in relations. Rouhani made comments this week that have led many leaders to conclude there is a chance to strike a nuclear accord between Iran and the other nations. He called on Thursday for an end to nuclear weapons, saying such disarmament ""remains our highest priority."" ""As long as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use, threat of use and proliferation persist,"" Rouhani told the U.N. General Assembly on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. ""The only absolute guarantee is their total elimination."" The recent developments prompted President Barack Obama to dispatch Kerry to seek a deal with Tehran. The United States and other world powers have long said they believe Iran wants nuclear weapons. Iran has said it only wants to harness nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Obama said on Tuesday that curbing Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, along with solving the Middle East conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, would be his highest foreign policy priority for the remainder of his term. ""While these issues are not the cause of all the region's problems, they have been a major source of instability for far too long, and resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a broader peace,"" he said during his address on the opening day of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Obama sounded cautious about any possible breakthrough, saying ""the roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested."" Senior administration officials said Obama made the decision to appoint Kerry his point man on Iran to demonstrate an increased emphasis and importance the president is putting on improved relations with Tehran. Until now, negotiations have been held at lower levels. But raising the dialogue through Kerry was intended to reiterate Obama's openness to move forward with a bilateral approach on Iran. Upon taking office, Rouhani appointed Foreign Minister Zarif, a western-educated former ambassador to the United Nations, as his lead nuclear negotiator. The move was similarly seen as a gesture at improving relations with the West. In his speech to the General Assembly, Rouhani said Iran was prepared for immediate nuclear talks that are ""time-bound and result-oriented ... to build mutual confidence and removal of mutual uncertainties."" The Iranian leader also said he listened carefully to Obama's speech and hoped the United States ""will refrain from following the shortsighted interests of warmongering pressure groups"" so the two nations ""can arrive at a framework to manage our differences."" In February, the bloc of countries leading the diplomatic effort offered Iran a package of economic incentives to abandon its nuclear ambitions. In exchange for easing of sanctions barring trade with Iran in gold and other precious metals, the group wants Iran to shut its underground enrichment facility at Fordo, near the holy city of Qom, and ship out its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20% purity. The group also proposed fuel for a medical reactor and easing sanctions on aviation spare parts in exchange for Iran suspending its uranium enrichment and shipping its stockpiles out of the country. Iran has never formally responded to the deal and it remains to be seen whether the group would be willing to sweeten the offer in the new climate. Rouhani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he has the full backing of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. ""The supreme leader, I can tell you, has given permission for my government to freely negotiate on these issues,"" he said in the interview. Obama administration officials have said they believe the Iranians are ready to negotiate because of the toll international sanctions have taken on their economy. In his remarks Thursday, Rouhani said Iran would be willing to live under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards against nuclear weapons, but scolded Israel for not signing on to international nuclear nonprofileration agreements. ""Israel, the only nonparty to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in this region, should join thereto without any further delay. Accordingly, all nuclear activities in the region should be subject to the IAEA comprehensive safeguards,"" he said. ""The international community has to redouble its efforts in support of the establishment of this zone. This would constitute a contribution to the objective of nuclear disarmament."" Israel has never acknowledged having nuclear weapons but is widely believed to possess them. Israeli officials fear Iranian nuclear weapons pose a direct threat to their security, especially after years of bellicose rhetoric from the previous Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. While Rouhani's tone has been different -- he recently wished Jews a happy Rosh Hashanah through his official Twitter account and on Wednesday acknowledged the reality of the Holocaust in Western media interviews -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this week that he's not yet sold on Iran's seemingly more moderate tone.

"(CNN) -- The war between natives and immigrants is ending. The natives have won. It was a bloodless conflict fought not with bullets and spears, but with iPhones and floppy disks. Now the battle between the haves and have-nots can begin. The post-millennial ""digital native,"" a term coined by U.S. author Marc Prensky in 2001 is emerging as the globe's dominant demographic, while the ""digital immigrant,"" becomes a relic of a previous time. The digital native-immigrant concept describes the generational switchover where people are defined by the technological culture which they're familiar with. Read more: China looks to lead the Internet of Things . Prensky defines digital natives as those born into an innate ""new culture"" while the digital immigrants are old-world settlers, who have lived in the analogue age and immigrated to the digital world. Although not Luddites, the immigrants struggle more than natives to adapt to hi-tech progress. Read more: 'Father of the internet': Fight for its freedom . The author of ""Teaching Digital Natives,"" whose success pushed him onto the speaking circuit, says the explosion of technology over the last 10 years is just the start of a symbiotic new world. Computers and handsets are becoming an extension of body and mind, creating a Cyborg-like population. Prensky cites the 100-meter runner Oscar Pistorius, an athlete with prosthetic legs, as an example of how technology is used to enhance our lives. He told CNN: ""For humans, what used to be this body of flesh and bone, all that is now just the center... Being human is a moving target."" The human race and its struggle to keep up with technology . Prensky says that at no time in history has technology moved so fast. Today the latest high-tech gizmos can be passe even before hitting the shop floors. In the past -- during the post-industrial revolution era, for example -- accelerating technology has plateaued. So, with the meteoric rise of new social media outlets including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Skype, history suggests the world is overdue for a slowdown. Read more: Why aren't robots doing my dishes yet? But Prensky says this time, any slowdown in the digital age is a ""myth,"" as innovation will only press forward ""faster... And faster and faster."" He told CNN: ""We are not going through a transition to another faze of stability, and that is the key point. People will always be behind now and that will be a stress they have to cope with."" The new norm . Connecting with one another in the modern world requires a knack for social networking and texting, which is the norm for the digital native. But for the immigrant, it can be akin to learning a whole new language. Prensky illustrates his point with former director of the CIA David Petraeus. In November, he was embroiled in a scandal that revealed he had an affair with Paula Broadwell. The FBI uncovered the affair while it investigated e-mails that Broadwell allegedly sent to a Petraeus family friend, Jill Kelley. Prensky labels this naivety by immigrants as ""digital stupidity"" -- by assuming that when people decide to post online or send e-mails, they believe privacy is automatically applicable. ""People get frightened by change and they should be. They need courage to face the future these days, especially those who feel left behind."" Prensky said. ""People adapt instinctively and humans are very good at that. The young people live in the context; the older people see the changing context and struggle."" Digital poverty . As technology filters into every corner of the globe and tech cities spring up in some unlikely places from Bangalore to Tel Aviv, a new gulf is emerging to separate the digitally savvy from the disconnected: Poverty. In India, over two-thirds of the population live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank. But a United Nations report still says that mobile phones are more common than toilets, with nearly half of India's 1.2 billion population armed with a handset. Nishant Shah, a director at the Centre for Internet and Society in India, told CNN that defining natives and immigrants by generation is a ""serious concern."" According to Shah, Prensky's views were formed from the ""privileged"" position of living in the U.S. Shah added: ""[Prensky's] observations may describe a generation gap that the U.S. faced, but if you transplant the same definition to other parts of the world, natives are sometimes indistinguishable from immigrants."" The real fear for Shah is the new hierarchies created by digital literacy and the class systems that will be shaped by access to digital technologies. The call of the developing world . As mobile networks extend their reach and areas become increasingly urbanized, Western tech companies are seeking to tap markets with large populations. Last year, Finnish phone maker Nokia released a range of smart phones targeted at consumers in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, to compete with cheaper Android devices. But Shah argues bombarding a country with technology and infrastructure is not a rounded solution to the digital poverty problem. India, for example, has connectivity and access in abundance, but the country continues to suffer from a generation of ""digitally poor classes."" He argues that simply providing the equipment does not help young people understand how that technology can better their lives without education and training. Shah told CNN: ""Just because young people have tech access in India, it doesn't make them digital natives."" He added, ""It creates digital outcasts -- people whose supposed problem of access to the world has been resolved."" Prensky, however, believes a ""networked planet"" is a sign developing nations will soon close the digital divide. Even those who don't yet have the technology still know that it exists, and will have it before long. The world in 2020 . By 2020, Prensky predicts people across the globe will be plugged into the ""AORTA,"" -- Always On RealTime Access -- a term coined by Mark Anderson, the chief of the Strategic News Service -- specializing in technology news. A future in which people are constantly able to access information and news from anywhere on the planet. Shah says that the works of science fiction may offer the most accurate insight into our futuristic society. He said: ""The presents that we live in, are the futures that our pasts have imagined."" ""Let us hope that the technologies of the future will also be designed to protect that which is sacred, and that which is important in our own understanding of being human.""","U.S. author Marc Prensky says that at no time in history has technology moved so fast .

"(CNN) -- Ski queen Lindsey Vonn has put her return to racing on ice -- for now. The new World Cup ski season begins in the Austrian resort of Soelden this weekend but the Olympic downhill champion will not take part as she continues her comeback from a serious knee injury. Vonn was airlifted to hospital February after she landed heavily on her right knee on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria. Less than seven months after her horror crash, the 29-year-old American returned to the slopes in Chile to test out her reconstructed knee. But Vonn, who is dating golfer Tiger Woods, says she is not yet ready to return to competitive action on the snow. ""My training camp in Soelden went very well and I made great progress, but I feel that I need more training before I start racing again,"" Vonn explained on her personal website. ""The Soelden race is not in the cards this year. Patience is not my strong suit so not racing is very hard for me but it will only make me more excited for the next one."" Vonn was crowned America's snow queen when she became the first American woman to win the Olympic downhill title at the Vancouver Games in 2010. She followed up her Vancouver victory with a stellar World Cup season in 2011-2012, winning 12 races and the overall title with a new record points haul. A combination of illness and injury disrupted Vonn's dominance on the slopes last season but she is confident she remains on course to defend her Olympic crown. She plans to return at the World Cup event in Beaver Creek, Colorado on November 29. ""I will go home to Vail and continue my preparation for the Beaver Creek races and my ultimate goal in February!"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Misinformation can spread quickly on Twitter, each retweet exposing it to wider audiences and even resulting in real world impacts. On Tuesday, hackers took over the Associated Press Twitter account and falsely claimed that there had been explosions at the White House and that the president was hurt. The tweet was up for a few minutes and retweeted more than 3,000 times before Twitter took the account offline. The AP immediately confirmed the news was not true, but the tweet was up long enough to send a shudder through the stock market, which plunged 143 points before recovering. Real tweets have the power to end careers, cause diplomatic tensions, fuel a revolution and find a kidney. Fake tweets can have the same ripple effects, and damage control is difficult. There is no way to edit or append a correction to a tweet, and once it has been retweeted, those 140 characters take on a life of their own. A follow-up tweet with the correct information might not be seen by the same people. ""You want to respond as quickly as possible. Deleting the tweet is a good approach, but even if you delete it it's obviously already out there,"" said social media expert Krista Neher. The AP incident is not the first time a tweet has influenced markets. In August 2012, an Italian journalist set up a fake Twitter account for a member of Russia's government and tweeted that the president of Syria had been killed, causing brief fluctuations in the oil markets. The journalist was an experienced Twitter hoaxer, having previously posted fake tweets about the death of the pope and Fidel Castro and established a number fake accounts for world leaders. He claimed he did it to prove how unreliable social media is for getting accurate news. A tweet doesn't just trigger financial panic, it can also strain diplomatic relations, as the U.S. Embassy in Cairo found out in April when the official Twitter account posted a link to a Daily Show segment critical of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. In March, someone posing as the U.S. ambassador to Moscow tweeted a criticism of the Russian presidential election process, which was picked up by the news media in Russia before it was revealed as a hoax. The U.S. government responded with official statements in both incidents. ""The speed at which information spreads is so much quicker than it used to be, and Twitter is such a big part of that,"" said Neher. That was painfully evident late Thursday night during the manuhunt in Boston. A tweet mistakenly named a missing Brown University student as one of the suspects. Twitter latched on to the name and many users assumed it was true even though it hadn't been confirmed by authorities. A faulty tweet also can have a negative impact on community or a family. Late last year a New Jersey teenager posted a plea for help on Twitter saying there was an intruder in her house and asking people to call 911. The tweet went viral as friends and strangers expressed genuine concern for her safety (though no one on Twitter actually called 911). But it was quickly discovered that there was no home invasion. The teen had run away from home and was later spotted on security cameras buying a train ticket to New York City. The fast-moving, viral nature of Twitter has its perils, but it can also be used for good. Twitter highlights the impact of single tweets in its Twitter Stories series, tracking Tweets that go viral and result in positive impacts and happy endings.","A fake tweet can spread across the social network and into the real world quickly .

"(CNN) -- Dan Hyatt's wife, Shelley, had been worried for a while by the time he hit 337 pounds. Her husband had a short fuse and a bad attitude because he hated the way he looked and felt. He was on multiple medications for high blood pressure and used a CPAP machine at night to treat his sleep apnea. She tried to dance around the problem, but she was afraid of becoming a widow. ""A couple times I said something like, 'How much life insurance do you have?' "" she said. ""I was afraid if I said, 'I'm afraid you're going to die,' that would make it come true."" On January 13, 2012, Hyatt crawled to the top of a tower at the plastics plant where he worked, doubled over and struggled to catch his breath. That was when it finally hit him -- if he didn't lose weight, he might not live to see his three daughters graduate college, get married or have children of their own. Read Dan Hyatt's story on CNN iReport . Heavy all his life from poor eating habits and little exercise, Hyatt had lost weight before only to gain it all back. So this time, he didn't set a weight loss goal. He gave himself a bigger challenge: Compete in an Ironman triathlon in five years or less. Arguably the world's most grueling endurance race, the Ironman consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile run with no break. ""I can't explain how my logic works, but I just decided, if I try to run the Ironman, even if I don't get there, I'm going to lose the weight and I'm going to get fit,"" said the 44-year-old from Ottawa, Illinois. Eight months later, Hyatt had completed his first triathlon, run his first marathon and lost nearly 100 pounds. To date, he has lost 135 pounds and 12 inches off his waist by working out 12 to 14 hours per week -- swimming, running, cycling and doing yoga -- and sticking with a fairly rigid diet. ""I love the fact that I've done what I've done, but it pales in comparison to what I want to do,"" he said. Cruel taunts in childhood . Hyatt was overweight as a child. He remembers the other kids calling him ""Moby Dick"" and yelling, ""There she blows."" Sports weren't his thing. He liked to swim, but the only time he went jogging was when his concerned parents would make him run around the block to try to help him lose weight. That just brought him more shame and ridicule. ""I'd have people I didn't even know yell names at me -- 'Here comes the fat boy running.' "" But decades later, when he laid down the Ironman gauntlet, there was no turning back. Follow Dan's journey to the Ironman on Facebook . He didn't tell his wife at first. The Monday morning after his January 2012 epiphany, he snuck out of bed and got to the YMCA when it opened at 5:30 a.m. He texted his wife something like: ""I just went for a swim."" ""I'm like, what? What are you talking about? You don't just go for a swim in the middle of January,"" she said. As the months went on, she got a clearer picture. ""At first it was just the swimming, and then he comes home and goes, 'I'm going to do a Couch-to-5K.' And then, 'I'm going to take up cycling,' and he signed up for a cycling class. And then he said, 'I'm going to do the Ironman.' "" The workouts escalated slowly. During the first month, Hyatt swam four mornings a week, adding a couple laps every other day until he got to a mile. After a couple weeks, he signed up for a weekly spinning class. When he joined up with some people starting the Couch-to-5K nine-week training program for beginner runners, he was still more than 300 pounds and breathing so heavily that the other joggers would ask if he was OK. But he made it to every run, three days a week. He finished his first 5K in 39 minutes and 56 seconds. From there, it was onto a 10K. Learning to ignore his detractors . Dealing with naysayers was the hardest part. In the beginning, people told him he'd destroy his knees. He was too big to be running, they said. When he hadn't lost all the weight, some people even accused him of lying about swimming a whole mile or running six. He said his wife and two friends were the only ones who believed in him. A nutritionist helped Hyatt balance his diet around running and cycling. He sticks to whole grains, lean meats, fruits and vegetables and tries to eat a combination of 55% carbohydrates, 30% fat and 15% protein, per her recommendation. If the family goes to a Chinese restaurant, he orders steamed chicken and rice with the sauce on the side. He treats himself to a Skinny Cow ice cream sandwich most days, and if he's training for a marathon, he'll eat a few slices of pizza. In September 2012, he ran a half marathon, and later that month, a triathlon. A couple months later, he did a full marathon. This past July, he completed a half Ironman, his proudest accomplishment so far. Swimming 1.2 miles in Lake Michigan was ""like swimming in a washing machine,"" and as he swallowed water and felt his chest tighten, he seriously contemplated dropping out of the race. But he kept going. ""When you get to that finish line ... it brought tears to my eyes,"" he said. ""At the same time, it was a stark reality that I'm only at half of where I need to be."" Early to rise: A disciplined regime . No one doubts him now. He wakes up at 3 a.m. on weekdays to run, swim and strength train before he leaves for work at 6 a.m. On weekends, he's usually up by 6 a.m. to cycle. When the family travels, his first call is to find the nearest YMCA with a pool. He weighs 202 pounds, about 20 pounds from his goal weight. He has gotten off two blood pressure medications, sleeps better and is a much more pleasant person to be around, his wife reports. ""Nobody would ever say anything to me anymore,"" he said. ""I'm way more fit than the average person these days, and I'm proud of that. And I'm not going to quit."" Hyatt is saving money for the $625 entry fee required to participate in the Louisville Ironman in August. And he won't be stopping there. After the Ironman, he's got his sights set on ultramarathons, trail running and the Boston Marathon (to qualify, he'd need to shave more than an hour off his current time). He also wants to win a race. ""The human body is capable of so much more than you can fathom if you have the mental fortitude to put past the artificial limits that your brain places on it,"" he said. ""The harder it sounds or the more challenging it is, the more appealing it is to me."" Shelley no longer worries how much life insurance they have, though she does wonder when he'll be home from his long runs or bike rides. On the upside, he cooks dinner for the family nearly every night to make sure the food is prepared healthily. ""There are time when I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I can't believe you're doing this; I can't believe how insane I am to let you do this,' "" she said. But, ultimately, she said, ""I'm so happy and so thankful because he's adding years to his life."" Update, Nov. 4, 2013: After learning about Hyatt's story, the Ironman organization waived his entry fee for the Louisville race. Hyatt has committed to give back by raising money for childhood obesity. He has set a goal of raising $5,000 by August 24.

"(CNN) -- The inflatable-armbands community is rejoicing -- Asia's first Legoland Water Park opened in Malaysia this week. With more than 20 water attractions, 70 Lego models and 3 million liters of water, the 300,000-square-meter space is the world's largest Legoland Water Park, say park officials. Before you get too awestruck over such a grandiose claim to fame, it's worth noting there are only two other Legoland Water Parks in operation. Both are in the United States -- one in California, the other in Florida. Still, this place is impressive. Especially for the under-12 set. Apart from water slides and pools, one of the coolest attractions of the Legoland Malaysia Water Park is Build-A-Raft River, which lets kids put together their own raft made of soft Lego bricks and float through the park via a slow-moving current. The Joker Soaker is an interactive platform in a wade pool where kids can shoot water cannons as a jester tells jokes -- family-friendly ones, naturally -- as it unleashes 350 gallons of water upon their gleeful (or horrified?) little heads. For toddlers, the Duplo-themed play area has smaller slides and characters modeled after those found in Lego sets -- an alligator, polar bear and elephant. The new Legoland Water Park has two restaurants, private cabanas for rent and a store. More: Gallery: Asia's first Legoland opens in Malaysia . Legoland Malaysia hotel to open next year . The water park is the latest addition to the Legoland Malaysia Resort, which opened in September of 2012 in Iskandar, in the state of Johor. A hotel, the final phase of the resort, will open in early 2014, say officials. About 50 kilometers from central Singapore, the 30-hectare theme park is made up of more than than 50 million bricks and has 40 rides, shows and attractions. Legoland Malaysia is the sixth theme park for the brand, joining properties in Denmark, England, Germany and two in the United States. Visitors can access the water park from outside as well as from the theme park, though extra tickets are required. More: Legoland Hotel Malaysia set for 2014 launch .

"(CNN) -- Chad Dickerson's shoulder bag is made out of an old bomber jacket, sewn together by a craftsman in Germany. Out of it he pulls a few of his favorite things - a linen laptop case, and a travel document holder made from Johnny Cash's ""I Walk the Line"" album cover. It's a little dog-eared, but then it is from 1964. The folder was bought and sold through Etsy, an online marketplace which Dickerson has helped lead since 2008, first as chief technology officer then as chief executive since 2011. Etsy is an e-commerce website, selling vintage goods -- which must be over 20 years old -- and homemade items. It also sells supplies for arts and craft. Other sites offering a similar craft-based marketplace include DaWanda and ArtFire. The company was started in 2005 and became profitable in 2009, even as the credit crunch dragged down the U.S. and European economies. It has received $91 million in funding from investors including Accel Partners and Hurbert Burda. It is creating virtual and actual communities which, according to Dickerson, are disrupting global supply chains by directly linking buyers and sellers. While Etsy, a headline act for Le Web London, is an e-commerce site, its ""primary driver is a the authorship and provenance of where something came from,"" Dickerson told CNN. ""That really sets us apart."" Read more: LeWeb 2013 - the best bits you might have missed . It also provides ""an antidote"" to the disjoint between people and the goods they consume, Dickerson says. On Etsy, ""you can both get a quality item and something that is totally unique."" Etsy, which has 900,000 active ""shops,"" attracts 60 million unique visitors a month, with a 70% jump in year-on-year marketplace sales in 2012, to just over $895 million. The company takes a 3.5% commission and the rest goes to the seller. It has created the commercial ""opposite of what major retailers do these days,"" Dickerson says. He points to the factory collapse in Bangladesh, in which more than 1,100 people died, as the type of commerce Etsy stands against. ""[Etsy's success] is a backlash but it's a very positive one,"" Dickerson says. ""When we talk about the vision for Etsy, we say that we are re-imagining commerce to build a more fulfilling and lasting world."" It's not one in which commercialism is a bad thing, Dickerson says. ""We believe that commercial activity, in the buying and selling of things, when done well actually improves the world."" Etsy has perhaps benefited from the credit crunch, as those suffering financial pain seek to boost their incomes with online selling, but Dickerson also points to a ""new form of economic activity."" It is ""not just the economic cycle, it's the creation of a new type of opportunity,"" Dickerson says. ""You can make a life, not just a living."" That reflects the ethos of Dickerson himself, a former Yahoo executive, who studied English literature before becoming fascinated by the opportunities of the open source software movement. ""I see the same dynamic on Etsy, but instead of creating open source software the Etsy community is creating something even more profound,"" Dickerson says. Etsy, is creating a ""whole new way of looking at commerce."" Etsy has teams to investigate authenticity of items and the website's community is also on the look-out for any misrepresentation. But Etsy is being challenged by the relentless drive of technology. The emergence of 3-D printing is something that's made us ""think about our world view,"" Dickerson says. Some sellers used 3-D printed parts in what they sell, but questions remain over whether it qualifies as craft. According to Dickerson: ""The truth is we don't know, because it is so new we are learning along with everyone else.""","Etsy was founded in 2005 and became profitable in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- An advocate for honoring women on British currency was thanked for her efforts on Twitter with dozens of rape threats. A female writer who recently spoke out against rape jokes, almost predictably, got the same treatment. Meanwhile, Facebook was called to task for not being quick enough to stamp out pages such as ""Fly Kicking Sluts in the Uterus"" and ""Violently Raping Your Friend Just For Laughs."" Hateful words and actions targeting women and other groups are, of course, nothing new. But in our digital age, social media sites must increasingly face the fact that their services have become the new schoolyard or city square, where a majority of friendly discussion and positive interaction comes with an ugly undercurrent of nastiness. ""Expressed hate and abuse is unfortunately part of our society, and it is now also part of our real-time digital culture,"" said Brian Solis, a new media analyst for Altimeter Group and author of ""What's the Future of Business? Changing the Way Businesses Create Experiences."" ""As we live the digital lifestyle, our expectations are such that any menace should not only be dealt with accordingly, it should be done immediately."" The question for sites such as Twitter, which on Tuesday responded to a petition to make reporting abusive behavior easier, is how to police hundreds of millions of people, providing a safe environment for some users while respecting the free speech of others. At the heart of the problem are the mechanics of policing. The sheer number of users means that flagging misbehavior is like playing a vast, never-ending game of Whac-a-Mole. ""Twitter represents a new medium that the world hasn't seen before,"" Solis said of the site that supports 400 million tweets every day. ""To protect its users, it must invest in automated and manual safety and reporting mechanisms as it grows."" This week, the Bank of England announced that ""Pride and Prejudice"" author Jane Austen will be featured on 10-pound notes. The move came after a campaign by Caroline Criado-Perez and others. On Twitter, Criado-Perez wrote that the response got ugly fast: ""I actually can't keep up with the screen-capping & reporting -- rape threats thick and fast now,"" she wrote now. ""If anyone wants to report the tweets to Twitter."" Some of the accounts she cited have since been suspended. Eventually, one man was arrested Sunday in Manchester, England. British police also are investigating a threat of rape and murder made to Stella Creasy, a Labour Party member of Parliament, after she tweeted her support of Criado-Perez. But activists complained that Twitter didn't act quickly enough. A Change.org petition, calling on the site to add a prominent ""report abuse"" button, had gotten more than 88,000 signatures as of Tuesday. The effort prompted Del Harvey, Twitter's senior director for Trust & Safety, to respond Tuesday in a blog post titled ""We Hear You."" ""We see an incredible amount of activity passing through our systems ...,"" she wrote on Twitter's UK blog. ""The vast majority of these use cases are positive. That said, we are not blind to the reality that there will always be people using Twitter in ways that are abusive and may harm others."" Harvey noted that three weeks ago the site rolled out a tool for Twitter for iPhone that lets users report individual tweets. That feature will hit Web and other mobile systems soon, she wrote. She acknowledged, however, that putting eyeballs on every offensive tweet is difficult, if not impossible. ""While manually reviewing every tweet is not possible due to Twitter's global reach and level of activity, we use both automated and manual systems to evaluate reports of users potentially violating our Twitter Rules,' Harvey wrote. ""These rules explicitly bar direct, specific threats of violence against others and use of our service for unlawful purposes, for which users may be suspended when reported."" The movement, and response, are not unlike a similar recent effort on Facebook. In May, a coalition of women's groups called for the site to get tough on pages that appeared to embrace hate speech, particularly violent language, toward women. Facebook responded by rolling out a slate of efforts that, among other things, increased accountability for pages that post content that is ""cruel or insensitive."" Speaking Saturday at the BlogHer conference in Chicago, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged the difficulties in policing abusive behavior among the site's more than 1 billion account holders. But she said tools to do so continue to improve. ""We have this really big challenge between free expression, which is really important ..., and creating a safe and protected community,"" she said. ""We take both very seriously. ""The No. 1 thing people can do is when you find content that's inappropriate, there's a report button. Hit that report button because we can look at and take down inappropriate content as long as we see it, and (it) is really an important part of what we're trying to do."" Both the Twitter and Facebook episodes mark what appears to be a shift in online culture. Throughout the Web's history, a certain amount of bad behavior has come to be expected, be it intentionally provocative online trolling or earnest hatred spewed more freely because of the ability to do so anonymously. But, in 2013, it's become nearly impossible to distinguish where ""Web culture"" ends and culture as a whole begins. Solis, the analyst, noted that as social media become more and more mainstream, bad behavior that would never be accepted on a sidewalk will increasingly be policed, one way or another, online. ""The idea of 'freedom of tweet' does not supersede law,"" he said. ""Expression aimed at hurting or threatening someone is indeed a threat heard around the world.""","Social media sites are wrestling with how to police hateful speech .

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- If your company bans you from using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media in the office, that policy is ""brain dead"", entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa told me. Wadhwa, listed as one of the 40 most influential minds in tech, is right of course. And here are five reasons, borrowing from several books published this year. 1. It's self-defeating. Dictatorial office managers be warned. Banning social media at work is about as viable as King Canute's attempts to halt the tide. As Nicco Mele argues in ""The End of Big: Howe the Internet Makes David the New Goliath"", social media is actually contributing to the demise of the large organization. Besides, since most workers now have their own smart phones and tablets, it's actually impossible -- without establishing an all-seeing totalitarian regime at the office -- to stop workers peeking a look at the their Facebook updates or Twitter feeds while in the restroom. 2. It's such an old idea. Even the word ""banning"" is archaic. As Moises Naim argues in ""The End of Power"", by undermining traditional hierarchies and gatekeepers, the Internet makes it more and more difficult to outlaw anything. ""Being in charge isn't what it used to be,"" he notes in the book's subtitle. Middle Eastern dictators should, of course, beware. But so should formerly all-powerful office IT directors or HR managers whose monopoly of authority and power has been undermined by the worldwide web. Like Tahrir Square, the 21st century office has been radically democratized. Tightly controlled, top-down offices don't work anymore. They are so 20th century. 3. Social media is the new coffee break. It's the 21st century version of the water cooler. It's how we get our news, keep up with friends and colleagues, make our social arrangements, establish our identities and view the world. Our obsessive use of social media means that we are all living in the perpetual present, says CNN columnist Douglas Rushkoff in ""Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now"". It's what social media gurus Robert Scoble and Shel Israel describe, in ""Age of Context"". As Scoble notes, this social media rich environment, in which everything we do becomes ""social data"", is what he calls the ""new world"". This is both ""scary"" and ""freaky"", as Scoble acknowledges. But it's an inevitable as self-driving cars or wearable computers. To ban social media, therefore, is to essentially ban people at work. It's like outlawing talking or laughing. You might as well ban breathing. 4. Multitasking is beneficial. As anyone with children knows, multitasking is how digital natives live their hyper-connected lives. And the same is increasingly true at work. Once upon a time, we sat in an office all day then went home to enjoy our leisure. But today, work and leisure are inextricably connected. So that occasional tweet or Facebook update from the office doesn't mean you aren't working. It just means that some of your brain might be temporarily focused on something else. But that temporary focus describes the nature of 21st century work. It's how we all -- even the most efficient among us -- operate in the networked age. As Jane McGonigal notes in her best-seller ""Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World"", multitasking actually makes us more creative by stimulating our playfulness. 5. It makes us more productive because it opens up our minds. Social media not only enables us to group-solve big problems, but also makes us more literate, able to think with more independence and gives us an ESP-like sense of what other people are thinking, according to Clive Thompson in ""Smarter Than You Think: How Technology is Changing Our Minds for the Better"". Through Twitter, we get access to newspaper articles and stories that we would otherwise have missed. LinkedIn enables us to network with fellow workers. Facebook gives us intelligence about competitive ideas and companies. And banning social media at work only empowers that intelligence even more by encouraging us to network with more open-minded and innovative companies. The FutureCast conference brought together entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, writers and technologists to imagine the future of 21st century digital society. It was organized and produced by Andrew Keen and was hosted by AT&T and Ericsson at AT&T's Palo Alto Foundry.","Bosses should be relaxed about employees going on social media at work, says Andrew Keen .
It increases creativity and benefits the company or organization, he argues .
And anyway, you won't be able to stop it, Keen warns employers ."
"(CNN) -- An appellate court on Thursday ordered a new trial for a Florida woman who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband, ruling that a jury was improperly instructed on self-defense. Marissa Alexander's case will be retried because the jury was wrongly told that -- for her to claim self-defense -- she needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her husband was about to seriously harm her, the appellate court said. Rather, the appellate court pointed out, the prosecution had the burden to prove that Alexander herself was guilty of aggravated assault. ""Because the jury instructions on self-defense were fundamental error, we reverse"" the conviction, a three-judge appellate panel said. A jury convicted Alexander, 31, of aggravated assault in March 2012 after just 12 minutes of deliberation. Alexander's lawyer said he told her about the new trial by phone. ""Marissa was ecstatic and obviously she's incredibly thankful and wants to get back with her family,"" defense attorney Bruce Zimet told CNN. 'Stand your ground' denied in Alexander case . The case gained the attention of civil rights leaders, who say the African-American mother of three was persecuted because of her race, and from others, including U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, who said the sentence was too harsh and Alexander never should have been charged. Alexander claimed self-defense, saying she was attempting to flee her husband, Rico Gray, on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall. She said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. State Attorney Angela Corey had said the case deserved to be prosecuted because Alexander fired in the direction of a room where two children were standing. Corey had said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence, but Alexander chose to take the case to a jury trial, where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a Florida law known as ""10-20-life."" The law mandates increased penalties for some felonies, including aggravated assault, in which a gun is carried or used. Opinion: Shame of mandatory minimums . During sentencing in May 2012, a judge said he had no choice but to sentence her to 20 years. ""Under the state's 10-20-life law, a conviction for aggravated assault where a firearm has been discharged carries a minimum and maximum sentence of 20 years without regarding to any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that may be present, such as those in this case,"" Judge James Daniel said that year. Before the trial, Alexander unsuccessfully tried to use Florida's Stand Your Ground law to argue she was immune from prosecution. To win the immunity hearing, she would have needed to show that she was more likely entitled than not to use force. But a judge in the pretrial immunity hearing rejected the request, saying Alexander's decision to go back into the house was not consistent with someone in fear for her safety. In Thursday's decision, the appellate court said Alexander would not get a new immunity hearing. But she can still claim self-defense at trial. The office of the Florida state attorney for Duval County said Thursday that Alexander's conviction ""was reversed on a legal technicality."" ""We are gratified that the court affirmed the defendant's Stand Your Ground ruling"" denying pretrial immunity, the office said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Five people are dead after a jeep plowed into a crowded part of Tiananmen Square and caught fire Monday, authorities said. The crash temporarily blocked off a busy area in the heart of the Chinese capital as rescuers and police rushed to the scene. Police said the crash happened around noon local time in front of the Tiananmen Rostrum, a structure that stands at the entrance to the Forbidden City bearing a giant portrait of Mao Zedong. The vehicle hit the guardrail of the Jinshui Bridge over the moat of the Forbidden City before it burst into flames, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The driver of the jeep and two passengers were killed, Beijing police said in a statement. The other two fatalities were tourists -- a Filipino woman and a Chinese man, according to state media reports. At least 38 people were injured, state media said. Eleven injured people, a mixture of tourists and police officers, have been taken to the hospital, Xinhua said. Photographs circulating on social media showed a vehicle engulfed in flames in Tiananmen Square. CNN wasn't immediately able to verify the authenticity of the images. Authorities moved quickly to tackle the blaze and clear up the scene. But the cause of the deadly crash remained unclear. Around 2:30 p.m., authorities were barring tourists from entering the area in front of the Tiananmen Rostrum and the center of Tiananmen Square. Both areas are usually packed with mostly Chinese tourists. Dozens of police vans, along with uniformed and plainclothes officers, were gathered at the site of the crash. Workers scrubbed the concrete, and there was no sign of the vehicle or any residue from the fire. The Tiananmen East subway station and part of the Tiananmen West station were temporarily closed, the subway operator said. Roads in the area soon reopened, and traffic was flowing normally by midafternoon. Tiananmen Square is China's most politically sensitive landmark as a result of the events of June 4, 1989, when government forces opened fire on civilians to quash pro-democracy demonstrations. The square is often closed or put under heightened security before and during major events. The previous noteworthy case of a vehicle catching fire in the area was in February 2009, when three people tried to set themselves on fire after police stopped them just east of the square. Two of those three people, petitioners from out of town, were injured in that blaze. CNN's David McKenzie and Steven Jiang reported from Beijing, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: The driver, two passengers and two tourists are dead, according to authorities .

"(CNN) -- The roadside bomb that smashed into Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo's Humvee in northern Iraq two years ago ripped off both legs below the knee. Retired Army Sgt. Brian Saaristo, who lost both legs to a roadside bomb, meets with a doctor in Minnesota. Now he's 45, living in retirement in Minnesota and confronting the rest of his life without the use of his legs. Yet he worries mainly about the thousands of younger U.S. service members who also have been maimed by makeshift bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Younger ones are taking it harder,"" Saaristo said. ""They feel they don't have the rest of their lives."" Roadside bombs and other homemade explosives have been a deadly staple of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, killing or wounding thousands of U.S. service members and civilians. Such improvised explosives devices -- ""IEDs"" to the military -- are the ""weapon of choice"" for insurgents, U.S. officials say. They're mostly cheap, easy to build and triggered by simple remote control. Protecting U.S. troops from such bombs is a top priority at the Pentagon. It has spent $14 billion in the past four years to fight homemade bombs. It even created an agency for that purpose -- the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization. That agency has had some success, a new report says, but insurgents continue to kill and maim U.S. service members with homemade bombs, in part because the bombs fulfill their purpose and it is easy to acquire the materials used to construct them. The report came from a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. It followed two years of hearings and study. The number of IED attacks has dropped in Iraq and gone up in Afghanistan, said Irene Smith, a spokeswoman for the IED organization. Yet there are more than 1,400 such attacks a month in Iraq and Afghanistan and an additional 350 elsewhere, a sign that insurgents continue to rely on them. ""We are in a long war, a persistent conflict with a group of insurgents who want to wear down our will so we quit -- the purpose of an IED,"" she said. ""The enemy recognizes IEDs as the weapon of choice."" The IED agency has developed and fielded electronic jammers that prevent the bomb's trigger signal from reaching the explosive, the congressional report said. It also has pursued better vehicle armor. The agency has been developing intelligence, fostering police work, funding surveillance and attacking insurgent networks that produce and set up the bombs. It has been involved in training troops on how to confront and look for the weapon. Yet the report said the group needs to improve the way it measures its performance, because it isn't clear in many cases whether the group's actions or other factors have led to various strides in confronting roadside bombs. The report also said the organization needs to widen its authority to include other agencies that confront roadside bombs, and get better oversight. Smith, the spokeswoman for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, agrees with these conclusions. She said the organization appreciates the opportunity to work with the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, ""to identify and resolve any problem areas in our processes."" She said the cooperation among agencies is crucial. ""Global terrorism will continue to manifest itself through use of IEDs,"" she said.","Number of homemade bomb attacks down in Iraq, up in Afghanistan .

"New York (CNN) -- Rap mogul Jay Z -- who has been thrust into a debate over alleged racial profiling at Barneys New York -- broke his silence Saturday, defending himself from critics who have insisted he break off his partnership with the tony department store over the allegations. The music icon and entrepreneur spoke in an online statement a day after a second African-American college student claimed that an undercover officers stopped and questioned her after she bought a $2,500 bag at the Manhattan store. Jay Z himself has nothing to do with these cases, though he does have something to do with Barneys: He has a fashion line that is set to sell there. A Change.org petition calling for him to end this collaboration had more than 13,000 signatures Saturday night. ""Right as Jay Z prepares to roll out a new partnership with Barneys New York for the holiday shopping season, I've been disappointed to hear new allegations about how the retailer treats young black consumers,"" wrote the petition's creator, Derick Bowers of Brooklyn. The celebrity -- born Shawn Carter, who in addition to being a rapper runs restaurants, a sport agency and other ventures -- on Saturday issued a statement on his website explaining his silence to date by explaining that he doesn't want to jump to conclusions without all the facts. He pointed out that proceeds from his partnership will benefit his charitable foundation, not him, and insisted, ""My idea was born out of creativity and charity ... not profit."" Bringing him into this debate, the rapper added, isn't fair -- especially since the truth hasn't been established in the racial profiling cases. ""Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately?"" he wrote. ""The negligent, erroneous reports and attacks on my character, intentions, and the spirit of this collaboration have forced me into a statement I didn't want to make without the full facts."" Jay-Z added that he and his team are working ""to get to the bottom of these incidents and at the same time find a solution that doesn't harm all those that stand to benefit from this collaboration."" ""I am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgments, no matter who it's towards, aren't I committing the same sin as someone who profiles?"" he said. ""I am no stranger to being profiled and I truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position. Hopefully this brings forth a dialogue to effect real change."" Accuser: 'I was attacked' A day earlier, 21-year-old Kayla Phillips made her case public, telling reporters she was forcefully stopped by four plainclothes officers after leaving the high-end retailer with her purchase in February. She and Trayon Christian, 19, who claimed he also was racially profiled after purchasing a belt at Barneys in April, want damages from the store and the New York Police Department. Christian has already filed a lawsuit. Phillips said that she had been eyeing an orange suede Celine bag after a friend bought the $2,500 arm candy for his mother. After showing the cashier her ID, Phillips paid at the register and left the store with the item in a Barneys bag. She walked out of the Madison Avenue store to 59th Street, where the officers stopped her, Phillips said. ""I was attacked,"" Phillips said. The officers -- three male and one female -- questioned Phillips on her Barneys purchase, she said. ""How did you buy this bag, where did you get the money from?"" the female officer asked her, Phillips said. Phillips showed them her debit card, which the female officer took and showed to her partners, bending and examining it, she said. After verifying Phillips' purchase and returning her card, the officers let her go and did not apologize, she said. In a prepared statement, Mark Lee, CEO of Barneys New York, said ""no customer should have the unacceptable experience described in recent media reports, and we offer our sincere regret and deepest apologies."" ""We want to reinforce that Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination. Our mission is to ensure that all customers receive the highest-quality service -- without exception,"" Lee said. Speaking to the claims by Christian, the company said no employee was involved ""in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale."" In a statement, the New York Police Department said, ""We are investigating the allegation."" The department directed CNN to its legal department. Kareem Vessup, Phillips' attorney, said an impending lawsuit could seek $5 million in punitive damages, but the exact amount is still undetermined. He said both Barneys and the NYPD should reevaluate their practices on ""shop and frisk."" ""There's a call for change,"" Vessup said. ""How long had this been going on? Who else may have been affected by this practice?"" Christian, a New York City College of Technology student, entered Barneys on April 29 to buy a Ferragamo belt he had seen rappers wear on television, his attorney, Michael Palillo, told CNN on Wednesday. Christian bought the belt, left the store and walked a block before two undercover police officers stopped him, Palillo said. When they saw the designer belt, they asked him how he was able to afford it, Palillo said. The officers allegedly accused him of purchasing the belt with a fraudulent card and said they had received a call from Barneys, according to Palillo. Christian said he was detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated, as police contacted Chase Bank to check his card, Palillo said. When they confirmed that his card was valid, police released Christian and apologized, Palillo said. In a similar incident, HBO television actor Robert Brown announced at a news conference Friday that he was racially profiled at Macy's in New York's Herald Square in June. Brown alleges that he was stopped by at least three plainclothes officers, accused of using a fraudulent credit card and detained in a holding cell inside the store. Brown, star of HBO's ""Treme,"" has filed a lawsuit against the NYPD seeking yet-to-be-specified damages, he said. The NYPD did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding Brown's claims. Macy's is investigating the allegations, wrote Elina Kazan, vice president of media relations for Macy's, in an e-mail to CNN, but did note that they ""do not comment on matters in litigation.""

"(CNN) -- Here's a big idea that needs to sink in quickly: Car crashes and motorcycle accidents are symptoms of a disease, and it's high time we started looking at killer roads as a public health crisis -- or ""pandemic,"" as the Pulitzer Center put it recently. We think of HIV/AIDS and malaria as the big bad killer illnesses. They are among them, of course. But they've also got the advantage of having the world's attention. Meanwhile, as the developing world continues to build more roads and buy more cars, road traffic deaths have emerged as a new and growing crisis -- one that's a threat to global public health. ""In the developing world, in a very short time, (road deaths) are going to leapfrog past all of these more famous diseases and will be the No. 5 killer in the developing world,"" said Tom Hundley, a senior editor at the Pulitzer Center, which launched an extensive project in August called ""Roads Kill."" That switch will happen, according to World Health Organization data, because malaria and HIV/AIDS are becoming less likely to kill a person, while deaths from road traffic accidents are expected to increase in coming decades. The ongoing Pulitzer project highlights sobering facts: Roads kill 1.24 million people each year, and by 2030, that annual number is expected to jump to 3.6 million. Sometimes laws are the problem. For instance, Nigeria only recently started requiring new drivers to pass tests. More often, it seems, enforcement is a culprit. South Africa requires seat belts for front and back seat passengers, the center reports. But it got a rating of only 1 on a scale of 1 to 10 for enforcement, with 10 being the best. Meanwhile, front seat passengers who wear seat belts reduce their risk of dying in a crash by 40% to 50%, according to the World Health Organization. The Dominican Republic has just about the highest number of road traffic deaths per capita, according to the World Health Organization. ""Travel at night on intercity highways and in rural areas should be avoided, due to animals on the road, poor road conditions, poor lane markers, missing manhole covers, large potholes, unmarked speed bumps, and other vehicles being driven at excessive speeds, often with malfunctioning headlights or taillights,"" the U.S. State Department says on its website for travelers to the Dominican Republic. ""Drivers should be aware that road hazards and closures are often indicated by piles of debris littered across the roadway, without any lettered signs or reflective surfaces to help call attention to the road condition. Often times, there is no indication of the road hazard whatsoever."" China has the highest total number of road deaths. In many developing countries, Hundley told me, traffic cops are on foot -- meaning they can't chase down speeding cars. ""You could run a red light or speed with impunity,"" he said. Motorcycles in Southeast Asia often carry entire families. That's got to create balance issues, and not everyone wears a helmet. ""A lot of these countries have helmet laws -- so the driver wears a helmet,"" he said, ""but his wife and two children don't."" Saddest of all is that, like many other killers, unsafe roads primarily are victimizing people in poorer countries. Income inequality factors in, too. ""If you're the rich guy in an SUV and you hit a child on a bicycle, you just take off"" in some countries with weak law enforcement, Hundley said. ""Or you pay a small fine."" If road deaths are part of a disease, we know the cure. Countries like the United States and Australia have greatly lowered their rates of road deaths, in part with smart safety laws and levels of traffic enforcement that don't exist in some other nations. Australia used to be a country of ""reckless drivers,"" the Pulitzer Center writes. ""But strict enforcement of safe driving laws resulted in an 80% decline in road fatalities"" over several decades. In the United States, the rate of road deaths per 100,000 people was 15.64 in 1994, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That rate had declined to 10.39 by 2011. One of the most interesting things about the Pulitzer project is it has kickstarted conversations about road safety all over the world. Dan McCarey, a Web developer at the Pulitzer Center, told me people from Venezuela to South Africa have been talking about it. ""It was big in Iran for a couple days,"" he said. These conversations need to happen, in part because of the increasing death toll, but also because solutions are relatively simple, especially compared to more stubborn global health problems like malaria, which also is a worthy issue. Road deaths should roll onto the global radar. That's where you come in. Everyone has a story about a dangerous road in the town or a traffic law they'd love to see changed. Take a look at the Pulitzer report -- it has a map where you can look up your country -- and tweet about what you want to change, or what you've experienced on the roads in the place where you live. The group suggests using the hashtag #roadskill. I'll do the same. I may tweet about how I've been on buses in Madagascar that turn their lights off at night because they think they're saving gas. Or about the driver in Atlanta who ran into me while I was biking because he didn't yield on a left turn. No one anecdote will solve this problem, but the more we talk about it the closer we'll get. And if Twitter isn't your thing, I'd love to hear your road stories in the comments section below. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Roads kill 1.24 million people per year, according to the WHO .

"(CNN) -- When tragedies occur, such as the one at the Navy Yard in Washington this week, all Americans are deeply affected. They include the one in four American adults who experience mental health problems. That's approximately 60 million Americans. Their first reaction is much like that of anyone else: feelings of anger and anguish and wanting to know when such events will ever stop. But there's another, secondary impact to this community if a history of mental illness is suspected. Tragically, in the case with the Navy Yard gunman, mental illness appears to be a factor. But in too many cases, people simply assume that it is, no matter how much we caution that it's best not to attempt to diagnose any medical condition speculatively through the news media. Unfortunately, stigma surrounds mental illness. It's most associated with a violent stereotype. The result has always been fear, prejudice and discrimination toward anyone struggling with a mental health problem. The stereotype endures despite the fact that the U.S. surgeon general has found that the likelihood of violence from people with mental illness is low. In fact, ""the overall contribution of mental disorders to the total level of violence in society is exceptionally small."" Despite the impact of the Navy Yard tragedy and those of Newtown, Aurora and Virginia Tech on perceptions, a much greater, different reality exists. Many thousands of veterans experience post-traumatic stress disorder. Civilian employees of the military seek help for depression; teachers live with anxiety disorders. Students succeed academically while managing bipolar disorder. People living with schizophrenia may be psychologists, professors, peer counselors or businesspersons. They are all members of their communities. Few are violent. In the face of violence, people may simply be unable to fathom how an event could occur other than through mental illness, thought of often in non-medical terms such as ""madness"" or ""insanity."" Their perceptions also are conditioned by headlines that largely overshadow the greater reality. Stigma perpetuated by the Navy Yard tragedy will be internalized by many people living with mental health problems, causing them to stay silent and withdraw from others. This will impede their recovery in many ways. Stigma will remain a major barrier that keeps people reaching out for help when they need it. In the wake of such tragedies, some will call for persons with mental health problem to be ""screened out"" by employers in the hiring process or to deny them security clearances. In the first case, the Americans with Disabilities Act provides some protection against discrimination, but it is not always followed or easily enforced. With top secret security clearances, just ask any member of the military or government official or contractor about the anxiety they often feel if they need to see a psychiatrist and then needing to disclose it as part of a security clearance application or review. Many issues need to be addressed in the case of the Navy Yard tragedy and the tragedies before it. They include what happened -- or didn't happen -- in the military and veterans mental health care systems, particularly when the gunman allegedly sought help from the Veterans Health Administration. Was there effective engagement? The response of law enforcement should also be addressed. In theory, had the police both arrested and charged the gunman in past incidents involving a gun or disorderly conduct, he would have been put into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database and prohibited from buying a gun, regardless of his mental health status. It is also possible that his case might have been handled by a mental health court, leading to supervision and treatment. Had Rhode Island police who responded to the gunman's 911 call for help in August been trained for crisis intervention and worked with a mobile crisis unit to have him medically evaluated, then perhaps this past week's horrors could have been averted. Those are issues that must be pursued. But in the haste to respond, let's not stigmatize or discriminate against the millions of American who live productively with mental illness and who share the anguish and anger of other Americans in response to tragic horrors. If stigma wins, things won't get better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael J. Fitzpatrick.","Approximately 60 million American adults experience mental health problems .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia will let its female athletes compete in the Olympics for the first time, its embassy in London said. Until now, Saudi Arabia was one of three countries that did not allow women to participate in the games. The other two -- Qatar and Brunei -- also reversed course this year and said they will send female athletes to the London games, which begin July 27. ""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes to reaffirm its support for the sublime meanings reflected by Olympic Games and the cherished values of excellence, friendship and respect that they represent,"" the Saudi Embassy in London said in a statement announcing the decision. The International Olympic Committee had been pressing Saudi Arabia to allow women to compete and act as officials, and said in March that talks were going well. ""IOC is confident that Saudi Arabia is working to include women athletes and officials at the Olympic Games in London in accordance with the International Federations' rules,"" the committee said March 19. Palestinian female Olympian: 'Miracles do happen' The decision is a rare concession for a kingdom where women are banned from driving. They also cannot vote or hold public office, though that will change in 2015. Women in Saudi Arabia also cannot marry, leave the country, go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian, who usually is the father or husband. Much of public life is segregated by gender. When it came to sports, female athletes were barred from the Olympic Games because they would be participating in front of a mixed-gender crowd. The Saudi Embassy did not say what prompted the kingdom to change its mind. Officials in Saudi Arabia could not immediately be reached for comment. Can Saudi women be competitive at Olympics? The embassy statement added that women who qualify for the Games will be allowed to participate, raising questions how many female athletes will be ready at such short notice. Dalma Rushdi Malhas, who became the first Saudi woman to compete in the Youth Olympics, praised the decision, calling it ""a dream come true."" ""This just opens so many doors for women,"" Malhas, an equestrian, told CNN International. Malhas said she won't be competing in London games this year because her horse suffered a minor injury, but didn't rule out future competitions. ""I look forward to giving my best and I'm determined to keep on trying for the next Games, hopefully,"" she said. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch issued a report in which it said the Saudi government's policy of banning women's participation in national competitive sports reflects the ""predominant conservative view that opening sports to women and girls will lead to immorality: 'steps of the devil,' as one prominent religious scholar put it."" In 2009 and 2010, the country closed private gyms for women, and its schools' curriculum does not include physical education classes for women, the rights group said. And while the Saudi National Olympic Committee selects athletes to represent it in competition, the committee does not have a women's section. Saudi Arabia's 153 official sports club are also closed to women, Human Rights Watch said. The only exception is the female basketball section of Jeddah United, a private sports company that is not among the official sports clubs, the group said. For its part, Qatar will send three women to London this year: a shooter, a swimmer and a runner. Brunei will send a woman who will compete in hurdling.","One Saudi athlete praises the decision as ""a dream come true""

"(CNN) -- Is Rory McIlroy saving his best for last? The Northern Irishman carded a seven-under-par second round of 65 at the Australian Open Friday as he bids to end 2013 with a bang. Former world No. 1 McIlroy has endured a frustrating year, failing to find his best form with his new Nike clubs and slipping to sixth in the world rankings. But the 24-year-old golfer finished the day with nine birdies, and just two bogeys to move to 10 under for the tournament, only two strokes off leader and Australian favorite Adam Scott. ""Obviously when you come to a tournament where you're one of the headline acts or main attractions, you want to live up to that billing I guess,"" McIlroy joked with reporters. ""For the most part this year I haven't wherever I went. So it's nice,"" he added. ""It's nice to reward the people that invite you down here and look after you so well."" The 2013 season has largely slipped by the two-time major winner McIlroy, who has struggled to recapture the form which saw him win four PGA Tour titles and two European Tour titles and the PGA Championship in 2012. In contrast to McIlroy, Scott has enjoyed a stellar 2013. The Australian has shot up to No. 2 in the world rankings, thanks in part to his first major triumph at the Masters in April. The 33-year-old shot a course record 62 on Thursday and followed it up with a two-under 70 on Friday to move to 12 under for the opening two rounds. Scott and McIlroy will be paired together for Saturday's third round at the Royal Sydney Golf Club. ""Obviously he (McIlroy) is one of the best players in the world, so I'm going to have to bring my best game and try and match it with him,"" said Scott. He is aiming to complete the Australian Triple Crown, by adding the Australian Open titles to the Australian PGA and Australian Masters titles he has already claimed. Robert Allenby in 2005 is the only player to have won the Australian Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open in the same season.","Rory McIlroy moves to within two shots of leader Adam Scott at the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- When you're the head of one of the biggest broadcast networks in the world, the last thing you want to hear from your teenage daughter is that they don't want a TV in their home. ""That wasn't gonna fly. Not for one minute,"" says Anne Sweeney, co-chair of Disney Media Networks and president of the Disney/ABC Television Group, after her daughter moved to college and snubbed the idea of taking the ubiquitous tube. ""I said to her: 'Rosemary, television has been very very good to you. You will have a television if I have to nail it to your wall.' ""And it was one of those 'Mom, you don't understand. I watch everything online now.'"" Anne Sweeney might be one of the most powerful people in television -- overseeing ABC TV, ABC Studios, and Disney Channels Worldwide. But when it comes to predicting trends, her two children have always been ahead of the pack. ""I've always said, if you want to know what the future is, ask a nine-year-old because they're just so adept,"" said the 56-year-old, who Fortune named the 18th most powerful woman in business. ""What they taught me was to be less parochial, less conventional, to be more daring. They were so free to experiment with technology. I remember my son putting a piece of liquorice into the VCR and not understanding why he couldn't see it on the television set."" The future of television . ""Create what's next,"" has become Sweeney's motto, and under her leadership she's steered the company through a brave new world where watching television is no longer about families gathering around a hulking black box in the corner of the room. Indeed, in 2005 she got a call from Apple's Steve Jobs -- ""I thought, 'that's cool, I've always wanted to talk to Steve Jobs'"" -- about a new piece of technology, the video iPod. ""As I held the video iPod in my hand I thought, 'I really like this.' I was watching an episode of Lost -- the sound was pristine, the quality of the picture was excellent. ""No one knew that that would be the beginning of probably the biggest moment in our television group -- this move towards technology that would make our content available wherever you are, on whatever device you're holding at that moment."" Under Sweeney, Disney/ABC Television Group became the first media company to put television content on new platforms -- eventually selling videos on iTunes. It's something we now take for granted as we watch our favorite programs in the palm of our hands. In 2006, it also became the first network to stream full episodes online, winning an Emmy for technical innovation. Day in the life . Not bad for someone critics initially said didn't have enough experience for the top job at Disney/ABC. Funnily enough, Sweeney agrees. ""I knew they were right,"" she said, joining the company in 1996 after working 12 years at Nickelodeon's Nick at Nite in various executive positions, and later as chairman and CEO of FX Networks, Inc. for three years. ""I didn't have the experience. But I really didn't care what people said because I was so excited to lead ABC,"" she says, adding: ""My strategy was to go in and learn."" Today, Sweeney heads almost 10,000 employees, overseeing 107 channels in 166 countries. This is a woman who rises at 4.30 am every morning, receiving anywhere between 300 and 500 emails each day -- ""I read through them quickly, and I delegate well,' she says. Mom's the word . Growing up in New York, Sweeney's mother was a teacher, her father a school principal, and she describes her mom as both her first mentor and a ""powerhouse."" Her dream job as a child was to be a ballerina and later an actress. Sweeney received a masters in education from Harvard University, before landing a job at Nickelodeon in the early 1980s, and in 1993 moved to FX Networks, Inc. ""Going to FOX and working for Rupert Murdoch was like being handed a saddle and given a horse and just told to ride, go fast,"" she says. ""There was tremendous creative freedom."" Family first .

"(CNN) -- Lindsey Vonn suffered a mild strain to her right knee, a partial tear to her right ACL, and minor facial abrasions as a result of a recent fall, her spokesman said Wednesday. The U.S. ski queen crashed Tuesday during a training run at Copper Mountain in Colorado. ""She needs to rest for a few days and then will pursue aggressive physical therapy and will determine the next time she is able to compete after seeing how she responds to the treatment,"" said Lewis Kay, her spokesman. Vonn also suffered scapular contusions from the fall, he said. Lindsey Vonn crashes in training run . In February, she was airlifted to a hospital after she landed heavily on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria. She tore the ACL and MCL in her right knee, and underwent surgery for knee reconstruction. Vonn was crowned America's snow queen when she became the first American woman to win the Olympic downhill title at the Vancouver Games in 2010. She followed up her Vancouver victory with a stellar World Cup season in 2011-2012, winning 12 races and the overall title with a new record points haul. A combination of illness and injury disrupted Vonn's dominance on the slopes last season. She had planned to return at the World Cup event in Beaver Creek, Colorado on November 29.

"(CNN) -- Before this week, Hasen Poreya's hometown was pretty much off the map. But Poreya worked with a group of volunteers who call themselves the Afghan Map Makers to walk the streets of Herat, Afghanistan, over the course of several weeks, pen and pencil in hand, to fill in the details. The group uploaded the data they collected to a Google program called Map Maker, and now the maps are freely available online. An area of western Afghanistan that, according to the Web, contained only two major highways is now digitally dotted with side streets, parks and universities. ""Afghanistan has passed decades of war and misery, but now is the time to rise up and construct the country and develop the abilities for making infrastructure, bringing technologies, being up to date,"" Poreya wrote in an e-mail. He added: ""Afghanistan totally doesn't not have any base map on the Internet, except old satellite imagery with a very low quality. Since we started our works we could finish Herat City, which is one of major cities in Afghanistan, and now Herat has a complete base map over the Internet."" Google announced Thursday that the efforts of volunteers like Poreya have led to several previously uncharted countries and territories being mapped online. They are: Afghanistan, Antarctica, Ecuador, Georgia, Guatemala, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Honduras, Iraq, Norfolk Island, Saint Pierre & Miquelon and Saudi Arabia. Google describes its ""Map Maker"" project this way: . ""These citizen cartographers help keep maps of their areas accurate and up to date. They add missing roads and new businesses -- and even map areas that have little to no data yet on Google Maps."" The company praised Poreya's efforts in conjunction with other volunteers and a university: . ""Striking for its charm, bustle and impressive historic architectural treasures, the silk road city of Herat, Afghanistan has until today, been nearly 'invisible' online in digital maps. Luckily, Herat is home to Herat University, which is filled with talented, entrepreneurial students some of whom have worked together to literally put their town 'on the (digital) map,' "" Google wrote in a blog post. The company added: ""This story is far more significant than the mapping of a city. It is a story of young people in a community coming together, taking ownership of their future and serving their country in a truly entrepreneurial and meaningful way."" You can watch the changes emerge in this time-lapse videos on YouTube, including one of the mapping progression in Herat. And here's some interesting background on maps in Kabul, Afghanistan, from the BBC: . ""At one of Kabul's Post Office distribution centres, I saw more than 30 private and official letters. None had an exact address - just a series of vague directions. One, which had been sent from America, simply states, 'Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace.'"" It underscores the impact of maps. They help a country function. For Poreya, this project was about much more than cartography. He hopes to help map the rest of Afghanistan. ""It has always been my honor to help the country, which had nothing but war,"" he said. ""This is my home ... and we are all hoping one day (to) have a peaceful country with great honors and glories over the world. ""The special thing for me is to make known the unknown (in) Afghanistan.""","Volunteers in remote countries are uploading data to Google Maps .

"(CNN) -- There's a plaque affixed to the wall inside the lounge room of the downtown Cairo studio where Bassem Youssef films ""Al Bernameg"" (""The Program""), the Arab world's most watched TV show. ""Sarcasm,"" reads the top line in big capital letters. ""Because beating the f*** out of people is illegal,"" it continues. Reading the sign, Youssef's face instinctively turns into a familiar wide grin, similar to the one with which he greets the legions of viewers who tune in every week to watch him poking fun at news and politics. But seconds later he shifts to a slightly more pensive stance. ""Sometimes you are too emotional to do things that might be illegal, so you revert to sarcasm and comedy,"" says Youssef, who is frequently described as ""Egypt's Jon Stewart."" ""It's a huge weapon,"" he adds. ""It's a very important weapon."" Egyptian movie star: 'Arabs are not terrorists' Armed with sharp-tongued humor, Youssef has become an icon for many in post-revolutionary Egypt. A trained heart surgeon, he started his satirical show from his flat amid the uprising, posting his work on YouTube. It got so popular that a major Egyptian channel picked it up. Since then, his satirical show has been drawing in tens of millions of viewers week in, week out, not just in Egypt but also across the Middle East and North Africa. Yet not everyone is a fan. Just a few months ago, Egypt's public prosecutor charged him with defaming President Mohamed Morsy, insulting Islam and spreading false news. Islamists have also filed a number of legal complaints on political or religious grounds, but activists say it's part of a campaign to silence the TV host. Youssef says the reaction is rooted in Egypt's patriarchal society, a culture which, he says, does not tolerate criticism of those who are deemed more powerful: from elders to authorities. ""This is what has put us down as a community, as a population, for so long. We can't really talk back,"" says the 39-year-old. ""It was fine when it was your parents but it's not fine when it's people with authority,"" he adds. ""But we do that and we do it with humor and we do it with sarcasm. And people equate being laughed at as being ridiculed, (saying) 'I can't be ridiculed by this little dot dot dot brat' -- you can put whatever you want about me."" Read this: 'Egypt's Brad Pitt' calls for people power . Last week Youssef welcomed to Al Bernameg Jon Stewart, the popular American comedian and host of the ""Daily Show."" For 20 minutes, the two satirists engaged in a wide-ranging conversation that veered from hilarious to serious to poignant, notwithstanding Stewart's support for his Egyptian counterpart. ""It doesn't get me into the kind of trouble that gets you into,"" Stewart told Youssef in response to a question about any backlash he's faced. ""I get into trouble but nowhere near what happens to you,"" added Stewart, before continuing, ""if your regime is not strong enough to handle a joke, then you don't have a regime."" While Youssef's comedy has brought him trouble on many occasions, the satirist says he's going to continue pushing the boundaries and battling for freedom of speech. ""This is by far the most important issue that everybody should fight for,"" he says. ""If you start to suppress people's freedom of speech under whatever excuse you want -- 'it's not good for the country, it's not good for the building of the country' -- so every time they say this, we raise the ceiling, we raise the roof, we push it further. And I'm going to do this until the ceiling is broken or we are shut down."" Shutting down is a real possibility, as lawsuits continue to be filed. But Youssef shrugs off the prospect with his usual humor. ""I'm going to have a holiday if they stop me,"" he smirks. ""Ah, I need a holiday."" He admits, however, that dealing with Egypt's day-to-day reality does have an effect on him. ""It brings me down all the time,"" says Youssef. ""It's very difficult to write a show with all this happening; it becomes very depressing and it's overwhelming, it overshadows everything that you do."" Yet he remains adamant that comedy is key for Egypt to get through the current turmoil. ""Countries aren't built by boring people,"" he says. ""As matter of fact, entertainment is a great industry so it helps to actually build the country. ""The thing is we aren't just being funny 'haha,' we are criticizing political situations. You can't just let it go. Other people can talk for hours about what's going on in the country. We take a couple of jokes and everyone talks about the problem. ""So, in a way, we are building the country.""","Bassem Youssef is known as 'Egypt's Jon Stewart'

"(CNN) -- Politicians and historians love to use the word ""crossroads."" It's become as American, and cliched, as ""Mom's apple pie."" The historian Shelby Foote, wrote, ""The Civil War defined us as what we are and it opened us to being what we became, good and bad things. ... It was the crossroads of our being, and it was a hell of a crossroads."" I have been thinking about the word, because this year's Black History Month theme is ""At the Crossroads of Freedom and Equality: The Emancipation Proclamation and the March on Washington."" Two pivotal events that shaped modern American history. A ""crossroads"" is literally the intersection of two or more roads -- two or more paths to get to the same place. Metaphorically, it refers to the place -- the moment -- of a critical decision. Shall we go forward together? Shall we separate? Shall we fight? We mark history's crossroads not by road signs but by the documents that identify them. The Declaration of Independence is certainly one. Who has not memorized the opening of the second paragraph? ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness."" Political philosopher John Locke's original term was, ""Life, liberty, and property."" Thomas Jefferson borrowed the phrase, changing ""property"" to ""the pursuit of happiness."" He understood that ""happiness"" -- being significant -- was more important than property, and that a ""right to property"" too often meant a ""right"" to own someone else, i.e. slavery. Locke rejected the ""divine right of kings."" He argued instead that God invested each person with an innate equality -- the right to be on this Earth and to be free -- free to pursue dreams. On the way to his first inauguration, Abraham Lincoln stopped at Independence Hall in Philadelphia to celebrate Washington's birthday. He told the assembled crowd, ""I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence."" Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 was another crossroads, one that required Lincoln, and the nation, to walk a long road of personal and national growth. ""All men are created equal"" had to take on a deeper meaning. Frederick Douglass, one of Lincoln's ""guides"" on his journey, later said the quality he most admired in Lincoln was his political courage. Confederate President Jefferson Davis once acknowledged to an Atlantic Monthly writer that Lincoln's Emancipation resulted in the self-liberation of ""two millions of our slaves."" A journey of a hundred years brought us to another crossroads -- the 1963 March on Washington. While ""property in man"" no longer existed, millions of Americans were unable to pursue their dream, or to live with full equality. James Farmer, a leading civil rights activist who was in jail in my home state of Louisiana, sent a message to the quarter-million in attendance that summer day, saying his people would not be free ""until the dogs stop biting us in the South and the rats stop biting us in the North."" Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, like the Declaration, resonates. It echoes through the years in the heartbeats of Americans. The ""pursuit of happiness"" is more than pleasure, for we often take great pains in the pursuit. Rather, the pursuit of happiness is the freedom to pursue our dreams, to make meaning in and find the unique significance of our lives. That is something we can only do when, in the bonds of fellowship and shared history, we nurture our dreams. The caged bird sings of freedom, but the freed bird sings of dreams. Today, we are 150 years further down the road to realizing the American creed of equality and freedom. We reached a crossroads in 2008 with the election of our first African-American president. We chose to continue on the road to a ""post-racial"" society. We're not there yet. But in 2012, when we could have chosen to travel down another road, one that led to further economic inequality, we chose instead to continue the realization of equality and freedom, and to the unfettered pursuit of dreams for each American. In some ways, the re-election of President Obama is more significant than his election four years ago. I say this not because I'm a Democrat, but because this time, the dog-whistles of racism were called out and condemned by people of faith and goodwill on both sides of the aisle. During the next four years, we'll come to more crossroads. I pray, and believe, we will take the road to freedom and equality for each child, man and woman in America.

"New York (CNN) -- Can liberals ever be happy? I keep asking myself this question as I hear an increasing number complaining about President Obama. There seems to be a Greek chorus of liberal whining: ""I'm disappointed by him."" ""I expected more."" ""I thought he would be different."" Earlier this week, singer Jackson Browne, a vocal 2008 Obama supporter, lamented that President Obama is ""...just as beholden to the people who put him in office as any of the Republicans would be."" Matt Damon, who had very publicly supported Obama in 2008, has now very publicly attacked President Obama. Damon even went so far as to heap praise on former President Bush, saying: ""I would kiss George W. Bush on the mouth"" in appreciation for his work fighting AIDS in Africa. Although Damon did note his kiss of Bush would be limited to: ""Three seconds, no tongue."" Others turning on Obama include John Cusack, comedian/actor Jon Lovitz, and even the distinguished professor Cornel West, who called Obama: ""A black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats."" A new Gallup Poll released this week found that President Obama's support among liberals was at its lowest point in seven months, although it's still a solid majority of 70%. What's clear is that the liberals speaking out don't want a president, they want a king. Albeit a liberal king -- but still a king, who would be unrestrained by Congress as well as the checks and balances enshrined in our Constitution. These disenchanted liberals apparently wanted Obama -- upon taking office -- to have instantly transformed every campaign promise into law by the simple wave of a pen. Or maybe they would have preferred Obama to have walked out onto a White House balcony where, in a scene reminiscent of the musical ""Evita,"" he would be greeted by adoring throngs waiting below, and on the spot, declare that all his ideas were now the law of the land. But here's the problem. Barack Obama is not a king, he's the president of the United States. For those who may have forgotten the ""Schoolhouse Rock"" cartoon of ""How a bill becomes a law,"" Congress needs to first pass the bill before it has any chance of becoming a law. Our Founding Fathers set up a governmental structure that requires the president to engage in give and take with the legislative branch. Of course, if the Founding Fathers could see the current state of our dysfunctional Congress, they may have instead chosen a dictatorship. But they didn't, instead drafting a system to guard us against tyranny. Consequently, President Obama is required to navigate through myriad vested interests that exercise influence on the 535 members of Congress. Keep in mind most of Congress was in office before President Obama was elected and most will be there when he leaves. Powerful members of Congress are like summer camp counselors and Obama is like the camper. He will only be there a relatively short amount of time, but they will remain to run the camp. And they know it. Thus, as opposed to a king, a president has to engage in activity that some on the left view as a dirty word. That wicked word is: compromise. In fairness, there are many on the far right who also disdain compromise. Who can forget tea party darling Herman Cain's statement: ""...people are sick and tired of this word in Washington: compromise. This is why nothing ever gets done."" (This is amazing logic, because you would normally think it was the lack of compromise that prevents things from getting done in Washington.) To me, the liberals who are so very disappointed with President Obama either had unrealistic expectations for him, viewing him as a messianic figure who would magically solve all of our nation's woes, or simply refuse to grasp the reality of our American political system. In either case, the answer is: The problem is not Obama, it's you. Being president requires some degree of compromise due to the very nature of our government. That is the way it has been for more than 200 years. While President Obama may be far from perfect -- and, I, too, have been disappointed with some of his decisions -- I certainly prefer him to a king. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: A growing number of prominent liberals criticize President Obama .

"(EW.com) -- For the first time ever, pioneering MTV reality series ""The Real World"" is changing its format. After 21 years and 28 seasons, ""The Real World"" is shaking things up with a twist and name change for its upcoming edition, which has the show returning to San Francisco. Arguably TV's second longest-running reality show (the first would be ""COPS,"" which launched in 1989), ""The Real World"" will be re-titled ""Real World: Ex-Plosion"" when it airs next year. The season begins like any other: Seven young, attractive and single diverse castmates from around the country move into a house. They'll start to form bonds, with each other and with San Francisco locals. Then, one month into the three-month shoot, they'll go away for a day trip. When they return, they're in for a huge shock: Their exes have moved in too. Discovery's new survival series: 'Dude, You're Screwed!' Jonathan Murray, who co-created the series with Mary Ellis-Bunim, notes the show's diverse-mix-of-strangers-in-a-house format isn't quite as earth-shattering of a format these days. Many reality shows — from Fox's ""Hell's Kitchen"" to CBS' ""Big Brother"" — use bunking together as merely one component of the show's drama. ""When 'The Real World' went on the air in '92, you put seven diverse people together and you get conflict, and out of that conflict would come change, and then you have a story,"" Murray says. ""Now that it's 21 years or so later, maybe we're a bit of a victim of our own success. Diversity is a fact of life today. A lot of young people date people of different races, or have friends who are gay. The world has changed. We've had conversations [with the network] throughout 28 seasons of the show, but we've never made this big of a commitment to change."" There was also the issue of the show's ratings. ""The Real World"" has proved incredibly durable considering how much the reality genre has evolved, and how many reality shows have come and gone on MTV — the network has always prided itself on trying to find the next bright and trend-setting idea. Yet MTV has gone from ordering two ""Real Worlds"" a year down to one as the show's numbers have fallen — the most recent season averaged 1.5 million viewers. MTV and Murray hope the new format will make the show appointment viewing once again. The Exes twist has been done in reality TV before (Big Brother's ""X Factor"" twist in 2003), but Murray suggests the idea came about in a more organic way. ""When we cast people we usually always try to cast single people,"" he said. ""And they'd say they were single during the casting process. Then the moment they arrived at the house suddenly their ex was back in their life. I don't know if it's a safety blanket or that we're never really done with our exes. When you talk about the age of our cast, their ex is often their first love — they play a huge role in their life."" Lifetime to launch new Tim Gunn fashion series . When casting season 29, producers sought singles who had particularly interesting relationships with their exes — there's the person who's really close friends with the ex, the one that's always getting texts from his ex, etc. After filming began, producers had to scramble to convince the exes to drop everything and join the cast too — five of the seven agreed. ""Four weeks into the show, after some [housemates] started to develop new relationships, the exes come in — thus, Ex-Plosion,"" Murray said. ""Then it got really complicated and really interesting. I'm still shocked we were able to pull it off."" ""We wanted to give our audience a fresh take on the series,"" added Susanne Daniels, president of programming, MTV. ""We are excited about this season's twists and unexpected turns."" Now that the format has changed, a move that acknowledges the show's own need to evolve, one must wonder: Can ""The Real World"" ever go back? Murray says the brainstorming sessions that led to ""Ex-Plosion"" inspired many other potential twists as well. ""We always approach it one season at a time. We will get this show on the air, see how people react and then decide. We had probably 10 good ideas for the season. This was one. Maybe there will be another good idea for season 30."" Fox orders comedy pilot from 'Big Bang Theory' star Johnny Galecki . In another twist, the housemates were given smartphones for the first time, for posting messages and photos throughout their experience in the house. During filming, the messages and photos were only viewable on a closed system viewable by the housemates, their friends and family (and their exes, of course). The banked content will be gradually rolled out publicly once the show starts airing sometime next year. And what about the hot tub? Does ""The Real World"" still have a hot tub in the house for the new season or has that changed too? Murray pauses at the question. ""Of course there's a hot tub."" See the original story at EW.com.

"Editor's note: Joel I. Klein has been chancellor of the New York City Department of Education since 2002. Joel I. Klein says Caroline Kennedy became a champion for New York City's children. NEW YORK (CNN) -- I was named schools chancellor in New York City in 2002, shortly after Mayor Michael Bloomberg won control over the city's school system. At the time, our schools were in desperate need of a strong advocate. Few prominent New Yorkers were willing to take a chance on our schools -- or invest in a system that many saw as beyond repair. Caroline Kennedy was willing. I approached Caroline about serving our city's school system because it would send a powerful message to the entire city about the importance of school reform and also because I was convinced, having known her personally, that she had the right skills to put together an office of strategic partnerships to undergird our efforts. Without hesitation, Caroline joined our effort, and started building partnerships with the private sector on behalf of children. She essentially became a champion for New York City's children, who badly needed her advocacy. Before the mayor and I took charge, New York City had not actively tried to raise money for its public schools. Caroline took over an office that previously oversaw donations to PTAs and alumni associations and recreated it around a model of a public-private partnership. The model she created in New York City has led to similar efforts in other school districts across America. Private donors were historically reluctant to make gifts to public schools because there was so little accountability and transparency around spending and outcomes. Caroline created a system that measured results. A new transparency around outcomes, along with Caroline's proficiency in articulating the goals of our reforms, gave private funders an unprecedented stake in the success of schools and students and attracted large amounts of new funding. Caroline was highly focused, efficient and hands-on in this effort. She verified the value of her work by visiting schools to see how funds were affecting principals, teachers and students. She was unafraid of asking hard questions, bringing diverse groups together and looking for alternative solutions. She framed problems in ways that made them solvable. These are qualities that served New York City's 1.1 million public schoolchildren well. Under her leadership, The Fund for Public Schools has raised more than $240 million from businesses, foundations and individuals, according to the fund. Schools have used these funds to improve middle schools, improve libraries, provide arts programs and train public school principals. Caroline's belief that government can improve people's lives -- and the way she put this belief to work on behalf of the city's public schools -- has inspired many people. In my experience, Caroline's belief in and passion for public service are contagious. If she is selected to represent our state in the U.S. Senate, I have no doubt that she would put that passion, along with her estimable talents, to work for New Yorkers in every corner of our state. I've spoken with Caroline this week about her decision to seek the Senate seat. She understands that the stakes have never been higher, and she knows that New Yorkers need to have a senator who will fight for them in Washington. Caroline is prepared to work hard for New Yorkers -- bringing jobs to our state, helping us win funding for infrastructure and homeland security, and helping to improve health care and education for New Yorkers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joel Klein.","Joel I Klein: Caroline Kennedy one of few willing to advocate for New York's schools .

"(CNN) -- We are about to mark the 12th anniversary of 9/11. Since then, al Qaeda and its affiliated groups haven't launched a successful attack in the United States. The Boston Marathon bombings in April, however, serve as a reminder that the United States still faces a terrorism threat from disaffected U.S. citizens and residents who are influenced by al Qaeda's ideology. So what is the status of this kind of threat? The good news is that the number of ""homegrown"" jihadist extremists who have been indicted or convicted has steadily declined over the past few years, according to New America Foundation data. Where there were 41 cases in 2009, there have been six so far this year. The number of individuals indicted for plotting actual attacks within the United States -- as opposed to other terrorism-related crimes such as raising money for a terrorist group -- also declined from 12 in 2011 to only three so far in 2013. In recent years, extremists plotting attacks against the United States have also shown little, if any, connection to foreign groups. None of the 21 homegrown extremists involved in plots against the United States from 2011 to so far in 2013 is known to have received training abroad. Of these extremists, only one, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the alleged Boston bombers, is reported to have had contact with foreign militant operatives, but it remains unclear to what extent, if any, those contacts played a role in the Boston attack. This lack of coordination between domestic extremists and overseas groups is likely the result of two factors. First, the ability of terrorist organizations to coordinate with extremists in the United States has been reduced by policing efforts inside the country and counterterrorism operations abroad. Second, Internet use among jihadist extremists enables them to come into contact with extremist communities abroad and be radicalized without face-to-face meetings. Of the 45 ""homegrown"" jihadist extremists who were indicted, convicted or killed from 2011 to now, 18 are known to have communicated with other extremists over the Internet or posted materials related to their radicalization online. The shift to plotting by individuals who lack ties to foreign groups poses a distinct type of threat -- plots and attacks that are more difficult to detect but are also likely to be of a smaller scale. And because of the measures now in place to prevent the acquisition of precursor chemicals and materials suitable for making conventional explosives, homegrown extremists have also often struggled to produce effective bombs. Before the Boston Marathon bombings, homegrown jihadists in the United States had shown little success at producing explosives. Joseph Jeffrey Brice -- who has professed admiration for Osama bin laden and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh -- almost killed himself in April 2010 when a homemade bomb he was constructing exploded prematurely. A month later, Faisal Shahzad's car bomb failed to explode in Times Square, even though he had received explosives training in Pakistan. If the Tsarnaev brothers built the bombs used in the Boston attack without guidance from jihadists abroad, it suggests that the difficulties other ""homegrown"" militants have had building or detonating explosives may have been overcome. On the other hand, the Tsarnaevs' successful bombmaking could just as easily have been a fluke. While the number of terrorism-related indictments fell between 2009 and 2013, the number of terrorist incidents has stayed about the same -- about one per year -- though not all of them have been lethal: . -- In June 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad killed a soldier outside a recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas. -- Five months later, Major Nidal Malik Hasan shot and killed 13 people at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas. -- Shahzad's 2010 attempt to bomb Times Square was foiled when his bomb did not ignite properly. -- Yonathan Melaku's drive-by shooting of military facilities in Northern Virginia in 2011 produced no casualties. -- The Boston Marathon bombers killed four and wounded hundreds of others in April 2013. The incidents carried out by homegrown extremists continue to be limited in their lethality, and major operations such as the 9/11 attacks are well beyond the skills of even the most capable domestic extremists. Additionally, no homegrown jihadist militant in the United States is known to have acquired or used chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons in the past twelve years. This point bears repeating, as there has been considerable overheated commentary on this subject over the past decade. Of the 221 individual cases of jihadist extremism since 9/11, not one case involved an allegation of CBRN acquisition, manufacture or use. However, the fact that jihadist extremists in the United States have shown no interest in CBRN weapons does not eliminate the need for securing potential sources of chemical, biological and radiological agents. According to a count by the New America Foundation, since 2001, 13 extremists motivated by right-wing ideologies, one left-wing militant and two individuals with idiosyncratic motives have deployed, acquired or tried to acquire chemical, biological or radiological weapons. For example, William Krar and Judith Bruey, two anti-government extremists, possessed precursor chemicals for hydrogen cyanide gas, which they discussed deploying through a building's ventilation system. They were arrested in 2003 and later pleaded guilty. The threat from homegrown extremists to the U.S. homeland has been constrained in recent years by a variety of security measures. According to data collected by the New America Foundation, family members of extremists and members of the wider Muslim American community provided useful information in the investigations of about a third of the homegrown jihadist extremists indicted or killed since 9/11. Noncommunity members provided useful reports of suspicious activity in another 9% of homegrown extremist cases, while an informant or undercover agent monitored almost half of all homegrown extremists. The Boston Marathon bombing, however, demonstrate the potential for these security measures to fail when plotters have few, if any connections, to known terrorist groups. Looking forward, a concern about the Boston attack is whether it represents an intelligence failure that could have been avoided through a better implementation of existing policies or a new trend where ""lone wolf"" extremism is largely undetectable with the existing systemic checks in place. The threat from homegrown extremists has changed substantially in the past three years, becoming the province of fewer individuals who are less connected to foreign groups than was once the case. Whether this remains the case will depend on law enforcement being able to successfully adapt to confront the threat from disaffected U.S.-based individuals motivated by al Qaeda's ideology as well as whether the past few years' counterterrorism successes against al Qaeda overseas can be maintained.","Authors: Since 9/11, al Qaeda hasn't carried out a successful attack in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Since the day I rocked my first pair of door-knocker hoop earrings and a baby blue velour Rocawear sweatsuit, Jay-Z has been my guy. His swagger, his street cred gone corporate, his lyrical genius and his uncanny ability to tap into the ethos of my hip-hop generation through the decades have inspired millions from the White House to bleakest corners of Brooklyn. We can't knock the hustle. We love Jay because he eloquently raps to the world the words we often want to say but keep tucked away behind our public faces. He's been our voice for so long that many of us think it unfathomable that he finds himself tongue-tied and on the wrong side of a racial profiling case at Barneys luxury retail store in New York, after two African-American customers charged that they'd been wrongly detained and harassed by police after making expensive purchases. For a while now, Jay-Z has been planning a collaboration with Barneys for an ""exclusive"" line of luxury items for the holidays. In his first statement on why he hasn't gone along with calls to dump the deal, he said, ""I move and speak based on facts and not emotion. ""I am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and Barneys. Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately?"" he asked after his face was splashed across the New York Daily News. Not exactly fighting words coming from the man who has spent decades demanding respect and railing against racism. This is the man who led a boycott of Cristal sparkling wine and other products when he believed the companies were disrespecting the black dollar. Jay's partnership with Barneys -- called ""A New York Holiday"" -- was designed in collaboration with luxury fashion houses. The products range from a $70 T-shirt, the cheapest item in the line, to a $33,900 watch. Reportedly, the deal may bring in millions, but a quarter of the profits will go to his Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation, which helps underprivileged young people get a college education. And for that reason alone, I say Jay should stay at the table with Barneys and use his leverage to force a change in the retailer's discriminatory security practices. It wouldn't be the first time ""dirty money"" was flipped and used for a better purpose. Nearly everything Jay touches goes platinum, from street wear fashion lines like Rocawear to the new Brooklyn Nets' sports arena. So it's easy to understand how Barneys, no longer a must-shop for serious fashionistas, would need Jay and the community that supports him to help return the retailer to relevance. Jay delivers dollars, especially African-American dollars. We've helped him build a fashion empire and sell more than 50 million albums worldwide while receiving 17 Grammys. And when we saw him at No. 2 on the 2012 Forbes list of hip-hop's wealthiest artists with a net worth of nearly $500 million, we celebrated, because we knew his success was not possible without us. Now, it's time for him to give something back to the hip-hop nation that has made him a global brand. Retailers have to be vigilant about theft: More than $13 billion worth of goods are stolen each year, more than $35 million a day, according to the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention. So what's the ""profile"" of a shoplifter? FBI studies show that 70% of people arrested for shoplifting are white. In some regions of the country, two-thirds are white women. And experts on retail crime prevention say most theft is committed by the employees. The two Barneys customers, Trayon Christian and Kayla Phillips, said last week that they were racially profiled and detained by police after making expensive purchases. Christian sued Barneys, saying he was accused of fraud after using his debit card to buy a $349 Ferragamo belt in April. Philips filed a notice of claim saying she would sue after she was stopped by detectives outside the store when she bought a $2,500 Celine handbag in February. It's nearly impossible to find a black person, including myself, who can say he or she has never been harassed while shopping. It happens so frequently that we've accepted it as a normal part of life. It's one reason why I've never spent my hard-earned cash in places that make me feel unwelcomed. It's just not worth the frustration of dealing with ignorant retail workers, especially in upscale department stores, who too many times show disdain for the very customers who make their jobs possible. For now, I'm sticking with Jay and trusting that he'll find a way to step up and lead a national dialogue about retail racial profiling. It's a conversation that is long overdue. The trick with having power is learning how to wield it wisely. Staying at the table and confronting Barneys is a stronger position from which to negotiate change. And Jay, along with other community activists, is the right voice to further this conversation. As the criticism grew, Barneys said Thursday that it had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures. CEO Mark Lee offered his ""sincere regret and deepest apologies."" But beyond a review and apology, Barneys and other retailers need to have a strong, clearly defined policies against racial profiling. If members of the security or sales staff are found guilty of this offense, they should be fired. All employees should be screened for racial biases when they are hired and be trained on how to respectfully serve the diverse customers who are keeping the doors open. Because retailers like Barneys need us a lot more than we'll ever need them. Racial profiling has been business as usual for too long. Jay has the power to bring change. And I'm betting Brooklyn's finest will rise to the occasion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Luxury store Barneys accused of racial profiling; hip-hop icon Jay-Z has deal with store .

"(EW.com) -- It turns out moviegoers want fire and ice this Thanksgiving. Both ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" and Disney's ""Frozen"" are thriving at the box office, so much so that the films are on track to break records and achieve the two best Thanksgiving five-day weekends of all time. ""Catching Fire"" earned $20.7 million on Wednesday and $14.9 million on Thursday. That $35.6 million haul puts the film on track for a five-day weekend of about $100-105 million, which will handily beat ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" $82.4 million gross over the same period of time in 2001. Remarkably, ""Catching Fire"" will have earned about $290 million after just 10 days of release, and if it keeps up this pace, it will easily outdo the original ""Hunger Games'"" $408 million domestic total. EW: Box office preview - 'Frozen' ready to storm the chart, but it won't beat 'Catching Fire' ""Frozen"" is more than holding its own against the behemoth blockbuster. Disney's animated musical pulled in $26.3 million on Wednesday and Thursday ($15.2 million, then $11.1 million), a substantially bigger start than Tangled, which grossed $19.9 million in its first two days in 2010. That film wound up earning $48.8 million over the following Friday-to-Sunday period (2.45 times its Wednesday/Thursday gross), and if we apply the same metric to Frozen, it's set to gross $64 million over the traditional weekend frame for a stunning $90 million five-day start. Much less fortunate were the weekend's two other newcomers, ""Homefront"" and ""Black Nativity,"" both of which got the cold shoulder from ticket buyers. The Jason Statham vehicle ""Homefront"" grossed $2.8 million over its first two days and may only find about $9.5 million in its first five. ""Black Nativity"" fared even worse, with $1.1 million combined on Wednesday and Thursday, which may result in a $3.8 million five-day start. Given the talent involved â€” Angela Bassett, Jennifer Hudson, Forest Whitaker, Mary J. Blige â€” and the proximity to Christmas, that's a major disappointment. EW: Box office report - 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' breaks November record with $161.1 million debut . ""The Book Thief"" didn't draw huge crowds in its expansion into 1,234 theaters. The film pulled in $1.6 million on Wednesday and Thursday and looks to gross about $5.5 million through Sunday, which will give it a $6.9 million total. ""Philomena"" isn't taking off, either. Judi Dench's Oscar contender has grossed just under $1 million from 753 theaters in two days. No numbers for Spike Lee's ""Oldboy"" have come in just yet.

"(CNN) -- Sarah is selling Sarah. The former vice presidential candidate and half-term governor of Alaska is a commodity of one and a marketing machine. She has created a new politics of profit. Palin's reanimation on the tea party stage probably means no more than the other intentions she has floated but never executed. She spent almost a year of the last presidential election cycle teasing the far right that she was going to run for president. She never did, but lots of network TV interviews and speculative articles drove up her name recognition and brand identification. And she's not running again. Palin is re-running the same show in her home state of Alaska by hinting that she is going to be a candidate for the U.S. Senate. She will not run though. There is too much risk of failure. She's not the near-unknown who was elected governor of Alaska and then quit 2Â½ years into the job. She has a profile, and she intends to use it to make money, which is one commitment she knows how to keep. Running and losing is always bad for business. Palin is a product. Not a candidate. Politically, Sarah Palin is an opposite gender version of Donald Trump. She makes grandiloquent statements about candidacies and a future that she knows will never transpire. Trump and Palin lack the courage to run for president but have profitably monetized the speculation about a candidacy. Trump cannot abide the notion of losing, which he knows is inevitable, and he fears what that might do to his image and revenue stream. Palin is self-aware enough to realize that she has neither the intellect nor popular support outside the increasingly unpopular tea party. So why not make a buck? In the detritus of the McCain-Palin presidential campaign, the second name emerged as the lead act. The first nine months after her resignation as governor, at the end of July 2009, Palin reportedly earned $12 million, including a book deal, a TV show and speaking fees that were generally more than $100,000 per appearance. It's not hard to tell whether principle is more important than profit for the failed vice presidential candidate. The tea party has been charged $100,000 for a Palin speech, and, even as she promotes support of charities, a Toronto cancer center a few years ago paid $200,000 for her to attend a fund-raiser, and the event sold out at $200 a seat. Her politics and intelligence might be trifling, but Palin appears to have evolved a very nice business model: Raise the profile to raise the revenue, mostly for herself. And she's back at it. Until recently, Palin hasn't been too active, except on social media. She seems to have the entire national tea party population on her Facebook page, but the TV cameras had not been showing up when she gave her bargain-priced speeches. A love spat with Fox News that kept her off the air and then back into the network's arms has left her fans confused. Donations to Sarah PAC fell off. Why was no one paying attention? Palinians should not fear. She has seen opportunity in the tea party and its plans to beat moderate Republicans in GOP primaries. This is a nearly risk-free approach to increased Sarah-wareness. The candidate runs, Palin speaks and rallies the initiates. She endorses, and if the campaign fails it is the candidate's fault, not Palin's; she's moved on to help in another race. But the cameras came, reporters took notes, images were broadcast, words were published, and Palin's price went up. Timing is critical to maximizing opportunity, of course. When the federal government shut down as a consequence of tea party obstinacy, Palin jetted off to Washington to help her ideological consort, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, as they crashed the ""Barrycades"" at the National World War II Memorial. Those cameras and bullhorns and journalists were there. Palin had just arrived from New Jersey, where she had endorsed the hopeless tea party candidacy of Steve Lonegan, who lost, soundly, but not without Sarah getting TV time in New York. In business school, they teach ""know your customer."" Palin might have attended that class because she is promising to help tea party candidates unseat GOP U.S. senators in South Carolina, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee in 2014. The Sarah Promoting Sarah tour begins, however, several months ahead at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Foundation dinner on November 9. In what is almost certainly a coincidence of timing, just three days later, Palin's new book goes on sale for the holidays. She has not written about the Constitution or her understanding of Paul Revere in the Revolutionary War; Palin, instead, is doing the much more challenging work of preventing further harm to Christmas. ""Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas,"" can already be pre-ordered. Get yours now. Or just send a check to Palin. She might not understand politics or policy, but Palin knows money. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James C. Moore.","James Moore: Sarah Palin's revival on the tea party stage increases her brand recognition .

"(CNN) -- On the Internet, a truly private conversation is hard to come by. Personal communications on apps, e-mail and social networks are very much an open book, and they leave a trail of personal data that can potentially be accessed by criminals, corporations and government agencies. No wonder more and more people are using apps whose messages quickly disappear from phones once they've been read. Take Wickr, a self-destructing messaging app that takes security very seriously. The free app has been available on iOS for a little more than a year and on Monday, it expanded its reach to a wider audience with an Android version. Like the better-known Snapchat (and the lesser-known Poke), messages on Wickr live briefly before supposedly vanishing forever from your phone and the prying eyes of computer servers. There are many security advantages to this type of communication. The format makes it difficult for recipients to share, forward and spread messages. Any sensitive photos or texts have a better chance of not becoming a permanent artifact on the Internet. They are also deleted from the companies' servers (or in the case of Wickr, never stored on a company server), making it difficult for hackers, criminals or government agencies to retrieve old conversations. Snapchat has become hugely popular in the past year. Its users now send more than 350 million photos a day. The company has played down the security advantages of self-destructing messages, focusing instead on the playful aspects of the ""ephemeral"" messaging trend, like having fun and living in the moment. Fairly or not, the service has also developed a reputation as a platform for sexting. ""Snapchat is not a great way to send photos you want to keep safe and secure,"" said Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference last week. He cited the ability of recipients to take screenshots and of hackers to access content as reasons the platform wasn't safe for ""inappropriate photos."" Wickr was developed by computer-security experts and has some heavy-duty layers of security to keep communications anonymous and private. Each message -- whether text, photo, video or voice -- is encrypted with a one-time-use unique key, and only the sender and Wickr users have those keys. Any telling metadata is stripped out when you send attachments, and deleted messages are forensically erased, or ""shredded,"" from your device. ""No security is 100%, but we are the best available,"" said Nico Sell, CEO and co-founder of Wickr. Wickr also has a few more messaging features than the minimalist Snapchat. You can choose to let messages live for days, not just seconds. The iOS app can send encrypted attachments, though you can not yet send PDF attachments on the Android version. Wickr's founders frequently test the app with their own network of well-known hackers, and as well as with a tougher crowd: kids. ""We really made it to try and protect them from the permanence of the Internet,"" said Sell, whose own children use the app. There are always security risks. If your phone is compromised, a hacker could track keystrokes while you are typing out messages. People are another potential weak link -- someone could steal your phone while you are logged in. Or the person on the receiving end of your messages could violate your trust and share the information. ""You have to remember, there's no magic pill for betrayers,"" said Sell. Unlike Snapchat, Wickr doesn't give a notification when someone captures a screenshot. It's difficult to take one, and the company thought a notification would give users a false sense of security. Wickr doesn't just want to take on Snapchat, it also hopes to be an alternative to Facebook Messenger, Skype and free International texting tools like WhatsApp. Typical online-communication tools store information on servers indefinitely. That can include the content of messages, participants in the conversation, time stamps and even location information. Many of the companies that host the messages, like Google and Facebook, make their money on personal data which they use to sell targeted ads. They aren't invested in keeping your personal data private because it's not smart business. Wickr has a different type of business plan that isn't based on personal data. The app is free, but eventually the company will charge its power users for in-app purchases, such as paying for a message to live forever. In a year filled with increased awareness of cybersecurity and the government's ability to snoop on digital communications, Wickr's anonymous, highly secure communication may be a killer feature all on its own.","Wickr is a self-destructing messaging app created by computer-security experts .

"(CNN) -- It's approaching midnight at the bottom of the English Channel and a team of eager ""tunnel moles"" stands poised for a busy night's work. Employing a mix of hi-tech tools and no little elbow grease, the 70-strong crew of engineers and maintenance staff will carry out essential repairs on the Channel Tunnel rail link that connects southern England and northern France. At 50-kilometers (31 miles) long and buried more than 100 meters beneath the surface at its deepest point, the ""Chunnel"" -- which consists of two rail traffic tunnels split by one service passageway -- is the longest undersea structure in the world. Making sure this engineering wonder runs smoothly is a detailed and complex task. Enter site operator Eurotunnel and their beavering band of ""tunnel moles."" See also: Navigating world's busiest shipping lane . ""Outside of good design (the most important thing is) lots of maintenance,"" explained lead maintenance engineer Paul Bushell. ""You've got the ventilation supply, you've got the drainage supply, you've got the main power supply, the water supply and you got the cooling supply. All of these things are vital for the day-to-day running of the tunnel,"" he added. Keeping track . Since opening in 1994, more than 320 million people -- the equivalent of almost 5 times the population of the United Kingdom -- have traveled through the Channel Tunnel, according to Eurotunnel. The route is also estimated to carry 550,000 tonnes of cargo every day. It's no surprise then that rail tracks here wear out far quicker than those on conventional networks. After just 16 years of operations, all of the tunnel's rails have already been changed twice. Trains also bring in immense amounts of dirt and dust that, if left to fester, can cause long-term damage to equipment and infrastructure. See also: Inside world's longest undersea tunnel . ""The job of our technicians is more like being a traveling service engineer,"" Bushell said. ""The service tunnel is 50 kilometers (31 miles) long and we've got plant rooms and control rooms all along that length. So quite often our technicians can cover 100 to 150 kilometers (62 to 92 miles) in an hour shift where they visit different sites,"" he continued. Strict timetable . Covering such lengthy distances makes the Channel Tunnel one of the longest workshops in the world meaning repairs must be carried out at a breakneck pace. Engineers generally begin late at night and must have all jobs completed before early morning services begin. During the daytime hours a team of trouble-shooters ensure a prompt response to any emergencies. According to UK work site manager, Dave Bennet, these procedures require close co-operation with both English and French based engineering and planning teams. ""We're all one big company,"" said Bennet in the spirit of cross-border tunnel bonhomie. ""(Generally) English teams do work on their own (and) French teams do work on their own but we also all work together. Language isn't really a barrier. Most of us are bilingual and that works both ways so it's not a problem for us,"" he added. See also: Silk road railways link Asia and Europe . Some long-serving engineers have been working in the tunnel since it was first opened in 1994. Others were even involved in the construction process itself, ensuring they know the deepest darkest recesses of the structure. Given the tight timescales involved, this detailed knowledge is an invaluable operational asset. As the service of the tunnel expands, this expertise is likely to become even more important. Future expansion . Eurostar -- which currently operates services between London and Paris through the tunnel -- has already invested heavily in extending the capacity of their fleet. Trains from German operator, Deutsche Bahn, meanwhile will be gracing the line come 2015, opening up services from London to Amsterdam, Frankfurt and beyond. An extra three to four million passengers are expected to pass through the tunnel each year as a result of these developments, while increased trade between the UK and countries on mainland Europe will also likely be further facilitated. See also: Introducing the world's biggest ship . According to UK civil engineers team leader, Philip Edwards, this means rapid maintenance work will likely take on an even greater importance. How it is carried out will remain broadly similar though. ""The (work) will adapt to the frequency of the trains going through the tunnel (but) we'll still have the same tasks and inspections,"" Edwards explained. ""The maintenance is always evolving and as things get older it has to adapt to it ... (Exactly) how that will happen though (as time progresses), I have absolutely no idea,"" he added. Either way, he concluded, ""more trains can only be good for Eurotunnel"" and their fast-moving team of tunnel moles.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Lengthy sentences handed down to 21 women and girls who were arrested at a pro-Morsy demonstration have highlighted growing unease over the Egyptian authorities' treatment of dissent. The protesters, including seven minors, were sentenced Wednesday in Alexandria after being arrested at a demonstration in support of ousted president Mohamed Morsy earlier this month. The seven minors were sent to juvenile detention, and each of the adult women got 11 years in prison. Their sentencing came amid demonstrations over a new protest law announced by the military-backed Egyptian government Sunday. The new law requires organizers to seek permission from authorities before gathering and gives police the right to cancel demonstrations and to disperse them with force. It was put into use Tuesday, when a demonstration of less than 300 people protesting an article allowing military trials of civilians in the draft constitution was dispersed with water cannon and tear gas on the grounds that organizers didn't seek permission beforehand. About 40 people were arrested. Female detainees said they were sexually harassed during the arrest and then beaten before being dropped off near a desert road south of Cairo. Twenty-four men remain behind bars facing numerous charges relating to the new protest law. About 2,000 demonstrated Wednesday, in the second strong showing of dissent this month not connected to Morsy supporters, chanting against the Muslim Brotherhood, police and Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi. ""The Cabinet ... declares its commitment to the firm and strong enforcement of the Right to Protest law; the complete support to the police; and its respect to freedom of expression within a regulated framework,"" Hossam Eissa, minister of higher education, said in an official statement Wednesday. One student was killed Thursday in clashes with security at Cairo University. Several were injured in university students' demonstrations in Cairo and Alexandria. Voting on the final draft of the constitution was postponed to next week, as discussions continue. Some members of the constitution-drafting committee who are opposed to the use of force against protesters briefly suspended their membership. Pro-Muslim Brotherhood demonstrations continue across Egypt but with smaller numbers, because of an ongoing crackdown and the arrests of leaders and young members. 'Political verdict' The sentences handed down Wednesday in Alexandria have intensified concerns among rights groups about alleged abuses by police, apparently with the support of prosecutors and the judiciary. ""We don't have any doubt that this verdict is a new episode in a series of politicized judicial rulings, which include the sentencing of several Al-Azhar students to 17 years in various misdemeanors based on accusations that are mostly trumped up and generalized,"" said a joint statement issued by 14 rights groups. A Human Rights Watch official echoed those concerns. ""I think the fact that this protest law passed is significant and is bad news because there was a lot of pushback against this law. We've been pushing back against this law, and they were all oppressive,"" said Heba Morayef, the group's Egypt director. ""I think what this new protest law shows is that hard-line security agencies are the ones calling the shots, because the Ministry of Interior wanted this new law to legitimize the crackdown on protests."" Lawyer Mahmoud Farouk, who is working on the case of the Alexandria women and girls, told CNN he is confident the sentences will eventually be overturned -- but not before they spend seven or eight months in prison or juvenile facilities. ""It's a way to punish the girls until a new verdict is out,"" he said. He believes the charges for which they were sentenced, filed in a misdemeanor court, will ultimately end in a petty fine. ""The verdict is political and doesn't have legal grounds,"" he said. The charges against the women include thuggery, congregating or gathering, weapons possession and destroying property. Polarized political scene . Morsy, backed by the Muslim Brotherhood and the nation's first democratically elected president, was forced out of office in July, with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Several hundred people have died in clashes between pro-Morsy demonstrators and security forces since the military removed him. Morsy is in custody, facing charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule last December. He has refused to recognize the court. In the months since Morsy's ouster, many Egyptians accepted the force used against his supporters as attacks on police and the army in Egypt's Sinai region increased. But the recent emergence of a faint voice rejecting the polarized political scene is encouraging more criticism of the security sector. On the government level, reports indicate an increasingly domineering role for the Interior Ministry in the decision-making process. With a frail economy, many citizens on the street don't want the disruption brought by protests and so are willing to defend the heavy hand of the security forces. But at the same time, demonstrations in campuses across the country and workers' protests are growing in number for a range of political and economic reasons. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","14 women sentenced to prison after pro-Morsy protest; 7 girls get juvenile detention .

"(TIME.com) -- A filmmaker with multiple sclerosis hopes an app he developed will help fellow wheelchair users make cities like New York more accessible. For most people, meeting friends for dinner at a new restaurant, jumping into a taxi or going out for a shopping trip shouldn't require too much advanced planning. Just show up and walk in. But as Jason DaSilva discovered, these simple actions that he took for granted for the first 25 years of his life harbored hidden obstacles that made them nearly impossible to perform in a wheelchair. Steps, narrow doorways, cracked sidewalks and impossibly long ramps were only some of the barriers he encountered as he tried to navigate New York City, where he lives, from a chair. Most of the subway system is out of reach, since not all stations have elevators. And not all taxis are equipped to load wheelchairs either. Frustrated by his inability to move around as freely as he liked, DaSilva developed AXS Map â€” a crowdsourcing platform that allows people around the world to rate businesses for accessibility and, most important, to share that information. Because while the Americans With Disabilities Act, enacted by Congress in 1990, mandated that buildings and other facilities become more accessible to those with disabilities, DaSilva found huge variability in how well the law was executed. TIME.com: The myth of Roosevelt's wheelchair . Beyond that, many buildings constructed before 1990 are exempt from the regulations. AXS Map isn't intended to rate the extent to which a structure is ADA-compliant; it simply serves as a tool for people with mobility issues to find out which businesses in their community are actually accessible, and to what degree. Launched in 2012 as a website and mobile Web app, AXS Map is powered by Google Maps. Both of the current iterations allow the user to rate several features of local businesses for accessibility, which are tallied into an overall star rating. Much like Yelp and other crowdsourcing platforms, the more data that users contribute, the more useful the app will become. Also like Yelp, with more ratings, the most positive or negative reviews are canceled out so users end up with a solid core of realistic reviews. ""I think it's critically important that people like Jason are getting involved and creating change in their own right. It is the only way that this effort will be successful,"" says Mark Perriello, president and CEO of the American Association of People With Disabilities. ""You see a lot of innovation by people with disabilities ... but the number of people who are participating and changing the future, changing their own future by changing society, is far too few."" TIME.com: Disabled kids get in the game . Instead of leaving the ratings for AXS Map up to specialists, DaSilva wanted members of the disabled community to inform and empower themselves, with the help of friends, family and neighbors, by pooling their evaluations of how accessible facilities really are. ""I found that there was a lack of awareness in general around accessibility,"" he says. ""People without disabilities don't realize all the challenges that we face, like is a restroom accessible, is there one small step outside a restaurant that would keep us from being able to get in? It kind of blows their minds when they start to realize all these little details. Opening up the ratings to the community is an attempt to bridge the gap between people living with mobility issues and the larger communities that we live in."" Failure to adhere to ADA regulations can result in government injunctions, steep civil penalties and lawsuits. But while thorough, the law is complex and often difficult to apply in practice, resulting in the patchwork level of accessibility that DaSilva encountered. Initially, the Department of Justice offered free written advice to business owners who had questions about applying the law, but those letters ended in the mid-'90s. Since then, businesses rely on ADA consultants or lawyers, whose help can be costly, or free ADA-consulting services, which can be difficult to find. Building inspectors are tasked with making sure that state and local codes are followed, and states can request federal certification from the Department of Justice that these codes adhere to or exceed the requirements of ADA. But as DaSilva and others affected by disabilities have found, there can be variation in the extent to which these codes actually address accessibility. For example, the degree of steepness and length of a ramp can render it too challenging for someone in a manual wheelchair; a fraction of an inch on a door frame can make it too narrow for some chairs. TIME.com: Equipping the disabled . And when it comes to older structures, which are more common in cities in like New York, for example, the issues become even more challenging. ""Those facilities have an obligation to remove barriers to the extent that the removal is readily achievable, and that is a multifactor analysis that takes into account the cost of the removal, the difficulty, the resources of the business and a host of other factors,"" says Minh Vu, a partner at the legal firm Seyfarth Shaw and leader of its ADA Title III Specialty Practice Team. Additionally, as with any piece of legislation, enforcement is also a major issue. For DaSilva, the app is his legacy for the disabled community. A documentary filmmaker in New York, he was diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, a rare, accelerated form of the neurological disorder, after he noticed that his walk began to change in 2005. With AXS Map, he hopes to help others like him to live as independently as they can. DaSilva and his wife Alice Cook, whom he met while developing the product, have started hosting Mapping Days across the U.S., bringing together volunteers from the community to map entire neighborhoods in AXS Map. And at the same time, they are raising awareness around accessibility. ""The work I do, this app and the film, is about changing the face of disability. The civil rights movement, the gay and lesbian movement, even the feminist movement all gained traction. But for some reason, the disability movement kind of slowed down,"" says DaSilva. ""I'm trying to find a way to bring it back."" Jason DaSilva's documentary film, ""When I Walk,"" opens theatrically in New York City at IFC Center on October 25 and in Los Angeles on November 1.

"(CNN) -- Turning grandmothers into solar engineers is one of Sanjit ""Bunker"" Roy's favorite jobs. Roy is the social entrepreneur and founder of the Barefoot College and has been championing a bottom-up approach to education and empowering rural poor since 1972. It is now a global enterprise with roots in India. Roy recruits women from around the world to install and maintain solar lighting and power in their home villages. ""If you ask any solar engineer in the world, 'Can anyone make this in a village?' they say it's technically impossible. And if I say a grandmother is making it who is illiterate, he can't believe it, it's beyond his comprehension,"" says Roy. The United Nations estimates that around 1.5 billion people still live without electricity, and often the best and most immediate way to bring non-polluting electricity to remote regions is with solar energy. Roy certainly believes so. ""The way to go about this is not a centralized grid system, which brings in power from hundreds of miles away,"" he says. ""It is to bring in basic light right down to the level of basic household wherein they take ownership and control over that technology."" Women are the focus for the solar power projects that the Barefoot College runs because men ""were very untrainable,"" says Roy. ""(Men) were restless, compulsively mobile, and they all want a certificate and the moment you give them a certificate they leave the village and go to the cities looking for jobs. ""So why not invest in women, older women, mature women, gutsy women who have roots in the village and train them."" Coming from countries across the world, the women are trained for six months before returning home. Many of the women have previously never left their villages before. ""We were scared. We don't even know (our neighbor) Rwanda...how can we go to India?"" says Moyoonia Olive from Democratic Republic of Congo. ""But, since everyone was interested in having electric current soon, we even convinced our husbands!"" To overcome any language barrier, classes are taught primarily with sign language and color-coded circuits. The women learn to build and maintain a variety of solar-powered lamps and chargers. The Barefoot College ""campus"" in Tilonia, Rajasthan, is a testament to the power of solar --everything there is powered by the sun; food is prepared using a parabolic solar cooker, night classes are powered by solar lanterns. Roy says that the school has trained 150 grandmothers from 28 countries, electrified around 10,000 houses with solar power and saved several thousands of liters of diesel and kerosene from polluting the atmosphere. ""We have shown that solar-electrified villages can be technically and financially self-sufficient,"" says Roy. ""The Barefoot College is supposed to be a sparking off process. People are adopting it and owning it, which is really the story behind the college.""","Barefoot College in India trains women to be solar engineers .

"(CNN) -- There are few more concrete examples of the longtime rift between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland than the walled city on the River Foyle. Its official name, and the name used by most residents of the UK, is Londonderry. But Irish nationalists and Catholics call it simply Derry. The city was a flashpoint for the violent conflict between unionists and nationalists that swept Ireland from the 1960s through the 1990s. Its Catholic and Protestant children attend segregated schools. Even today it's not uncommon for road signs pointing motorists to Londonderry to have the ""London"" blacked out by graffiti. This weekend, however, Derry-Londonderry plays host to an event its organizers hope can help unite this divided city, at least for a few days. Called Lumiere, it's a four-day festival expected to attract tens of thousands of spectators to see the city's historic cathedrals, walls, bridges and squares illuminated by splashes of light. Projects range from LED and neon sculptures to large-scale projections by leading artists and lighting designers from Ireland and beyond. ""It (the city) has been a contested space for a very long time. And we're going there in the hope that ... maybe people who haven't felt comfortable standing next to each other in the streets will find an opportunity to do that,"" said Helen Marriage, co-director of Artichoke, a London-based company that stages large-scale public events across the UK. ""It may be a naive hope, but the hope is that communities who are divided by heritage or tradition or faith will find something new they can all enjoy together."" Marriage knows what she's talking about. In her eight years at Artichoke, which she co-founded with Nicky Webb, she has orchestrated numerous public, artistic spectacles in London and other cities. Each have drawn throngs of people who packed the streets, faces bright with wonder, to witness their city be transformed if only for a moment into something magical. ""I don't exaggerate the power of what we do,"" Marriage told CNN during her recent appearance at the PopTech conference, an annual gathering of artists, scientists and thought leaders in Camden, Maine. ""But the way people are moved by the work, and the way it makes them feel about their town, is something that's hard to describe. You can absolutely feel it in the air."" The Sultan's Elephant . In retrospect, the birth of Artichoke's first project was a minor miracle. In the early 2000s, Marriage and Webb wanted to bring Royal de Luxe, a French street-theater company, to London to mount a spectacle in the streets with enormous marionettes acting out a fanciful story about a young girl and a time-traveling elephant. Marriage had to persuade skeptical city officials to shut down parts of central London and reroute traffic while convincing them the event wasn't just a piece of frivolous disruption. ""You can imagine sitting in front of 25 gentlemen in various uniforms and suits, and saying, 'Hey guys, it's a kind of fairy story, about an elephant and a little girl. And we'd like to shut the city (down) for four days,'"" she said. ""A lot of them admitted afterwards that they thought we were mad."" This lobbying effort took Marriage five years. ""I used to go to these meetings and say, 'Please, may I do this?' And then I realized I was asking the wrong question. If you say to somebody, 'Please may I do this thing that's a bit unusual,' you're placing them in a position where they have to authorize your unusual behavior. And of course their instinct is to say no,"" she said. ""So I said, 'This is happening, on these dates. How can you help me?' And immediately the response was different. Because nobody was being asked to take responsibility for something they couldn't possibly imagine. Nobody ever really said yes. They just stopped saying no."" The event, ""The Sultan's Elephant,"" was a huge success in May 2006. Londoners, despite anxieties about crowded public spaces after the terrorist bombings that had rocked the city 10 months earlier, turned out in droves. Crime in London plummeted that weekend, and the event -- funded by government arts agencies and private donors -- generated an estimated 28 million pounds to the city's economy, Marriage said. To her, the emotional impact was even greater. ""People really took it to their hearts,"" she said. ""It's always an incredible moment when the city is returned to the people who live and work there. And they can wander freely as if in a playground, for no better reason than something is happening that they love. The real point of it is to create a moment of magic and wonder in people's lives."" Plinthers and a Telectroscope . Artichoke's subsequent projects were smaller in scale but no less imaginative. In 2008, they worked with British artist Paul St. George to unveil the Telectroscope, a fanciful contraption that claimed to link London and New York by means of a transatlantic tunnel and lots of mirrors. Thanks to a fast broadband connection, people in London could peer into the ""tunnel"" and see a live feed of New York City, and vice versa. Thousands invested in the illusion that they were peeking through a subterranean scope at the other side of the world. Marriage and her team followed that in 2009 with ""One & Other,"" which took over London's Trafalgar Square for 100 days and nights. The square's famous monument to Adm. Horatio Nelson is flanked by four smaller plinths, or platforms -- one of which sits empty. So Artichoke turned it into a monument to living Brits by inviting people to be hoisted atop the plinth to do whatever they pleased for one hour. The rules: Only one person would be allowed at a time, they could take up only what they could carry, and they couldn't do anything illegal. More than 35,000 applied and the winners -- ""plinthers,"" they were called -- were picked randomly by lottery and assigned a time. The event began in July and ran for 2,400 hours, day and night, with a new person occupying the plinth each hour. Many used their 60 minutes for performance art, others for tribute or protest. Some played music. Twelve stripped naked. One man proposed to his girlfriend. ""People used it in incredibly imaginative ways,"" Marriage said. ""The summary of all of those hours became the artwork. It was sort of a portrait of a nation at that point in our history. ""We always choose projects where we can insert the project itself into the DNA of the city,"" she continued. ""We don't work in galleries or opera houses or theaters. We work in the streets, using the buildings of the city, the architecture of the city, as the stage."" Cities of light . Then came the first Lumiere festival, held in November 2009 in Durham, a small medieval city in northern England. For four dark, wintry nights, Artichoke's artists transformed its cityscape of castles, stone walls and cobbled streets into gleaming spectacles of light. The festival proved so popular that it was repeated in 2011 and then again earlier this month, when an estimated 175,000 people came to view 22 installations across the city. The success of Lumiere in Durham inspired Marriage to double down this year on the festival in Derry-Londonderry. In planning the event, she and Artichoke were careful to embrace both Irish and English traditions and to include members from Catholic and Protestant communities. ""Many of the works that we have commissioned have been made to reflect on the city's divided history and the current progress being made towards its shared future,"" she said. At its simplest level, Lumiere invites people to come out and enjoy artworks specially designed for each nook and cranny of its historic host cities. Whether the Derry-Londonderry festival, which closes Sunday night, has a more profound, lasting impact remains to be seen. But Marriage is optimistic. Based on her experiences with past Artichoke events, she believes ""the simple act of sharing a newly imagined world leaves a lasting legacy in all those who experience it.""","Helen Marriage is co-director of Artichoke, a creative company that stages big public street events .

"(CNN) -- Early childhood programs for low-income families in six states, forced to close because of the government shutdown, will reopen with the help of $10 million in emergency funding from billionaire Houston couple Laura and John Arnold, the National Head Start Association said Tuesday. Some 7,000 children in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Mississippi were affected by the closures, the organization said. As many as 97,000 children in 41 states and one U.S. territory could be affected if the showdown extends into November, the group added. Shutdown forecast: Week Two, and clouds ahead . Head Start serves about 1 million children a year, according to the federal Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the program. ""The Arnolds' most generous act epitomizes what it means to be an angel investor; they have selflessly stepped up for Head Start children to ensure their path toward kindergarten readiness is not interrupted by the inability of government to get the nation's fiscal house in order,"" the association's executive director, Yasmina Vinci, said in a written statement. The Head Start Association said it will repay the Arnolds if the government, after the shutdown, provides funding to keep programs operational for a year. ""The entire Head Start community and the at-risk children we serve are tremendously grateful to the Arnolds for their compassion and generosity,"" Vinci said. ""The bottom line, however, is that angel investors like the Arnolds cannot possibly offer a sustainable solution to the funding crisis threatening thousands of our poorest children. ""Our elected officials simply must find a fiscal solution that protects, preserves and promotes the promise that quality early learning opportunities like Head Start offer to nearly one million at-risk children each year."" Head Start is a federal program that helps low-income children from birth to age 5 prepare for school. It was founded in 1965. According to its website, it has since served more than 30 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. When Head Start programs close, many parents must miss work or school to find alternative care for their children, the association said.","The government shutdown forced some Head Start programs to close .

"(CNN) -- An internal report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has found that it committed no wrongdoing in the case of Internet activist Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide while facing charges he hacked into the university's computers and stole millions of online documents. The report ""makes clear that MIT did not 'target' Aaron Swartz, we did not seek federal prosecution, punishment or jail time, and we did not oppose a plea bargain,"" wrote MIT President L. Rafael Reif in a letter Tuesday to the MIT community. Reif had requested an analysis of the university's involvement in the federal case against Swartz from the time MIT first perceived unusual activity on its Web network in 2010. But the report also questioned MIT's ""neutral"" policy on the issues raised by Swartz's prosecution and suggested the university could have showed more leadership. It also asked whether MIT should become involved in debates over reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act -- one of the laws under which Swartz was charged. Swartz, 26, was discovered dead in his Brooklyn, New York, apartment in January. He was facing 13 felony counts stemming from his illegal downloading from MIT of more than 4 million articles from JSTOR, a repository of research journals, and was scheduled to go to trial in April. If convicted on the federal computer-fraud charges, he faced up to 35 years in prison. Internet prodigy, activist Aaron Swartz commits suicide . Swartz was an Internet savant who helped develop social-news site Reddit and RSS, the technology that allows websites to send updates to subscribers. He was an outspoken advocate for the free exchange of information over the Internet and co-founded Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against Internet censorship. As described in the report, Swartz's death ""ignited a firestorm on the Internet."" Admirers held memorial services, a petition on the White House's website demanded the firing of the federal prosecutor responsible for the case and members of Congress introduced a proposed revision of the law under which he was prosecuted. After his suicide, Swartz's family issued a statement criticizing prosecutors for seeking ""an exceptionally harsh array of charges (for) an alleged crime that had no victims,"" and claiming that decisions made by prosecutors and MIT officials had ""contributed to his death."" How Aaron Swartz helped build the Internet . The MIT report on Swartz was issued by a review panel led by Hal Abelson, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science. In preparing its report, the panel reviewed about 10,000 pages of documents and interviewed about 50 people, including MIT faculty, students, alumni and staff; lawyers, police officers and prosecutors; and Swartz's friends and family. ""The review panel's careful account provides something we have not had until now: an independent description of the actual events at MIT and of MIT's decisions in the context of what MIT knew as the events unfolded,"" Reif wrote in his accompanying letter. ""From studying this review of MIT's role, I am confident that MIT's decisions were reasonable, appropriate and made in good faith."" But others disagreed, including Swartz's family and romantic partner. ""Having now read Abelson's report, it is clear that MIT in fact played a central role in Aaron's suicide,"" Robert Swartz, Aaron's father, said in an e-mailed statement through a family friend. ""MIT made numerous mistakes that warrant further examination and significant changes. MIT was not neutral in the legal case against Aaron. And whether MIT was neutral or not is a red herring: the university had a moral obligation to advocate on Aaron's behalf."" Robert Swartz had some conciliatory reaction as well. ""We are encouraged by MIT President Raphael Reif's desire to ensure that some positive comes of the terrible, tragic situation in which Aaron found himself, and applaud MIT for its commitment to self-examination."" Swartz's partner was upset at the report. ""MIT's behavior throughout the case was reprehensible, and this report is quite frankly a whitewash,"" said Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman. ""We have an institution to contrast MIT with -- JSTOR, who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution. Aaron would be alive today if MIT had acted as JSTOR did. MIT had a moral imperative to do so,"" she said. There was further reaction, too. ""Today's report was intended to provide closure for the MIT community regarding the overprosecution and tragic loss of Aaron Swartz. Instead, the report simply whitewashes MIT's role in Aaron's prosecution and revises history to protect MIT's image,"" said Demand Progress campaigner Charlie Furman. ""MIT does not seem to understand that a few simple, reasonable actions would have saved Aaron's life,"" Furman added. ""If the university had said publicly, 'we don't want this prosecution to go forward,' there would have been no case, and Aaron would be alive today."" Opinion: Why the Net grieves Aaron Swartz .

"(CNN) -- Thank you for shopping at Goodwill, your total is $23,472. That is a line most thrifty shoppers will never hear. Maybe $23.47, but certainly not 23 grand. While most think of Goodwill as a great place to buy really cheap shirts or gently used shoes, maybe even some furniture, the charity has an online auction site called shopgoodwill.com. That's where the really high-dollar donations go to be sold. Like the collection of 55 African artifacts that sold recently for a Goodwill online record of $23,472. ""The African collection will provide significant revenue for job training in the region,"" said Terry Hayes, president of the Tacoma (Washington) Goodwill, in a written statement. An anonymous donor dropped off the artifacts at a center in Port Townsend, Washington, in October in two huge containers filled with the items and packing straw. The pieces came from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Congo, Mali, Mozambique and Tanzania. They were sold as 54 lots, with a headdress mask from Cameroon drawing the highest bid of $2,601. The auction began November 19 and ran through Sunday. The pieces were evaluated by Tacoma Goodwill's in-house appraiser Jazlan Grigbsy. She valued the collection at $11,000, said George White, a spokesman for Tacoma Goodwill. He said he thinks more people have learned about the auction site through media coverage and an increased number of bidders helped yield the record amount. White explained most people don't know about Goodwill's tiered approach to retail, which has the online site at the top and the familiar outlet stores at the bottom. In between are specialty boutiques for high-end apparel and accessories or home decor, and regular retail stores. He said the money goes mostly to fund more than 30 different job-training programs. Abour 140 Goodwill agencies contribute items to the Shopgoodwill.com online store, which has more than 61,000 items in 350 categories that include art, electronics, jewelry and transportation.

"(CNN) -- Remember when social media websites were just about sharing fun things? I'm talking about the time when Facebook was essentially a place to post photos of you having a great time and the most serious event shared was when a person changed his or her status from ""in a relationship"" to ""single."" But those days are gone. Social media has now become a place to share deeply personal and often horribly painful events in our lives. It has, in essence, become an online group therapy session where people reveal the details of dreadful events from their lives in the hopes it helps them cope and will attract support from others. We saw it on display this week with 16-year-old Hannah Anderson, who was taken hostage by James DiMaggio for a week after he allegedly killed Hannah's mother and younger brother. Within days of being freed, Hannah went online to the website ask.fm and answered questions from the public about her ordeal. And she didn't just respond to a few questions, she fielded a long list of probing questions from ""Why didn't you run?"" to ""Are you glad (DiMaggio is) dead?"" I noticed this evolution in the way people had begun to use social media last year, and at the time, I didn't like it. My concern was: Why would anyone share the intimate details of tragic events from their lives with people online, many of whom are strangers? It really hit home this year when a friend posted on Facebook that he had been diagnosed with cancer. I was shocked, first by the news but second by the fact he announced his diagnosis on Facebook. Typically, this would be the type of news you would share only with family and close friends, and probably in a face-to-face conversation. But reading the comments responding to his original posting -- and the comments to his subsequent posts about his treatment -- caused me to change my view on what was appropriate to share on social media. The amount of support he received on his Facebook page was astounding. He was touched by it, noting that the outpouring brought him comfort and inspired him to fight the disease even harder. Many others are sharing the most heartwrenching events in their lives. In just the past few weeks, friends on Facebook or Twitter have posted information about the deaths of a parent or a grandparent. And this week, I saw an even more candid sharing of information when a friend posted on Facebook that his brother in Egypt had been shot by the police there during the recent protests. He followed that up a few hours later with updates about surgery to save his brother's life. Finally, he posted a photo of his deceased brother from the morgue where they identified his body. A few weeks ago, NPR host Scott Simon tweeted live updates from his dying mother's hospital room to his more than 1 million Twitter followers. Some said Simon was invading his mother's privacy while others labeled him as self-centered, focused more on himself than his dying mother. But like many others, I found it to be a moving tribute to his mother. What sparked this trend to divulge information that had once been revealed only to family and close friends? There are a few reasons. First, it's clearly therapeutic for many. By sharing their painful experiences, it helps the person heal, and the show of support by others bolsters them. Second, those who have been using social media for years on a daily basis have grown accustomed to sharing events and experiences from everyday life. We are now extending the scope of what we will share from our lives. Finally, I believe there's a connection between a willingness to share private aspects of our lives and the reality TV show world in which we have been immersed for over a decade. On a nightly basis, we see people share their triumphs and tragedies, be it on shows like ""Big Brother"" or ""The Real World"" or more contrived ones like ""Honey Boo Boo"" or ""Keeping up with the Kardashians."" They have made it easier and more acceptable for us to do the same. To me, the best thing about this new trend is that you get to control it. It's your choice whether to disclose deeply personal information. Those who find it unnerving or inappropriate can keep that information secret. But for the rest, social media may end up being a less expensive but helpful form of therapy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Social media evolved from sharing trivial matters to more personal ones .

"(CNN) -- Screaming children are the bane of many a single passenger. Now, amid all the grumbles of childless passengers and harassed parents, airlines are offering the warring factions a chance to sit further apart.. Recently, Scoot Airlines, Singapore Air's budget brand, became the latest carrier to unveil child-fee seating zones. The program, called ""Scoot in Silence,"" follows on the heels of AirAsia X -- the long-haul arm of the Asian budget carrier -- launching a ""quiet zone"" on their flights. The operations are similar: under-12s are banned from the zones and cordoned off from the remaining passengers via a curtain, galleys and the exit doors (the space that usual separates business class from economy). Contrary to how it might seem, Azran Osman-Rani, AirAsia X's CEO, maintains the measure is as much for the benefit of families as it childless travelers. ""It's cute how some parents have written back and said, 'This is a brilliant idea,' because they feel less stressed and guilty if their child is restless. Now, if someone's giving them an evil stare, they can just say, 'Well, if you're going to complain, you should have sat in the quiet zone.'"" In general, Air Asia X assigns random seats, unless passengers pay a $15 fee allowing them to choose where to sit. Whether that choice is to perch at the back of the plane grouped with spouses and spawn, or up front, where it's free from minors, the fee is the same. By introducing quiet zones, Osman-Rani is hoping to drive passengers, be they families or singles, towards paying the fee. So far, it's been successful -- the number of passengers paying to choose a seat has risen ""several percentage points"". Read more: Place your bids for business class . Helane Becker, an airline analyst with Cowen and Company says she assumed from the start that the trend was financially motivated. ""I kind of viewed it less about cordoning off children, and more as just another way for airlines to charge fees,"" she says. Still, some airlines argue the measure is more operational. Japan Airlines has taken a different if similar track on their Tokyo-Honolulu route, where they have introduce a curtained ""women only"" section in the last four seats of economy. The idea is to give women privacy to breastfeed and do their makeup. The seats don't generate any added income, but they do help free-up the bathrooms. ""About 60% of our passengers are women, and the in-flight lavatories are always crowded before landing. This resolves the long line,"" says Jian Yang, a spokesperson for the airline. Becker says that to a certain extent, passengers segregate themselves. ""While kids are cute, they can definitely be a distraction, especially if you're trying to get stuff done for work. That's why a lot of businessmen chose to sit in economy plus. Meanwhile, a family of four or five usually wants to sit together, and it's easier for them to do that in the back,"" she notes. Interactive: Which airlines have wi-fi? Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways has taken a different approach. Rather than separate the two groups, they've introduced ""The Flying Nanny,"" an in-flight team of child experts that play with, calm and otherwise distract children from causing a scene. ""We looked at what it's like to enter an aircraft from a child's perspective. Many are small, and it's daunting to board a plane and not know where you're going, or to have to sit there and not be able to walk around,"" explains Aubrey Tiedt, the vice president of guest services. Etihad Airways has paired up with Norland College, England's premier childcare institute to train the all-female staff of nannies on child psychology, sociology and child development. The carrier hopes to have 500 trained by the year's end. The nannies, who are recognizable by their bright orange aprons, can help with feedings and give advice on diaper changing, though their main purpose is to entertain. They come armed with a special kit, full of cardboard, crayons, colored paper and star-shaped stickers and will help kids create anything from sock puppets to paper animals. ""It's about making them feel special, which also makes them feel calm,"" explains Tiedt.","Scoot Airlines is the latest carrier to offer child-free zones.

"(CNN) -- There's a devastating narrative being told about the PC these days: It's dying. It's not a slow death either. Sales of traditional PCs are collapsing faster than anyone expected. And this isn't just some vague perception from the anti-Microsoft crowd. This is backed up with real data, most notably in the latest IDC report released this month that says PC sales are down 14% year over year. The entire market appears to be imploding, and it doesn't just apply to PCs running Windows. Even Apple's Mac computer sales are basically flat year over year, yet its iPad business continues to grow. So what's going on here? Why aren't people buying regular laptops and desktops anymore? There are a ton of theories floating around out there, but the consensus seems to be that PC makers still haven't figured out how to leverage the transition into mobile devices. Perhaps the biggest blame falls on Microsoft. It made a huge gamble with the introduction of Windows 8, a radically different kind of operating system designed primarly for touchscreen devices. Windows 8 replaces your traditional desktop screen with a new touch-friendly start menu that has a lot of people confused. IDC's report sums it up nicely: . ""While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices. Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market."" It's as if Microsoft is eating itself, trying to catch up with the mobile revolution while still packaging its new operating system in pricey hardware that's clearly declining in popularity with consumers. And because Windows 8 tablets are full PCs with expensive components, people are moving to cheaper tablets like the iPad Mini or ones based on Google's Android operating system. After all, why buy a brand new expensive computer that's difficult to learn when you can get an easy-to-use tablet that can do most of the same stuff at a fraction of the price? However, there is a small ray of hope for the Microsoft faithful. Microsoft is gearing up to release a new version of Windows later this year, codenamed Windows Blue. According to several reports, Blue will give users the option to replace the new start screen with a traditional desktop by default. If the reports are true, it would be a smart move, and one that could help ease the transition into modern mobile computing. The company is also toying around with the idea of making smaller, cheaper tablets that are much more popular with consumers. Microsoft recently issued a statement to its manufacturing partners that Windows 8 will now support smaller screens in the 7-inch range. Plus there are several reports that Microsoft will add such a tiny tablet to its Surface line of devices. You can expect to see a bunch of similar devices from other manufacturers later this year.

"(CNN) -- Jason Day nearly pulled out of the World Cup of Golf after learning he had lost eight relatives to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Instead he completed an emotional double victory Sunday in Melbourne as he claimed the individual title and paired with Adam Scott to lead Australia to team honors. After finishing with a final round 70 for 10-under at Royal Melbourne, Day said his Filipino mother Dening and his sisters had been in this thoughts throughout the event. They were in the gallery to watch the 24-year-old hold off Thomas Bjorn of Denmark by two shots in a tense final round. ""I am just happy that she is here and I get to hug her,"" he said. ""It would have been the easiest thing for me to just go ahead and pull out of the tournament with what has been going on over the last week, just to be up there with my mum and support her,"" he added. Day lost his grandmother, an uncle and six cousins in the November 8 tragedy and he said that both he and World No.2 Scott would assist with the relief program. ""We will definitely be giving some money or raising money and trying to raise awareness to what has really happened over there. ""To have that lead going into Sunday with all that stuff going on, to finally finish off and hit a great shot into 18 like I did and to win like that was a very big move in my golfing career."" Scott, who has won the Australia PGA and Australia Masters title in the past month, continued his superb form by taking third in the individual standings. Their combined score left them 10 shots clear of the United States in the team category, Australia's first success for 24 years in the annual competition. Bjorn, who led after two rounds and trailed Day by just one shot heading into the last day, paid tribute to the winner. ""I couldn't be happier for Jason. He has gone through a rough time of late and for him to even be here is a big thing and then to go and go and win the golf tournament, and for him to also win the team event, is fantastic,"" he said. Scott will head to the Australian Open in Sydney this week, bidding a triple of the three main tournaments held in his country, only the second man in history to achieve the feat if he does emerge the winner. Day will also be competing at Royal Sydney.","Jason Day wins World Cup of Golf in Melbourne .

"(CNN) -- The other day, the industry group representing small brewers issued its latest definition of what qualifies as a ""craft"" beer. Based on our size, that definition excluded us, even though we brew some of the most popular craft beers in the marketplace. We respect the fact that some of our fellow brewers would want to differentiate themselves, but we're convinced that the ultimate assessment of our beers will not come from an industry organization, but instead from America's beer drinkers. We know that no matter what style of beer it is, we will ultimately be judged by the quality of our beers. We like that, because we are confident that the quality of our beers stacks up well versus that of any brewer of any size, anywhere. Now, because we are best known for brewing some of America's biggest light beers, some people may be skeptical about that claim. We urge those people not to confuse the style of a beer with the quality of the beer. Whether it's a light lager designed to provide the refreshment many American beer drinkers seek, or a vigorously hopped IPA designed to provide the nice bite many other beer drinkers desire, our brewmasters are obsessed with crafting superior-quality beers within each style. While we may be big, we are still a company of beer people who take great pride in our beer culture and heritage, tracing our roots to two visionary immigrant entrepreneurs who opened breweries in the mid-19th century, Frederick Miller and Adolph Coors. We're also proud of our craft heritage. Nearly a quarter century ago, we acquired the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., which was making great beers, but struggling financially like many smaller brewers of that era. Leinie's, as it's affectionately known, was founded in 1867, and we promised we weren't presumptuous enough to tell it how to brew its beers. We've kept that promise, and the Leinenkugel family -- now on its sixth generation in the business -- is experimenting more than ever with new styles and flavors, including the popular lemonade-flavored Summer Shandy. Then there's Blue Moon Belgian White. Launched in 1995 by brewmaster Keith Villa, Blue Moon exposed U.S. beer drinkers to Belgian-style ales at a time when they were not widely known. After a quiet start, Blue Moon has gone on to become the best-selling craft beer in the country. In fact, Blue Moon introduces many consumers to craft, opening their eyes to the diversity of beer. The brewers of Leinie's, Blue Moon and other smaller craft and import beers operate autonomously so they can maintain their own unique personalities and keep experimenting and pushing limits. As a large brewer, we do not view the emergence of craft beer as a threat, because we know that innovation is essential to the American beer industry. In fact, we appreciate the vital role craft beers play within our industry. And we believe it's good for beer that there are more breweries and more brands available to American beer drinkers than at any other time in U.S. history. We're determined to continue to play a leading role in that innovation. And whatever style beer you might prefer, all we ask is that you judge us by the quality of the beer in the glass. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Long.","MillerCoors CEO: Small brewers want to exclude large brewers' products in craft category .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods was whacking golf balls across a bridge in Turkey last week, but back in Spain, Sergio Garcia is still feeling the need to build them following the ""fried chicken"" saga earlier this year. Speaking to CNN's Living Golf, Garcia once again struck a chord of contrition over the comments he made about the World no.1 last May. ""I didn't mean it in a bad way. When I was driving back to the hotel, I started thinking about it,"" Garcia told Shane O'Donoghue. ""Obviously, I didn't expect that question at all and you try to be funny and it comes out the wrong way I guess,"" he added. Garcia made the comment during a private dinner at Wentworth golf club a couple of weeks after he and Woods had endured a fractious third round at the Players Championship -- the Spaniard complained that the gallery following Woods had disturbed him during a shot. When asked in jest if he would be inviting Woods for dinner during the then upcoming U.S. Open, Garcia replied: ""Yeah, we will have him around every night. We will serve fried chicken."" Fried chicken is a common food in the American South, but when used in reference to African-Americans can often imply a negative stereotype. Fellow Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell perhaps summed up the slip best on Twitter: ""Private/humor filled environment but he (Garcia) shouldn't have said it #slip."" The remark echoed U.S. golfer Fuzzy Zoeller's infamous slur on Woods' following his maiden major win at the Masters in 1997. ""Tell him not to serve fried chicken next year,"" Zoeller said to reporters in an attempt to make humor of the fact that Woods was the first African-American to win the tournament. Tradition dictates that the reigning Masters champion choose the menu for the Champions Dinner the following year. Woods tweeted that Garcia's comments were ""wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate"" and even the Spaniard's equipment makers TaylorMade weighed in calling the comments ""offensive."" Garcia issued an unreserved apology via the European Tour but recoils when asked to recall the media storm that followed the jibe. ""It was horrible, but what's done is done. Everybody knows how I feel about it, so I think they should be fine with it and if not, it's kind of their problem,"" he said. ""The most important thing is learning from all those things. ""I'm making sure that all those experiences make you stronger, a better person and things like that. I think that I've learned from those things and I just need to keep getting better at it, and hopefully keep making people happy.""","Sergio Garcia talks to CNN's Shane O'Donoghue about ""fried chicken"" controversy .

"(CNN) -- Drawing level with the ""Star Wars"" saga and pulling well ahead of ""Shrek,"" ""Ice Age"" and ""Spider-Man"" in the sequel stakes, ""The Fast and the Furious"" could yet challenge Rocky Balboa, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger for longevity. So what's the appeal? Combining heist movie suspense with regular high-speed chase action, ""Fast and Furious"" takes ""Ocean's 11"" downtown, swapping con men for street racers, suits for vests and hair gel for grease (Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Tyrese Gibson are all chrome domes now). Where Steven Soderbergh aimed for suave and sophisticated, this unpretentious franchise sticks with stunts and sweatpants. But unlike Michael Bay, who ham-fistedly satirized a testosterone-fueled abs and EZ-money gym culture in ""Pain and Gain,"" these pumped up B-movies aren't condescending to their multiethnic, working-class characters or their audience. Instead, they celebrate the loyalty and brotherhood of that outlaw extended family unit, the gang. These criminals don't have time for traffic regulations, but they still operate under a strict code of their own, a code that echoes Alexandre Dumas' famous motto for ""The Three Musketeers:"" All for one and one for all. Under director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan (who has penned the last four episodes), the series has hit on a mock-serious, car-toony groove that's hard to resist. Even Michelle Rodriguez, who was killed in the fourth flick, is back in ""Furious 6,"" a hook to lure Dominic Toretto and crew out of retirement and onto Special Agent Hobbs' team. Rodriguez's Letty has been spotted riding in a looky-likey criminal outfit (""They're our evil twins!"") led by a ruthless ex-British Special Forces soldier, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). If Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) help Hobbs take Shaw down, they can win immunity for Letty and for themselves. Set largely in London -- congestion-plagued Brits will scoff at a street race that loops around Piccadilly Circus and wonder how many pedestrians were sacrificed in the making of this movie -- the film imports a James Bond-style threat in the form of a military ""Night Shade"" device. The device is the kind of thing that cannot be allowed to fall into the wrong hands (which Shaw's definitely are.) If the set up is farfetched and the acting more willing than able, you have to give the producers credit for putting the budget up on the screen. Each of the extended cast gets his or her moment to shine, and whether it's Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges trading quips, Sung Kang and Gal Gadot shooting flirty looks or Rodriguez duking it out with ""Haywire"" alum Gina Carano in a convincingly crunchy catfight, there may well be something for just about anyone here. But it's the action set pieces everyone will be talking about. And if ""Fast 5"" set the bar pretty high with that train stunt and the safe-dragging climax, ""Furious 6"" is more than ready to up the ante with still bigger, and clunkier, modes of transportation. I don't want to say too much, but for some reason I kept having flashbacks to ""Toy Story 2"" during the preposterously elongated climax. (Not a criticism, just that you wouldn't be surprised if Woody rode to the rescue on Bullseye in one of the outtakes.) Ludicrous, but undeniably fun and surprisingly affectionate, this is really all you could ask of a car crash movie, and more. Stick through the end credits for a satisfying coda.","The ""Fast & Furious"" franchise is back for round 6 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As thousands of traumatized typhoon survivors struggled to escape the stricken city of Tacloban, Gina Ladrera was desperate to get back in. It had been five days since Super Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the Philippines coast, obliterating everything in its path. And five days since she'd last heard from her family: husband Pedro Ladrera Jr., and their two children, 10-year-old daughter Kyra and 11-year-old son Kim. For the 39-year-old domestic worker living in Hong Kong, the silence was too much to bear. She had to go back home to find them. And miraculously, she did. READ MORE: Mother's grief as Haiyan aid flows . Leaving Hong Kong . CNN first spoke to Ladrera on Tuesday evening, four days after the typhoon. She was packing for the flight from Hong Kong to Cebu. From there she hoped to fly to Tacloban City, then somehow travel more than 10 miles (17 kilometers) south to her hometown of Tanauan, a city of around 50,000 people. Ladrera's voice broke as she recalled the last time she spoke with her husband, the previous Thursday, hours before screaming winds sent a wall of water slamming into the coast. ""He told me, 'don't worry, they can manage, my two kids.' It was the last words for me: 'Don't worry, I can manage my kids.' That was the last thing he told to me,"" she said, bursting into tears. The Ladreras are used to separation. Gina has been working in Hong Kong for more than two years, sending money to her 39-year-old husband, Pedro, a security guard, to help him provide for their children. Asked to describe them, Ladrera says Kyra is ""very clever,"" before adding in a stilted, tearful laugh, Kim is ""very lazy to do his homework, he likes to play."" VIDEO: Haiyan's path of destruction . Ladrera is one of hundreds of thousands of domestic workers who leave the Philippines to earn money abroad. In the days after the storm, she feared Haiyan may have separated her family forever. ""I asked them to evacuate in another place or another house but (my husband) didn't know the typhoon was very worse. I don't know if they evacuated,"" she said. ""I can't talk to them."" For hours after the storm hit, she tried calling her husband and daughter's mobile phones. There was no answer. By Friday afternoon, there wasn't even a signal. She hadn't heard from neighbors, or anyone who knew them. Days later, the Philippine Consulate in Hong Kong had no record of their whereabouts. With the help of her Hong Kong employers, Ladrera packed a large backpack with food, water, a tent and sleeping bag and left for a place described by survivors as ""worse than hell."" Returning to Tacloban . Ladrera flew from Hong Kong to Cebu on Wednesday morning with a friend, Rita Ladenia, a fellow domestic worker from Hong Kong who was also frantic with worry about her husband and five-year-old son. Ladenia had heard her family was alive but needed to find out for sure. Once in Cebu, the women immediately booked tickets to fly to Tacloban the following morning. Ladrera said she was nervous, scared and worried about having her bag stolen by starving survivors desperate for rations. She wasn't sure how long she'd stay or what she'd find. Ladrera planned to meet her friend's husband at the airport who would take her by motorbike to her family's home, where she hoped to find them safe and well. For whatever reason, that plan didn't work. Losing contact . After the typhoon, mobile signals were sporadic at best in Tacloban, a city splintered by the force of Haiyan, which smashed into the coast on Friday, November 8, bringing a storm surge that caught many locals by surprise. Ladrera had a local mobile but repeated calls to the number were met with the message: ""The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later."" Her friend Ladenia, who was reunited with her husband at the airport, sent a message to friends in Hong Kong that Ladrera had left the airport with a film crew from GMA-7, a Filipino news channel. A GMA-7 producer told CNN they had spoken to her at the airport, but said when they returned later to pick her up for the trip to her home town she was gone. There was no sign of her on Friday, one week after the typhoon, and no way to tell her the news she'd been so desperate to hear, that her husband and children had survived the storm and were safe. ""We had an agreement with Gina that if she gets in her place she was going to call me back. I'm also worried about her. I've not heard from her,"" Ladenia said on Friday. It wasn't until Saturday that word came through that Gina had made it to Tanauan and had been reunited with her family. She sent a text message to her friend -- all were safe. READ MORE: Survivors question faith . 'I'm so blessed because I found them' Only later did it emerge the lengths Ladrera had gone to to get home, and her family's astonishing story of survival as the storm lashed their house, and all but flattened the entire town. From Tacloban Airport, Ladrera begged for a ride from the Philippines military aboard a truck to Palo. From there, she rode with police to her home town of Tanauan. Everything was gone. But amid the debris, was her family, sheltering in a makeshift hut her husband made from what he could salvage from the remains of their house. ""They were very shocked. They didn't expect to see me. They were crying tears of joy, and then also my children, they didn't know what they're feeling. I'm so blessed because I found them,"" she said. Her husband, two children and parents-in-law had survived by clinging onto electrical wiring on the rooftop for four hours until the storm passed, she said. They were bruised and scratched by flying debris; minor injuries compared with the devastation around them. Neighbors gave them dry clothes, and a day later someone handed them rice and water. When Ladrera arrived home, there was no food left. She gave them what she had in her backpack then set about getting them out. They returned to Tacloban and on Sunday night caught a flight to Cebu. From there they'll fly to Manila before heading to her mother's home in Luzon. The children are in shock, she said, and are screaming in their sleep: ""They are crying no, no, no."" Ladrera plans to ensure her family is safely settled before she returns to work in Hong Kong. ""I'm starting from zero,"" she said, aware of the time it'll take to earn the money to rebuild her family's home and lives. ""I will go back to Hong Kong, I need to. I need to work because of my family,"" she said. Another separation looms ahead.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The prosecutor sounded like the narrator of a hard-boiled police drama as he carefully laid out pieces of the puzzle that led detectives to arrest one of their own in a 23-year-old cold case. ""A bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart, that's the evidence that will prove to you that defendant Stephanie Lazarus murdered Sherri Rasmussen,"" Deputy District Attorney Shannon Presby told jurors as an unusual criminal trial began this week in Los Angeles Superior Court. The trial promises to tell the story of a decorated female officer who rose through the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department while allegedly hiding a dark secret: She was getting away with murder. Lazarus, now 51 and retired from the force, is accused of killing her college crush's new bride in 1986, staging the crime scene to make it look like a burglary. Yes, she was a police officer, but she did not kill in the line of duty, or to protect the public, Presby alleged. ""This killing was personal."" Rasmussen was a tall, athletic 29-year-old hospital nursing supervisor with a pretty smile. She met a brutal end, beaten, bitten and shot to death in her townhouse in the suburban San Fernando Valley on February 24, 1986. She'd also been tied up and hit over the head with a vase. To police, it looked like a burglary gone bad. Stereo components were stacked by the door and Rasmussen's new BMW, an engagement gift, was missing. The case intrigues because it blends soap opera suds with ""CSI""-style forensics -- including broken fingernails and a bite mark. It also promises to hold up a mirror to one of the nation's most storied law enforcement agencies. ""Metaphorically speaking, this case is about the new LAPD investigating the old LAPD,"" said Andrew Blankstein, who has covered the department for the Los Angeles Times since the 1990s. ""This trial really traces the evolution of the LAPD and its approach to investigations, coupled with the revolutionary advances in technology."" He added, ""There's the old adage that the LAPD would never go after one of its own, but this case flies in the face of that."" According to prosecutor Presby, the crime was all about a guy. Witnesses who knew them in college at UCLA will testify that Lazarus was smitten with John Ruetten, but he just wasn't that into her. To underscore his portrayal of Lazarus as a woman obsessed, Presby displayed an old photograph found during a 2009 police search of the journals she'd stashed in a footlocker at home. Taken at their college dorm 30 years earlier, it shows Ruetten sleeping with his back to the camera. He was wearing only white cotton briefs. Ruetten did care for Lazarus, Presby continued, but in his view they were just good friends -- with occasional ""benefits."" Defense attorney Mark Overland told jurors there was much more to the relationship. The couple dated after college, went on trips and slept together ""many, many times."" Lazarus thought it was serious and also got to know and love Ruetten's mother and brother. She thought they had a future, the lawyer said. When she learned Ruetten was marrying someone else, Lazarus decided to lay her cards on the table. She told him how she felt. They slept together one last time, and then he told her he was going ahead with his marriage to Rasmussen, Overland said. ""She was tearful,"" he added. ""She wasn't hysterical."" A key part of the case involves a confrontation between Lazarus and Rasmussen at the hospital where Rasmussen worked, but Overland insisted his client was no stalker. By some accounts, Lazarus allegedly told her rival: ""If I can't have him, nobody can."" While Overland acknowledged there was a meeting between the two women, he described it as more of a heads-up. The message from Lazarus, according to her attorney: ""Hey, if he's dating you, you'd better tell him to stop bothering me. He keeps calling me. Tell him to knock it off."" At the time of the slaying, Lazarus was in her second year with the Los Angeles Police Department. The killing occurred on a Monday. Lazarus had taken the day off; Rasmussen had called in sick that morning. Authorities estimate she died before lunchtime. Ruetten found the body when he came home from work after 6 that night. Wearing a red robe, pink T-shirt and black panties, Rasmussen was sprawled on her back on the living room floor. By all accounts, the grim find left Ruetten dazed and despondent. Lazarus was a newbie patrol officer when Ruetten broke up with her for good. She was hurt by his rejection, sure, but she moved on and prospered, Overland said. She made detective and met her husband, a fellow Los Angeles police detective, in 1993, and they have a daughter. She was headed for the department's internal affairs and its prestigious art theft detail. According to prosecutors, the key to unlocking Lazarus' dark secret lay for years on the back shelf of an evidence freezer in the coroner's office. A sealed evidence envelope contained a vial. Inside that vial was a cotton swab. On that swab, prosecutors say, was DNA taken from saliva from the bite wound on Rasmussen's left forearm. Testing in 2005 revealed the assailant was a woman. But still some detectives clung to the burglary theory and focused their inquiries on known female prowlers. From the beginning, the victim's family had pointed to an ex-girlfriend of Ruetten's who was a cop, and as the DNA testing advanced, undercover police followed Lazarus to a Costco store and retrieved a discarded soda from a trash can. Saliva traces from the straw matched the bite mark DNA, and she officially became a suspect. Lazarus was confronted, and another sample was taken from her shortly before her arrest. Tests revealed the DNA found in the bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm belonged to Lazarus. How sure were they? Presby said the chances of the killer being anyone else is ""one in 1.7 sextillion."" That's a 17 followed by 20 zeroes. Overland says the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and can't be trusted. The envelope has been torn. Photos show the top of the vial poking through. And while the top of the envelope may have been sealed with red crime lab tape, the bottom was wide open. Overland quoted the crime lab's supervisor, who observed: ""We've got a problem."" Hairs, fibers and fingerprints found at the crime scene can't be tied to Lazarus at all and haven't been matched to anyone else, Overland told the jury. The jurors listened intently Monday but didn't take many notes. As prosecutors set the scene with their first witnesses, the images projected on a large screen were jarring: A beaming bride in white appeared one minute, followed by an image of a bloodied corpse in a red robe, arms and legs stiffened with rigor mortis. Both photos were of Rasmussen, and they were taken less than four months apart. Her father, Nels Rasmussen, occasionally choked back sobs, and one of the victim's sisters teared up at the sight of the bloodied face with one eye blackened and swollen shut. Sherri Rasmussen ""wore the white dress that the defendant felt was hers,"" Presby said. ""Four months after that marriage, Sherri Rasmussen was dead, her beauty disfigured, obliterated, blotted from existence."" Lazarus, dressed in black for court, appeared pale and waxy as she jotted notes and whispered with her attorneys. During breaks, she waved at her husband, mother and brother, who were seated behind her. Presby reminded jurors what life was like in 1986. Ronald Reagan was president. Bill Cosby had the top-rated television show. People played Pong and Asteroids and hardly anybody had a home computer. And few, except for scientists, had heard of DNA. The genetic testing that is now the ""gold standard of evidence,"" was yet to come, Presby reminded the jury. ""A tiny Stephanie Lazarus was hiding in the bite on Sherri Rasmussen's arm,"" he said. The O.J. Simpson trial in 1994 and 1995 helped cement DNA as a household word. Ten years later, the Los Angeles Police Department launched its cold case squad, reopening hundreds of files to see, as Presby said, ""if there were more killers hiding on evidence shelves in coroners' freezers."" It will be up to eight women and four men to decide if Lazarus is one of them.","Trial of former Los Angeles police detective Stephanie Lazarus is under way .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- In many African cultures, every part of a slaughtered cow is used. Nothing goes to waste, not even the bones. Following this tradition, a youth group in Nairobi's Kibera slum is making beautiful jewelry out of discarded bones from cows and goats. Under their brand name ""Victorious Bones"" the group has an innovative way of making a living by dealing with waste management -- a huge problem in urban areas. ""If you walk around here you will see the garbage is thrown almost everywhere,"" says Jack Nyawanga, founder of Victorious Bones. ""As a team we play a big role in waste management in terms of creating a clean environment. ""Through collecting (bones) and recycling them, we are able to form something very nice and also to keep the environment clean."" Read this: Artist gives 'trash a second chance' Nyawanga buys discarded bones for his workshop once a month at a restaurant in the neighboring slum. He cuts and sharpens the bones using a circular blade and then smooths them down with sand paper. The next step is boiling the bones using hydrogen peroxide to remove the oil on the bone and to make it easier for the paint to sink in. He then applies candle wax to the boiled bones -- the waxed part will remain white and the other part will become black when the bones are dyed. In the final stage, Nyawanga puts the bones in a container filled with dye for an hour to enable them to have a long-lasting color. The jewelry is of different sizes and designs, with pieces ranging from earrings and necklaces to bracelets and rings. Depending on the complexity of design, a piece of jewelry can take from six to 20 hours to complete. The group has the capacity of making 400 earrings and 150 to 200 necklaces a day depending on the order. ""This business is very competitive,"" saysNyawanga. ""If you go to the market you will see people are really competing in terms of creativity."" Read this: Mice kebab sellers turn rock stars . Currently the group works very closely with local NGOs to bring in tourists who buy their pieces. It also exports its jewelry to clients in Canada. And it provides a much-needed source of local employment, with Victorious Bones currently employing more than 40 young people drawn from Kibera -- the largest slum in Kenya. ""Some of the youths who were trained here have been employed in other companies,"" says Nyawanga. ""Some have been able to open their small businesses where they supply their customers with jewelry. ""Some of the workers here are able to pay school fees for their children, they are able to put food on the table, they are also able to pay house rent. These are some of the achievements they have gone through,"" he adds. In the next five years, Victorious Bones sees itself as a major supplier of crafts made from bones to different markets both locally and internationally. ""In life you have to choose between two things: you either submit to degradations of poverty, hopelessness or start your own walk,"" says Nyawanga.","Youths in Nairobi crafting jewelry from discarded cow and goat bones .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- As if on cue, Ermelinda Briceno entered the makeshift shrine to Hugo Chavez and shed a tear. This place of reverence to ""el Comandante,"" the president of Venezuela for 14 years, popped up in this poor neighborhood after Chavez's death last month. Briceno said her devotion to Chavez is unshakable. But she understands why even some who supported the late president were reluctant to vote for his handpicked successor, Nicolas Maduro. ""I think a lot of people didn't know Maduro so they didn't vote (for him) but here we are, it was very close,"" Briceno said. For this country of 29 million, struggling economically, the election was perhaps too close for comfort. At least seven people were killed and 61 were injured in post-election violence across Venezuela, state media reported Tuesday, citing Venezuela's top prosecutor. While the government claims these attacks were against government supporters, CNN could not independently verify the reports. Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in Sunday's election, while opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski won 49%, Venezuela's National Electoral Council said. As the crisis continues, the economy limps along. Even Venezuelan government predictions indicate the country could see inflation hit 30% this year, one of the highest rates in the world. And then there are the food shortages. Currency restrictions and price controls have compromised the economy; there are shortages of basic goods like flour, sugar, rice, even cornmeal, a Venezuelan staple. We went to one bakery in central Caracas where the owner told us he was working with his last three sacks of flour. The bakery is limiting purchases of bread to four loaves per purchase until the supply of flour stabilizes. It's a situation that's difficult to understand considering Venezuela is a petro-state with the largest proven reserves of oil on the planet. ""I have no idea when I'm going to get any more flour and usually I have about 50 sacks on hand for the month,"" said the bakery owner, who did not want to be identified for fear of government retribution. Fear seems to be rising among Venezuelans, no matter who they voted for. The government's threats against the opposition grow more ominous by the hour. ""You will not go downtown to Caracas to fill it with blood and death,"" Maduro warned the opposition, saying their protests were illegal. He added that he believed the United States was funding and encouraging the protests. Henrique Capriles responded with a call for calm, yet another demand for an election recount, and most importantly a plea for protesters to ignore his earlier calls to protest on Wednesday and stay home instead. He said he feared the government would incite violence at what he hoped would be a peaceful demonstration. READ MORE: Venezuela state media: 7 dead in post-election violence . ""The government wants to use the violence so that we don't talk about the issue that brought us to this point, "" Capriles said at a press conference on Tuesday. Back at the Chavez shrine, where he is already known as ""Santo Hugo Chavez,"" a saint, there seems little interest in following the sparring between the government and the opposition. People were returning to work and school and making their way onto the crowded commuter buses that wind through the poor barrios. But this is hardly the ""divine inspiration"" Chavez had hoped to give Venezuela after grooming his successor before his death. Maduro had a double-digit lead over the opposition after Chavez's death but that evaporated in a short, 10-day campaign. Even the opposition told CNN they considered this a ""miracle.""

"(CNN) -- The government in Niger has declared three days of national mourning for 92 migrants who died from dehydration after their vehicles broke down in the Sahara desert, state media said Friday. The government was ""profoundly moved by the catastrophe"" and ""presented its condolences to the victims' families,"" state-run newspaper Le Sahel reported. The victims, almost all of them women and children, had been trying to reach Algeria, Azaoua Mahaman of the Synergie nongovernmental organization said Thursday. Instead, after being stranded in the country's northern desert, they died of thirst. When found, many of the bodies were severely decomposed and appeared to have been partially eaten by animals. The travelers were hoping to find a better life for themselves in Algeria, trying to escape the extreme poverty and economic hardships in Niger, Mahaman said. The country of about 16 million is one of the poorest in the world and lies second from bottom in the U.N.'s Human Development Index. Hardship and the lack of opportunity prompt many to leave. Niger's desert north has become a major transit area for migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration, and many people smugglers operate there. Algeria and Libya are the final destinations for some travelers, while others seek to reach Europe, said Laura Lungarotti, migrant assistance regional specialist in the organization's west and central Africa office in Senegal. Most are from Niger, although others also come from central and western Africa. Once they embark on their journeys, they face ""extremely dry and difficult conditions,"" she said. Those who get stranded in the desert face a challenge to survive. Part of the problem is that many would-be migrants are stopped by Algerian or Libyan authorities and are expelled back over the border into Niger's desert, Lungarotti said. Some of those kicked out are transported directly to two transit centers run by the International Organization for Migration: outposts in the desert where the migrants can receive food, water and first aid. Others manage to make their own way there. Despite the dangers, the migrants' numbers have been increasing since the beginning of this year, Lungarotti said. Over the past 10 months, more than 15,000 from Niger and 1,300 from other countries have reached the two transit centers: one in Arlit, closer to Algeria, and the other in Dirkou, nearer to the Libyan border. It's unusual for so many migrants to be women and children, Lungarotti said of the latest deaths. A recent study by the migrant organization found that the majority of migrants are men, although there are growing numbers of unaccompanied minors, she said. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","Migrants died of dehydration while crossing the Sahara .

"(CNN) -- Raise your hand if this has ever happened to you: You wake up bleary-eyed on a weekday morn, lazily scroll through your newsfeed or Twitter feed or Google reader or whatever medium you use to absorb small bits of inanity, and there it is -- an opinionated update on a season finale, new movie or hot book, filled with important plot points. BAM! You've been struck by a spoiler. Times have changed since 76.3 million Americans tuned in to the disappointing series finale of ""Seinfeld."" As one, they turned their gazes to their television sets, letting out a slow exhale as the final credits rolled. Nowadays, fewer and fewer people are catching programs at their air time. In 2012, 36% more people watched TV on their smartphones than in 2011, according to a report from Nielsen. And Netflix, Hulu, DVR, and streaming services let us mold TV schedules into our own lives. Which is all to say: You cannot assume, just because you've seen something, that everyone else has, you arrogant jerk. Your friends shouldn't have to creep around with their fingers in their ears screeching, ""Don't tell me; I haven't seen it yet!"" If you simply must pontificate on a cultural reference point with surprises, twists or big reveals, bear the following in mind. 1. Give us fair warning. Simple: Just put ""SPOILER ALERT"" at the beginning of the write-up. Bonus points if you place the big plot-pivotal announcement after a jump (on a blog) or after a few hard enters on Facebook (so readers have to click ""see more"" to read the rest). 2. Remember: Hints are spoilers, too. If people want clues as to how the tale will end, they will ask. Ninety-nine percent of the time, they'll want to finish it unbiased, draw their own conclusions and then discuss. Hot tip: Saying anything to the effect of ""THERE IS A HUGE TWIST AT THE END, but I'm not going to tell you what it is"" is indeed a spoiler, because the viewer/reader will now follow the entire tale expecting the unexpected. Just keep your mouth shut until they've finished, yes? 3. Favor exclusive discussions over blasted proclamations. All 483 of your Facebook friends do not care what you thought of the moment in ""Girls"" when we learn Hannah is an illegal alien. (SPOILER ALERT: Hannah is not an illegal alien.) Guess what! You can even use social media to bring to you those who are equally eager to discuss Don Draper's untimely death. (SPOILER ALERT: Don Draper isn't dead.) Simply make your chat status something like ""Must begin discussing the end of 'Brave' posthaste. Who's seen it?"" and then squawk away without ruining anyone else's experience. 4. Give it the three-year test. Has the Earth made three or more trips around the sun since the book/movie/show/play had its day? Then all bets are off. Those who still haven't seen ""Wall-E"" by now are unlikely to get around to it. 5. Forgive the spoiler. OK, so your jerk friend just posted about the shocking moment in ""Madagascar 3"" when we realize the whole trilogy is the fever dream of a koala who watched his friends get taxidermied. (SPOILER ALERT: Oh, please.) Take heart: Research from UC-San Diego reports that spoilers actually enhance enjoyment. Scientists found that students had more fun reading narratives when they knew the plot twist ahead of time than when they just learned it at the end, likely because it helped them pick up subtle clues along the way. (That's the reason everyone saw ""The Sixth Sense"" at least twice.) In case you haven't seen it, Bruce Willis' character ... is a ghost himself! You're welcome! Hey, don't blame us.

"(The Frisky)  -- One would think that becoming engaged would make a woman happy, right? Well, if status updates on Facebook are any indication -- and at least two research scientists say they are -- that theory is all wrong. Cameron Marlow and D.J. Patil spend their days tracking trends on Facebook where the roughly 400 million users give them a totally unprecedented insight into human behavior. Together, they study what Facebook calls the ""Gross National Happiness Index,"" an application ""that measures the positive and negative sentiments expressed in status posts,"" and what they've discovered is that becoming engaged makes women less happy than they were before getting engaged. The Frisky - Bad marriage may be a health risk . ""Maybe this is the effect of having to plan a wedding,"" Marlow told the San Francisco Chronicle in an article (""Researchers Study Behavior in Social Networks"") that ran on May 12. ""While the process of being engaged is stressful for women, once you're married, then in general, you're less negative than you were before. But if you're a man, then something else changes, it increases the negativity. These fit the gender stereotypes so perfectly that it's almost uncanny."" Facebook's ""Gross National Happiness"" prototype app . As someone who has wasted too much time perusing a popular website that pokes fun at status updates from people who are happily -- often annoyingly so -- coupled up, I kind of have a hard time believing these findings. It's all, ""Ooh, another lovely evening at home waiting for the pizza delivery and watching my husband clip his toenails!"" And: ""I'm getting marrriiieeeeed, suckas!"" Whether these people are truly happy or just want people to think they are is open for debate, but I have a hard time believing they're illustrating ""negative"" tendencies. Then again, I deleted my Facebook account months ago, so maybe I'm simply missing out on the ""woe is me"" updates from the newly engaged and married. The Frisky: Kim Kardashian drowns her food in Windex . Another finding the researchers have discovered is that ""being in an open relationship 'is uniformly bad,' decreasing positive feelings by 15 percent compared with single people."" Interestingly, it's women who are actually less negative about open relationships than their male counterparts. Who would have though that? The Frisky: Bad breakup gave me more confidence . On a different note, it's a little creepy that people on Facebook -- all 400 million of you -- are unwitting participants in these research studies, isn't it? As if there weren't already enough performance anxiety when writing one's status update.

"(CNN) -- Every Halloween, I get the same questions from parents: . ""Should I let my kids have candy?"" ""How much candy is safe?"" And a question not necessarily tied to Halloween: ""How can I raise my kids with healthy habits but also without making them feeling deprived?"" The answer isn't simple. All the focus is on the candy we eat once a year at Halloween when we eat even worse foods all year long. My opinion as a dentist has evolved over the last 25 years, and it continues to evolve as I learn from my patients and from my own children. To begin to answer this question, we first need to understand: How bad is candy, really? The effects of candy on our children are twofold. There are biological effects that we all know about, such as the adage ""candy rots your teeth,"" but there are also psychological effects of binging on all that well-marketed candy. The effect candy has on your kids' teeth . The increased consumption of sugar in our culture is linked to diabetes and obesity. Consider: . • Sugar is changing our children's taste buds. By exposing our kids to sugar-laden foods, we are corrupting their taste for the sweetness in fresh fruit and ""superfeeding"" the bacteria that cause tooth decay. • ""Just this once"" actually has a lasting effect. So what's the big deal if your children binge on candy just once a year? That one binge may lead to an altered taste sensitivity, which can lead to cravings for other things. Those things might include soda, which we know is linked to increased risk of diabetes, obesity and other health issues. The dental screening that could save your life . Sugar addiction has also been shown to activate the same parts of the brain as cocaine addiction. Would we let our children have cocaine ""just once"" each year? In this way, Halloween candy may be a gateway to serious systemic diseases. • Candy plays a role in your children's future dental health. The effects of candy have compounding ramifications as children get older. The more tooth damage that occurs, the earlier people have issues with their teeth as adults in terms of crowns, root canals, extractions or implants -- or all of the above. By delaying damage during childhood and the adolescent years, you bypass a crucial and vulnerable time in life. Children are more vulnerable to the effects of candy than adults because they often aren't aware of the ramifications (such as a $1,400 root canal that comes later in life), and they don't brush, floss and take other actions to negate the effects of bad decisions. The exposure your children have to candy and the habits they form will determine their dental future. Beyond the teeth . Perhaps just as concerning as the damage to the teeth are the psychological effects of all this candy. Those include: . • It's an unhealthy message. All year long, we tell our children, ""Don't take candy from strangers."" But isn't Halloween asking them to do just that, making an exception? What if that confusing and conflicting message were to jeopardize a child's safety one day? • Halloween doesn't teach moderation. The binge culture that Halloween promotes might be just as damaging as the sugar itself. The name of the Halloween game is, how much candy can you get in your bag before midnight? Or worse -- how much can you eat in one sitting? Candy is no longer a treat for Saturdays from the candy shop -- it now comes in big bags from warehouse stores. 5 things to do at the dentist's office . It's all about quantity, rather than an infrequent treat that is savored. Grandma was right when she said ""everything in moderation."" Those who live the longest, healthiest lives cite moderation as key to their longevity. • Selling and marketing food to children is big business. The food industry spends nearly $2 billion annually to market and advertise food to children and adolescents. Children are vulnerable to messages from their favorite television character who is endorsing a candy. So, how bad is candy? You'll have to make the decision for yourself and for your family, but the important issue is that we're aware of the physical and psychological costs of candy and can make an educated decision about it. One solution I've found to all this madness to invoke the spirit of the Great Pumpkin, who collects candy left on doorsteps every Halloween night to replace the candy with a real treat -- a book, new computer game, skateboard, etc. So, are you a bad parent if you let your children eat Halloween candy? I'd encourage you to ask a different question: Am I empowering my children with healthy habits and knowledge before they go trick-or-treating this Halloween? Am I an enabler to all the candy madness, or am I modeling healthy habits and moderation? One of the responsibilities of parenthood is educating our children and setting them up with healthy habits that they'll carry through to adulthood and even on to the next generation. We likely aren't going to bar our children from going trick-or-treating, but modeling and teaching them what happens afterward is what will determine their habits around candy for life. If you can answer yes to all those questions, then you and your children are in the clear. Healthy habits are the real treat. Baby's teeth: What you should know . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Mark Burhenne.","A dentist offers points to consider about letting children binge on Halloween candy .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- As Japanese authorities widen their investigation into ties between financial institutions and organized crime, an investigative reporter says the current allegations have left with a sense of ""déjà vu."" ""In 2004, Citibank (Japan) lost their private banking license because they were allowing yakuza to do many complex transactions,"" Jake Adelstein, author of ""Tokyo Vice"" and an expert on Japan's mafia -- known as the yakuza -- told CNN. ""They got spanked in 2009 for failing to update their databases and allowing yakuza to do business with them again. The Financial Services Agency (FSA), the country's financial regulator, will send inspectors to Japan's three largest banks -- Mizuho Bank, Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Bank -- to ""review over their corporate governance, legal compliance and overall risk management,"" said Hiroki Kato, director of the Inspection Bureau of the FSA. The on-site inspections are scheduled to begin next week. All three banks declined to comment on the review when contacted by CNN. Ties to gangs . Mizuho has already come under scrutiny after 54 executives, including the bank's president, were punished after it was revealed an affiliate made more than $2 million in loans to people with ties to organized crime. Yakuza is the name given to Japan's organized crime syndicates. Adelstein -- the only American who has worked a crime beat for the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper -- has called them ""Goldman Sachs with guns"" because of the financial prowess and sometimes brutal means. ""The yakuza have been tremendously successful because they can work out in the open,"" Adelstein told CNN. ""They have business cards, they have office buildings. People know who they are -- they have fan magazines and they have a lot of money."" Strict code . Members are said to follow a strict code of discipline -- and often sport full body tattoos. The biggest and wealthiest yakuza gang -- the Yamaguchi-gumi -- is said to number nearly 40,000 members. Robert Feldman of Morgan Stanley Japan once called the Yamaguichi-gumi ""Japan's largest private equity group."" Belonging to a yakuza gang itself is not a crime. But members are known to engage in drugs, prostitution and gambling. After recent crackdowns by Japanese authorities, yakuza are making more strides into white-collar crime, experts say. ""So if you have a lot of money and a lot of information and you can use blackmail and extortion to do insider trading it can make quite a tremendous financial force,"" Adelstein said. ""Yakuza have tremendous political connections and they have a lot of information to blackmail people.""","Three of Japan's largest banks are under scrutiny for making loans to underworld groups .

"Beijing (CNN) -- When it comes to fighting corruption, virtually all Chinese give the ""thumbs up."" They liken it to ""a rat scampering across the street -- everyone is crying 'beat it up!'"" This resentment is mirrored in recent public opinion polls, which list graft among the respondents' top grievances, along with pollution and the rising cost of living, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Far from ignoring this growing discontent, President Xi Jinping's new administration has been targeting Communist Party officials and government bureaucrats whom they believe to be guilty of ""severe breaches of discipline,"" a favored euphemism for corruption. The Chinese refer to more minor officials accused of corruption as ""flies"" and their more senior counterparts as ""tigers."" So far, the campaign has claimed more flies than tigers. But the list of high-flying officials who have gone from fame to shame include Bo Xilai, the fallen former party chief of Chongqing, who was recently put on trial and is now awaiting the court's verdict. Timeline: Bo Xilai scandal . The campaign has also snared the former railway minister, Liu Zhijun, who was meted a suspended death sentence, and Liu Tienan (no relation), a former vice minister of the powerful National Development and Reform Commission. Big catch . However, the big news this week has been the dismissal of Jiang Jiemin, 58, the minister of the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), for ""serious disciplinary violations."" Jiang's dismissal is stunning news. He is a member of the Central Committee, the Communist Party's policy-making body, and has supervised all the central state-owned Enterprises (SOEs), which generate massive revenue and jobs. He was promoted into the post only last March. Before that, he was the former chairman of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), one of the biggest Fortune-500 companies in China. His dismissal follows investigations into Li Chuncheng, a former deputy party chief of the southwestern Sichuan province, and four other top oil executives. Many of these officials are known to be allies of Zhou Yongkang, who held senior positions in China's oil industry. He wielded enormous influence over China's security apparatus when he served as a member of the nine-person Politburo Standing Committee until he retired last November. Rumors . This has prompted rumors on Chinese social media that Zhou is also being investigated. ""If the stories about Zhou Yongkang are true -- and the naming of his associates as targets of corruption investigations surely indicates he is under pressure -- then Xi Jinping is taking China in an especially dangerous direction,"" said Gordon G. Chang, author of the book ""The Coming Collapse of China."" ""I think the Communist Party is in the early stages of tearing itself apart,"" he added. Chang says Xi faces grave political risks if he is indeed targeting Zhou. ""Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, senior leaders, as a means of ensuring unity and continuity of Communist Party rule, have honored the agreement not to prosecute each other,"" Chang said. ""If they can no longer be sure they are safe in retirement, politics will inevitably return to the brutishness of the Maoist era. Deng Xiaoping lowered the cost of losing political struggles. Xi Jinping is raising the stakes, perhaps to extremely high levels."" Other analysts are not convinced that Xi is going after Zhou just yet. ""It will be too destabilizing, ""said Joseph Cheng, professor at the City University of Hong Kong. ""Xi Jinping wants to use the anti-corruption campaign to enhance his popularity and consolidate his power. ""Cases of Bo Xilai and Liu Zhijun were initiated by his predecessors. Xi wants to show that he too is also going after important officials and is ready to tackle vested interests. He wants to do this before the Third Plenum of the Communist Party."" Economic reforms . The plenum, a bi-annual conclave which sets major policies, is now scheduled to convene in Beijing in November. The new Chinese leadership is expected to unveil a package of economic reforms later this year to stimulate domestic consumption as an alternative source of growth instead of relying on investment and exports that have propelled the economy for the past 30 years. Cheng says Xi is showing strength, not weakness, by going after powerful vested interests. He says Xi's anti-graft campaign is tied to economic reform. ""He wants to reduce the privileges of the state sector, to make it more competitive and innovative, and to offer a level playing field to the private sector,"" Cheng explained. On the political front, however, Xi has shown little sign of loosening up. A document, known as ""Document No. 9"" and distributed internally by the Communist party's central committee, warns that ""Western forces hostile to China and dissidents within the country are still constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere."" These opponents, the document says, ""have stirred up trouble about disclosing officials' assets, using the Internet to fight corruption, media controls and other sensitive topics, to provoke discontent with the party and government."" Public pressure . But with China's economy slowing, the rich-poor gap growing and social tension intensifying, analysts say Xi needs to champion initiatives that resonate with the public, such as fighting graft. Since taking over the reins as China's paramount leader, Xi has issued warnings about how corrupt practices risk soiling the party's image and threaten national stability. ""We must uphold the fighting of tigers and flies at the same time, resolutely investigating law-breaking cases of leading officials and also earnestly resolving the unhealthy tendencies and corruption problems which happen all around people,"" Xi said in a speech addressing the Communist Party's top discipline body, Xinhua reported in January. Xi has even directed the spotlight on the People's Liberation Army, where his wife Peng Liyuan serves as a senior officer. He has issued directives banning drinking and extravagant dining -- particularly among senior officers -- and called for audits of military-owned assets. More recently, the PLA issued a directive tightening approval of gala performances by army singers and dancers. Military performers, like Peng, are now asked not to perform in privately-funded performances and casinos, and not to take part in local TV talent shows. They are also ordered not to set up companies or studios for personal financial purposes. While Xi may earn praise for showing his resolve in tackling corruption, it remains to be seen if he can sustain the campaign long enough to eradicate ""all the rats which still roam the corridors of power"" in China.","President Xi Jinping's new administration has been targeting corrupt officials .

"(CNN) -- What are iconic and twisted and no longer free? Pretzels aboard some Continental Airlines flights. Continental stopped serving complimentary snacks to passengers flying coach on domestic routes this week. The change is consistent with the carrier's merger-partner United Airlines' policy of food for purchase. ""We are removing beverage snacks -- pretzels and Biscoff [cookies] -- in an effort to reduce costs and align ourselves with many of our network competitors,"" Continental representative Andrew Farraro said. Continental expects the pretzel and cookie cut could save $2.8 million annually. The move comes after some domestic airlines, including American and US Airways, have already dropped free in-flight treats. Delta, JetBlue, Airtran and Southwest still offer freebies. Delta, the last major legacy airline to provide them, has no plans to downsize its snack system. ""We believe complimentary snacks are an appropriate component to the flight,"" Delta representative Chris Kelly Singley said. ""There are no plans of changing that right now."" Raymond Kollau of Airlinetrends.com said the once-popular ""free snack"" is no longer a travel staple or airline standard. ""Continental's move is just another sign of legacy carriers reducing amenities in order to shave off a bit of their costs in an industry with cutthroat competition and razor-thin margins,"" he said. Rather than spending millions on reintroducing free in-flight food on United flights, Continental is staying consistent with its merger-partner and creating room for profit with snack packs starting at $3.95 on coach flights, he said. ""For passengers, it means another 'full-service' airline that eliminates even the most basic amenities,"" Kollau said. ""Of course, passengers won't walk away from Continental because their free snack has gone, but what is left of their sympathy for the airline is disappearing fast this way. Although a small service, I think the free snack is quite valued by passengers."" Hungry air travelers could blame rising fuel costs, said global aviation consultant Mike Boyd of Boyd Group International. ""It's to be expected when the price goes over $3 a gallon,"" he said. ""They're going to be doing whatever they can. I don't know what they'll cut next, but I'm sure they'll find something."" Boyd said snack removal shouldn't be considered a calamity. Passengers will shrug and fly anyway. ""We're talking about a bag of pretzels here,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A group of hackers in Germany says it has found a way to bypass the fingerprint-sensor security system on the new iPhone 5S. The hackers claim they fooled the Touch ID biometric security of the iPhone 5S by photographing a fingerprint left on a glass surface and using the resulting image to create a fake ""finger"" which unlocked the phone. They demonstrated their exploits in a video posted Sunday to YouTube. ""We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you canÂ´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token,"" said Frank Rieger, a spokesman for the group, the Chaos Computer Club, in a post online. In the post, the hackers said they snapped a high-resolution photo of a fingerprint, inverted it and laser-printed it with extra toner onto a transparent sheet. Then they smeared pink latex milk or white woodglue into the fingerprint pattern, lifted a thin latex sheet from it and placed it onto the sensor to unlock the phone. ""As we have said now for ... years, fingerprints should not be used to secure anything. You leave them everywhere, and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted prints,"" said a hacker, who goes by the nickname Starbug, on the Chaos Computer Club's site. Apple did not respond to a request from CNN for comment. Starbug and the Chaos Computer Club are being rewarded for their efforts. They were named the winners of an online contest offering a bounty of cash and other prizes to the first person or group to successfully hack the new iPhone's Touch ID system. The contest, IsTouchIDHackedYet, was created by Nick DePetrillo, an independent computer security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones, and Robert David Graham, owner of Errata Security, a cybersecurity firm. It invites donors to contribute to the bounty, which so far includes an assortment of cash, bitcoins (a form of digital currency), several bottles of booze and ""a dirty sex book."" ""It's official. Starbug of the CCC has been declared the winner of #istouchidhackedyet Congrats! Video to come soon,"" DePetrillo posted on Twitter Monday afternoon. The total cash bounty topped $16,000 at one point, although one donor has since reneged on a promised $10,000 donation, according to the site. According to terms DePetrillo posted on Twitter, to collect the bounty a hacker had to lift a fingerprint from the phone or elsewhere and reproduce it in such a way that will allow the hacker to unlock an iPhone 5S in less than five tries. All the steps had to be documented on video. ""The whole point of #istouchidhackedyet was to put up or shut up with regards to criticisms of Apple's Touch ID security and implementation,"" DePetrillo said Saturday on Twitter. The iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday, has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Apple calls the new security system Touch ID. Phone owners must ""register"" their print with the device, after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button. Other users' fingerprints will not unlock the phone, which protects it from thieves. How secure is your iPhone 5S fingerprint? The Touch ID system is meant for human fingerprints, of course, but it apparently works with animals, too. A Minnesota man posted a video Friday to CNN iReport that showed him using the paw of his pet Chihuahua to unlock his new iPhone. DePetrillo and Graham are so-called ""white hat"" hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems. Tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues, which they can then patch before users' personal information is compromised.","Hackers in Germany say they have successfully hacked the new iPhone 5S .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration released two documents on Friday describing the scope of National Security Agency data collection programs, a bid to quiet criticism they violate privacy rights. An NSA memorandum describes the beginnings of the agency's collection of so-called telephone metadata of nearly every American under a provision of the Patriot Act, and the agency's monitoring of foreign Internet traffic. The agency says in the memo that its systems monitor 1.6% of the world's Internet traffic, and its analysts review .00004% of global traffic. Published accounts drawn from leaked documents provided by admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden have portrayed a much broader eavesdropping system under section 702 of the Patriot Act. Another document from the Justice Department describes the legal basis for collecting the telephone metadata, such as the numbers dialed, the length and time of the calls. The government says the NSA phone data collection operated under court supervision, and that the database is only accessed for specific searches in counterterrorism investigations. The document also explains why government lawyers say the program carried out under section 215 of the Patriot Act respects constitutional First and Fourth Amendment freedoms, which protect free speech rights and prohibit the government from unreasonable search and seizure. The release of the documents came as President Barack Obama held a news conference where he addressed the Snowden leaks, and promised greater transparency about the government's surveillance programs. See NSA document (PDF) He defended the NSA programs which he said have been incorrectly portrayed as an invasion of privacy and said they were key to protecting national security. Still, the president promised to consider changes to help reassure the public that the Patriot Act wasn't leading to abuses. The NSA memo describes how the agency was monitoring conversations between one of the hijackers that carried out the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and people in an al Qaeda safe house in Yemen. The agency says it didn't have the ability to find out that the hijacker was already in the United States living in San Diego, and therefore couldn't tell the FBI. According to the memo, the data collection programs were begun to address those shortcomings. The NSA memo also for the first time explains some of the confusion over various agency codenames for its collection programs. According to the NSA, the agency uses different code names for data collected from each communications company. ""Some that have been revealed in the press recently include FAIRVIEW, BLARNEY, OAKSTAR, and LITHIUM. While some have tried to characterize the involvement of such providers as separate programs, that is not accurate,"" the memo says. The Justice white paper released Friday argues that ""The vast majority of the telephony metadata is never seen by any person because it is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized. But the information that is generated in response to these limited queries could be especially significant in helping the government identify and disrupt terrorist plots."" The document also says that the phone data doesn't ""involve tracking locations from which telephone calls are made."" The government's three branches, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and Congress, help oversee the programs, the Justice memo argues. Critics have argued that the data collection violates privacy rights, and that the government should require warrants to collect such information. The Supreme Court last year restricted the government's use of GPS trackers on cars of suspects under investigation, making it necessary to seek warrants. The Justice Department says the phone metadata is different and that ""Supreme Court precedent makes clear that participants in telephone calls lack a reasonable expectation of privacy for purposes of the Fourth Amendment in the telephone numbers used to make and receive their calls."" In any case, the Justice memo says ""any arguable privacy intrusion arising from the collection of telephony metadata would be outweighed by the public interest in identifying suspected terrorist operatives and thwarting terrorist plots."" The Justice memo also argues that the government's rules ""expressly prohibits the collection of records for an investigation that is being conducted solely on the basis of protected First Amendment activity, if the investigation is of a U.S. person.""","Two documents describe scope of NSA data collection programs .

"(Mashable)  -- A new survey from casual gaming company PopCap shows that an incredibly high percentage of adults in the UK and U.S. is into mobile gaming. This stat may be due in part to the uptick in smartphone adoption. According to a separate Nielsen survey, 31% of U.S. mobile users now own smartphones, and a Pew survey shows nearly half of cellphone users download and use mobile apps, too. In PopCap's research, more than half (52%) of 2,425 respondents said they had played a game on a mobile device, whether their own device or someone else's, at some time in the past. The percentage for UK respondents was significantly higher (73%) than the rate for U.S. respondents (44%). Around one-third of all respondents had played a game on their own mobile phones within the past month, and one out of four respondents said they played games on a weekly basis. Still, some respondents admitted to only having played a mobile game once. The biggest gaming group was smartphone users. A full 83% of smartphone-owning respondents said they had played at least one mobile game in the past week, putting them solidly in the ""avid mobile gamer"" category. Interestingly, the male-to-female ratio in mobile gaming doesn't show the pronounced gender gap seen in console and PC gaming. Men play slightly more than women by a slim margin of 2-10%. This fits pretty well with the current picture we have of the social gaming scene as a predominantly female market. And mobile gamers aren't just biding their time on mass transit; they're also contributing to the bottom line of game manufacturers across the major mobile platforms. Around half of all mobile gamers in this survey said they had upgraded a free trial game to the full or paid version in the past year. And one out of four mobile gamers, or one out of three smartphone gamers, said they had bought ""additional content"" for a game within the past year. Also, smartphone users are more likely to buy games than their feature phone-owning counterparts, for obvious reasons. The average smartphone-using mobile gamer bought 5.4 games in 2010, versus the 2.9 games bought by non-smartphone-owning gamers. Also, the smartphone crowd said they spent more money on games -- $25.57 per user for the year, compared to $15.70 from feature phone owners. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- Efren Penaflorida was grateful when Typhoon Haiyan bypassed his home in Cavite City, Philippines. But when he saw the devastation in other areas of the country, he wanted to do all he could to help his fellow Filipinos. ""I was crying watching the news,"" said Penaflorida, the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year. ""It really sank my heart, seeing all the people who lost their loved ones, houses. They lost everything."" Penaflorida immediately began collecting donations at his mobile ""pushcart classrooms,"" which he uses to educate poor children in the country. But he wanted to do more. So he reached halfway around the world to Doc Hendley, a North Carolina clean-water activist who had also been honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009. After a disaster strikes, access to clean water is vital to help prevent the spread of disease. Hendley, who has responded to humanitarian crises in Darfur, Haiti and Syria, had just started assessing how his nonprofit, Wine to Water, might help the Philippines when he received Penaflorida's e-mail. ""I was already thinking that maybe I should go, "" Hendley said. ""When he shot me the e-mail ... he sealed the deal. ""Our organization depends on relationships with people on the ground ... (and) what better relationship than with Efren?"" Soon, Hendley was on a flight to the Philippines with hundreds of water filters in tow. Penaflorida picked him up at the airport in Manila. ""That was a long trip from the U.S. to the Philippines ... and he has put out his own money and resources to help us,"" Penaflorida said. ""We were both excited, seeing each other."" The next day, both men helped volunteers assemble the filters and pack 120,000 meals donated by Stop Hunger Now, one of Hendley's partner organizations. Then they headed to Tacloban, in the heart of the devastated area, to deliver the filters. Hendley said it's hard to communicate the scope of the disaster. ""It reminds me of Haiti because the buildings are completely collapsed, destroyed ... but it's different,"" he said. ""The trees on mountains are blown over, lying down like matchsticks, and palm trees have snapped in half, broken. It's pretty shocking."" Penaflorida said that the destruction was worse than he'd seen on television, but he soon found reason to take heart. ""When we got to the communities, they were asking for help,"" he said. ""When Doc presented them with filters, I saw hope in their eyes."" Hendley said they will have distributed 2,000 filters by the end of the week. Because each filter can provide enough clean water for 10 people, and because each will last for 10 years, Hendley estimates that at least 20,000 people will benefit. He originally planned to return home for the Thanksgiving holiday, but he now intends to stay until early December. ""I couldn't be home for a nice Thanksgiving dinner and pretend like nothing happened,"" he said. ""There's too much we have to do."" Penaflorida returned home Wednesday to focus on a new project: bringing his pushcart classrooms to the devastated areas to help educate children while the communities rebuild. The country's minister of education has expressed strong interest in the large-scale replication of the program, Penaflorida said, and asked him to assess the feasibility during his visit. Penaflorida hopes work can begin in the coming weeks. Other CNN Heroes are also responding to help those affected by the typhoon. Robin Lim, the American-born midwife named CNN Hero of the Year in 2011, has strong ties to the Philippines; her mother was Filipino. So after the storm, she brought food and medical supplies. She has also been working with local clinics to provide assistance to pregnant women, new mothers and young children. Unexpectedly, Hendley and Penaflorida ran into Lim as they traveled from Manila, an impromptu Heroes reunion of sorts. Hendley now plans to provide water filters to Lim so she can distribute them to the women and children she is helping. Dr. Laura Stachel, a 2013 Top 10 Hero, has also provided Lim with one of five ""solar suitcases"" that she has donated to the relief effort. These portable kits provide essential power to medical clinics. Team Rubicon, a group of military veterans that responds to natural disasters, was on the ground within days of the storm. The group, founded by 2012 CNN Hero Jake Wood, has 43 volunteers in the Philippines providing medical care, opening supply lines and helping repair a field hospital in an area west of Tacloban. Evans Wadongo, a Top 10 CNN Hero in 2010, is also hoping to partner with Penaflorida. Although Wadongo normally distributes his solar-powered lanterns to rural communities in Africa, he has launched an online campaign to raise funds so he can assist Filipinos more than 5,000 miles away. This outpouring of help has greatly touched Penaflorida. ""CNN Heroes are like family, and I'm glad that my fellow Heroes have immediately responded,"" he said. ""But that's what you do when you are family: You help each other. ... That makes me feel happy and so grateful."" You can support relief efforts in the Philippines through Penaflorida's Dynamic Teen Company or Hendley's Wine to Water or by visiting CNN's Impact Your World. CNN's Marissa Calhoun contributed to this report.","Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, has devastated the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- Many people think Amelia Earhart's fame rests on her dramatic disappearance in 1937. I don't think so. I think her life has been overshadowed by her death. I think that when her Electra aircraft is finally found, the focus will return to her life and her remarkable accomplishments. She will become even more famous than she is today. A new, privately funded investigation into one of the most famous missing persons cases in history will start this summer, carried out by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery. It will be headed by Ric Gillespie. The group has mounted 10 previous expeditions to Gardner Island, also known as Nikumaroro, in the Pacific. I wish him well, but my experience leads me to believe Gillespie will come up empty again. Earhart started flying in the 1920s. Her first plane was powered by one of the first -- and still unproven -- air-cooled engines ever made. But Earhart possessed more than guts and a passion for flying. She was blessed with good looks and intelligence. She thrived on publicity, charmed men and set as her mission in life the empowerment of women. She went on the lecture circuit to finance her flights and became wildly popular, the Oprah Winfrey of her day. Earhart helped create and lead the Ninety Nines, the women's flying organization that promoted women fliers, and was idolized by her flying peers as much because she was fun as because she was efficient. She married a successful publisher, George Putnam, who looked like a stand-in for Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent. He devoted his life to her. In a time when planes were being perfected and aviators were the superstars of the day, she matched the men. Earhart's most daring achievement was that five years to the day after Charles Lindbergh's flight, she took off from Harbor Grace, Newfoundland, and safely landed her red single-engine Lockheed Vega in a farmer's field in Derry, Ireland. After a harrowing flight replete with equipment malfunctions and bad weather, she became the first woman and the second pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic. The world went crazy. After the flight, she was elevated to almost mythic status. ""Forget Garbo, forget Jackie, she was in a realm beyond stardom,"" recalled Gore Vidal, who knew her well. She set countless speed, long-distance and altitude records. She was on what she planned as her last record-breaking flight in 1937 when she went missing, flying around the world at the equator, which had never before been done. She had always flown solo, but on this last flight, she took along a navigator, Fred Noonan. She was on the last, most dangerous leg of the flight, taking off from Lae, Papua New Guinea, for Howland Island, a dot in the middle of the Pacific a bit north of the equator and 2,556 miles away. She was landing there to refuel the Electra before flying on to Hawaii. When she failed to appear, the Itasca, a U.S. Coast guard vessel waiting at Howland Island to guide her in, radioed the world. The final resting place of her plane has never been ascertained, but most fliers and history buffs, including me, think that the plane rests on the ocean floor somewhere in the vicinity of her destination of Howland Island, rather than Gardner Island, 400 miles away. But the ocean is 17,500 feet deep around Howland, a mile deeper than the resting place of the Titanic. Only recently has technology allowed the construction of underwater vehicles that can endure such extreme pressure. In 2009, I was on the second leg of the R/V Seward Johnson's search for Earhart. The Seward Johnson is a 204-foot research vessel that set out from American Samoa to search the ocean floor to the west of Howland Island. Ted Waitt, founder of Gateway Computer and creator Waitt Institute for Discovery, was behind the expedition. A great admirer of Earhart, he was also the impetus behind the recent movie, ""Amelia."" There were 29 of us aboard the Seward Johnson: scientists, oceanographers, technicians, computer experts and ordinary seamen. Autonomous underwater vehicles, bright yellow sonar subs 12 feet long, did the searching. For 46 days, the AUVs looked for the plane round the clock. Going on the assumption that headwinds had slowed the plane down more than Noonan realized, the subs were deployed to survey to the west of Howland Island. The AUVs work by pinging the ocean floor as they travel just above it, sending up signals that are displayed on computer screens as dots that change color as the subs ping over different surfaces. The softest surface, sand, transmits as blue dots; hard stone and metal transmit as red dots that blend off into green. The Electra, as a metal object, would show up red. Once an AUV pinged a large metal object: It turned out to be a 55-gallon steel drum. Other than that, the ocean floor was as barren as the moon. In the past 16 or so years, The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery has come back with all sorts of artifacts that Gillespie was sure would prove to have belonged to Earhart. Nothing has held up to scrutiny. While his hunches have led him to concentrate on this island, Gardner was one of the first islands searched, five days after Earhart went missing. At that time, three planes catapulted from the battleship USS Colorado searched the area. If one of the three pilots had sighted anything even slightly promising, the pilot would have reported it. The pilot who sighted the plane would instantly have been the hero of the hour. Such a sighting was never made. At President Franklin Roosevelt's bidding, the Colorado was within days joined by a fleet of nine ships of the U.S. Navy, including an aircraft carrier that held 62 planes, to look for Earhart. The ships and the planes then conducted a search they estimated as covering 150,000 square miles. The Seward Johnson only searched the ocean floor to the west of Howland Island. It is my best guess that the plane rests on the ocean floor to the east, waiting to be found by the next expedition. Whoever finds Earhart and her Electra will deservedly become famous. I agree with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has said the search itself is inspirational. It will be wonderful news when one day our lost heroine is found. In the meantime, Earhart remains an icon, revered by young women, remembered by many for her signal accomplishments, remembered by all because of her dramatic end. She is 39 forever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Butler.","Susan Butler thinks new expedition won't find Amelia Earhart's vanished plane .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Life has its share of both stormy and sunny moments. There are clouds (your car broke down) and then there are silver linings (but at least it's a nice day for a walk). While most of us would classify the recession as the mother of all clouds it, too, has a silver lining. The current recession has sparked a big upswing in entrepreneurial pursuits, and small businesses are cropping up around the country. According to a recent study by the Kauffman Foundation, ""Rather than making history for its deep recession and record unemployment, 2009 might instead be remembered as the year business startups reached their highest level in 14 years -- even exceeding the number of startups during the peak 1999-2000 technology boom."" Although the highest spike in startup rates was among people ages 35-44, the entrepreneurial bug hasn't only bitten those established in their careers. Many young people are also turning toward owning their own businesses as an alternative to finding a full-time, entry-level job. ""Young people are keenly aware of the recent economic downturn, and have seen parents, relatives or friends lose their jobs,"" says Alice Horn, executive director of the South Florida chapter of Network for Teaching Entrepreneurs. ""They understand they cannot count on the same job -- or even the same career -- for an extended period in the future. For growing numbers, this means 'making their own job' as entrepreneurs."" Below, how three young people are doing just that: . Zephyr Basine, Editor-in-Chief, CollegeFashion.net . Zephyr Basine started College Fashion as a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts, when she noticed a lack of fashion publications directed at college students. Although it only took her only a few hours to create her blog, ""It kind of took off from there,"" she says. Currently, CollegeFashion.net gets around 1.5 million page views per month. ""By the beginning of my senior year, I was already earning more money from the site than I would have at an entry-level management job,"" Basine says. ""The idea of giving that up to search for a 9-to-5 job didn't seem very attractive. In addition, I have always really enjoyed working on the site -- I thought, 'So long as I'm still having fun and can afford to work for myself, why not stick with it? I can always get a job later if it doesn't work out.' The poor state of the job market only made me feel more confident in my decision."" After working for herself since graduating college in 2009, Basine doubts she could ever begin working for someone else. ""I know I work 10 times harder for myself than I ever would for someone else, so I'll be more successful long-term as a self-employed person. The self-employed lifestyle really suits me; it's a great fit for my personality and I am very happy with my choice,"" she says. Giancarlo Massaro, Founder, AnyLuckyDay.com . ""One night while watching TV, I saw an infomercial that caught my attention and I thought it would be a good idea if I could test out products before I had to buy them. With a little tweaking of that idea, the AnyLuckyDay concept was born,"" says Giancarlo Massaro, who will be a senior at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut this fall. AnyLuckyDay.com is Massaro's daily contest website, where he promotes companies by giving away their products to his audience. ""I started this business in January 2009 at the age of 19 as a hobby just to review products and give them away, but since January 2010, I have been selling days on a calendar to companies and so far have sold close to 200 of 365 days this year,"" says Massaro. Companies he's worked with include Snyder's of Hanover, Boston Acoustics, Peek Mobile, Flip Video Camcorders, Keurig Coffee, Griffin Technology and Scottvest clothing. Massaro has no plans to trade AnyLuckyDay.com for a full-time job after graduation next year. Alex Hodara, CEO, Hodara Real Estate Group . In the year and a half since Alex Hodara started Hodara Real Estate Group, the company has sold more than $4 million in real estate and rented over 100 apartments. Hodara started his business while still a student at Boston University, but says it never crossed his mind to do anything but grow his business when he graduated this past May. ""As the CEO of my own company, I learn diverse skills and take on responsibilities that I would never be able to get in a traditional entry-level job,"" he says. Although Hodara says the economy played little role in his decision to pursue his business (""I was already determined to continue growing the Hodara business rather than pursue a job search,"" he says) he certainly understands the plight of his peers that were forced to enter the job market. ""This has certainly been a hard year for the graduating class of my undergraduate business school. Many students had a difficult time finding jobs, and many people are still looking. I was lucky enough to have a successful business that allows me to support myself financially, and I try to do whatever possible to help my friends as they continue their job searches, whether in helping them to network with business associates of mine or making them a part of the HREG team,"" he says. To those who might be having a hard time finding a job after graduation, Hodara says: ""Young people should keep in mind that starting your own business is always an option -- if you feel comfortable with your abilities and have an idea that you can realistically build on after graduation."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011.

"(CNN) -- The Arizona Division of Forestry has been fined $559,000 for workplace violations during the Yarnell Hill fire that left 19 elite firefighters dead, state health and safety officials said Wednesday. The state forestry division has 15 days to appeal the citations, which accuse the organization of mismanaging the fire when it failed to prioritize the safety of firefighters over the protection of non-defensible structures and property. It also accuses the state forestry division of failing to develop the necessary action plans and fire analysis to combat the wildfire as well as failing to provide necessary and key incident command personnel. ""There are lessons that can be learned from this horrible tragedy and we owe it to the firefighters who died, and to those that risked their lives fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire, to do so,"" Bill Warren, director of the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health, said in a written statement. The $559,000 fine is the largest handed down by the occupational safety and health division. It includes a penalty of $25,000 for each firefighter killed on June 30. The state forestry division did not immediately respond to the findings. Who were the firefighters? The Yarnell Hill Fire, which is considered the deadliest in state history, began June 28 when lightning strikes started several fires, according to the state forestry division. Hundreds of homes and other buildings were destroyed in the wildfire that began near Yarnell, a community of about 600 people northwest of Phoenix, authorities said at the time. The findings of the occupational safety and health division appeared to contradict, at least in part, the finding of a state forestry division investigation that was released in September. That report concluded there was ""no indication of negligence, reckless actions, or violations of policy or protocol."" Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . On June 30, driven by fierce winds, the fire turned and overran the hot shot crew, authorities said. The fast-moving fire cut off the crew's evacuation route and its path to a safety zone, according to the state forestry division report. ""They were deploying fire shelters when the fire overtook them,"" it said. Temperatures exceeded 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and ""the deployment site was not survivable,"" the report said. The deaths of the 19 members of the Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew represented about 20 percent of Prescott's fire department. Killed, according to officials, were: Eric Marsh, the unit's 43-year-old superintendent; Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Robert Caldwell, 23; Travis Carter, 31; Dustin Deford, 24; Christopher MacKenzie, 30; Grant McKee, 21; Sean Misner, 26; Scott Norris, 28; Wade Parker, 22; John Percin, 24; Anthony Rose, 23; Jesse Steed, 36; Joe Thurston, 32; Travis Turbyfill, 27; William Warneke, 25; Clayton Whitted, 28; Kevin Woyjeck, 21; and Garret Zuppiger, 27.","The Arizona Division of Forestry has been hit with penalties related to the deaths of 19 firefighters .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- The chairman of the Samsung Group plans to resign, according to a report published Tuesday by Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. Chairman of the Samsung Group Lee Kun-hee has been indicted for tax evasion and breach of trust. The decision of Lee Kun-hee to step down comes a few days after his indictment amid an investigation into corruption allegations. Lee was indicted for tax evasion and breach of trust. Samsung is South Korea's largest conglomerate. It has annual sales of nearly $160 billion and accounts for 18 percent of South Korea's economic output. The company's exports -- valued at about $70 billion -- account for a fifth of all South Korean exports. Lee was indicted for breach of trust in connection with a plan to transfer control of the company to his son, a prosecutor said. He was also indicted for tax evasion. Investigators started looking into Samsung in January, after a former company lawyer said the company created slush funds worth $200 million. Last week, however, a prosecutor said an investigation found no evidence supporting an allegation that the company bribed government officials and prosecutors. Samsung has apologized for ""causing concerns"" and said it would outline plans for reform this week. E-mail to a friend .","Samsung Group chairman, Lee Kun-hee, plans to resign, Yonhap reports .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Council has joined governments of at least five other major U.S. cities and one state in passing legislation requiring private employers to provide paid sick time. The Earned Sick Time Act, which now goes to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will require private businesses with 20 or more employees, to provide five paid sick days annually, beginning in April 2014. Some businesses will be exempt from the requirement to pay employees for sick time, but will still be required to provide time off without penalty to employees. The act was approved with a 45-3 vote tally, and comes after the City Council announced an agreement in March to pass the act. The Council expects the new legislation to affect nearly 1 million New York workers, according to a press release. ""People who are sick or who need to care for a loved one should be able to take time off without the fear of losing their job or not having money to pay the bills,"" City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said. ""At the same time, we can't ignore the harsh realities that small businesses face, and we need to protect their interests as well. This bill strikes that important balance."" The bill now goes to Bloomberg, who vowed Wednesday to veto it. Bloomberg said that the some workers will suffer as some companies may lay off employees or split up into smaller companies to avoid falling under the regulations. Judge orders morning-after pill available without prescription in New York . ""History shows that an awful lot of people will take those days whether they're sick or not. You can then argue they're vacation days,"" Bloomberg said. If Bloomberg does veto the bill, the City Council can override the veto with a two-thirds vote. In 2006, San Francisco became the first city to required companies to provide paid sick days, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. Washington and Milwaukee followed in 2008, and Connecticut became the first state to pass statewide paid sick time laws in 2011. New York appeals soda-cup decision . Seattle passed laws in 2011, and Portland, Oregon, followed earlier in 2013. Currently there are no federal legal requirements for paid sick leave, according to the U.S. Department of Labor website. Some companies are subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year ""for certain medical situations for either the employee or a member of the employee's immediate family."" The FMLA was amended in 2008 to permit a ""spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin"" to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a member of the Armed Forces who is undergoing medical treatment, according to the Department of Labor website.","The City Council passed the legislation 45-3 .

"(CNN) -- As the run-up to the 2012 U.S. elections gains momentum, Hispanic Americans may prove to be an especially influential political force. According to a new report, the political mobilization of U.S. Hispanics is an increasingly mobile (as in cell phones) phenomenon. According to Connected Hispanics and Civic Engagement, published recently by the Hispanic Institute, ""The use of cell phones builds upon the cultural affinity for close connections and opens the way for organized political and social action. Three areas in particular demonstrate the power of mobile technology in the Hispanic community: immigration, education and voter registration/mobilization."" The report points out that Hispanics have been leading the U.S. population in terms of embracing mobile technology. For example, last summer Pew found that more than 87 percent of English-speaking U.S. Hispanics owned a cell phone, vs. 80 percent of non-Hispanic whites. Another Pew study found that, compared to the general American population, Hispanics use their cell phones more often, and they use more features on their phones. Additionally, Pew found in 2009 that Hispanics were leading other ethnic groups in mobile internet access. Hispanic mobile civic engagement isn't just limited to smartphones, which so far comprise less than one third of the cell phones in use in the United States. Much of this activity is happening via text messaging, e-mail, the mobile web and social media -- tools available on most ""feature phones"" (the next step down from smartphones, and usually the most affordable type of cell phone). For example, the report notes that in 2006 ""a group of 4,000 Hispanic high school students used MySpace, e-mails, and texting to organize a walkout in protest. The students' success served as an inspiration for a subsequent major demonstration in April 2006 in Dallas with 350,000 participants."" And in 2009, two immigration advocacy groups (Reform Immigration FOR America and the Fair Immigration Reform Movement coalition), ran a successful text messaging campaign. They sent out simple alerts containing key information, calls to action, and quick responses to breaking news. They gathered feedback via text messaging. Organizers credit this with increased attendance at rallies and hearings in 2009 compared to previous rallies in 2008. Cell phones also played a leading role in mobilizing the 10,000 Nevada voters that the Hispanic Institute signed up during its 2009 voter registration drive: . ""Once individuals were registered to vote, they were sent numerous text messages to remind them about early voting, voting site locations, availability of transportation to the voting sites, updates about ballot initiatives, and other information. Additionally, voters were given contact information and a central location for in-person contacts. This two-way mobile network allowed voters to access information when it was most convenient to them."" Furthermore, ""THI staff were able use text messaging to gauge how many of the newly registered voters had taken part in early voting or were likely to wait until Nov. 2. With this real-time data, THI staff were able to then target particular neighborhoods, and even specific addresses, for additional in-person follow up."" THI believes that mobile apps increasingly will drive Hispanic civic engagement. A 2010 Pew report indicates that U.S. Hispanic smartphone owners are avidly embracing apps, for everything from video sharing to banking and more. And in general, apps are becoming a key tool for all kinds of political and advocacy campaigns -- from candidate-driven to grassroots. Apps may indeed fuel future Hispanic civic engagement. But if the goal is to reach a large and economically diverse group such as Hispanics, smartphone apps are just one part of an integrated mobile strategy. Other vital components of effective engagement efforts include simpler Java-based apps (designed to run on feature phones via platforms such as Snaptu and GetJar), mobile web sites, social media, e-mail, and text messaging. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Hispanic Americans may prove to be an especially influential political force in 2012 U.S. elections .

"(CNN) -- The United States has offered to destroy Syria's ""priority chemicals,"" the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Saturday. ""The United States has offered to contribute a destruction technology, full operational support and financing to neutralize Syria's priority chemicals, which are to be removed from the country by 31 December,"" the group said in a statement. A joint OPCW-United Nations team charged with overseeing the destruction of the weapons began inspecting sites in October. The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid-2014 for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences. The goal is to move the most dangerous chemicals out of the country as quickly as possible, said Sigrid Kaag, head of the joint team. OPCW approves road map for Syria chemical weapons destruction . The operation will be conducted on a U.S. vessel at sea using hydrolysis, a method that dilutes the most dangerous chemicals to a point where they can be disposed of safely. The OPCW has turned to the private sector for the destruction of Syria's other chemicals, including common industrial ones. An estimated 1.8 million pounds (800 metric tons), accounting for a major part of Syria's stockpile, is to be disposed of commercially at a cost estimated at $47 million to $54 million. Some 35 companies have expressed interest and are being evaluated, the OPCW said. United States still getting rid of its chemical weapons . The U.N. resolution on Syria's chemical weapons was based on a deal struck between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people overall have died since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. It began with a government crackdown on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement, then slowly and bloodily spiraled into a a full-blown civil war. There was more bloodshed Saturday in the Middle Eastern nation. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria blamed President Bashar al-Assad's forces for a ""horrible massacre against civilians"" in al-Bab, in Aleppo province. The network of opposition activists said at least 21 people died after Syrian warplanes dropped ""explosive barrels"" on the city. These were among at least 72 people killed nationwide Saturday, the LCC reported. While it did not mention Al-Bab specifically, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, or SANA, reported that government troops killed ""dozens of terrorists"" in Aleppo province. The units additionally destroyed ""missile launchers"" -- some of which, the SANA report claimed, had been ""used by terrorists to target residents"" -- ""and cars loaded with weapons and ammunition in several villages and towns."" The conflict, once again, spilled outside Syria's borders on Saturday. At least five people died in clashes between pro and anti-Syrian regime groups in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, Lebanon's state-run news agency NNA reported Saturday. Lebanese Armed Forces have retaliated with gunfire in the area in an attempt to restore calm, according to NNA.

"(CNN) -- Doctors are fighting to save the sight of the artistic director of Russia's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet after a masked assailant threw acid in his face on a Moscow street, state media reported. Sergei Filin, 43, was approaching his home around midnight Thursday when the unidentified attacker flung the concentrated acid at him, causing severe burns to his face, the state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Friday. It could take Filin at least six months to recover from the third-degree burns to his face and eyes, RIA Novosti cited Yekaterina Novikova, a Bolshoi spokeswoman, as saying. Filin took up the key role at the world-renowned ballet company in 2011, after three years directing Moscow's Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater. There was ""fierce rivalry"" for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to RIA Novosti. The agency reported that Filin had suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls and the slashing of his car tires.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Making it to the top as a prima ballerina takes a lot of work, strength and time -- and, says, Svetlana Zakharova, ""a lot of emotions."" The 33-year-old Russian has been prima ballerina, or principal dancer, with Moscow's prestigious Bolshoi theatre company for nearly a decade and her presence on a cast list is guaranteed to fill any theatre in London, New York or Paris. Zakharova's grace and stage presence belie her difficult, and sometimes lonely, journey to the top. Born in the historic, north-western city of Lutsk in Soviet-era Ukraine, Zakharova's mother sent her away to train at the age of 10 -- first to Kiev, then at St. Petersburg's esteemed Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet. ""It took me a few years to get used to the ballet,"" she said. ""My child's body was not ready to handle such loads, and the legs that were used to walk upright had to be twisted and the back always had to be held straight. It was a huge strain and I did not have the strength."" It was an unhappy period in the young Zakharova's life. She says that she would find herself crying ""all the time"" between the conveyor belt of exams and rehearsals. More from Human to Hero: Molecular gastronomy chef Heston Blumenthal . Only when, as a teenager, her body grew tall, strong and athletic did she begin to see how her future might pan out. ""When I was about 13 or 14 ... I really realized that I wanted to become a ballerina,"" she said. From then on she practiced everyday, often for up to eight hours solid. She says she didn't miss out on the usual freedoms of childhood: ""I cannot say that it was a sacrifice,"" she said. ""I do not even think about it."" Revealingly, she wouldn't wish the same experience for her own daughter, who was born in February 2011. ""I cannot imagine myself giving her away to study in a different town,"" she said. ""I asked my mum, 'Why? How did it happen?' And she said, 'You know, even until now I can not understand what I was led by -- it must have been something from above.'"" Zakharova graduated from Varganova Academy in 1996, aged 17, and immediately joined the Mariinsky Ballet -- one of Russia's preeminent ballet companies -- and a year later was promoted to principal dancer. In the seven seasons that followed, she learned the bulk of the company's repertory, including the great classical roles of Giselle, Odette-Odile in ""Swan Lake"" and Aurora in ""The Sleeping Beauty."" More from Human to Hero: Former piano prodigy Benjamin Grosvenor . Despite growing national acclaim -- she was awarded one of Russia's highest artistic accolades, the Golden Mask, for two consecutive years at the turn of the millennium -- she was getting itchy feet. ""I worked in the Mariinsky theatre for seven years, and I danced the whole classic repertoire there, and the contemporary repertoire,"" she says. ""But all of a sudden I started to realize that I was not developing any more. Day in, day out it was the same and the same -- and suddenly I wanted to change something."" That change came in a dramatic move to Mariinky's main rival, the Bolshoi ballet company in Moscow, known for it's ""grander, more expansive style,"" according to Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper. Zakharova hasn't looked back since. With the Bolshoi she has traveled the globe and in 2007 she was awarded the Russian State Prize for outstanding achievement in ballet. Next year she is scheduled to perform at Milan's renowned La Scala opera house, where she will dance Giselle. Success, though, has not eradicated a persistent grain of self-doubt. Even now, as she enters her 15th year as a professional dancer, Zakharova still regards herself, for the most part, as a student. ""When I'm in rehearsal I always feel like I'm a pupil -- and not at all a ballerina"" she reveals. Indeed, it's only in those comparatively brief moments on stage that Zakharova says she truly believes in herself as a performer. ""This transformation is unique,"" she explains. ""Something from within takes place and you understand sometimes that human abilities are limitless. During the performance you do such things which you completely did not expect from yourself."" Whatever it is that envelops her on stage, the feeling is addictive. Zarkharova has been dancing almost everyday since the age six and now finds it hard to imagine what the future will hold when, one day, she will have to hang up her ballet shoes for good. ""Ballet is not just my profession, it is my life ... It is horrible for me to think that one day it will all finish.""

"LONDON, England  -- Models younger than 16 should be banned from catwalks during London Fashion Week over fears that some girls are developing eating disorders because of their work in the industry, fashion experts have recommended. British model Lily Cole, now 19, shot to fame in 2003 at the age of 15. She attracted attention for her thin build. The new rules were proposed after a panel of experts in the UK began investigating health problems among models in the wake of the size zero debate. However, the guidelines fall short of banning stick-thin girls from the catwalk. The independent Model Health Inquiry said Wednesday in its interim report into models' working conditions that a greater level of protection for 17- and 18 year-olds was needed, including chaperoning at shows. The panel said models under 16 were particularly vulnerable. It mentioned the risk of children being sexually exploited when they were made to represent adult women. It also called for a rigorous scientific study into the prevalence of eating disorders among fashion models and outlined a positive case for setting up a union for the modeling profession. During the inquiry, panel members heard from many models who described the fear of not being selected for work because they were not thin enough, according to Panel chairwoman Baroness Kingsmill, the UK's Press Associated reported. ""The panel has set out an approach designed to protect vulnerable young workers in an industry which appears to be glamorous but which has hidden risks and that for all practical purposes is largely unregulated and unmonitored,"" Kingsmill said. ""During our investigations members of the panel became increasingly concerned as we heard more details about the working conditions faced by many models and the vulnerability of young women working in an unregulated and scarcely-monitored work environment. ""We have been given startling medical evidence about the prevalence and impact of eating disorders in certain high-risk industries. Working conditions for models are far from transparent and there is a worrying lack of information about the overall profession."" The panel ruled out weighing all models because it had been ineffective in other countries, PA said. However, they want more information on whether a minimum body mass index (BMI) requirement of 18.5 should be introduced for London Fashion Week models. This approach has already been adopted by Madrid fashion week. It called on the British Fashion Council which owns and runs London Fashion Week to develop new best-practice standards for model agencies. After gathering responses to its interim report, the inquiry will publish its final report in September, along with a final set of recommendations, ahead of the next London Fashion Week. Agencies should arrange medical checks including screening for eating disorders when they first put a model on their books. This should be followed by annual check-ups, the panel said. The College of Psychiatrists told the panel that models with a BMI of below 18.5 -- which means they are underweight -- should be banned from the catwalk, but other respondents said BMI did not help identify the eating disorder bulimia nervosa. Last year, models with a BMI of less than 18 were banned from taking part in Madrid Fashion Week. Doctors use the index, which is a ratio of height to weight, to calculate the healthy size for an individual. Recent controversy over skinny models was sparked in August 2006, when Uruguayan model Luisel Ramos, 22, died of heart failure after not eating for several days. Her death was followed in November by that of Ana Carolina Reston, a Brazilian model who suffered from anorexia. The debate about the U.S. size zero was caused by celebrities dieting down to the super-thin size. E-mail to a friend .","Panel: Under 16s too vulnerable to work as models, recommends catwalk ban .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The United Nations is reviewing its security procedures after an attack on a private guesthouse in central Kabul killed five U.N. staff members Wednesday. However, the agency's leader said it would not blink in carrying out its ""noble mission"" in war-ravaged Afghanistan. Speaking to reporters at the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters that the United Nations remains committed to working in Afghanistan, where workers from the world body have been helping the fledgling government plan a second round of the country's flawed presidential elections. In addition to the five U.N. staff members who were killed the carnage also wounded nine others, Ban said. The U.S. State Department said one American working for the United Nations was among the dead. Of the non-U.N. employees, three Afghans were killed. Ban said there were at least 25 U.N. staff members at the guest house, including 17 members of the U.N. election team. ""This is a sad day and very difficult day for the United Nations,"" Ban said, condemning the ""shocking and shameless act and the terrorists who committed this crime"" and noting that the incident is a reminder of how tough the U.N. job is in Afghanistan. Ban said he was assured by Kai Eide, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, that Afghan President Hamid Karzai has instructed his Interior Ministry to provide strengthened security, and he said the United Nations will also take necessary measures to beef up security -- in other areas of the country as well as Kabul. ""We will, of course, review our security procedures, as we do regularly for the Afghanistan mission as a whole. We will take all necessary measures to protect our staff,"" Ban said. In the strike, weapons fire and explosions pounded the heart of the capital starting about 6 a.m. local time. The fighting began as sporadic gunfire, but intensified over time, lasting more than an hour. The attack took place in a relatively secure section of the capital, in the vicinity of a number of government buildings, and the firefight, which included machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades, appeared to be concentrated near the guesthouse. A plume of black smoke rose from the compound. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying on an insurgent Web site that three militants killed 50 foreigners, who were election organizers. The claim did not include specific details and could not be independently confirmed. The violence comes 10 days ahead of a presidential runoff election on November 7. Taliban militants have threatened to disrupt the polling. Officials said three militants were killed. One was shot dead by an Afghan soldier, and another wearing an explosives vest died when it was detonated. Karzai condemned the violence, as did the United States and the European Union. The second round of the presidential election -- a runoff between Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah -- comes after a first round marred with complaints of fraud, and the polling has led war critics to question whether the United States and other nations should invest their money and lives in a country where the government appears corrupt. Ban addressed the problems of government corruption and the drug trade, saying that he has urged Karzai to deal with the issues. If the matters aren't confronted, Ban said, it will not be possible to expect to have a credible government. He also urged the Afghan government to engage in politically conciliatory dialogue with many ethnic group leaders and regional country leaders. There had been an increase in international troop levels this year to provide security for the Afghan election in August, and the United States is considering the deployment of more troops to the country. The issue of security came up at the daily White House news conference. Spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is confident there are ""appropriate resources to conduct the election and that the Afghan process won't be thwarted."" CNN's Chris Lawrence and Tom Evans contributed to this report.","Taliban militants attack guesthouse in central Kabul killing up to five U.N. staff .

"(CNN) -- The comic debut of Superman has sold for an out-of-this-world price. The copy of Action Comics No. 1 from 1938, which features the first appearance of the ""Man of Steel"" was bought by an undisclosed buyer for a record $1.5 million Monday on the online auction site ComicConnect.com. ""This is the Holy Grail of Holy Grails,"" said Vincent Zurzolo, co-owner of the Web site. A copy of the same issue sold for $1 million in February, but this one fetched a higher price because it is in better condition. It was stored inside a movie magazine for the past 50 years, Zurzolo said. ""The book looks like it just came off the presses yesterday,"" said Zurzolo. ""The colors are extremely vivid, the whites behind the 'Action Comics' logo are snow white. It's just a stunning copy -- it almost looks brand new."" The sale of the Superman book marks the third time this year that a record was set for the sale of a comic book. The other copy of ""Action Comics"" No. 1 held onto its record for only three days before a comic book featuring Batman's debut sold for $75,000 more at an auction in Dallas, Texas. It's widely believed that there are 50 to 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 floating around, which makes it exceedingly rare. However, the copy sold Monday has received the highest rating to date from the Certified Guaranty Company, an independent comic grading company in Sarasota, Florida. The company inspects comic books for imperfections, ranging from yellowing to slight creases. J.C. Vaughn, the associate publisher of The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, an annual publication considered the authority on comic book pricing, said the Action Comic No. 1 book sold Monday is worth every penny. ""The older any comic book gets, obviously the more unlikely you'll find it with a high rating,"" said Vaughn. ""A book this old, featuring Superman's first appearance? I think this book warrants the price."" Back in 1938, there were 200,000 of these first editions printed and 130,000 sold, said Vaughn. The 70,000 other copies were destroyed. Zurzolo said it could be a while before another comic book sets a new mark, because only a few other comics have this type of value. ""You will see a lot of very high-priced comic books selling in the next few years,"" he said. ""But until these books hit the market again I don't think you'll see the same exact type of numbers in the near future."" ComicConnect wouldn't reveal the buyer of the $1.5 million Superman book. ""Our buyer, much like most of the superheroes out there, has a secret identity and would rather remain that way,"" Zurzolo said. However, he added that the customer has a tremendous passion for superhero comic books and is especially fond of Superman. ""Superman was the first superhero,"" said Zurzolo. ""Without Superman there would be no Batman, Spider Man, Wolverine, Wonder Woman -- they all came about because of the immense success of Action Comics and the first appearance of Superman."" Alex Rae, the back issue buyer for Midtown Comics, one of the nation's largest comic book dealers located in New York, said if he had his choice of any comic book in the world, it would be the one just purchased. ""It revolutionized the comic book industry,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Bernadette's father died from AIDS complications when she was a child. Her mother never even knew he had HIV until she and her daughter tested positive years later. Shocked and angry, Bernadette couldn't accept the news. She refused to take her medicine. Depressed and shut off from the world, Bernadette imagined she would soon die. Then, at the urging of her mother, she joined a Sunday support group for young people living with HIV. Over time, she became engaged in youth activities and opened her heart to the others. Today, she is a youth peer educator at Women's Equity in Access to Care and Treatment, where she shares her experiences with other young people living with HIV, encouraging them to stay in school, take their medicine and work for a better future. This is just one example of a brave story. And there are millions more: . The teenage girl who was orphaned and had to raise herself and her siblings; the young man who refused to be silenced by discrimination and disclosed his status to friends; or the young couple -- one HIV positive and the other not -- planning their future. These stories speak to the pain, loss and challenges that HIV and AIDS have put upon this generation, but also to the triumph of what's possible when we come together. We are part of a generation that has only known a world with HIV. The United Nations says that about 34 million people are living with HIV worldwide -- and 5 million of them are between the ages of 15 and 24. That age group accounts for an estimated 39% of new adult HIV infections globally; and nearly 65% of young people living with HIV are women. Most of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. Bernadette is one of those young people. Now 20, Bernadette has been a client at the WE-ACTx for Hope Clinic, Keep a Child Alive's partner in Kigali, Rwanda, since 2007. Cristina and I have had the honor of visiting our Keep a Child Alive programs in Africa -- and Cristina just returned from a visit with some of the young people that I met when they were just toddlers. Ten years later, these young people are living healthy, happy, hopeful lives. We've seen amazing progress in the past 10 years -- and though we still have a long way to go, more people are getting HIV treatment and fewer babies are being born with HIV. We're seeing the results of so many people's work to ""keep a child alive,"" and now, the first generation of children who received HIV treatment are entering adolescence and young adulthood. But for all of our progress, we are still failing this generation. In the United States, young gay men and young women and men of color are particularly vulnerable to HIV. In terms of rates of infection, vulnerability, impact and -- most important to us -- the enormous potential to turn this epidemic around, young people are at the center of the HIV epidemic. Despite this, most HIV treatment programs and policies are designed for children or adults, leaving young people caught in the middle of programs that fall short in meeting their special needs. The good news is that across the world, young people are uniting to demand a seat at the table. They are demanding attention from their communities, health facilities, schools, governments and leaders. At Keep a Child Alive, we believe in nurturing a strong, true and loud collective voice from our world's young people. We recently launched, 5MIL, a new initiative that seeks to address the needs of their generation as it relates to HIV. Over the next few months, we will roll out 5MIL: Hangout, a youth-led platform to connect young advocates living with HIV and affected by HIV from Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda and the United States. This grassroots, virtual dialogue is about fostering a safe space for young people to come together and talk openly about HIV, share challenges and solutions and connect directly with influential leaders. We are calling for action from all young people around the world living with and affected by HIV and AIDS and the global community to join this movement. Get loud! Talk, blog, tweet and text truths about HIV. By talking openly, we can take the power away from silence and fear and put it in the hands of knowledge, acceptance and love. Tap into the Y-potential: Young people are passionate -- let's harness their energy and willingness to think boldly and take risks. Ask young people what they think and what ideas they have to turn the tide of HIV for their generation, their community and themselves. Know your status: Get an HIV test and talk to young people about testing, prevention -- including using condoms and having good sexual health -- and treatment if they are positive. AIDS isn't over yet. And it won't be without including young people in the conversation. We believe in a world where young people living with HIV and its effects can lead a life without fear. You believe they can thrive and follow their dreams. I hope you will join us in our efforts to bring awareness and money to organizations such as Keep a Child Alive. Together, we are loud, proud, and strong! And please tune into live streaming of the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday in Central Park, New York. I'll be performing, as well as John Mayer, Kings of Leon, Stevie Wonder and Elvis Costello. It's organized by the Global Poverty Project. Opinion: Social entrepreneurs dare to change the world .

"(CNN) -- The Jonas Brothers canceled their planned concert tour because of ""a deep rift within the band,"" a representative said. The first of 19 shows had been scheduled for Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, on Friday, but the brothers pulled the plug, spokesman Jesse Derris said on Thursday. ""There is a deep rift within the band,"" Derris said. ""There was a big a disagreement over their music direction."" The national tour was to conclude in Seattle on November 6. Fans who already bought tickets can get refunds from the vendor who sold them, Derris said. People.com first reported that Nick, 21, Joe, 24, and Kevin, 25, were arguing over the weekend, leading to the cancellation. The brothers became household names through the Disney Channel ""Camp Rock"" movie series. They signed with Disney's Hollywood Records label in 2007. Their albums -- including solo projects -- sold 20 million units worldwide, according to their website. Nick and Joe released solo albums and pursued acting careers in recent years, while Kevin and his wife, Danielle, have starred in their own reality series, ""Married to Jonas,"" which is in its second season on E!. Kevin and Danielle, who married in 2009, announced in July that they are expecting their first child together, a girl. The trio came back together musically earlier this year, releasing singles ""Pom Poms"" and ""First Time."" Despite the canceled tour, more tracks are expected from their upcoming fifth studio album. There is no word on what the disagreement over their musical direction will mean for the planned album. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Band spokesman: ""There was a big a disagreement over their music direction""

"(CNN) -- A Nigerian immigrant's dream came true when President Barack Obama signed into law a rare private bill granting him permanent residency in the Unites States. Victor Chukwueke, who lives in Michigan on an expired visa, came to the United States 11 years ago to undergo treatment for massive face tumors. He graduated from a university in the state, and plans to attend an Ohio medical school that requires him to have permanent residency, also known as a green card. In a rare act, the United States Congress passed a private bill this month granting him permanent residency. Obama signed the bill Friday. Private bills -- which only apply to one person and mostly focus on immigration -- are rarely approved. His is the only one to pass in Congress in two years. ""I was overwhelmed with joy; it was nothing less than a miracle,"" the 26-year-old says. ""Only in this country can so many miraculous and wonderful things happen to someone like me."" Before coming to the United States at age 15, Chukwueke lived in the southeastern Nigeria town of Ovim. He suffers from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes massive life-threatening tumors on his face. Treated as an outcast because of his deformed face, he was depressed and humiliated, he says. His family abandoned him at an orphanage after taking him to the nation's best facilities for treatment. ""I went to a large teaching hospital in Nigeria and the doctor touched my face and said there was nothing they could do,"" he says. "" I cried and begged him to do something. I was so tired of the humiliation."" Nuns from the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy rescued him from the orphanage in 2001 and arranged for a Michigan doctor to perform surgery on him. He considers himself lucky to have developed the tumors. ""Without them, I would not have met the nun, left Nigeria, arrived in the U.S. and had the miracle to attend medical school,"" he says. He lives with the nuns in Oak Park, Michigan. They have cared for him since he came to the U.S., where he has undergone seven surgeries, including one that left him blind in the right eye. Despite the obstacles, he remains committed to getting an education. He finished his GED -- the equivalent of a high school education -- while undergoing treatment and enrolled at a community college. A benefactor helped him attend Wayne State University, where he graduated last year with a bachelor's in biochemistry and chemical biology. He had a 3.82 GPA and gave the university's commencement speech. ""Should I call myself a victim, or should I press forward to my dreams?"" he asked during the speech amid thunderous applause. Soon after his graduation, the University of Toledo in Ohio admitted him to medical school. The only hurdle: The program requires him to have permanent residency status. With Obama's signature, his wish has come true. ""My own personal struggles to receive treatment have motivated and encouraged me to pursue a medical career ... to alleviate the pain and suffering of others,"" he says. ""A medical career will allow me many gratifying years of making a difference in the health and lives of others."" Chukwueke's journey to get legalized has seen many strangers rally to his help. Inspired by his story, Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, sponsored the bill, S. 285. The measure passed the Senate in the summer and the House this week. Attorney Thomas K. Ragland took his case pro bono. ""Victor's story is remarkable,"" says Ragland, who is based in Washington D.C. ""Here is this kid who comes from Nigeria, he was taunted and teased for his diseases, and he comes to this country and excels, despite so many surgeries. It is a testament of not letting anything get in the way."" The number of illegal immigrants in the United States was estimated at 11.5 million last year. Following the signature, the State Department will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to Nigerians.","Victor Chukwueke's visa expires after he comes to the U.S. for treatment of face tumors .

"(CNN) -- The tragic killing of Trayvon Martin and the initial decision by the police not to arrest George Zimmerman for that killing have focused public attention on Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. According to police, Zimmerman claims self-defense, but many observers can't understand how a grown man with a gun can plausibly claim that he was forced to kill a teenager armed only with some candy. If that's the law of self-defense in Florida (and elsewhere), these observers argue, the law needs to change. The law of self-defense is at its core about reasonableness. If a person reasonably perceives a serious threat of harm, and uses reasonable force to meet that threat, the law justifies even deadly force, and it does so even if it turns out that the perceived threat was illusory. People have differing views of what's reasonable and, as a consequence, self-defense laws (which vary by jurisdiction) have always attempted to further define the concept. Until very recently, Florida's definition of reasonableness, as in many states, incorporated a longstanding principle, the ""duty to retreat."" This principle required that someone who found themselves in a violent confrontation had to try to defuse the situation and retreat ""to the wall"" before resorting to deadly force. In other words, deadly force was only permitted as a last resort. The basic idea was simple: If more people backed down, retreated or stepped aside, fewer people would be killed. The ""duty to retreat"" also made it easier for prosecutors to prove that a killing was not in self-defense. The facts that can be proven are often murky (particularly when of the two people who know what happened, one is the defendant and the other is dead) and prosecutors could often, by pointing to a defendant's failure to retreat, obtain a conviction even without establishing the precise facts. In American jurisdictions there has long been an exception to the duty to retreat called the ""Castle Doctrine."" As then-Judge (and later U.S. Supreme Court Justice) Benjamin Cardozo explained in 1914: ""It is not now and never has been the law that a man assailed in his own dwelling is bound to retreat. If assailed there, he may stand his ground and resist the attack. He is under no duty to take to the fields and the highways, a fugitive from his own home."" In recent times, ""stand your ground"" laws extended this concept in many states beyond the home to any place where a person might lawfully be found, such as a bar or a public sidewalk. Florida's version enacted in 2005 (over the objection of many in law enforcement) is one of the most far reaching. The law states that a person ""who is attacked"" anywhere he is lawfully present has ""no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm."" Importantly, a person cannot invoke this provision if he is ""engaged in unlawful activity"" or ""initially provokes the use of force against himself."" Finally, in Florida, once self-defense becomes an issue at trial, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense -- a heavy burden. This is the legal backdrop against which Florida's prosecuting authorities must assess all claims of self-defense, including Zimmerman's. In an ideal world, law enforcement would make this assessment by thoroughly investigating the case and, after determining the provable facts, comparing those facts to the law. Critical to this determination will be evidence reflecting: how the confrontation began and how the suspect acted after the confrontation (prosecutors often look for actions such as flight or a cover-up that indicate a ""consciousness of guilt""). Perhaps most critically, investigators will compare all the evidence (physical and otherwise) with the suspect's statement (if any) about what happened. If the investigation reveals sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Zimmerman was not acting in self-defense (as Florida law defines that concept), he can be prosecuted. If not, charges are unwarranted. Depending on the facts that ultimately emerge, the ""stand your ground"" law may ultimately control the legal outcome of the Trayvon Martin case. If, as a result, Florida's citizens and legislators (and those in other states) see that law in a new light, they can change the law, perhaps leading to fewer tragic outcomes in the future. For it may (as many suspect) be the case that Zimmerman was not forced to kill Trayvon Martin. But in a state like Florida with a ""stand your ground"" law, that is no longer the standard for determining whether someone acted lawfully in self-defense. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Bellin.","Jeffrey Bellin: Until recently, Florida's self-defense law included a ""duty to retreat""

"(CNN) -- It's getting harder to shock people with stats about income inequality. Americans know they live in a two-tier country -- one where the uber-super-ultra-rich are leaving the rest of us behind; where, as Michael Moore famously put it, 400 of the richest people control the same amount of wealth as 150 million others; where, as President Obama said in a speech on Wednesday, the ""average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40% since 2009, but the average American earns less than he or she did in 1999."" ""Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits,"" the president said in his prepared remarks, ""nearly all the income gains of the past ten years have continued to flow to the top 1%."" 1%, 2%, red percent, blue percent. At a certain point, these numbers bounce off our foreheads. That's why I found it particularly refreshing that Obama, however briefly, argued this week that America's growing income inequality is ""morally wrong."" The fairness of the widening rich-poor gap, or the lack thereof, has been discussed far less than the number soup. Yet it's a crucial question -- perhaps the central question -- for America to consider. The fairness gap is the basis for a wide range of policies, from the tax code to education; health care to the minimum wage. So is extreme inequality amoral? To think this through, I called up four smart people -- Nigel Warburton, a freelance philosopher and writer, and host of the (wonderful) Philosophy Bites podcast; Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute and author of ""Wealth and Justice""; Thomas Pogge, director of the Global Justice Program at Yale; and Kentaro Toyama, researcher at the University of California at Berkeley. Each offered a range of interesting and nuanced views. But to make this column as un-wonky as possible, I've broken down their arguments into a few, (hopefully) easy-to-chew-on talking points you can use to fight about inequality with your friends. Bring these up at your next dinner party and let me know how it goes. Inequality isn't a moral problem; opportunity is . In this school of thought, it doesn't matter if the mayor of New York City is worth $27 billion (he is) as long as everyone in the city has an equal chance to succeed. That's the view of Brooks, from the American Enterprise Institute. I asked him about that city, which is more unequal than any other metro in the U.S. ""The truth is there are a lot of really, really wealthy people there. Great! That's a morally neutral concept,"" he said. But not all of them have an equal opportunity at success, he said, in part because schools don't perform well in all neighborhoods. That's morally bankrupt. (Check out this wild map that shows the chances a kid at the bottom of the income ladder would have of climbing to the top. In Atlanta, where I live, a kid in the bottom fifth of income earners has only a 4% chance -- 4%! -- of making it into the top fifth of income earners.) Fix economic mobility, Brooks said, not inequality. And let the rich do their thing. Inequality turns us into 'Downton Abbey' This isn't just about income; it's about class-based psychology. Extreme income inequality, even if it's derived from a fair playing field, can lead to a society where the rich look down their noses at the poor and essentially force them into positions of servitude, a la ""Downton Abbey."" ""It undermines the social fabric,"" said Pogge, the Yale professor. He told me this idea comes from a University of Michigan philosopher, Elizabeth Anderson. ""It basically creates a multi-class society -- a society in which you have people who have to flatter and endear themselves and have to be servile. And other people dominate."" Wealth is rad; human suffering isn't . Imagine a society in which the poorest people are very solidly middle-class by today's standards. They have enough to eat; they have jobs that are stimulating and thought-provoking; they have comfortable lives and can afford to go to movies and all that. Meanwhile, some people are extraordinarily rich -- like way richer than Gates or Buffett. Is that fair? Is it moral? Yes, said Toyama, the UC Berkeley researcher. Eliminating suffering is what matters most. Beyond that, extreme wealth is an incentive for people to work harder. ""Morality, on some level, is the avoidance of suffering,"" he said, ""or at least the decrease of suffering. And where, in the United States, we have the financial wealth to be able to address everyone's direct suffering, the fact that we're not doing so is the basis for claiming that something is morally wrong."" Extreme inequality ruins democracy . It's no secret money rules politics in America. Team Obama spent $1.1 billion to win the 2012 presidential race. When inequality becomes extreme, it undermines democracy, as the late philosopher John Rawls and others have argued, because it creates unequal access to the political system and to positions of power. One person, one vote -- yeah. But one person with millions to spend has much more influence. ""What is problematic in the United States is the political system ... is one that is quite substantially dominated by those people that have money,"" said Pogge, the Yale professor. ""They can, in the American system, yield a substantial amount of influence on the legislation through lobbying and therefore expand their advantaged position."" Jesus wants us to be poor . In the Biblical tradition, there are parables and sayings that cast the rich in a negative light, implying it's wrong to hold too much wealth, especially if you're not using it to help less fortunate people. See Matthew 19:24: ""Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."" ""There's something immoral, from the Christian perspective, about being very rich,"" said Warburton, the author and podcaster. ""That's explicit."" (Warburton happens to be atheist, by the way.) The size of the rich-poor gap matters . Some inequality is acceptable to pretty much everyone these days. No one is arguing for a fully equal society. But the degree of inequality really does matter when you're trying to determine whether inequality is moral or amoral, said Pogge, the Yale professor. When extreme inequality sets in, that's when social and political problems follow. His best estimate for a fair distribution is the Palma Ratio, which measures how much income the top 10% earns compared to the bottom 40%. Ideally, those amounts would be equal, meaning the country would have a Palma Ratio of one. According to a calculation cited by the Danish Institute for International Studies, the United States has a 2010 Palma Ratio of 1.852, which is about the same as Burkina Faso but not as bad as China or South Africa. (In an earlier version of this column, I incorrectly estimated the U.S. Palma Ratio based on wealth instead of income. I should have let the experts handle that, and I regret the mistake). By Pogge's assessment, that means inequality here is too high. Negative consequences for our society will result. Inequality is bad if the poor don't benefit, too . I'll end this list back on John Rawls, the philosopher whose 1971 book, ""A Theory of Justice,"" is a must-read (or at least a must-become-familiar-with) for people interested in this topic. One of Rawls' theories is that inequality can be justified only when it benefits everyone in society, particularly those who are most poor and vulnerable. If Rawls were creating a society from scratch, he would design it so that, in his words, ""social and economic inequalities ... are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society."" If the rich making more will help the poor be better off, too, that's cool. If not, it's unfair, or amoral. For real-world reference, here's a quick look at CEO pay in the United States, from the AFL-CIO: The average S&P 500 CEO compensation in 2012, according to that labor group, was $12.3 million. A worker? $35,000. Do the poor benefit from that disparity? Does everyone? Anyone? I'll leave you to fight about that in the comments. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Obama: ""Growing inequality isn't just morally wrong; it's bad economics""

"(CNN) -- Sometimes a sign of the times is subtle. Let's talk about it: Second Life has long been a forum for self-help, now some rehab centers are setting up shop there. For clients of an alcohol rehab center in Atlanta, one appears in the form of an after-care option: they can meet their therapist for follow-up sessions in Second Life, the popular virtual world. The clients at Accelerated Recovery Centers, all addicted to alcohol, first complete an initial two to three weeks of intensive therapy at the center, undergoing training and meeting with psychologists, counselors, life coaches, medical professionals, nutritionists and personal trainers. Then they go home -- where temptation waits. To cope with that, over the next nine to 12 months they have sessions with their therapist over the phone, through a video-chat service like Oovoo.com, or in Second Life. In the latter, an avatar that the client controls meets with another that the therapist controls. The rehab center has been carefully replicated within Second Life, on a secure parcel of virtual real estate called Identity Island. The furniture, walls, and layout of the virtual rehab center look the same as in Atlanta. The therapist's face is mimicked on the avatars. Audio is used rather than text chat, so the therapist's voice comes from the avatar during sessions. There's also group therapy, with many avatars meeting at once. But the rehab center is not about technology -- it's about helping clients overcome alcohol addiction. (The center was started about three years ago; the Second Life option came last year.) Some clients decide against Second Life. They're not comfortable with computers, perhaps, or they don't like being represented by an avatar. But for many, the virtual world works. They have a sense of having ""been somewhere,"" notes David E. Stone, a licensed psychologist at the center and its chief technology officer. And they feel ""more comfortable meeting in a replica of the therapy room that they used in real life."" Many also tend to reveal more, or be more direct, in the virtual world -- a phenomenon called ""online disinhibition."" (You can see it in chat rooms too.) And different aspects of identity tend to emerge with different mediums, whether text, voice, video or avatar (or in-person), just as a group setting reveals different things than one-on-one. Avatar-based therapy raises some intriguing questions. For instance: Do clients identify with their avatars? ""Clients may possibly objectify or distance themselves from their avatar, which in some cases might attenuate the effects of the therapy,"" notes John Suler, a psychology professor at Rider University in New Jersey who has studied the topic. But in some cases an avatar might help, he notes. For instance developing an ""observing ego"" -- the ability to look at oneself objectively and rationally -- is critical to many kinds of psychotherapy. ""It's possible that interacting through an avatar might stimulate that observing ego,"" he says. The rehab center's use of the virtual world is, if anything, restrained. Of course not every problem can be addressed in Second Life, such as, Stone feels, psychotic disorders. Immersive worlds help cope with the real world . But many therapists believe virtual worlds can help clients deal with fears or addictions and experiment with new behaviors and means of expression. Avatars are not always involved. For instance a virtual world can be immersive, with earphones, wrap-around goggles, vibrating floors or chairs, and even smells, so users feel they're ""in"" the world rather than controlling an avatar moving through it. The former has more power to distract, to the point where in some experiments burn victims have felt reduced pain while immersed. Such setups, however, can get expensive, whereas Second Life is free or low cost, making it an easy way for therapists to experiment with virtual worlds. The U.S. military uses virtual reality to help Iraq War veterans cope with post-traumatic stress disorder. Added to the visual experience are smells and sounds -- like burning rubber and Arabic prayer -- to help trigger flashbacks so they can be dealt with gradually in a safe environment, with a therapist on hand. A California chain called the Virtual Reality Medical Center helps clients overcome a wide range of fears, including of flying, heights, public speaking, closed spaces and spiders. Virtually Better in Georgia has similar offerings. The list goes on, with variations seen around the developed world. But these are still early years, and much remains to be seen and tested when it comes to virtual worlds and psychotherapy. Stone and his team plan to share their findings on the use of Second Life at an American Academy of Psychotherapists event in November. A fair bit of self-help goes on in Second Life, without therapists. For instance some physically disabled users combat depression by flying, dancing and earning a living in the virtual world. Shy types gain real-world confidence in virtual parties. This sort of thing is likely to happen more often. Research firm Gartner estimates that 80 percent of Net users worldwide will be in non-gaming virtual worlds like Second Life by the end of 2011. Ironically, Internet addiction is also likely to rise -- meaning in some cases one malady could be swapped with another. Not all therapists will go virtual. Many insist on seeing cues like appearance, facial expressions and body language. Some set up shop in Second Life but require a real-world meeting first. Others accept PayPal and offer their services to any avatar or website visitor who happens along. Of course long-term success is rarely a sure thing in psychotherapy, whatever the approach. Back at the rehab center, therapists and clients are easing into virtual reality. Avatar-based therapy is just an option. In any case clients must return to the center at least once. The real center, that is, in Atlanta -- to meet with the real version of their therapist.","Some rehab centers using virtual worlds to complement therapy for addiction .

"(CNN) -- At first, the children's eyes light up with anticipation. Christmas comes early. Tanzanian students celebrate receiving Books for Africa textbooks. Then they stare in wonder. Some reach out and cradle the object as if it were treasure to be guarded. Others lift it up in triumph, singing and dancing in joy. The gift that inspires this kind of marvel in many African children is none other than a simple schoolbook. Books are so rare in many African countries that children celebrate receiving them as if it were Christmas morning, says Brad Mattson, a manager for Books for Africa, a nonprofit group that ships donated books to African countries. Mattson traveled last year to a remote Tanzanian village, where he saw children who were studying in mud-brick schools with no electricity or running water eagerly grab a shipment of donated textbooks. ""It was like my kid getting an Xbox,'' says Mattson. ""They protect them like gold."" Is there a moral obligation to feed poor children's minds as well as their bodies? Books for Africa's leaders think so. The group says it shipped 2.7 million books to 24 African countries last year to combat what it calls a ""book famine."" About 33 percent of school-age children in Africa have never set foot in a classroom, according to a U.N. study released this year. Among those who have, it's not uncommon for 10 students to share one textbook, Books for Africa officials say. A book offers impoverished African students some hope of a better life for themselves and their country, says Deb McDonald, Books for Africa's assistant director. ""Education is the great equalizer,"" McDonald says. ""When people get access to information, they're on more equal footing."" Students study in the dirt . Many African children don't even have access to a pencil, says Andrea Wall, who distributes textbooks for Books for Africa in the East African nation of Tanzania. Wall says she has seen students study in the dirt. She once watched Tanzanian elementary school students practice their lessons in the sand because pencils and paper are a luxury. Yet the students are eager to learn, she says. Many have never left their village or traveled in a car or even seen electrical appliances. ""They do not know anything different and most are grateful that their parents have enough money to send them to school instead of tending cows or gathering firewood and water,"" Wall says. Books are an expensive commodity in Tanzania. There are no bookshops in the East African nation and the only books available are printed on thin paper with weak binding. Wall is co-director for a nonprofit group called PEN Trust, which uses construction, education and nutrition to help lift Tanzanians out of poverty, she says. Once, however, she was a kindergarten teacher in Minnesota who had a classroom crammed with toys, puzzles and learning centers. She first visited Tanzania in 2001 with a church group, ""fell in love with it,"" and decided she had to return. She was later laid off as a teacher due to budget cuts and decided to return to Tanzania as a full-time volunteer in 2005. Now she's seen even the most rudimentary educational tool bring joy to Tanzanians. She once saw an American pastor visiting a Tanzanian village give a villager a simple gift. ""He gave one mother a brand new shiny yellow pencil and she jumped up and down thanking him and then just as fast broke it into three parts -- one for each of her children,"" Walls says. The low literacy rate in Africa is related to political instability as well as poverty, says McDonald. When civil war erupts, books become targets. Even newspapers and magazines are relatively scarce in countries like Tanzania, she says. ""One of the first things soldiers do is burn information,"" McDonald says. What types of books are needed . Shipping books to Africa isn't like packing together shipments of food or medical supplies, Books for Africa officials say. It involves sensitivity to Africa's history. The scars of colonialism, where Western nations used violence to occupy African nations and pillage their natural resources, shapes what types of books are sent to Africa. During colonialism, a bitter joke among Africans was that missionaries gave them the Bible but took their land. The joke reflected a belief among some Africans that Western nations used Eurocentric books to manipulate and build self-hatred among Africans. Books for Africa officials, though, say they refuse to send books that celebrate the superiority of Western ways. In fact, they only send books that African schools request. ""I don't like it when you go in and tell them what they need,"" McDonald says. ""I like them to tell us what they need."" The books that African nations typically request can be seen in a cavernous warehouse operated by Books for Africa in Atlanta, Georgia. At the warehouse, rock and R&B music booms over the speakers as volunteers sort through thousands of books and zoom through the floor in forklifts. Most of the books African countries requested were books for elementary and secondary schools. Textbooks -- geography, science and math -- are abundant. The books that aren't used are recycled into paper. Books for Africa officials estimate they save about 2 million books a year from landfills. Book companies and school systems often donate books in bulk to Books for Africa, including used books, overprints and previous years' editions. The group also depends on volunteers to sift through its books. One of them, D.J.

""We're standing in the grocery line and we're bombarded by tabloids, and we're bombarded by books and TV,"" she says. ""You're not bombarded by anything there,"" McDonald says.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United produced a five star showing to book its place in the knockout phase of the Champions League Wednesday. The English champion cruised to a 5-0 away win at Bayer Leverkusen -- despite missing a whole host of players including striker Robin van Persie. United, which has endured a difficult start to the season under new manager David Moyes, was held to a disappointing draw at Cardiff in the Premier League at the weekend. But it gave a gentle reminder of its European pedigree with a fine victory as it racked up the club's biggest away win in the Champions League. More goals . ""We could have scored more,"" Ryan Giggs told Sky Sports. ""But we can't be too greedy. To score five anywhere in Europe is a great result. ""Going into a game knowing a win puts us through is a carrot and the five goals and a clean sheet is a bonus. It was a pleasure."" Antonio Valencia gave United the lead midway through the first half before an own goal from Emir Spahic doubled the visiting team's advantage. Jonny Evans, Chris Smalling and Portugal winger Nani added further strikes after the interval. ""There were so many good performances,"" United manager Moyes told Sky Sports. ""To come to Germany and get a such a good result, Leverkusen are second in the Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich, it gives an idea of where our performance and result stood. ""[The performance] was what I was hoping to get more often, there have been signs we are getting better but also signs we have been wasteful as well."" Top spot . United still requires a point from its final fixture against Shakhtar Donestk to secure top spot in Group A. Shakhtar still boasts aspirations of claiming top spot after it defeated Real Sociedad 4-0 in Ukraine. But it will have to beat United at Old Trafford to win the group, while Leverkusen must beat Real and hope Shakhtar fail to win. The defeat was Leverkusen's first at home in 14 games since losing 2-1 to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga back in March. ""When you conceded five goals, there isn't much more to say,"" Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling told reporters. ""We should never have allowed them so many chances to shoot."" Real deal . Meanwhile, Real Madrid also qualified for the next stage following a 4-1 home win over Galatasaray. Deprived of its injured talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, Real's night threatened to unravel following the sending off of defender Sergio Ramos. But goals from Gareth Bale, Alvaro Arbeloa, Angel di Maria and Isco secured all three points. ""The team was very, very good in the second half,"" Arbeloa told Canal Plus. ""The coach was exactly right in the tactical changes he made and we were able to press them higher up the pitch."" Galatasaray can still make it through to the last-16 but it must defeat Juventus in its final group game. Juventus needs just a point to take second place after it saw off FC Copenhagen 3-1 thanks to a hat-trick from Arturo Vidal. Cavani class . Also through to the next stage is Paris Saint-Germain, which left it late to see off Olympiakos 2-1 in the French capital. Despite being reduced to 10 men when Marco Verratti was sent off, PSG prevailed thanks to goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani. Olympiakos must now beat Anderlecht on December 10 and hope that Benfica fails to claim maximum points against PSG if it is to progress. Benfica edged out Anderlecht 3-2 in Belgium with Rodrigo netting a 90th minute winner. Record run . Elsewhere, defending champion Bayern Munich set a new Champions League record after winning a 10th consecutive game. The German side defeated CSKA Moscow 3-1 in Russia to eclipse the previous record of nine straight wins by Barcelona, which recorded the feat in 2002-3. ""Getting 10 wins in a row is very hard and I am proud of my players, the club and everyone involved,"" Bayern manager Pep Guardiola told reporters. Arjen Robben fired Bayern ahead on 17 minutes before Mario Gotze netted a stylish second. Keisuke Honda pulled a goal back from the penalty spot just after the hour mark only for Thomas Muller to net Bayern's third. ""It is a fantastic achievement to win 10 consecutive games in Europe especially if you consider we also played Barcelona and then Borussia Dortmund on the way to the final (last season),"" Robben told reporters. ""We have said we don't play for records, we play to win titles. But we have a great team and I am proud to be part of it."" City slickers . In the group's other game, Manchester City eased to a 4-2 win over Czech side Viktoria Plzen. City, already through to the next stage, continued its goalscoring streak following the 6-0 Premier League win over Tottenham at the weekend. Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri, Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko were all on target.","Manchester United qualifies for second phase .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the country goes into the weekend with the government shut down and neither side talking, there seems to be little hope for breaking the impasse any time soon. And with the days ticking down toward the moment the country runs out of options to meet its debt obligations, the head-butting over funding the government might force Congress to try to work out a deal to get it running again and raise the debt ceiling at the same time. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King and Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley were asked about the state of play as we end a tumultuous week as well what next week might look like. Q: CNN and others reported that House Speaker John Boehner said to Republicans in private meetings that he will get something passed to avoid defaulting on the U.S. financial obligations, even if it takes putting something together that would attract Democrats. Did he blink? John King: His top aides are saying there's no dramatic shift here. But the speaker's meeting in small groups with rank-and-file lawmakers. John Boehner knows when he goes into a meeting like that it's going to leak out. What is he doing? He's sending an early signal that, ladies and gentlemen of the Republican caucus, 'we are not going to be part of defaulting.' His obituary is already going to read he was the leader of a bizarre three-ring circus on Capitol Hill. He doesn't want to say he was the speaker when the government for the first time defaulted. There's still a huge question of how you get there, though, because the speaker will continue to insist no raising the debt ceiling without getting something from the administration -- on spending cuts, on spending levels, on reforms in the most expensive government programs. And the president, of course, is on the record saying 'I won't negotiate.' You can reconcile those two positions by doing it in a couple of sequenced steps. It's an optimistic statement from the speaker that we won't default, but getting from ""A"" to the finish line is still complicated. READ MORE: House Republicans say shutdown likely to drag on . Q: Are we talking about a grand bargain again? It's hard to believe that could happen this time around -- things have gone from bad to worse in terms of relations between these two parties? King: Sometimes at the bleakest moment is when something can be pulled -- a rabbit you pull out of a hat, if you will. However, when you talk to people in both parties and top aides close to all of the people involved, from the White House to the Republicans and the Democrats on Capitol Hill, most just don't see an environment because of the distrust, because of the looming political calendar of 2014 for a big grand bargain that does Medicare, Social Security, tax reform, other entitlements, other spending cuts in the government. Is there a possibility of a smaller bargain that gets some of the things Republicans want in terms of savings in Medicare and Social Security, some other spending cuts? That is possible in these separate budget agreements. The question is can you get the government re-opened, raise the debt ceiling and then do those things? Will the Republicans trust the Democrats to do that? Or because of the suspicions, will you have the revolt? A lot of the fight has been about strategy and many people will say that's their frustration with Washington, they're more concerned about the political win rather than the ramifications and the ripple effect on the economy and the country. But the reality is it is about strategy. Q: Mitch McConnell's and Rand Paul's hot mic moment was instructive in showing the disconnect between what they are supposed to be doing and what they want to be doing. What does it mean to you to overhear this? Crowley: It certainly is a signal to the House. We had heard Rand Paul say publicly 'we're not going to be able to get rid of Obamacare.' But it's a great starting position. We have had, in particular in the Senate, a lot of Republican senators saying shutting down the government is a bad idea, it won't work for Republicans politically. This tells me that they are in a position that the Senate doesn't want to be in. It tells me that they are hearing privately and publicly from the president 'no negotiations,' which probably is more troublesome in terms of there really isn't anything going on. We kept thinking there was -- that maybe somewhere people were talking about a compromise and clearly that's not happening. So, what Republicans believe is that that particular stance -- we're not going to negotiate on anything -- is not going to survive the test of public will. So far, what we see is Republicans are taking the bulk of the blame. We'll see if that shifts. Q: Why is Boehner not bringing up this vote for a resolution? What do you believe is behind it? Is he not doing this because he's worried about losing face or his job? Why is there no vote? Crowley: I want to put something -- not particularly in this conversation -- but something we don't discuss all the time but that is there may not be the votes there. I talked to Nancy Pelosi a couple weeks ago, and I said, 'Do you like the CR? I mean, if the House put -- if Boehner -- put just a straight old temporary spending resolution, do you like it?' She said, 'No. There's too many cuts in it.' There are Democrats who don't like the CR, even plain without anything attached to it. There are Republicans that are always going to vote against it because it doesn't do anything about Obamacare, should a clean CR come up. There may not be the votes at the moment. Having said that, certainly the main impetus is that his caucus is not with him at this point. I would also suggest it's not just the 35 or 40 in the tea party caucus. They have been pretty good at holding together. This is more than 40 congressmen at this point. Now we're beginning to see some fractures and maybe a dozen House Republicans looking for a way out, but they've held force with not just the tea party, although it does seem tea party driven, obviously. Q: On the debt ceiling, what are you hearing -- on the one hand, Rep. Steve King says it's not that big a deal, that it's false demagoguery. On the other, Boehner says he won't let the country default on its obligations. Do they get that this is a big deal? Crowley: I'm hearing nobody wants to find out. The debt ceiling really has been, from economists to a number of folks on Capitol Hill, they just look at it and say, this really would be disaster on the U.S. economy, on the world economy. Even those who say, 'I don't know because I'm not an economist,' say, 'I don't want to find out.' What we're hearing from Boehner I think certainly substantiates all of that. This is not something that he's going to allow to happen, even if it means he has to rely on Democratic votes. That's something for the Republican speaker of the House to say: ""Even if I have to get Democrats to do it, we're not going to allow the debt ceiling not to go up.""","Boehner ""leak"" was a signal to his caucus that he's not going to be the one to put country into default .
Atmosphere in Washington is too toxic to hope for a ""grand bargain""
It's possible that Boehner might not get enough Democratic votes even if he drops GOP demands ."
"(CNN) -- When Christopher Moore isn't jumping rope, shooting baskets or playing the board game Chutes and Ladders, the 8-year-old can often be found at home using his ninja fighting skills, protecting the world from would-be enemies. Roger Walland and daughters Rachel, 5, and Jennifer, 2, of Plano, Texas, play with Nintendo's popular Wii system. ""I'm trying to save the other people from being hurt,"" he said of his Avatar video game adventures. ""And I be beating him bad,"" he added with a coy smile and a nod toward his 15-year-old brother. The Moore household, in Birmingham, Alabama, enjoys a good blend of at-home entertainment, something the foursome is doing more and more during these precarious financial times, explains the boys' mother, Lisa Moore. They grill, play outdoors or whip out traditional games that may be decades old, and although she doesn't plop down at the video console with them, the boys and her husband often duke it out virtually. ""They're always in competition,"" she said with a laugh. ""It keeps them busy. It keeps them occupied."" iReport.com: Show us how you're entertaining yourself on the cheap . Numbers show that at-home entertainment is doing better than ever, flying in the financial face of so many industries that are struggling in this recession. Netflix, a DVD rental service, has had a record quarter and now boasts 10 million subscribers. With no late fees, a selection of 100,000 titles (outdoing typical video stores by about 97,000), free postage, nine price plans and now the ability to stream 12,000 movies, Netflix's offerings are resonating loudly with concerned consumers, spokesman Steve Swasey says.  Watch report on booming video game sales » . ""Netflix has always provided unprecedented convenience and value ... [and] has been a growth company for the past 10 years,"" Swasey explained. ""There's something for everybody. ... Right now we think [the surge in success] is because the value argument is stronger. People aren't buying DVDs, and they're not going out as much."" Bang for the buck and ""affordable escapism"" is what people want, agrees Scott Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com. That shows, too, in the gaming industry, which has become a $22 billion business, the Entertainment Software Association reported this year. A movie, concert or sporting event gives several hours of entertainment. But a video game, even if it seems pricey at $60, can offer 40 hours of fun, Steinberg says, and can amount to a ""much sounder investment."" And many games can be downloaded cheaply or for free online, from the comfort of one's home. ""It's all about instant gratification,"" he said, adding that iTunes and streaming video services are two other examples of booming businesses. ""You can sit there in your boxers with Cheetos on your chest and have a grand old time."" The gaming experience, too, has changed with the years. Five years ago, online gaming was considered a solitary activity, says David Williams, who heads up the Nickelodeon Kids and Family Games Group. And although games can still be played alone, the social component is burgeoning. ""Over a third of families will play games together online,"" Williams said. They're staying home more, and they're ""using games to connect with one another."" Addicting Games, a Nickelodeon free online brand that caters to teens and tweens, counted 40 million visits from 11 million individuals last month alone, Williams says. Another Nickelodeon brand, Shockwave, has also grown. The free offerings have boomed, but he said the subscription business, too, has continued to grow ""more than 20 percent year after year."" When it comes to the games children and adolescents play, many parents such as Lisa Moore may choose to sit it out. But Christina Vercelletto, a senior editor at Parenting magazine, says that engaging in the games with them can do a family good. ""It can be an opportunity to bond with your kids,"" she said. If parents express interest, kids ""will probably be thrilled. And you'll get a little window into what has them so excited."" Plus, by playing the games, parents can determine how comfortable they are with what their kids are doing. For those who want to get the opinions of others, she points out that the Entertainment Software Rating Board provides feedback and that parents are always learning from one another on, for instance, discussion boards. Beyond traditional entertainment, people watching their wallets can watch out for themselves while staying home. Take, for instance, the practice of yoga. Rodney Yee, a nationally recognized instructor, says video and DVD sales are up. Also thriving is the Gaiam Yoga Club, his and his wife's first of its kind online 12-week yoga practice, which costs $5 a week. ""I really believe that this is an opportunity for all of us to re-evaluate the way we live in the world,"" Yee said. ""Even though they seem like hard times, they're reflective times. We can look at our lives and question what we value by what we're doing.""","At-home entertainment businesses soar as other industries struggle in recession .

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers in northern India are scrambling to save tens of thousands of people left stranded by devastating floods that have killed as many as 150 people in the region. One government official described the flooding as a ""Himalayan tsunami."" Triggered by unusually early and heavy monsoon rains, the floods have swept away buildings, roads and vehicles in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand, which borders Nepal and China. The neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh has also been hit. ""Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy,"" said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who carried out an aerial survey of the affected areas in Uttarakhand on Wednesday. With bad weather hampering rescue efforts and some areas still under water, officials are struggling to gauge the scale of the disaster. ""Very heavy casualties are feared and I cannot give the exact number without a proper survey,"" said Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, according to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN. He described the severe flooding as a ""Himalayan tsunami."" Singh said Wednesday that estimates put the number of people killed in the floods at 102, but added that ""it is feared that loss of lives could eventually be much higher."" A local official in Uttarakhand, Om Prakash, said that the death toll in the state had reached 150, but cautioned that he wasn't able to give an exact estimate since some villages were still inundated, CNN-IBN reported Thursday. More than 60,000 people remain stranded, the network said. Flooding hits holy site . With Hindu shrines set amid its stunning scenery, Uttarakhand is often referred to as ""the Land of Gods."" At the heart of the recent devastation is the town of Kedarnath, the home of a deeply revered Hindu temple that attracts many pilgrims. Images from the area have shown the centuries-old holy town, which sits in a deep valley, swamped with mud and rocks. Rescue workers reached the town Wednesday and evacuated hundreds of people to safer areas, CNN-IBN reported, but thousands more remain stuck there. The temple is intact, but shops and other buildings surrounding it have been severely damaged, it said. ""The maximum damage has been in Kedarnath and its vicinity,"" Singh said. Extreme weather . The worst of the heavy rain came in the past few days in a region of India where the monsoon doesn't usually arrive for another month, according to Pedram Javaheri, a CNN International meteorologist. ""Some areas have seen more than twice their average monthly rainfall totals,"" he said. It's ""the fastest India's ever seen the onset of the monsoon season."" The conditions have now improved somewhat, Javaheri said, predicting that the rain ""should be scattered in nature for the next couple of days at least."" The weather has also brought chaos further south, in the Indian capital, New Delhi, where the Yamuna River has reached its highest level since 2010, according to CNN-IBN. Flood waters have flowed out into parts of Delhi, inundating streets, shops and homes. Some water from the river has spilled out onto the city's Outer Ring Road, potentially disrupting traffic, CNN-IBN reported Thursday. Authorities have relocated more than 5,000 people from affected areas, the network said, citing Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit as saying the situation is under control. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 60,000 people are estimated to be stranded .

"London (CNN) -- Six months ago, a winning ticket was bought for the Euromillions lottery draw in or near the English town of Stevenage, north of London.

And whoever holds the golden ticket has only until 11 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) Wednesday to claim their prize, or the whole sum will go to charity. The search for the unknown winner has gripped the centuries-old town of 84,000, as well as the smaller neighboring town of Hitchin. Euromillions, which said the ticket was bought in the Stevenage and Hitchin area, has made repeated appeals to try to find the missing ticket-holder. A billboard campaign has even been run in a central square in Hitchin, an old market town. Whoever it was matched all five numbers, 5, 11, 22, 34 and 40, and the Lucky Star numbers -- 9 and 11 -- in the Friday, June 8, draw.

"(AOL Autos) -- Big Al, the used car dealer with that small lot down on the corner, may be your mother's cousin, but that doesn't mean you'll get the best used car deal in town from him. He sells all brands of cars, has no visible shop or mechanical staff, and he is the only one that stands behind the quality of his cars ... until the rear tires clear his driveway. The numbers of items inspected on the cars range from 100 to 300. A better used car? If shopping for regular used cars, whether it be at a dealer or private party, just isn't cutting it for you, there may be a better solution -- choosing to buy from a new-car dealer who also operates a Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) used car program. These programs are operated jointly by the manufacturer and the dealer, and practically guarantee the quality, condition, and future long life of the car, truck, crossover, or SUV you're interest in. It's in the dealer's and the manufacturer's best interest to find the best used cars available for these programs, so most of the cars sold through them are clean, undamaged cars coming off of two- or three-year leases or out of rental-car fleet service. Restrictions on which vehicles are allowed in the program, such as age and mileage, vary. Some cars in CPO programs could be as young as six months and have only 6000 miles on them, as in BMW's program, and others could be as much as five years old and have a maximum of 80,000 miles on the odometer, in the case of Volvo. Inspection and warranty . Although the content and extent of each brand's certified pre-owned program varies, one of the constants is the complete vehicle inspection offered by every program. Though the number of items -- or points -- inspected on the vehicle varies from 100 to 300, as a consumer you should feel comfortable knowing that everything important on the car was inspected by the dealer, under the guidelines of the manufacturer, and the worn or bad parts were replaced, if necessary, before the vehicle was put into the program. Aside from the inspections, the length and coverage of the certified-vehicle warranty also varies from program to program, and the buyer should make absolutely sure that the original manufacturer is offering the warranty, as opposed to a third-party or extended-warranty company. Depending on a vehicle's age, condition and mileage, it may in fact be cheaper to buy an uncertified used car from a dealer and then purchase a separate extended warranty for the vehicle. The CPO bumper-to-bumper warranties can be a bit complicated, so be sure to do your homework and become familiar with all the ins-and-outs. Some of the warranties start when the car is sold to you, and some warranties start from the date of the original sale or in-service date of the vehicle, but are extended up to six years or 100,000 miles. Certified used car buyers should be sure to read and understand every paragraph of the vehicle and powertrain warranties offered with the vehicle so there are no surprises later. Some warranties also require the buyer to pay a predetermined deductible amount for each repair; some don't (BMW, for instance, charges a flat fee of $50 for any warranty repair). Some CPO warranties are even transferable to the next owner after you, which may be an attraction when it comes time to sell it. In most cases, the original long-term powertrain and corrosion penetration warranty will still apply. You also get perks . Beyond the usual vehicle inspection thoroughness and the length of the certified-vehicle warranty, the various manufacturers and dealers offer a large menu of extras on their certified pre-owned vehicles as enticements to a deal. What if you buy a CPO vehicle, load your kids into it, and it stops running halfway to grandma's house? Most programs offer 24/7 roadside assistance for such situations on a CPO vehicle (Hyundai, for instance, offers this feature for a full ten years and unlimited mileage from the original in-service date). Some offer temporary vehicle loans while your vehicle is being repaired. Others go even further than that, offering trip interruption insurance that will pay you up to $1,500 toward your living expenses while your CPO vehicle is being repaired and/or partial reimbursement for a taxi, shuttle or rental car during the repair period. What if you sign on the bottom line, take the vehicle home, and nobody likes it? Some companies offer a no-strings return policy after three days or 150 miles of home-based test driving (Mercedes-Benz offers seven days and 500 miles). Others offer special financing rates on CPO vehicles to make the deal as attractive as possible. Another potential deal-sealer is a free Carfax report on the car before you buy it, a feature offered by Lexus. A few CPO programs include the Carfax Buyback Guarantee as well. Still other goodies could include free lock-out service, free car washes on each warranty visit, and preferential treatment in the service queue. Infiniti offers free tire changing, lock-out, jump start, an oil filter change, and emergency fuel delivery in addition to other benefits. Others offer free trip routing and maps. Jaguar, for instance, sweetens its deals with British Airways companion tickets, free membership in the Hertz #1 Club, free magazines, and a Jaguar club liaison. It's all there, in the fine print. Is it worth it? Due to the costs involved in the inspection, certification and warranties process, a certified used car will almost always be more expensive than a normal used car or one from a private party out of the classifieds. How much more? From two to eight percent higher, according to Kelley Blue Book research. Premium-brand vehicles will be priced even higher because there are more items to warranty on a luxury car than there are on a basic Chevrolet or Ford. But, look at it this way: You can get a thoroughly inspected and guaranteed, slightly used two-to-five-year-old vehicle for far less money than you'd have to pay for it new. Add to that attractive interest rates, with lots of extra perks in the deal, including the security of a longer warranty. Can Big Al match that? We don't think so.

"Editor's Note: Jennifer Brea is a writer and a graduate student studying political science at Harvard University. Her writing has appeared in the Guardian, the Africa Report, and Ebony Magazine. Jennifer Brea says Barack Obama represents the increasing diversity of America. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When I was a small child, even before I had the right vocabulary, I could tell that my parents were different. When I was with my mother, strangers would gush over me. When I was with my father, I felt a distance. For reasons deeper than I could explain, it was safer with Mom; I was more special when, as far as the outside world could see, I belonged to her. I later learned this was because people were reacting to the fact that my mother was white and my father black. Like a growing number of Americans, like our new president, I grew up straddling this country's racial divisions. Barack Obama, America's first black president, is also our country's first biracial president -- no secret, but a fact that, especially in the euphoria of his inauguration, is often downplayed. The experience of multiracial Americans is as varied and complex as the races and heritages that make up our unique mixes, but when I came of age in the '80s and '90s, it was a world of stark and often strange choices. Race was a set of mutually exclusive, ill-fitting boxes. We were forced to choose just one, to pick sides. Often, the world chose for us. It was a question not of our culture, or how we self-identified, or even the objective makeup of our DNA, but how we looked. Tiger Woods, when he rose to fame as America's first black golf star, caused an uproar after he told reporters he was ""Cablinasian,"" a nod to his Caucasian, Black, Native American and Asian ancestry. (He is one quarter African-American.) It never occurred to Fuzzy Zoeller, who, after the 1997 Masters Championship, made an off-color joke about Woods ordering fried chicken and collard greens for the next year's Champions Dinner, that he might prefer Pad Thai. The story of my own family was similarly complex. My Anglo-Irish mother is as white as they come. But my father is Haitian, the descendant of West African slaves and French plantation owners, as well as Chinese and Egyptian. And still, growing up, I was asked to choose between one of the two boxes available to me. ""Are you black or are you white?"" It took until 2000 before the U.S. Census allowed respondents to check off more than one racial category, a formal recognition that there are no longer two Americas, one black, one white, but dozens, maybe hundreds, of overlapping Americas. The most recent census predictions hold that by 2042, whites will no longer be the majority. Americans who identify as biracial or multiracial are less than 2 percent of the population, but their demographic is growing at about 3 percent each year, more than 10 times the rate of the white population. New immigration from Africa and the Caribbean is challenging old notions of what it means to be African-American. As the number of transracial adoptions and interracial marriages increase, the old lines, while far from vanished, are blurring. At the beginning of his campaign, Obama's exotic heritage was a liability. We had no idea what to do with him because we couldn't place him in any of the familiar boxes. There were charges lobbed against him that he was, on the one hand, not black enough for black America, and, on the other, too black for the  white American mainstream. By telling his story of being raised by white grandparents in Hawaii, their love for him and his grandmother's utterance of racial stereotypes, and his adult quest to connect to his father's Kenyan roots, Obama has changed the entire dialogue about race. He has managed to accomplish something truly rare: to both carry the mantle of African-Americans' struggle for justice and to transcend it. He is as much the fulfillment of more than 300 years of struggle as he is a symbol of the future: A president who embodies the changing landscape of our imperfect union. Tuesday, he boldly declared it. In his inaugural address, Obama said, ""...our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve...."" When Obama took the stage at Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois, on election night, with his family, it was the first time in my 26 years of living I felt like America really belonged to people like me. If you were to ask me, at that moment, if I was African-American, even though I have blue eyes and fair skin, even though my grandparents came to this country from Haiti, with their own language, their own concepts of race, my answer to you would be a resounding ""Yes!"" Without the struggle of brave African-Americans who came before me, my grandparents would not have had the same opportunity to pursue the American dream. We would not be allowed to choose freely whom we love, and I might not even exist. And yet if you were to ask me, in that same moment, if I were black, or biracial, or a woman of Haitian, Chinese, Egyptian, English and Irish descent, my answer would have been the same. Before we become a ""post-racial"" America, we have to become one that is truly multiracial, comfortable with the fact that more and more Americans no longer wear their identities on their skins. That you might not be able to tell from just looking at a woman if she is Dominican or Brazilian, or the daughter of a Belgian and a Congolese. She might consider herself many things at the same time, without planting a flag or declaring an allegiance. Obama can help lead us into that new era, toward a more sophisticated conversation about culture and race. He should be celebrated as our first African-American president. He should also be allowed to be Kenyan and Kansan, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Luo -- all the legacies that have made him the man he is today.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich maintained their unbeaten record in the Bundesliga with a hard-fought 3-2 win over Hertha Berlin at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Pep Guardiola's side endured a desperate start to the match, going behind to a goal from Adrian Ramos in the fourth minute before seeing both Tim Kroos and Arjen Robben go off injured with only a quarter of the match played. The two Mario's -- Mandzukic and Gotze -- came on in their place and immediately set about changing the course of the match. Croatian striker Mandzukic equalized in the 29th minute heading home a Franck RIbery's free-kick before adding a second headed goal six minutes into the second half. Gotze's first Bundesliga goal for Bayern doubled their lead in the 54th minute only for Anis Ben-Hatira to pull one back for Hertha four minutes later thus ensuring a tense final quarter of the match. Bayern held on and maintain a one-point advantage at the top of the table over Borussia Dortmund who recorded a 3-1 win away to Ruhr valley rivals Schalke. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute with Nuri Sahin doubling the lead six minutes into the second half. Max Meyer halved Schalke's deficit in the 63rd minute before Jakub Blaszczykowski sealed three points for Jurgen Klopp's side with a 74th minute strike. ""We got off to a dream start in this really intense match,"" Klopp said. ""A brilliant second goal and wonderful counter-attack for the third adds up to us deserving this victory."" Third-place Bayer Leverkusen kept pace with Dortmund after beating Augsburg 2-1 while Wolfsburg moved up to fifth and level on 15 points with Hertha following a 3-0 win against Werder Bremen.

"(CNN) -- For Leanne Mai-ly Hilgart, being vegan isn't only about what she eats and chooses to wear each day. Avoiding meat and dairy in her diet and animal-derived products in her closet is just part of the equation for the 30-year-old designer, businesswoman and animal lover. As founder of fashion label Vaute Couture, her dedication to creating animal-free coats, sweaters and other cold-weather gear has earned her a global cult following among animal rights activists and eco-conscious fashionistas. Her activism began when she was 10 years old with an elementary school social studies project in suburban Chicago on factory farming and the fur industry. She became vegan at 17 and continued her activism in high school with a campaign for alternatives to animal dissection in science class that, with the help of national group Animalearn, eventually became Illinois law. This week, she took her philosophy to New York Fashion Week, where she debuted her first ready-to-wear line in a solo show Wednesday, less than five years since starting Vaute Couture in 2008. Stella McCartney, Charlotte Ronson and other big-name designers have created fur-free collections in previous seasons. But Vaute Couture is the first independent fashion house to show during New York Fashion Week with animal- and cruelty-free built into its brand DNA, from its ultrasuede elbow patches to Thinsulate-lined winter jackets. The line's aesthetic goes beyond faux fur and leather, using organic, recycled and high-tech fabrics in an effort to redefine traditional outerwear staples. Before a packed showroom in New York's Chelsea gallery district, models, accessorized with rescue dogs available for adoption, showed off Vaute's line of coats, dresses and pants of waxed canvas, velvet and moleskin (a heavy-napped cotton twill fabric, despite its name), among other materials. Even the shoes, by Love is Mighty and Brave GentleMan, were vegan. Though Vaute's line comes at a time when consumers seem more willing than ever to pay a premium for products from companies or businesses whose values align with theirs, industry insiders say the company is swimming against the tide in a season expected to bring new twists on leather and fur. But Hilgart, an activist at heart, is undaunted. She believes that there are people like her who care about where their clothes come from and how they're made. It's Vaute's role to make those options more accessible, she said. ""I want to reach women who love style, love color, love fashion, and maybe they used to care about where their clothes came from but at some point they told themselves that it was naive to care,"" Hilgart said. ""I think it's important that people see that you can care, you can interact with the world in the way you want and it's not naive. But to do that, you need options."" Vaute's values infused all aspects of the show, from the animal-free makeup and hair products used on the models to the vegan petit fours and cheesecakes inscribed with a V from Vegan Treats bakery of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Leashed rescue dogs were led around the audience by volunteers from the Humane Society of New York and Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue. The list of sponsors included some of the biggest names in animal rights activism: the Humane Society of the United States, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Farm Sanctuary and Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. By sponsoring fashion events and designers like Hilgart, these groups get a chance to share their mission with buyers, fashion editors and industry insiders, key influencers of consumer trends. ""It's a great audience for us to get our message in front of,"" said Michelle McDonald, outreach manager of the Humane Society's fur-free campaign, which sponsored Jay McCarroll's runway show in 2006 and Charlotte Ronson in 2008. The Humane Society tracks progress through a growing list of designers and companies that have adopted fur-free policies. But Hilgart has taken the commitment to ""cruelty-free"" fashion a step further with Vaute, McDonald said. ""She's not only trying to do her part for fur-bearing animals but for animals all over,"" McDonald said. ""We're very thankful she's out there and attracting so much attention from the fashion industry."" The genesis of the company came from Hilgart's own desire for a stylish winter coat that wasn't ""accidentally vegan"" because it used substitutes for wool, fur or leather to drive down costs. She was a DePaul MBA candidate on break working as a Ford fashion model in Hong Kong when she decided that entrepreneurship was the best way for her to make a difference. ""I realized that if I could create a business where the process in itself was actually creating positive change, that would be my activism,"" she said in a phone interview last week from a noisy New York coffee shop in between final preparations for her show. ""I started with outerwear because I found being cold was an excuse to wear animal products,"" she said. ""I wanted to figure out where I would be needed to make a contribution to the movement so people would no longer need to use products and materials made from animals."" Whether consumers are ready to give up fur, leather and wool is another story, even if it's in favor of equally stylish and warm alternatives. Hilgart knows there is a market for animal-free fashion among people like her, vegan or not, who take conscious consumerism to an active level. Many of those people attended Wednesday's show and were thrilled by what they saw, regarding the Sailor Moon-inspired collection as a validation of their beliefs. ""Compared to even just a couple of years ago, there are now so many cruelty-free alternatives to products that we used to think required the bloodshed of animals -- everything from shoes to cosmetics to luxury fabrics,"" Jasmin Singer, executive director of Our Hen House, a nonprofit animal advocacy organization in New York, said after the show. ""As a society, we're evolving away from commodifying animals, because, finally, it is becoming clear that it's not only cruel, it's unnecessary. There are accessible, affordable, sustainable and attractive alternatives that are ethically sourced and cost no lives. Why not choose them?"" People want to do the right thing, she says, citing growing excitement around organic food, fair labor practices, and even faux fur and leather as evidence. But some see the interest in fake animal material in fashion as simply the trickle down effect from more of the real thing appearing on runways. Even if interest in animal-free fashion might be greater than ever, in the same way that more people are willing to go vegan or pay extra for locally made products, trend forecasters say there's a greater interest in looks incorporating fur and leather, which will be reflected on the runway this season. Part of it is a continuation of the seasonless fashion trend that began showing up unexpectedly in spring and summer collections, said Jaclyn Jones, womenswear editor of style forecaster WGSN. But most of it has to do with the luxurious look of leather and fur, plain and simple, Jones said. ""There's a point of view from many people in the fashion industry that having real leather or fur pieces adds a kind of elevated conception,"" she said. ""Everyone is always trying to look like their outfit costs more or have more worth or more value to it, especially during economic hardships, people want to make sure they're putting money into something that will last."" Hilgart understands that perspective, which is why it has taken her this long to come up with looks that she hopes will make the fashion world and consumers take notice, she said. Creating garments of high-tech materials to convey the indulgent look of high fashion took months of research, especially for someone with no formal training in fashion, she said. With coats and skirts starting at $200, Vaute Couture's price tags are also typical New York Fashion Week, at least on the low end of the scale. Hilgart said the prices reflect the quality of materials and the cost of paying workers a living wage to produce most of the garments in Brooklyn, where she lives. (The line's knits come from Maine.) ""I knew I had to design something that would be innovational for the entire industry. Not using animal fibers was an opportunity to look past what was just good enough to make something truly superior,"" she said. But even attendees of Wednesday's show who were receptive to the concept acknowledged that it's an uphill battle to change an industry or consumer behavior. Simply making animal-free clothing available is a big step in the right direction, especially if it's hip and stylish, said Dakota Kim, a freelance fashion writer who attended the show so she could write about it on her blog, Fashtronaut. ""I think that (animal-free clothes) really came to the forefront with Stella McCartney and ever since then it's been a big deal. It's more mainstream and the clothes are just so young,"" Kim said. Fur coats and leather pants are easy enough to cut out of your wardrobe, she said. But everything else? ""It's hard to cut all that out."" Follow Emanuella Grinberg on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Two of Turkey's main political parties are pushing for a constitutional amendment to lift bans on headscarves at public universities, a move that has caused concern among Turkey's secular population. The lifting of the ban on headscarves has caused concern among Turkey's secular population. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initiated the move, saying it would create equality in Turkey's higher education. The constitutional commission will discuss the proposal -- submitted by the AKP and MHP parties -- in the coming days before sending it to the floor for a vote. If approved, it would need President Abdullah Gul's approval, which is expected. Under the proposal, veils, burqas or chaddors -- all of which cover a woman's face -- would not be allowed. Bans on headcoverings were imposed in the early 1980s by Turkey's universities because they were seen as political symbols and conflicted with Turkey's secular governing system. The proposal to change Turkey's constitution sent chills through Turkey's secular population. Women's groups went to parliament Tuesday to voice their rejection. ""This is a direct threat to the republic and its foundations,"" said Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main secular party, CHP. Another CHP lawmaker said she fears that if the proposal is enacted, parents will feel pressure to have their daughters wear headscarves, even in elementary school. Mustafa Akaydin, head of Turkey's Higher Education Commission, is against the proposal. He said that allowing headscarves would be a rejection of Turkey's secular system of government. ""It is an attempt to create a counterrevolution,"" Akaydin said. ""It will be a breaking point."" He said a majority of female high school students at one school were wearing headscarves during last weekend's entry exams -- a rarity in Turkish schools. The Higher Education Commission will meet Friday in Ankara to discuss the proposed changes. E-mail to a friend .","Turkey's ruling party agrees to lift ban on head scarves in universities .

"(CNN) -- Quest Means Business begins a new chapter in New York Monday -- just as the U.S. economy also enters a new phase. Five years since Lehman Brothers collapsed, America is a different place. Back then, in 2008, investors endured ""Shocktober"" and the Dow made a record points loss, down 778 at the close in one day. Economic growth went into reverse, and by the end of that year jobs were disappearing at the rate of 700,000 every month. READ MORE: Lehman bankruptcy fees hit $2.2 billion . Now, the markets keep on hitting record highs, to the point where it's almost routine. Month by month, the economy is slowly gaining jobs. The vital signs appear to be stronger; the patient's illness is in remission. And the Federal Reserve is about to start withdrawing the treatment. Quantitative easing was first used as shock therapy in 2008, and investors are still attached to the money drip at the rate of $85 billion a month. Many analysts expect Ben Bernanke to start cutting down the flow in the coming days. But as he ""tapers"" the treatment, another great tide of fortune is rising -- that of American oil. Domestic crude production has been increasing since 2008, reversing a decline which began in 1986. Now, given the right conditions, the U.S. could even become a net oil exporter, according to the U.S. Energy Administration. Five years ago, that would have seemed an impossible dream. And it is all because of the controversial new technique of fracking. CNN EXPLAINS: What is fracking? Across the country, fracking is re-making boom towns, where income is high and jobs are plentiful. On next week's Quest Means Business, some of those working in this new oil industry describe it as a ""wonderful revolution"" and ""American capitalism at its best."" But as Lehman Brothers proved, American capitalism is not always kind. The industry is building on fractured or ""fracked"" ground, and what goes boom can surely go bust too. Richard Quest traveled to Midland, Texas, where he met some of the new generation of oilmen extracting crude from solid rock. State Governor Rick Perry told him that the success of shale oil and gas is a product of free spirit and innovation, raising the U.S. economy out of its miasma. And that it is here to stay. Hard knocks, seismic shocks and intense pressure may have made the U.S. economy hurt; these days a similar process is also helping to make it strong. At least for now.","Quest Means Business is relaunching, as U.S. economy also enters a new phase .

"(CNN) -- Where do you go to feel a sense of gratitude, serenity or peace in your life? While those feelings can come from a simple walk around the block or a moment with a good friend, some places inspire a sense of thankfulness by their very existence. As the nation gathers to celebrate Thanksgiving, some gratitude gurus tell us how they focus on thankfulness in their daily lives -- and they share the awe-inspiring spots that give them that sense of grace. Heartbreaking loss inspires a new life . When author and illustrator Grace Lin's first husband died of cancer after a long illness, she found herself filled with gratitude for the time they had spent together and thankfulness for being alive. Her gratitude for his life and hers made her want to write a book about gratitude. And when she traveled to Hong Kong for a speaking engagement, the folk tales she heard and the beauty she saw further inspired her to write ""Where the Mountain Meets the Moon."" The children's book is about a poor girl who over time realizes she has everything she needs to be happy. Her favorite spots include the mountains of Kowloon, a neighborhood in Hong Kong that means ""Nine Dragons."" As the legends tell it, the Song Dynasty's Emperor Bing named the area after its eight tallest mountains. And the emperor was the ninth ""dragon"" protecting the region. Hearing that story from her travel companion, ""I thought that was really neat, and it sparked my first idea of putting these folk tales into the story"" that became the book, she said. Her latest book, ""Starry River of the Sky,"" focuses on peace and was also inspired by her visit to Hong Kong. It came upon her when she took the Ngong Ping cable car trip to see the Big Buddha at Po Lin Monastery. ""It was a misty day, and I remember riding into it and seeing the huge Buddha in the mist, almost floating. It gave me such a sense of awe."" Now remarried in Massachusetts with a new baby, she has even more reasons to be grateful, she says. God's painting across the sky . When Lysa TerKeurst gets stressed about her crazy schedule packed with work, writing and the needs of her five children, she admits it's easy to get sucked into anxiety. If she can realize what she's doing, her first step is to be honest about her anxiety. ""I love God and I serve God, but I don't put on any plastic facade to say I have it figured out,"" says TerKeurst, president of Proverbs 31 Ministries, a Christian ministry for women. ""I don't have it figured out."" ""I make myself stop and start listing things for which I am thankful,"" says TerKeurst, whose latest book is ""Unglued: Making Wise Choices in the Midst of our Emotions."" ""That's the best anti-anxiety remedy."" It can be as simple as appreciating the nature around her North Carolina home, or Camp-of-the-Woods, a Christian camp in New York's Adirondacks where her family leaves all electronics behind. ""When I watch a sunset, it's like God hand painted the sky that night,"" she says. ""There will never be another one like it again."" To dig even deeper into gratitude, Terkeurst has traveled to the Dream Center in Los Angeles to volunteer on Skid Row. ""Every single day they're doing some kind of mission work out in the community, and they will make a way for you to come out to serve,"" she says. ""You can do things as a family with kids, married or single. It's an amazing place where miraculous things happen."" Not at the top of the food chain . Even though she was born and raised in Chicago, author Laura Munson has lived with her family in northwest Montana near Glacier National Park for 20 years. The area inspires Munson, whose memoir focused on her taking responsibility for her own happiness. ""This sacred part of the world steers my life, worldview, writing, mothering, everything,"" says Munson, author of ""This Is Not the Story You Think It Is."" It may have to do with the fact that grizzly bears and mountain lions sometimes outrank humans on the food chain in Montana, she says. And her daily life can require skill with backhoes, chain saws and snowplows. ""My life is very, very quiet and for the most part, unwitnessed,"" she says. ""I can wander in open spaces for miles here in the Flathead Valley, and not see another soul. I am grateful for Montana and its rugged wilderness. It has taught me about the rugged wilderness that is me."" A meditation teacher's discoveries in Virginia . Meditation teacher Pat Coffey lives about 10 minutes from Shenandoah National Park in rural Virginia where he finds peace and gratitude simply by looking at the mountains from his home or taking a daily walk in nature. He loves hiking the different trails at Shenandoah and finding the waterfalls tucked away in the park. The founder of the Insight Meditation Community of Charlottesville, co-founder of the Meditation Teacher Training Institute and co-founder of the Blue Ridge Prison Project, Coffey does a traditional Buddhist meditation every day for about an hour, but he says you don't need any training to meditate in nature. ""Part of my healthy regimen is to get outside every day and feel what nature has to offer,"" Coffey says. ""Nature is a pretty calming presence. Stand around a bunch of trees, and you'll feel they're just exuding calm. It's a nature meditation that you don't need any practice to do."" Restoration in Anne Lamott's living room . Those without a travel budget can still escape to find that sense of gratitude, says author Anne Lamott. As in her latest book, ""Help, Thanks, Wow: The Three Essential Prayers,"" Lamott focuses much of her work and life on gratitude and that ever-elusive search for serenity. When she feels frayed and depleted, she creates a space on her living room couch she calls the ""cruise ship."" ""This form of travel mainly requires intention to seek serenity, peace and union, with self, with the now, with the divine,"" she says. Choose your cruise ship drinks and snacks: ""You need a beautiful festive drink. I make cranberry spritzers, with a slice of lime. So gorgeous -- the cranberry red and the lime -- and you get to use your best glasses."" Grabbable foods are important so there's no need to cook. Her choices include guacamole, corn chips, a perfect cheese, strawberries, Tootsie Pops, Hershey's Kisses and cashews. Choose your sacred texts: For Lamott, ""this might be Mary Oliver and Rumi poems, a daily Bible study, a great novel and the latest issue of People magazine."" Her version of yoga: ""prone yoga,"" where she lies around as much as possible. ""Plus I have a small skylight above my couch, so I can see sky and birds without the inconvenience of wind and other people."" Her intention is ""to stop fighting to get more done, to figure out more, achieve more, impress more, etc. It is the intention to seek union with something bigger than us -- with the ocean, which in the living room is really just the carpet; or with God, or God's people, and in the living room, God's big motley dogs.""

"(CNN) -- One of the most-anticipated new shows of the fall season, ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" is now also the highest-rated drama debut in almost four years. The ABC program's Tuesday premiere was watched by 11.9 million viewers, and earned a 4.6 rating in the target adult demographic. That sizable turnout isn't really surprising, given the feverish excitement that has surrounded the show since ABC announced its interest in a ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" pilot last summer. Co-creator Joss Whedon, whose career has veered into blockbuster territory with the 2012 film ""Avengers,"" took out time from leading the ""Avengers"" sequel, ""Age of Ultron,"" to helm ""S.H.I.E.L.D.'s"" pilot episode. Those who watch TV for a living have been more or less satisfied, but a few fans walked away from ABC's 8 p.m. hour disappointed. 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.': Can 'Avengers' magic make the jump to TV? ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" is built around Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson, who was thought to have died in ""The Avengers."" His recovery is one of the storylines that were teased during the pilot, which sees him lead the S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) team. The idea is that S.H.I.E.L.D. is filled with highly skilled and talented agents whose job it is to look into the ""strange and the unknown"" happenings, such as the stuff that went down in ""The Avengers'"" climactic Battle of New York. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are tasked with ""protecting the ordinary from the extraordinary"" in this post-""Battle of NY"" world. It sounds like it could be the setup for yet another Marvel movie, but Whedon and his team, which includes Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, have scaled down this superhero universe to fit onto the small screen. The result, at least judging from the pilot, is that ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" is, well --""okay,"" said HitFix's Alan Sepinwall in a review. ""Quippy in that pleasingly distinctive Joss Whedon way, with a few intriguing ideas about life in a superhero world, but with a cheap look and mostly bland supporting characters. ... All told, it's a much more promising start to things than the first episode of (Whedon's) 'Dollhouse.'"" But in the aftermath of ""'Man of Steel,' Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, and the interlocking Marvel Universe movies, (which) are so overwhelmingly immense and glitzy ... a show like this can't help but look and feel anemic,"" said New York Magazine's Matt Zoller Seitz. ""But hey, it's TV. ... The show embraces its relative smallness, building much of the action around knowing banter and the occasional close-quarters fistfight."" USA Today's Robert Bianco called Tuesday's pilot a ""very promising start,"" adding that ""anyone familiar with Whedon's TV work will be happy to see some of his best traits on display: the sideways humor that surprises while staying true to plot and character; the efforts to ground the fantasy in real-world emotion; the belief that events in past episodes (and movies) must have repercussions in the present."" With ""Whedonesque touches evident throughout,"" the show ""looks ready to hew a solid middle path between 'The Avengers' and 'Buffy,'"" critiques The Atlantic. ""It will never have the scale and budget and cast of the former, and it's awfully hard to envision it equaling the emotional intimacy of the latter. But if it can weave together the strengths of each -- the breadth and mythology and fan interest of the Marvel Universe on the one hand; the storytelling and character-development possibilities of serial television on the other -- it could prove to be something truly special."" Some of those 11.9 million viewers might not be as patient to see how ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" will grow. CNN.com commenters have been emphatically frustrated, calling the premiere boring and predictable. ""I really like Joss Whedon's work. I could see 'Firefly' over and over again and the movie 'Serenity' is great,"" said TampaMel. ""I saw 'S.H.I.E.L.D.' last night. I HATED IT. Will give it one more chance. If it is as bad next week, I am done. So disappointed."" Commenter Blue meanie thought the premiere ""felt pedestrian and a bit phony. Seen that and done that before; nothing special or extraordinary, and nothing 'marvelous' about it. ... Take one part 'Gossip Girl,' one part 'Alias,' one part 'Heroes,' mix it up and that's what you got. ...The Whedon-loving geeks will love this and swallow it up, but it's a pass for me."" Maybe ""meanie"" is on to something. Commenter KWDragon encouraged other viewers to ""hate all you want, but I really liked it. I thought it had some good Whedon-esque hallmarks, while keeping in line with the Marvel mythology. Maybe all the 'cool kids' are gonna publicly diss this because it's the thing to do, but I thought it was great. I will gladly fan squee over this show.""","ABC premiered anticipated series ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- A witness sources have described as Aaron Hernandez's ""muscle man"" says he was with the ex-New England Patriot the night of a 2012 Boston double homicide that police say may be linked to Hernandez, said a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. The witness, Alexander Bradley, has filed a civil lawsuit accusing Hernandez of shooting him in the face during an argument after they left a Florida strip club in February. Bradley lost sight in one eye because of the incident, according to the lawsuit. In what could be a crucial account for the prosecution, Bradley is telling investigators that he was at Boston's Cure nightclub -- with Hernandez -- on July 12, 2012, before Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, were fatally shot in their car, the law enforcement source said. Bradley and Hernandez were also captured on the nightclub's security camera, the source said. Bradley has testified before a grand jury in Boston after being arrested last week because he failed to show up for a court proceeding about a grand jury subpoena. A Boston grand jury has been hearing evidence allegedly linking Hernandez to the double homicide, sources have told CNN. Among the evidence is a .35 caliber handgun sources describe as the murder weapon in the double homicide. In addition, a silver SUV driven by Hernandez was discovered covered with dust in his uncle's garage, law enforcement sources say. Law enforcement sources say the SUV is believed to be linked to the deaths. Hernandez's lawyers have not commented about the investigation. The SUV was found as investigators searched the uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut, in connection with another shooting death, that of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez is charged with Lloyd's murder and has pleaded not guilty. He appeared in court Wednesday for a pretrial hearing in that case. Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd's June 17 execution-style shooting. Authorities have said that Hernandez, Wallace, and a third man, Carlos Ortiz, picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before his death. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people. Lloyd was not among them.","Source: A witness says he was with Aaron Hernandez the night of Boston double homicide .

I don't need health insurance -- I get it from my employer -- but I wanted to see how easy (or difficult) it is for the millions of Americans who do need insurance and want to shop on the new exchanges set up by Obamacare. For about a week, I couldn't even create a login and password, the necessary first step for shopping. Then finally I could, but when I tried to log in, I received error messages; sometimes I even saw the dreaded twirly thing that just went 'round and 'round. When I tried to make a new account, that didn't work either. I called the Healthcare.gov 1-800-number for help, and the representatives said the site was very busy. They suggested I try at off-peak hours, such as early in the morning or late at night. Following their advice, I made attempts at 7 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. Still no luck. Apparently those hours weren't off-peak enough, so on Saturday night I kissed my husband and daughters good night and set my alarm for 3 a.m. for a date with Healthcare.gov. But in the wee hours of Sunday morning, I was to meet with only more disappointment. ""The system is down at the moment,"" read the message on the screen. ""We're currently making system improvements. Please try again later."" I tried to go back to sleep but couldn't. I've covered health care reform for 25 years, first as a print reporter in Washington and then for CNN. I interviewed Sen. Claude Pepper about catastrophic coverage in the late 1980s, reported on Hillary Clinton's health care plan in the 1990s and have followed every twist and turn of the health care reform debate since 2009. Over the years I've watched countless people suffer because they couldn't get insurance. In my Empowered Patient column I've tried to help the uninsured muddle through by explaining how to negotiate hospital fees or get help paying for prescription drugs, for example. But I knew my words were Band-Aids -- flimsy, torn Band-Aids without much sticky stuff, at best. These people needed insurance, plain and simple. It's been a roller-coaster ride for them as health care reform passed in 2010 and was then challenged in the Supreme Court. In the weeks before that decision, Matt McManus, a dad in California, cried in an interview with me, worried out of his mind about what would happen if the court overturned Obamacare and his young daughter, who has a rare and devastating illness, lost her insurance. McManus cried tears of joy the day the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. Millions like him were relieved that health insurance would finally be a sure thing, not something they had to yearn for or worry over. Success on day 14 of Obamacare site . October 1 was supposed to be the big day -- the day they could finally buy a policy without worrying about denials for pre-existing conditions or sky-high premiums that only millionaires could afford. But when the big day rolled around, after years of waiting, for many their hopes were dashed as they couldn't enroll on the site. Their frustration practically jumps off the pages of the government's Healthcare.gov Facebook page, where they've lodged their complaints. The Obama administration ascribes the trouble to ""glitches"" due to high traffic on the site. The president compared it to a glitch with Apple's recently launched iOS 7. But Apple's glitch was fixed quickly and, even more importantly, was never a big deal in the first place -- the operating system was functional even with the glitch. Healthcare.gov's glitches, on the other hand, are so overwhelming that Ezra Klein of The Washington Post's Wonkblog has deemed it a ""failure,"" at least so far. ""Not 'troubled.' Not 'glitchy.' A failure,"" Klein wrote. 'Cumbersome' system still has 'glitches' There is, however, a light at the end of the tunnel. The government continues to work on the site, and Monday morning, I finally tasted some victory. Three times, I tried to log in and failed. Twice I tried to create new accounts but couldn't. The third time, however, I was successful. I managed to log in and proceed with an application. I shouldn't have had to create a new account, of course, and the site is still spotty -- I couldn't log back in Monday afternoon, and then I could log in Tuesday -- but at least it's a start. We've been hearing from others, too, that the site seems to be getting better. This snafu is not completely without precedent either. In 2005, the launch of the Medicare Part D's website was considerably delayed and riddled with glitches. They fixed the problems though, and the program is now generally considered a success. What we don't know is how long it will take to fix the major problems with Healthcare.gov. People who want insurance by January 1 need to sign up by December 15. Will the site be fully functioning by then? I'll be going back to Healthcare.gov every day to see how it's doing. I hope to get no more error messages, no advice to try again later, and goodness knows, no twirly things. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Elizabeth Cohen.","Healthcare.gov users have been plagued by glitches and error messages .

"(CNN) -- Nike co-founder Phil Knight stunned backers of the Oregon Health & Science University's cancer institute by announcing he and his wife would put up half of a billion-dollar push for cancer research. The $500 million gift from Phil and Penny Knight is contingent on the Portland university's ability to raise $500 million from other donors over the next two years. Knight made the announcement at a Friday night gala for 400 top supporters of the university's Knight Cancer Institute, which the couple previously had backed with $100 million in 2008, said Dr. Joseph Robertson, president of the university. ""This was probably the biggest surprise of my professional life,"" Robertson said. He said university leaders were already at work Saturday planning a national fund-raising campaign to match the Knights' gift.

"(CNN) -- A Florida university has stopped all band performances amid an investigation into the death of a student over the weekend that authorities say is linked to hazing. Robert Champion, a 26-year-old drum major with Florida A&M University's marching band, became ill and died Saturday night after a game, the Orange County, Florida, Sheriff's Office said. Investigators have found that hazing was involved in the incident, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday. The cause of death is inconclusive, however, and the medical examiner says more tests are required, Demings added. ""Any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third degree felony,"" he said. ""Anyone who participates in such events can be criminally charged."" FAMU President James Ammons announced Tuesday he is immediately suspending ""any and all performances and engagements for bands and other ensembles under the auspices of the Music Department, including the Marching 100."" The suspension will stay in place during the investigations of Champion's death, Ammons said, and it will not be lifted until he authorizes it. Ammons vowed to convene a task force ""to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100."" ""The purpose of this review is not to establish culpability of individual band members in this particular case, but rather to determine whether there are patterns of behavior by the band -- or members of it -- that should be addressed at the institutional level.,"" he said. At a news conference, Ammons was asked whether there were previous instances of possible hazing in the band this semester. ""There were allegations that were turned over to the authorities and those investigations are ongoing at this time,"" he responded. Asked whether it is accurate that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing, he said, ""That is true."" CNN's calls to the university for further information were not immediately returned. In his statement, Ammons warned students: ""There will be no retaliation against anyone who cooperates with the investigation, but there will be serious consequences for anyone who tries to impede it."" The school's anti-hazing policy states that any students or groups found to be responsible for hazing can face penalties ranging from fines to expulsion. After a game Saturday, the band returned to its hotel, where ""the victim reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe,"" the sheriff's office said in a release. ""Friends of the victim called 911 and administered CPR. The victim was transported to Doctor Phillips Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased."" ""The investigation indicates that hazing was involved in the events that occurred prior to the 911 call for assistance,"" Demings said Tuesday. Band director Dr. Julian White met with band members early Sunday to inform them of the death, the school said. Grief counseling was made available. A music major from Atlanta, Champion was one of six drum majors for the 375-member Marching 100 band, the school said. A memorial service was scheduled for Tuesday evening. ""We are in shock,"" White said in a written statement. ""He was a very fine drum major who was of excellent character and very trustworthy. I had not told him yet, but he was slated to be the head drum major next year."" FAMU takes pride in the Marching 100. The band has been credited for ""not less than 30 innovative techniques which have become standard operating procedures for many high school and collegiate marching band programs throughout the nation,"" according to its official website. The band dates back to 1892. The Marching 100's motto lays out ""qualities to live by,"" including ""highest quality of character"" and ""dedication to service."" In 2009, the band represented Florida in the parade for President Barack Obama's inauguration.","NEW: The band took part in President Obama's inauguration parade .

"(CNN) -- The reactions to Ariel Castro's death have ranged from tears to calling him a coward to demands for an investigation. But the three women who suffered in his control for about decade remained silent. Michelle Knight, Georgina DeJesus and Amanda Berry have not said a word about Castro's death. The man who snatched them off the street, chained them in his house and raped them repeatedly, was found hanged in an Ohio prison Tuesday. While there were strong opinions about Castro from many, a spokeswoman said Wednesday the three women would not make a statement. Maria Castro-Montes, Castro's cousin, said she cried when she heard the news and immediately thought of the victims. Would they be glad or angry about Castro's death? ""I just hope these victims can move past this now. I know they wanted him to live out a life sentence, but really, was he suffering behind bars?"" She said. ""I mean, getting meals, sleeping in a nice, warm, soft bed. You know, those girls didn't even have that luxury when they were being held captive in his home. They were being raped. They were being tortured. They were being beaten."" Castro, 52, was found hanged with a bedsheet Tuesday night, Coroner Dr. Jan Gorniak said. He was being held at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient. Prison medical staff tried to revive him but failed. Castro was taken to The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 10:52 p.m. The Cuyahoga County prosecutor had tough words in the wake of Castro's death. ""These degenerate molesters are cowards,"" Timothy J. McGinty said. ""... This man couldn't take, for even a month, a small portion of what he had dished out for more than a decade."" Attorney questions the suicide . Castro was not a part of the general prison population, officials said. ""He was housed in protective custody which means he was in a cell by himself and rounds are required every 30 minutes at staggered intervals,"" JoEllen Smith of the corrections department said in a statement. ""A thorough review of this incident is under way,"" she added. At least two investigations will be done, according to another corrections department statement. The prison director commissioned a review team, to be made up of legal, medical, mental health, security and operational professionals not directly involved in the incident, to analyze Castro's death. 'Hope for everyone,' ex-captive says before house demolished . But Castro attorney, Craig Weintraub, said more precautions against a possible suicide should have been taken. Castro's attorneys had requested permission for an independent forensic psychologist to evaluate their client, but were denied by officials, he said. If Castro was believed to be suicidal, he should have been under stricter protection, he said. Some will see his death as ""a happy ending to this story, and a quick ending and justifiable,"" Weintraub said. ""But we're in a civilized society and no one should really be celebrating this."" No place in the world . In handing down a sentence last month, Judge Michael Russo told the kidnapper there was no place in the world for his brand of criminal. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. The charges stem from his kidnapping, rape and assault of Knight, abducted in 2002; DeJesus, abducted in 2004; and Berry; abducted in 2003. Castro is the father of Berry's 6-year-old daughter. Castro's victims resilient after years of abuse . All three women kept diaries with Castro's permission, providing many of the details of their abuse. ""I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day,"" Knight, 32, said, as she addressed her abductor head-on during his sentencing. ""I will live on. You will die a little every day.""

"(CNN) -- Frowned upon in business meetings and scorned by bosses, the common doodle has long been condemned as the offspring of the slovenly and the cynical...Until now. Oddly enough, doodling has even been the subject of academic research. In 2009, Jackie Andrade, psychology professor at the University of Plymouth conducted a study to find out whether drawing hinders or improves attention to a primary task. Forty participants were tested and the results concluded that doodling aids concentration by reducing an individual's capacity to daydream whether in the workplace or the classroom. The doodlers in the study retained about 29% more information than non-doodlers. So CNN spoke to author and doodling evangelist Sunni Brown about how sketching at work can make you more productive and whether we're seeing the dawn of a doodling revolution. CNN: When did you first make your doodling discovery? Sunni Brown: I've been going into working environments for several years now to teach visual thinking and how to solve business problems through a combination of images, words and thought experiments. What I noticed was a complete lack of competency in all working cultures -- except for design, engineering and some creative consulting firms --in visual language. Because like so many adults today, I, too, was raised in a culture that placed virtually no value on visual language but eventually I learned the importance of developing my own, and now I'm trying to help people to improve their visual literacy and articulation. Read more: Organize your mind to organize your life . CNN: Why should doodling be important to us? Sunni Brown: People have been doodling for over 30,000 years from cavemen and women to cultures that developed pictographic languages. Simple visual language has always offered a way to share and pass on information and history. In today's business world, I refer to Microsoft founder Bill Gates, author and professor Clayten Christensen, and Frank Gehry, architect and creator of the Guggenheim Museum, as examples of prolific doodlers who use doodling to think and to solve problems. Read more: Noreena Hertz: Don't get stuck in your own success . CNN: How can doodling be of use in the workplace? Sunni Brown: My definition of doodling is to make spontaneous marks with your mind and your body in order to help yourself think. So if you look at it through that lens, what it does for people is a variety of things. Some of those benefits include increased creativity, because you're liberating your mind from traditional, linear and linguistic thinking and moving into a more organic thinking space, heightened information processing, heightened information retention and the ability to view content from a variety of different angles. Read more: Where is self-control in the brain? CNN: Can doodling actually help someone's concentration levels? Sunni Brown: By physically drawing shapes, images and letters, we are inviting our minds to slow down and to focus on that experience. Doodling absolutely influences and aids concentration as well as elevating information retention, since it allows people to bring what's happening right now into a more saturated and sensory experience. CNN: Could doodling work for a younger generation, who may struggle to concentrate? Sunni Brown: In the digital age, concentration is a rare commodity. We are constantly having to keep up with vast amounts of content from various platforms and by doodling people can associate that information with a visual aid. It also encourages insight that you wouldn't otherwise have. When we are problem solving, we usually have mature ways of thinking about a problem and when people switch into doodling-mode they find themselves looking at that problem from a different angle. Read more: What we learn from doodles . CNN: How can doodling help us to be successful? Sunni Brown: There's a number of ways that doodlers can deploy sketching and drawing to be successful. One way is to maintain focus on what is happening. People doodling are harnessing energy that would otherwise just dissipate, which makes it possible for them to stay present with whatever is happening and relieve boredom. Another way is to allow access to different insights. By doodling, you're connecting neurological pathways with otherwise disassociated pathways in the brain, making spontaneous marks with your body to help your mind access insights. Read more: Brain controls brain in new demonstration . CNN: Can doodling help solve problems in the workplace? Sunni Brown: People use doodling to think through a problem. These can be called ""infodoodles,"" using a combination of drawings, shapes and letters to formulate and display an idea. Apple founder Steve Jobs is a great example of this. He used whiteboards and physical movement to illustrate his concepts, according to people he worked with. I would call him a ""kinesthetic doodler."" He was a person who seemed to think better while making spontaneous actions with his body. Read more: 'Power naps' may boost right-brain activity . CNN: Is the business world opening up to this? Sunni Brown: That is my fervent prayer, but leadership and management need to drive it and they need to cultivate organizational cultures that recognize its value and apply it in a way that makes sense for that business context. Most of us have preconceived ideas about doodling. There's a lot to overcome. I have seen working cultures that get it and its use is a no-brainer for them, and there are areas where people are embracing it whole-heartedly. In my view, people are far more open to it than they ever were but there's still a long road ahead before it's fully understood and applied.","Sunni Brown: Doodles are an ancient human art form .
Doodling is a way to visualize ideas and learn more quickly, says Brown .
Studies show those who doodle retain more of the information they are taught ."
"(CNN) -- Travel back in time with me to 1988: Guns N' Roses was blasting onto the music scene, Dustin Hoffman turned in an award-winning performance in Rain Man, and Nike coined the now-famous tag line, ""Just Do It."" But the year also brought a cultural touchstone with much deeper significance: the first World AIDS Day. The importance of such a day -- to be held annually on December 1st -- could not be understated, particularly at a time when the disease was still widely misunderstood, and a diagnosis often meant a death sentence. Twenty-five years on, it is difficult to imagine a world without World AIDS Day (or without AIDS, for that matter). But in the quarter century since the first World AIDS Day, much has changedâ€”so much so, in fact, that leaders have begun to call for ""the beginning of the end of AIDS,"" a global tipping point when the number of people newly infected with HIV is surpassed by the number of people newly offered treatment. A new study released by The ONE Campaign this week demonstrates just how far we've come, and suggests that if current rates of progress continue, the world will reach ""the beginning of the end of AIDS"" as early as 2015. Reaching this milestone would have been unimaginable just a few years ago, and is testament to the immense global effort and impressive new science that has emerged, particularly in the last decade. That acceleration has also been fueled by the simple fact that AIDS treatment now works better, and costs far less. In 1988, the only drug available to treat HIV/AIDS was AZT; it was not hugely effective, and it cost as much as a car. Today, for the price of an iPhone -- less than a dollar a day -- combination antiretroviral treatment allows HIV-positive individuals to not only stay alive, but live long and productive lives. The progress we've made also means that the language we use to describe the AIDS pandemic needs a refresh. In particular, ONE's report stresses that it's time to retire the phrase ""AIDS in Africa."" Of course, this doesn't mean the disease has disappeared from the continent, but it does mean that African countries have made widely divergent progress, and that a one-size-fits-all approach no longer makes sense. In fact, 16 African countries have already achieved the beginning of the end of AIDS. Countries like Ghana, Zambia, and Malawi are leading the way, deftly combining their own domestic health financing and planning with donor aid to achieve real impact. Political leadership has also been important in elevating HIV/AIDS as a priority issue on the national agenda, supported (and sometimes pushed) by dynamic civil society organizations on the ground. It's important that we celebrate all of this progress, and honor those who have worked so hard to make it happen. But the work is far from over, and in many ways, the AIDS fight today is struggling precisely because of its own success. Because it is no longer perceived as an emergency, but rather a chronic and manageable disease, the fight has lost some of its political momentum and funding has not grown to match the global need. UNAIDS estimates that the funding needed to fight AIDS is still at least $3-5 billion short each year. With a few exceptions, donor funding for AIDS has stalled. Compounding this problem, only six African governments are meeting their commitments to spend 15% of their national budgets on health. These trends must be reversed -- and quickly -- in order to accelerate progress. Insufficient money is not the only thing holding back the global AIDS response. Although treatment programs have grown massively -- they now reach nearly 10 million people around the world -- too many people are still being left behind. In the coming years, the world must do a better job at adapting treatment and prevention programs to reach those most at-risk, including LGBT populations, drug users, and sex workers. Doing so will, in some cases, require a sea-change in how these populations are treated. On a political level, leaders can do more to ensure that the HIV/AIDS responses in their countries are more equitable and free of stigma, as the first lady of Zambia, Christine Kaseba-Saba, recently did in a statement rejecting homophobia. Equally important, donors must make sure that their resources are appropriately targeting these at-risk groups and tailored to match the unique nature of local and national epidemics. Each World AIDS Day forces the world into a moment of reflection and accountability. On this 25th anniversary, we have much progress to celebrate, but we cannot allow complacency to set in before we're even halfway home. As we close in on a global tipping point and look to defeat AIDS within our lifetimes, we must pick up the pace. We have the tools to defeat the epidemic, but we need reinvigorated political will and new resources from the public and private sectors. The message this year should be: Let's work harder, together, to make the beginning of the end of AIDS a reality. Or, to borrow from Nike's 1988 ad: ""Just do it."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Erin Hohlfelder.","25 years on from the first World AIDS Day, much progress has been made in fight against AIDS .

"(CNN) -- The Pakistan Taliban have voted to elect Asmatullah Shaheen, who is on Pakistan's most wanted list, as their interim head, according to an official for the group. The move comes after former chief Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Friday. The group, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, will not be making an announcement on a new permanent leader for several more days, according to Azam Tariq, a member of the Pakistan Taliban's Shura Council, their centralized decision-making body.. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to Islamabad was summoned to Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Saturday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry did not explain why the envoy was summoned. A U.S. State Department official confirmed the meeting to CNN but would not disclose details about it. The State Department official would not discuss U.S. operations in Pakistan but pointed to the Pakistan Taliban's 2009 attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan and claims of responsibility for a failed attempt to bomb Times Square in New York. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and is not being named by CNN. Afghan President criticizes U.S. drone strike that killed Pakistani Taliban leader . Pakistan: Peace talks will go ahead . Pakistani Information Minister Pervez Rasheed insisted that Mehsud's death would not delay proposed peace talks between the government and the Pakistan Taliban, amid concern that anger about the strike might derail the process. Rasheed condemned the use of drones in Pakistan. ""Drones are used for killing, but they will not let the peace process be killed with it,"" the minister told reporters. Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head for his alleged involvement in the 2009 attack, was killed in a drone strike in northwestern Pakistan, senior U.S. and Pakistani officials told CNN. He was buried overnight, though the body was burned beyond recognition, Taliban sources said. The Afghan Taliban condemned the drone strike as ""cowardly"" and ""barbaric"" in a statement posted on their website Saturday, the SITE intelligence group said. The statement urged the Pakistani government and people to take measures to stop the attacks. Pakistan braces for reprisals . There are fears the killing of Mehsud may spark a surge in violence. This is in part because the attack in Afghanistan in 2009 -- in which seven U.S. citizens died -- was launched in response to a strike that killed another Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, four months earlier. The Haqqani Network, designated by the United States as a terrorist organization, vowed to avenge Hakimullah Mehsud's death. Spokesman Ahmed Yousaf said the group will launch attacks within a few days. The network is blamed for more than 1,000 U.S. casualties in Afghanistan. Security around Peshawar, the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwest Pakistan, is being beefed up as police and security brace for reprisal attacks, Home Secretary Akhtar Ali Shah said. ""Since this drone strike, we are waiting for a reaction,"" he said. ""We know the reaction will be strong. We have strengthened security in Peshawar, especially at the entry points into the city. We have extra security on patrol with sniffer dogs."" Pakistan summons U.S. envoy after death of Pakistan Taliban leader . Strike hit Taliban stronghold . Three other people were killed in Friday's strike, Pakistani intelligence sources and tribal officials said. They described the incident as a suspected U.S. drone strike in a remote area of Pakistan's North Waziristan region, a Taliban stronghold bordering Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. One missile hit a compound and another struck a car nearby, the Pakistani sources said. This is not the first time Hakimullah Mehsud -- who took the reins of the Pakistan Taliban in 2009 -- has been reported killed after a drone strike. In February 2010, multiple sources said he had died after being hit in a drone strike in Pakistan a month earlier. But reports that he was alive surfaced in April of that year, and in May 2010 he appeared in a video in which he vowed attacks on major U.S. cities. The fact that senior Pakistani government officials have commented so quickly on the news of his death this time adds credence to the reports. Pakistan Taliban claimed Times Square plot . The Pakistan Taliban, who have long been conducting an insurgency against the Pakistani government, claimed responsibility for the December 2009 suicide bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. Five CIA officers were among the seven U.S. citizens killed, and a member of Jordanian intelligence also died. The U.S. Justice Department charged Hakimullah Mehsud in the summer of 2010 for his alleged involvement in the attack, and U.S. officials offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. The group also claimed responsibility for a failed May 2010 attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square. The following September, the U.S. State Department designated the Pakistan Taliban a foreign terrorist organization. Mehsud took over from Baitullah Mehsud, a fellow clan member, in 2009 after the latter was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Peace prospects . Hakimullah Mehsud's death could make progress in proposed peace talks between the Pakistani government and Pakistan Taliban more difficult. A relatively young and charismatic leader, he held together a disparate group with different tribal and other allegiances. There had reportedly been talks about him being involved in peace talks with Pakistan's government. His killing may upset some elements within the Pakistan Taliban if they believe that the Pakistani government was involved. The Pakistan Taliban could also pose an increased security threat if they splinter into smaller groups, which could be harder for security forces to detect. There has been a series of suicide bombings in the region over the past couple of years. CNN's Shaista Aziz, David Simpson and Susanna Capelouto contributed to this report.","New interim leader selected by Pakistan Taliban .

"(CNN) -- One of the next times owners from the 32 NFL teams will all be in one place is Super Bowl XLVIII in February. Officials from the Oneida Indian Nation have asked to join the big party at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, so they can address the NFL's kingpins about the R-word. For now, they'll have to be happy to have met with three vice presidents from the league office. Representatives of the Oneida Nation met Wednesday in New York with executives from the National Football League -- but not NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell or Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder. Ray Halbritter, a representative for the Oneida, said he gave NFL vice presidents Adolpho Birch, Paul Hicks and Jeff Pash a letter and a study on the effects of the Redskins name. ""We were somewhat disappointed to say it mildly that they continued to defend the use of the slur,"" he said. ""It really does require us to redouble our efforts in dealing with this issue."" A statement from the NFL said the meeting was part of an ""ongoing dialogue."" ""We listened and respectfully discussed the views of Mr. Halbritter, Oneida Nation Wolf Clan Representative Keller George and their colleagues, as well as the sharply differing views of many other Native Americans and fans in general,"" the NFL said, according to the statement. Halbritter said the letter asks for another meeting at the Super Bowl so he and the clinical psychologist who put together the study can address every NFL owner on the harm the Redskins name can cause. ""The use of the R-word is not just a victimless crime. It has very real and damaging effects on Native American youth,"" he said. Snyder has said the Redskins name will not change. ""After 81 years, the team name 'Redskins' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from, who we are, and who we want to be in the years to come,"" he wrote in a letter on the team's website. The nickname is a ""badge of honor,"" he wrote. Besides the request for a Super Bowl meeting, Halbritter said the letter also asks Goodell to add an NFL rule that prohibits league franchises from naming teams with dictionary-defined racial slurs. The Oneida also want Goodell to sanction Snyder, if he doesn't change the name. And they also invited Snyder and Goodell to come to Oneida land in central New York, the two-page letter says. The Washington Post reported that Snyder met with Goodell on Tuesday and the Washington owner reiterated he was keeping the Redskins name.","Officials from Native American group displeased after meeting with NFL officials .

"(CNN) -- Nineteen firefighters were killed Sunday battling a blaze in Arizona, the state forestry division said. The vast majority were from Prescott, said Wade Ward with the Prescott Fire Department. State forestry official Art Morrison said the firefighters were members of a ""hotshot"" crew, tasked with digging a fire line and creating an escape route. ""In normal circumstances, when you're digging fire line, you make sure you have a good escape route, and you have a safety zone set up,"" Morrison said. ""Evidently, their safety zone wasn't big enough, and the fire just overtook them."" The crew was fighting the Yarnell Hill fire, which broke out Friday northwest of Phoenix. The fire has grown to 1,000 acres, damaged three homes and forced the evacuations of residents in the communities of Peeples Valley and Yarnell, Morrison said. Authorities believe lightning sparked the blaze. Not including the 19 deaths reported in Arizona, there have been 43 firefighter fatalities reported so far in 2013, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. A total of 83 firefighters died last year while on duty. A Facebook page in memory of the Arizona firefighters was created Sunday night. People left their condolences and messages of support. ""Such a tragic loss. My heart aches for these brave souls, and for their families and friends,"" wrote one. ""I pray for the families and the town of Prescott. RIP,"" wrote another.","NEW: Official: The firefighters were part of a crew tasked with digging a fire line .

"(CNN) -- It was merely a dream, wasn't it? That whole Jason Collins thing of six months ago -- never happened, right? The headline news of his becoming the first openly gay active male professional athlete in a team sport. The Sports Illustrated cover. The supportive tweets from everyone ranging from Barack Obama and Bill Clinton to Jason Kidd and LeBron James. The interviews. The raves (""Game-changing!""). The altered landscape. Remember when The Guardian newspaper called Collins' emergence significant for LGBT acceptance ... ""as professional sports had long been seen as the final frontier""? Remember when the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network presented Collins with its courage award? Remember when the veteran NBA center was being likened to Jackie Robinson? Well, eh, forget it. Forget the whole thing. As you read this, Collins is likely sitting somewhere inside his California home, twiddling his thumbs, watching reality TV, waiting, hoping, waiting, hoping, waiting, hoping for the groundbreaking opportunity that looks, increasingly, unlikely to occur. Put differently: For one to actually become the first openly gay active male professional athlete in a team sport, one must be an openly gay active male professional athlete playing a team sport. And Collins ain't playing squat. With the NBA opening in less than two weeks, it has become clear that the league's 30 teams have no interest in Collins, a 34-year-old journeyman. From a purely basketball standpoint, this is understandable: Once a valuable role player on a New Jersey Nets team that reached back to back NBA Championship series in the early 2000s, Collins is a shell of his former self. Playing with Boston and Washington last season, he averaged but 1.1 points and 1.6 rebounds in 38 games. He is -- to be blunt -- a slow, nonathletic player with creaky joints and no offensive repertoire of which to speak. Were this any other similarly submediocre player in any other sport, his departure would register nary a blip on the radar. He would vanish, and life would move on. Jason Collins, however, ceased being ordinary the moment he announced he was gay. To thousands upon thousands of Americans, he became a beacon of hope and a sign that maybe sexuality would matter not the in machismo-stuffed world of professional sports. If LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and Chris Paul could embrace a gay man as a teammate, what excuse would the loudmouth, homophobic blockhead at the construction site or law firm have for his close-mindedness? Finally, things were about to change. Only they weren't because, well, nobody called. The NBA has been repeatedly defended in its inaction with predictable attacks on Collins' game -- too slow, too marginal, too worthless. Yet could somebody (anybody?) have at least invited him to training camp -- land of myriad oafs and fringe players itching to land a job? Hell, the Los Angeles Lakers' preseason roster included Dan Gadzuric and Eric Boateng, two men with limited skill sets and without Collins' great teammate/dogged worker resume. Hell, the Atlanta Hawks briefly employed David Lighty, a 6-foot-6 shooting guard with no redeeming NBA attributes. Hell, the New York Knicks, according to NBC Sports' D.J. Foster, ""have basically worked out everyone who has ever touched a basketball this offseason."" Everyone save Collins. This isn't a hard one to figure out. As the late Branch Rickey of baseball fame repeatedly pointed out, change within the sports landscape doesn't come easily. Just as members of the Brooklyn Dodgers were loathe to share locker space with Robinson in the summer of 1947, many NBA players (whether they admit it publicly or not) were likely not thrilled by the idea of showering alongside a gay man even if they'd been showering alongside said gay man for more than a decade. Adding Collins to a roster -- even a preseason roster -- would likely have meant awkwardness, confusion and weirdness. There almost inevitably would have been conservative Christian teammates asking to change in a designated private space. Special press conferences would need to be arranged. Gay rights groups would flock to the arena -- and they'd be loud. And what of the slurs that fly across courts during practice with staggering regularity, and without much thought? What would happen the first time a Clipper or Piston or Spur uttered the word ""f****t,"" even if it were not directed at Collins? Could all this trouble (and it would, inevitably, be trouble) be worth it for at best a seldom-used 12th man? Answer: Absolutely. Opportunities like this don't happen often, and the NBA -- arguably the most progressive of the four major American team sports -- is failing miserably. Where is Kidd, the Nets' new coach and former Collins' teammate, with a camp invite? Where is Mark Cuban, the forward-thinking Dallas Mavericks owner, with a pen and a contract? Where are the Golden State Warriors, the team whose arena is 18 miles from the spot where Harvey Milk was murdered? Where are the Lakers, a franchise desperately in need in grit and toughness? Where are the Miami Heat, whose bench could use a bruiser of Collins' ilk? How in the world could no one think to add Collins to a roster, if only to give his courageous first step the conclusion it deserves? How are we letting this one slip away? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman: NBA player Jason Collins came out in April and his move drew support .
Collins has yet to be signed; where did all that support go?

"SHANGHAI, China (CNN)  -- If it weren't for the Internet, Murong Xuecun might still be working as a sales manager at a car company in the southern Chinese city of Chengdu. That is what he was doing when he started writing his first novel on his office's online bulletin board system back in 2001. The Internet is increasingly being seen in China as a tool for literary empowerment, analysts say. Week by week when he got home from work, Murong would post new pieces to a story that painted a bleak yet honest picture of modern urban life in the city where he lived. It contained tales about sex, love, gambling and drugs and became so popular that it soon appeared on numerous other online forums. Today the 35-year-old is considered one of the most famous authors to have emerged in contemporary China. His debut work, ""Leave Me Alone: A novel of Chengdu,"" has been read by millions of Chinese ""netizens"" -- steady Internet users -- and adapted for film and television and translated into German, French and English. He also is viewed as a pioneer of what has become nothing short of a literary renaissance online in the country, particularly among young Chinese writers. This is a constituency that has struggled to find a platform for their work in a publishing industry that is viewed as conservative as it often faces state censorship. Instead of remaining silent, a new generation of authors has found its voice on the Web. ""It is a very big revolution,"" said Yang Hengjun, a political espionage novelist who published his first work online. ""When you write something on the Internet that you can't do in reality and you cause a change, that is revolutionary."" The past decade has seen the blossoming of countless literary Web sites and online forums hosting stories from thousands of aspiring authors. Their work is read by millions of Internet users, leading some to assert that in the future all writing, even reading, in China will take place in cyberspace. ""It's an inevitable trend due to the rapid development of the Internet and conceptual change of people,"" said Hou Xiaoqiang, head of Shanda Literature, a division of Shanghai-based Shanda Interactive Entertainment, the largest online entertainment provider in China. ""Ordinary people have started to realize the world ought to be dominated by them, rather than some media or elite,"" Hou added. ""Online authors are breaking the rules and using totally fresh concepts."" Shanda Literature operates three of China's biggest literary portals, including Qidian, one of the most popular. Collectively, the Web sites receive more than 200 million daily page views and have published nearly 30 billion Chinese characters, according to Shanda Literature's company data. Shanda generates revenues through online advertising and by charging readers small amounts to access popular stories or works from famous authors who have been contracted to write. However, the company is increasingly trying to earn money by licensing online novels to film studios, music producers, game developers and book publishers while protecting the intellectual property rights of its authors. Shanda owns the rights to more than 200,000 works and has already sold a number of licenses to other entertainment companies, including a popular ""Tomb Raider"" novel that is being adapted for film by Hong Kong director Johnnie To Kei-Fung. ""Literature is the starting point of all means of entertainment,"" Hou told CNN. ""It can provide numerous blueprints for games, music, movies and dramas. A lack of good stories is the main reason of the underdevelopment of entertainment [in China]."" Many of China's usually young and often female cyber-writers are posting their work online with the hope that, like Murong's novels, their stories will be read by millions, ultimately becoming books or movies and turning the authors into celebrities. The online Chinese literary scene is, in some ways, like a TV reality show. Bookstores now have sections devoted to Internet novels published as paperbacks, while a number of other influential writers have emerged from the Web over the years, including Annie Baobei, whose books about love and loneliness in Chinese cities have sold more than a million copies. ""In America, people have the American dream. In China, people have the online dream,"" said Dai Yingniao, a college junior who says almost all of her friends read online fantasy novels about time travel, romance or some mixture of the two. These genres are mostly read by ordinary girls who find life boring, said Dai, noting her roommate especially fancies a novel from the Qidian Web site called ""The Legend of Little Beauty."" ""I prefer real literature rather than imaginary works,"" added the 20-year-old. She then described a cyber-novel she is planning to write about a princess who lives during the Qing Dynasty. After leaving her home in Beijing, the princess returns to find she no longer recognizes her family or the society she had lived in a few years before. ""I just want to convey my opinions about today's life,"" Dai said. ""Sometimes euphemism is more powerful."" Today it is more accepted for Chinese publishers to take risks with voices emerging online, many now printing stories that simply would not have been possible a decade ago. Publishing houses often peruse Web sites for talent whose writing can be brought to readers who are not logged on. ""Publishers can come in and say there are readers for this, and this is the demographic and if we want to hit young adults, then this is a great voice,"" said Jo Lusby, the manager of Penguin China. ""[The literary Web sites] are now a very natural part of the publishing scene in China. It is really a convergence of print and online writing."" Yet despite what has been a gradual commercialization and subsequent opening up of the Chinese publishing industry during the past few years, many of the writers who are able to self-publish with freedom online find they still can face substantial censorship when their works are adapted for offline audiences. ""Offline publishing is still tightly controlled and not easy to change,"" said Yang Hengjun, whose spy novels are banned in the country. ""Any Internet novel is largely edited when it goes to publishing."" In the long run, however, Yang said he believes the freedom of literary expression on the Internet will spur even further liberalization in the Chinese publishing industry. ""It is a good thing and it is a promising thing,"" said Yang. ""Nowadays for more and more people if they want to express themselves, they can go online.""","China now has the most Internet users in the world .

"(CNN) -- It happened again Sunday. A woman leaped from the third level of the Oakland Coliseum at a Raiders football game. She survived the 40- to 50-foot drop when a Marine vet who happened to be leaving the stadium used his body as a shield as she landed. But others have not been so fortunate. Every few months this year have brought reports of a fan falling -- sometimes fatally -- at arenas across the country. There have been several incidents this year alone. • On November 24, the day of the woman's fall, a 48-year-old man suffered severe head injuries after falling down steps at the M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore at the Ravens game against the New York Jets. • On November 17, a Buffalo Bills fan fell as he tried to slide down the rail of the upper deck of Ralph Wilson Stadium, dropping about 30 feet. He injured himself and a fan he landed on. • On October 24, a woman fell about 20 feet from the stands at Floyd Stadium at a game at Middle Tennessee State University. • On August 12, a man fell about 85 feet from the upper level of Atlanta's Turner Field. The death was ruled a suicide. The reasons . So, why are these incidents happening? There's not a one-size-fits-all answer. In May 2011, a man trying to slide down a railing at Coors Field at a Colorado Rockies game fell and died. An autopsy later found marijuana in his system, as well as a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit for driving. Some are just tragic accidents. In July of the same year, a father fell to his death trying to catch a ball thrown toward him by Texas Rangers outfielder Josh Hamilton. The man lost his footing and fell over the rail at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, as his young son looked on. The death prompted the Texas Rangers to say the team would raise the railings. It followed an incident a year earlier at the same stadium. In July 2010, a fan fell 30 feet while trying to catch a foul ball. He fractured his skull but survived. 'We're just more aware of it' Is there an uptick in falls in stadiums? ""It's hard to say,"" said Alana Penza, director of the Institute for the Study of Sports Incidents at the National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg. ""From what we've found, it appears it has gone up,"" she said, citing her work going back a decade that is based largely on news accounts. She found three such incidents in 2003 and five or six per year since 2010. But, she added, the previous lower numbers could simply reflect underreporting. ""They're not going up,"" said David Weeks, co-author of ""Death at the Ballpark"" (McFarland, 2009) and head of public services at the library at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina. ""They've been pretty common since the early '70's, back when the super stadiums started being built."" Fan falls to his death at San Francisco's Candlestick Park . Since 1969, he said, 23 people have died in incidents at Major League Baseball games, with ""only a couple"" of suicides. In the ""vast majority"" of the incidents, alcohol was involved, he said in a telephone interview. Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium and New York's Shea Stadium each had three such deaths, he said. A lot of the fatalities weren't falls from upper-level stands to lower-level stands, but were instead falls from stairwell railings, escalator railings and failed attempts to jump from one stairwell to another, he said. For a sport whose preoccupation with numbers can seem obsessive, numbers about deaths and injuries at stadiums are surprisingly tough to come by. A Major League Baseball spokesman said much of the league's information is anecdotal. ""We don't have tallies or numbers going back historically, but we always follow up with clubs after such incidents,"" MLB spokesman Mike Teevan said in a telephone interview. ""We keep records on things that have happened in recent years, but no totals."" But he predicted that could change, now that the league's security department has new leadership. Weeks said he and his co-author, Robert Gorman, based their work on accounts in newspapers, which often ignored fan deaths caused by heart attack or stroke. And some of the newspaper accounts glossed over the details. ""A lot of times, they don't identify the person who was killed,"" said Gorman, who is head of reference at the Winthrop University library. ""But nowadays, with the Internet and YouTube and that sort of stuff, this stuff gets spread around like crazy. I think we're just more aware of it."" Mammoth falls from mammoth stadiums . The size of the newer stadiums appears to have played a role in many of the deaths. ""They build those mammoth ones, and there's a lot more distance to fall,"" Gorman said in a telephone interview. The authors' research, which extended to other venues as well, tallied more than 800 game-related fatalities of players, other personnel and spectators from 1862 through 2007. A second edition of their book will list hundreds more, Gorman said in a telephone interview. Some deaths at sporting events had nothing to do with falls, but were the result of colossally bad luck. Accounts posted on the authors' website detail such incidents, one of which occurred on July 31, 1949, at a game in Baker, Florida. As play was beginning before a crowd of about 300, lightning struck the chicken-wire backstop and raced around the infield. ""There was a loud crack like a big whip, and a brilliant line of fire ran down the third-base line,"" left fielder Gordon Walter testified, according to Gorman. ""Then came this awful thunder, and when I could see again, I noticed all our infielders lying on the ground, and people started running all over the field, shouting and screaming."" The third baseman, second baseman and the shortstop died; about 50 others in the stands were shocked and/or burned. At least 30 players, including one minor leaguer, have died from lightning strikes, according to the authors. Don't sharpen your pencil . Fans know that baseball is all about timing, which couldn't have been worse for one fan at an amateur game on October 25, 1902, in Morristown, Ohio: . ""Stanton Walker, 20, was seated between Frank Hyde, who was scoring the game, and Leroy Wilson, another fan. During the course of the game, Hyde asked Wilson for a knife so he could sharpen his pencil. Wilson opened the blade of his penknife and handed it to Walker to pass along to Hyde. Just as Walker took the knife, a foul ball struck him on the hand and drove the blade into his chest over his heart. Walker bled to death within moments."" Gorman said he initially thought the account was apocryphal but was convinced that it was real when he found it described in the local newspaper. Teams have been protected from legal liability for more than a century by the doctrine known as the assumption-of-risk rule, which holds that the dangers to spectators are widely known and that fans assume any risk, according to Gorman. He said that without the digitization of local newspapers in recent years, he and Weeks would not have been able to complete their project. Gorman said he is a big fan of the game but won't sit on field level along the third or first base sides when he takes his grandchildren with him. ""It's called the danger zone,"" he said, citing those who sell netting. All deaths are not equal, he said. ""When a player is killed, they call it a day; when it's a fan, they don't stop the game."" CNN librarian Julie In contributed to this report.","""I think we're just more aware of it,"" says David Weeks, author of ""Death at the Ballpark""

"(CNN) -- Three blasts rocked northeastern Myanmar leaving one person dead and two others injured, an official told CNN Thursday . According to Sai Tin Ooo, a lawmaker in Shan state -- which borders China -- the first explosion occurred late Wednesday night causing no injuries. Two other explosions on Thursday morning killed one person and wounded two others. Local police confirmed the incidents but could provide no further details. The blasts are the latest in a series of explosions in Myanmar. Late on Monday, a homemade explosive device went off at the luxury Traders Hotel in former capital Yangon, a popular destination for international visitors, injuring one American woman, according to police. A 27-year-old suspect was arrested early Tuesday in the southeastern state of Mon in connection with the bombing at the Traders, Agence France-Presse reported. He had previously stayed in the room where the blast occurred, AFP said, citing police sources. A further suspect was being sought by authorities in connection with an explosion last Friday at a guesthouse in the town of Taunggu, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the capital Naypyidaw, that killed a man and a woman, AFP said.
