"By . Emily Kent Smith . Dental nurse Ravinder Kaur was accused of lacing her practice manager's coffee with Mercury. She walked free from court today . A dental nurse accused of poisoning her boss with mercury after she had been fired days before walked free from court today. Ravinder Kaur's case was dropped by the CPS when two separate juries failed to reach verdicts. Kaur, 35, was said to have laced practice manager Laura Knowles’ coffee with the toxic metal after being handed her final written warning three days previously. Ms Knowles, 37, had to be rushed to hospital with stomach cramps, nausea, and dizziness after drinking the noxious drink which was ‘slimy like an oyster’. Ms Knowles initially thought her colleague had spat in the coffee, she said in court. But when her stomach was x-rayed, doctors found small pieces of Mercury inside. Fortunately, she suffered no permanent effects from the poisonous chemical. Kaur, who worked at Shams Moopen Dental Practice in Shefford, Bedfordshire, did not get on with her colleagues, the court heard. She had been disciplined twice by Ms . Knowles. Three days before the incident, Ms Knowles had told her off for leaving a patient unattended in the dental chair to go on her lunch break. But today, the CPS dropped the case after two separate trials in which juries failed to return a verdict on a charge of administering a noxious substance. Last week a jury of eight women and four men deliberated for 11 hours and ten minutes before they were discharged. The case, at Blackfriars Crown Court, was a retrial after a jury also failed to reach a verdict in May last year. Robin Miric, for the CPS, said: ‘The long and short of it is that the Crown have decided they don’t wish to proceed further in this matter.’ He said that it was only in 'exceptional' circumstances that the CPS would make more than three attempts to convict. Kaur, who began working at the practice in November 2011, claimed she had been framed for the poisoning, which happened in 2012, by her colleagues. ‘I believe I’ve been framed’, Kaur said. ‘I was shocked and I still am. ‘I’m proud to stand here today, just to stand here, to be here and battle for my life. ‘This concerns my liberty, my whole life. My career has gone down, I won’t be back in dentistry, it has been an emotional trauma for me. ‘I’ve been publicised everywhere, my family and friends have suffered, I can say I haven’t had a good night’s sleep for two years.' Victim Laura Knowles is pictured leaving court. She alleged that Ravinder Kaur laced her coffee with mercury days after she gave the dental nurse her notice. Ms Knowles was rushed to hospital because of dizziness and nausea . Mrs Knowles had just returned to work . after the death of her father and accepted the drink from Kaur, known . as Ravi, who had moments earlier offered her boss her condolences. She told jurors it took a 'considerable . amount of time' - about 15 minutes - for Kaur to make the coffee, with . the nurse claiming it was because she had to change the water in the . kettle. Ms Knowles said that she realised after a few gulps that something was wrong with her drink. She told the jury that the coffee was ‘slimy like an oyster’ and that when she tipped the remainder away in the sink ‘metal blobs’ were left by the plughole. Ravinder Kaur is pictured outside Blackfriars Crown Court. Today, the CPS dropped the case against the dental nurse after two juries were unable to come to a verdict . Colleagues described Ms Knowles as panicking and ‘white as a ghost’ when she realised what had happened. Kaur told jurors she left the kettle to boil before heading to surgery, where she saw dentists Dr Kunal Shah, Dr Angela Darshini and nurse Dakina Patel. ‘I went to the staff room and started preparing the coffee, there was no water in the kettle so I prepared to put water in there and had it on to boil’, Kaur said. ‘I put one teaspoon of granules in from the jar, one teaspoon of sugar, two teaspoons of Coffee-Mate then poured the contents into the mug. Colleagues described Ms Knowles as panicking and ‘white as a ghost’ when she realised what had happened. Kaur said that she did not lace her boss' coffee with mercury . ‘I left the kettle to boil and went to the contamination room where I saw Dakina and asked if she wanted a drink, she said ‘no thank you Ravi’. ‘I asked Dr Darshini if she wanted a cup of coffee out of courtesy, she said ‘no thank you Ravi’. Kaur added that she also offered a hot drink to Dr Shah and again offered Dr Darshini a cup of coffee before she returned to the staff room. ‘I just poured the water, stirred it and that was it, gave it to Ms Knowles and went to surgery one’. Kaur from Bedford, denied administering a noxious substance with intent to annoy, injure or aggrieve.","Ravinder Kaur alleged to have poisoned coffee at a Bedfordshire surgery .

"By . Simon Danczuk . That Cyril Smith was a . paedophile is known. But in a devastating book - serialised in the Mail . this week - Labour MP Simon Danczuk exposes the industrial scale of his . debauchery and how the Establishment, Liberal Party, police chiefs and . even MI5 covered it up. Today Danczuk, MP for Smith’s old Rochdale seat, reveals how the  29-stone monster was saved from prosecution time after time... Cyril Smith, pictured celebrating being elected MP for Rochdale, would groom and abuse vulnerable teenage boys . This is the story of one of Cyril’s victims. He was 16, living with adopted parents and hungry for new experiences, when he first met Smith in 1979. His story reveals how shrewdly Smith would groom favoured boys — and how ruthlessly he then abused them. A loud voice was booming outside the window. A big black Mercedes was crawling around our council estate with a Tannoy blaring out ‘Nice One Cyril’. A huge figure got out, strode purposefully across the road and knocked on our door. I opened it and stared at this  smiling hulk of a man. ‘I’m Cyril Smith. Are you interested in politics, lad?’ ‘Yes, I am.’ His face lit up. ‘Then perhaps I’ve got a new recruit. Why don’t you come and join us?’ I did just that, stuffing envelopes at his parliamentary campaign HQ and speaking to voters on doorsteps as he campaigned in the General Election. I went to the count at the Town Hall to watch him win. The cheers nearly shook the building as Cyril was returned as the town’s MP for the fourth time. I was working in a textile mill at the time. I’d never known my real mother, my dad was in prison and I’d been put up for adoption at an early age. I was searching for excitement, risk, purpose. Cyril seemed to promise it. You could tell he didn’t live by the same rules as the rest of us. It wasn’t long before I was a close member of his team and spending  more and more time at his office. I watched with awe at how he tended to constituents’ problems. He’d listen attentively as someone told him how they needed a bigger council house for their  family, then he’d pick up the phone and the council would leap to attention and sort out whatever he wanted. Cyril seemed to have complete control over the public sector in Rochdale. If you became a friend of Cyril’s, he’d make sure he looked after you. ‘You want to be a magistrate?’ he’d ask. ‘Leave it to me.’ He was well in with the free-masons, too. He could always get something done by calling a contact. In 1980, Cyril took me to the Liberal conference in Blackpool. We stayed in the Imperial Hotel and I loved it. Cyril could see I was completely overawed. He laughed and tousled my hair. Method: Smith's victim met him while he was out campaigning with a car using a Tannoy, as in this picture . Back . in Rochdale, he asked me to come for a drive late at  night. ‘Let me . get my mum to bed first,’ he said, and then he picked me up. Cyril . was dressed in his pyjamas and slippers. He drove us up into the . Pennines and pulled up by a stone wall in a remote spot. I remember . looking at his huge clenched fist on the handbrake. I could see the . whites of his knuckles. He . leaned towards me. ‘I’m not going to be in politics for ever,’ he said. ‘If you stick with me, I’ll  make sure you’re the next MP for Rochdale. I’ll show you the ropes, I’ll groom you. It can be yours if you want . it.’ His face was an inch away from mine now and I could smell his breath. The leather seats squeaked as his weight shifted towards me. As he spoke, his hand slid down my inside leg and he began to pull me towards him. I know now I should have screamed and punched him in the face. I should have got out of that car and never turned back. But I didn’t. I sat there frozen as he groped me, moaning and groaning and burying his face in my neck. I didn’t say a word. My heart  was pounding. In the years that followed, I lost count of how many times he did this to me. I could tell by the look on his face that he knew he had complete control over me. My background meant I had hardly any confidence or self-esteem. I’d never had a girlfriend and Cyril’s world was exciting and unpredictable. He treated me like a sex object. I got used to seeing dark clouds  of lust cross his eyes — then  he’d create opportunities for us to be alone. At one point, he even groped me in Parliament. He’d taken me there a few times and introduced me to all kinds of people. I remember meeting Labour leader Michael Foot and watching the pair of them laughing hysterically at things that weren’t in the slightest bit funny. I wondered if you had to be mad to get into that place. In Cyril’s office there he was all over me — with the door open, too. Politicians walked past, but no one said anything. It was as though different laws applied to the  people there. 'The door was open': His victim says he will never forget how Cyril Smith, pictured with then Liberal leader David Steel in 1977, abused him in the House of Commons . Eventually, I was tired of being used. He’d taken what little self-respect I had and trampled all over it. He’d made dignity a foreign word to me. Sometimes I looked in the mirror and felt sick at what I saw. I even dreamed of killing him. Everyone has a breaking point, and I now saw Cyril for what he was — a fat, middle-aged, lonely man who liked abusing boys. His problem was that he’d become intoxicated with power. He was reckless and took risks, but he knew he’d get away with it. By 1985, I was married and left Rochdale and Cyril Smith behind for good. When he died, I couldn’t watch the simpering politicians on TV as they fawned over him and talked of his legacy. He was cremated, but if he’d been buried I would have torn  his gravestone down. I phoned  the chief executive of Rochdale council and told him if they built  a statue in memory of him I’d  personally get a digger and  demolish it. Hate is a powerful emotion and it’s one that I fight with constantly. I don’t want to be owned by it, but I can’t forgive Cyril. How on earth can a politician get away with molesting 16-year-old boys? And how many more were there like me? You know the thing that’s stayed with me most? It’s his laugh. Utterly mirthless, loud and hollow. Sometimes I can still hear it now.

"By . Belinda Robinson . This is the moment a blundering sneak thief ripped off a souped-up campervan's bodywork - but was caught red-handed by a secret dashboard camera staring straight at him. Daylight robber Daniel Gordon, 25, plundered the front bumper off the sporty VW Transporter in broad daylight. But he didn't realise he was being filmed - and was found when the owner put his DIY mugshot on Facebook. Scroll down for video . Duck down: Car park thief Daniel Gordon can be seen ducking down near the VW campervan in Swansea . A court heard the dashboard camera caught the car park thief cannibalising the expensive van. Owner Michael Thomas had spent £2,000 on a sports kit for his beloved VW campervan - and was devastated when he discovered it had been ripped off. But when he played back the footage on his dashboard camera he saw the thief staring straight back at him. Mr Thomas handed the footage to police and put it up on Facebook asking for help in identifying him. Gordon was quickly identified from the film footage and arrested. In a police interview Mr Gordon said he stole the body parts because his friend needed them for his own van. A court heard Mr Gordon told officers he sold them on for just £100. In a victim impact statement, van owner Mr Thomas said: 'I've been left £830 out of pocket by the theft and had to take time off work to sort insurance and repairs to the van. 'My wife was concerned the thief may come back and target us again.' Ripping it off: As he crouches down, the top of his head can still be seen by the dashboard camera . Packing up: Mr Gordon approaches another car with the bumper in his hands . Smile: You've been caught on camera! The car park thief is seen opening the boot and putting the bumper in . Candid camera: He takes a look at his handy work as he closes the boot . Mr Thomas has now changed the number plate of the van to avoid the thief being able to find them. Swansea magistrates court was told Mr Gordon had 12 previous convictions for dishonesty offences. His latest offence was committed while subject to a community order - imposed after being caught stealing from a car. Louise Clissord, defending, said Mr Gordon had a £100-a-day cocaine addiction after diagnosing himself with depression. Magistrates sentenced him to a 12 months community order supervision and a drugs rehabilitation order. He was also made subject to a curfew.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A pensioner was seriously burned after her e-cigarette is thought to have ignited her oxygen supply in hospital. Jean Booth, 65, was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, it was reported, and is fighting for her life after suffering severe burns to her scalp and face. Mrs Booth was only in the hospital for a routine hip operation and hospital chiefs are investigating how the incident occurred in the early hours of Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, when Jean Booth set fire to her oxygen tubes with the e-cigarette . A recent study raises concerns that the 'healthier' option of e-cigarettes may still causes cancer in users . A relative of the retired cleaner told The Sun: 'We're all in total shock. Her face is completely burnt. 'It's covered up with bandages. She might be blinded. It's absolutely horrendous. 'We are not sure she will pull through. If she does she'll have to go through loads of skin grafts.' A spokesman for the hospital said last night: ‘We can confirm that an incident involving one patient in our care took place in the early hours of Friday.’ Last week a barmaid was slightly injured when an e-cigarette blew up while it was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Laura Baty, 18, turned away from the flames but was left with a burnt dress and a singed arm. Around 1.3million people in the UK are thought to use e-cigarettes as consumers look for ‘healthier’ ways to continue smoking. Sales rose 340 per cent from £44million in 2012 to around £193million in 2013. However, a recent study claimed that e-cigarettes may not actually be healthier than their tobacco counterparts. Last week, barmaid Laura Baty, was burnt when her e-cigarette exploded while it was charging . Scientists found 'strikingly similar' gene mutations in lung cells of those exposed to e-cigarettes and those of traditional smokers. ‘[E-cigarettes] may be safer, but our preliminary studies suggest that they may not be benign,’ said study author Avrum Spira, a genomics and lung cancer researcher at Boston University. Mr Spria, who presented the study’s findings at the American Association of Cancer Research’s annual meeting last week, said he could not confirm or deny that e-cigarettes cause cancer, as the research is in its early stages. Further experiments are planned.","Jean Booth is fighting for her life after setting fire to her oxygen tubes at Wythenshawe Hospital .

"By . Deni Kirkova . The perfect wine as voted for by UK wine-lovers would be red, produced in Australia, and cost just £5.83. The ideal bottle for convenience-led Britons would also feature a screw top and be on offer at a discounted price or as part of a multi-buy promotion. The characteristics of the perfect tipple are unearthed thanks to new research into British beverage-buying habits. Almost 40 per cent prefer a glass of rouge, compared to 35 per cent who would choose white . British vino drinkers would also want their beverage available to buy at the supermarket, and to be made by a popular, known brand. Red wine narrowly beat white as the nation's favourite, with almost 40 per cent preferring a glass of rouge, compared to the 35 per cent who chose white. Rosé ranked in third place after drawing less than a fifth of the vote (19 per cent). While European wine from heavyweight producer countries like France, Spain and Italy remained well liked, New World wine - especially that from Australia - was revealed to be leagues ahead in the popularity stakes, with 1 in 5 declaring a preference for booze from down under. When it comes to splashing the cash (or not), UK shoppers are prepared to pay, on average, £5.83 for a bottle, with 7 in 10 unwilling to spend more than £6. We're also much more likely to buy a wine if it's on offer or discounted as more than half of respondents stated that ‘getting a bargain' is a main purchasing driver. The perfect wine as voted for by UK wine-lovers would be red, produced in Australia, and cost £5.83 . These latest statistics produced by specialist wine bottler Cobevco paint a picture of us Britons as creatures of habit. Almost half choose to buy a particular wine because it's made by a brand they've heard of or because it's a grape variety we've tried before and like. Despite this, more than 1 in 3 claim to be ‘knowledgeable' and ‘adventurous' when it comes to wine. Almost 80 per cent of us buy our bottles . exclusively at the supermarket, preferring the convenience of having . everything in the same place to the specialist knowledge of wine . merchants. Only 6 per cent purchase wine at an off license, while even fewer (3 per cent) shop for the booze online. A Cobevco spokesperson said: 'The results of this research really do give us an insight into the state of the nation when it comes to wine preferences. 'For the first time, we're able to get the low down on what makes British consumers tick in the wine aisle. 'While public confidence and spending is on the up, shoppers' purse strings are still tight so it's no surprise that they're looking for an affordable treat in the form of a bargain bottle - most likely one that's on offer. 'What's interesting is that shoppers are now demanding great value wine from far flung producer countries. 'As supply chain technologies advance and overseas producers begin to embrace the cost benefits of bottling in the UK, we'll begin to see even more top notch yet affordable New World wine hit our shelves.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teacher has told of how she ended up with a £2,600 bill after downloading a Neil Diamond album while on holiday in South Africa. Katie Bryan, a maths teacher from Lighthorne, Warwickshire, was visiting her South African-born boyfriend’s family when she downloaded the music to her iPhone via iTunes. When the 43-year-old returned to the UK, she discovered that her bank account was more than £2,000 overdrawn as a result of a direct debit to phone company Orange of £2,609.31. Katie Bryan, 43, from Lighthorne, Warwickshire, downloaded a £8.99 'best of' Neil Diamond album while on holiday in South Africa which ended up costing her of £2,609.31 . The multiple-track ‘best of’ CD of the legendary American singer-songwriter's greatest hits for £8.99, ended up costing her £2,609.31. Her HSBC branch later reversed the payment, putting her bank account back in credit, but the telecoms giant insisted she pay the full four-figure bill. Ms Bryan said: ‘It was a lunchtime get-together with my boyfriend's family at a house where we were staying near the Kruger National Park. I'd had a bit of wine but not too much. ‘People were playing music through their iPads or on phones through an iPod dock. It wasn't a particular song that I wanted to hear. I'm really not that big a Neil Diamond fan. Endnote: Ms Bryan was later given a £400 bundle offer by Orange, removing £2,209.31 off her bill . Ms Bryan said she had been sent a confusing, scrambled message by Orange regarding downloading, but not been told how much it would cost. As she downloaded the tracks, including Song Sung Blue and other all-time favourites, she received a message from Orange informing her she had used 10mb of internet, but still no information on how much it cost. As the download proceeded, further messages warned that she had used 20, 50, 100, 150 and 250 mb. She now knows that the music download, which took 15 or 20 minutes, rocketed to 326 mb. Ms Bryan added: ‘After I got home I took a call from Orange who mentioned that I'd run up a big bill. I actually laughed because I thought they were referring to my £94.68 bill for calls which is nearly three times higher than my normal £35.00 monthly account, but at no point in the conversation was the actual amount raised. ‘I knew nothing about it until I went online to reconcile my HSBC bill and saw this enormous overdraft. A letter from my bank was waiting for me when I got home. At first I thought I hadn't been paid, then I realised it was my phone bill. Ms Bryan phoned Orange to complain about the bill and was told by a customer service advisor that the phone company would come up with a solution within a week. She said: ‘I think Orange is preying on people who make a mistake while abroad. Why such a massive difference in cost? In England you would just pay the album price. ‘There is no way this huge bill relates to the actual cost to Orange. ‘You hear of people doing this and you think 'stupid person - why did you do that?' I do feel foolish. ‘But I also feel it is morally wrong to be expected to pay this sort of money for a Neil Diamond album’ Orange has now offered Ms Bryan a £400 bundle offer and taking £2,209.31 off her bill. They also apologised for the stress they had caused. An Orange spokeswoman said: ‘We have spoken to Ms Bryan and offered a significant reduction in her bill and she is happy with this resolution.’","Katie Bryan, 43, from Warwickshire was charged £2,609.31 by Orange .

"By . Hugo Gye . A police expert who is trained in identifying suspected criminals from CCTV believes he may have found the soldier behind one of the most famous photographs of the First World War. Last week, Raymond Darkes claimed that his father Frederick was the man captured on camera carrying a wounded comrade through the trenches during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. However, Scotland Yard 'super-recogniser' PC Dale Nufer has ruled Pte Darkes out of the running, saying he cannot be the person from the propaganda film. Instead, he pointed to Pte George Edwin Raine as a possible candidate, as there is a 'link and a resemblance' between photographs of him and the famous image from the Somme. Mystery: The soldier in this image, taken from The Battle of the Somme, has never been identified . Found? Douglas Raine believes the soldier was his father, Pte George Edwin Raine, pictured in this photograph . The picture was taken from The Battle of the Somme, a film which helped educate the British public to the horrors of the trenches at a time when many had a much more positive image of the war. It shows a soldier looking up at the camera with a haunted look, carrying a wounded man who is said to have died half an hour after the footage was captured. However, the film's producers did not keep a record of who appeared in it, leading to decades of speculation about the soldier's identity. Last week Mr Darkes, 83, said he had no doubt that the man must have been his father, who survived the trenches and lived until 1960. Claim: Last week the son of Frederick Darkes, pictured with his wife, said he thought he was the soldier . But Mr Nufer, one of the Metropolitan Police's most skilled identification experts, told The Times it was almost impossible that the two men were the same person. 'His nose is a lot longer and sharper and the eyes seem different,' he said. 'The soldier has a full ear lobe and [Darkes] doesn't - he has a squarer chin and slightly higher forehead.' Solution? PC Dale Nufer, pictured, says Pte Darkes cannot have been the soldier and suggests it is more likely to have been Pte  Raine . Douglas Raine, 83, from West Sussex, insists that the man was in fact his father George, who served with the Durham Light Infantry. The former soldier apparently remembered being caught on camera while carrying his comrade towards the nearest medical station. When Mr Nufer saw a photograph of Pte Raine, he said: 'There is more of a link and a resemblance, if you look at the straight brow, the stronger and broader nose and the solid-looking, oval shape of the face. 'And he has the right kind of ear lobe. I would say there is a link with this one.' Pte Raine was a miner from County Durham, before moving to London to work on building the Underground. During the war he used his mining experience to help dig military tunnels, and he died in 1960 at the age of 76. The Imperial War Museum, which owns the propaganda film, says the question of identification is 'officially open' and has declined to comment on the competing claims. Mr Nufer has identified more than 200 criminals from examining CCTV footage of crime scenes. He is part of a team of Met 'super-recognisers' who have been picked out as exceptionally talented at spotting people and matching up identifications. The specialist officers are often used to provide the initial breakthrough in a case, which will then be investigated using conventional means to corroborate the identification of the suspect. The Battle of the Somme was shown around Britain just four weeks after it was filmed on the battlefield. It was a huge success, and 20million people had flocked to cinemas to see the footage just six weeks after it was released. A single film would not reach so many viewers again until Star Wars in 1977. Photographs and descriptions of life on the front had been available previously, but this was the first time a moving picture of modern warfare was widely shown. Many audience members would never have seen a film before. At first was feared that the graphic depiction of war might damage morale, but instead the images of brave British soldiers struggling on the front line brought about a huge swell of support. A newspaper report at the time said: 'Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy.'","Soldier caught on camera in the Somme in 1916 has never been identified .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . When Tim Sherwood met Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy last week, he gave him three specific transfer targets. West Ham defender Winston Reid, Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry and Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku were the men he wanted at White Hart Lane next season. Sherwood’s recommendations had been taken so seriously during a transfer meeting the previous month that director of football Franco Baldini went to watch Fulham play Everton on March 30, instead of travelling to Anfield to watch Tottenham. Given the 4-0 scoreline at Liverpool, it was a wise decision. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Sherwood defiant over Spurs future after 5-1 win . All over bar the shouting: Tim Sherwood will be replaced as Tottenham manager in the summer . Character: Sherwood has been outspoken as Spurs boss and at times it might have been too much . Attention! Sherwood (right) salutes Emmanuel Adebayor after the Spurs striker's second against Sunderland . Don't get too comfortable: Sherwood (centre) sits in the dug-out before Tottenham's 5-1 win over Sunderland . This break from the norm for Baldini, who usually sits close to Levy in the directors' box at Tottenham matches, was significant. Lukaku and Barry both played the full 90 minutes for Everton in their 3-1 victory and they were wanted men. Sherwood was desperate to get them to Spurs. At the time he was in with a chance of keeping the job, despite the interest from Louis van Gaal, Frank de Boer, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino. Of the names under consideration at White Hart Lane, former Tottenham striker Jurgen Klinsmann is the only candidate who has not been agitating for the job behind the scenes. Big tick there from the boardroom. More on them in a moment. Sherwood knows he has made mistakes since he replaced Andre Villas-Boas as Tottenham’s manager and it probably wasn’t a good idea to ask for the ear of the chairman after another leathering, this time at Anfield. Goodness knows Levy has had a gutful of that this season and anybody who knows him will tell you that no-one gets away with humiliating Tottenham’s chairman in public. This season alone he has been on the end of some hidings: 6-0 and 5-1 against Manchester City, 5-0 and and 4-0 against Liverpool, 4-0 at Chelsea, 3-0 at home to West Ham and three defeats against Arsenal. In Levy’s world, someone will always pay the price for that. Sherwood has certainly provided some entertainment in his 23 games in charge of Spurs, but Levy believes he lacks maturity and stature for such a prestigious position. Tim's targets: Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry (below left) and Winston Reid (below right) were wanted by Sherwood when he thought he still had a future as Tottenham manager . It probably wasn’t wise, even in jest, for Sherwood to say that he would be returning to the technical area for the Sunderland game and ‘might knock a few people out’. He knows that. He is highly-emotional, passionate about his work and his team. There is something to be said for that, even if it is a bit much at times. Sherwood spoke of the ‘shackles coming off’ after the team ran out 5-1 winners against Sunderland on Monday, shining a torch on his pre-match team talk with Tottenham’s players. They have been made aware that their manager is leaving at the end of the season and will be replaced someone with vast experience in the game. Waiting game: Louis van Gaal (right) has kept Spurs hanging on as he watches the situation at Manchester United . Big tick: Jurgen Klinsmann (left) is favoured by the Spurs board, while Frank De Boer also wants the job . Under pressure: Carlo Ancelotti (left) remains an option for Tottenham if he is fired by Real Madrid . Not the answer: Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino isn't ready to manage Tottenham . That is Levy’s wish, something he has already articulated to his board as he begins to plan for next season. Presumably this means Southampton manager Pochettino, who has lost twice against Tottenham in the league this season, is not ready for the 14th biggest job in European football, according to the 2014 Deloitte Money League. At 42, a man who refuses to speak English despite a near perfect command of the language, is not the answer for Tottenham at this moment in time. Klinsmann, who is preparing for the World Cup with the USA, had been offered the position until the end of the season when Villas-Boas was fired. Levy had tried to tempt him with the bait that he could keep a closer eye on the Americans playing in Europe if he could help Spurs out in the short term. Klinsmann said no. Rebuilding job: Daniel Levy (front) will have to appoint yet another manager . After Real Madrid’s stunning 4-3 defeat at home by Barcelona on March 23, Ancelotti was under so much pressure at the Bernabeu he believed he could be fired at the end of the season. His team are now third in La Liga, three points off Atletico, although they are in Friday’s draw for the Champions League semi-final after beating Borussia Dortmund. Ancelotti has not been ruled out. The Italian remains an option if he is fired. Then there is Van Gaal, the man who has kept Tottenham waiting after hanging out for the possibility that Manchester United could replace David Moyes. The relative upturn in recent results, with the exception of the 3-0 defeat at home by Manchester City, has closed the door on Van Gaal’s hopes of heading to Old Trafford. Moyes is staying for the time being. Sherwood will not remain and he will walk away from Spurs after their final game of the season at home to Aston Villa on May 11. Beyond that, Levy will have to start rebuilding this club. Again.","Jurgen Klinsmann is favoured by the Spurs board to be the next manager because he hasn't agitated for the job .

"By . Tara Brady . A body discovered 40ft up a tree on a golf course after a dog found a human arm has been identified as a Lithuanian man who was missing for three years. Jurij Sliachtecov, a 21-year-old Lithuanian, was first reported missing in early May 2011. At first the police and his friends believed he had returned to his native Lithuania because he had taken his passport. Jurij Sliachtecov, a 21-year-old Lithuanian, was first reported missing in early May 2011 . He was last seen out with friends in Bournemouth in late April 2011. However, it was soon realised he had not returned home and a feature about his disappearance appeared on the Lithuanian version of Crimewatch. It was only when a dog emerged from a bush at Meyrick Park golf club, near Bournemouth, holding a human arm in its mouth on March 31 that police were called. The discovery sparked a massive police search and more remains were found that day 40ft up in the branches of a tree. Grizzly: A man points police in the direction of where he found the human bones in Bournemouth . The walker took police to where he found them but when they looked up they discovered more human remains . A man, who lived near the gold course, approached the officers the following day clutching two more human bones in a clear plastic bag. He had taken them home after finding them at the spot last year but did not tell anyone or call police. A spokesman for Dorset Police told the Western Daily Press that formal identification has not yet been carried out but they believe the body is that of the missing Lithanian. An inquest is expected to be opened and adjourned later this week and cause of death is yet to be established. At this stage the death is not being treated as suspicious. Discovery: A spokesman for Dorset Police said last night that officers had found 'additional human remains' A spokesman for Dorset Police said at the time that officers had found 'additional human remains' in an inaccessible place, high up in a tree. 'They have been found high up in a tree. The remains have not yet been identified,' the spokesman added. As the body decomposed, it is believed the bones fell to the ground. Teams of police forensic experts with tracker dogs worked in a large sealed off section of Meyrick Park golf course. The golf club remained open to players who were stopped from using just one hole by blue and white police tape . A private ambulance was called to the scene to take the hand away to be examined at a hospital mortuary. The golf club remained open to players who were stopped from using just one hole by blue and white police tape. A spokesman for Dorset Police said a pathologist confirmed the hand to be human, prompting a thorough search of the woodland with police sniffer dogs. It was described as being in 'fairly advanced' stage of decomposition. Police were left baffled today after discovering a badly decomposed body in woodlands at a golf course . The limb, which had been detached from just below the elbow, did not have any remnants of clothing or other type of covering on it, and had no distinguishing features. There were no rings on the fingers. Files on missing people were examined for clues about who the arm belonged to. Residents living near to the golf course regularly walk their dogs on the land surrounding the holes and were stopped by the investigation. One walker, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone who walks up here has said it’s an arm or a hand. It’s not very nice, it’s sad to think it’s been in that woodland without anyone knowing.'","Police were called to Meyrick Park, in Bournemouth, on March 31 .

'I'm speaking as a Chelsea player, but when we all sit back and look at it then it's definitely two yellows. It's simple as that. 'If it's a minute, two, five minutes into the game and it is a yellow or red card then it doesn't matter. Thankfully we managed to take advantage.' Swansea boss Garry Monk added: 'For their bench and manager to [then] surround the fourth official, and their players surround the referee himself, and then the red card comes so [much] later on, it makes you wonder.'

"By . David Kent . Schumacher is 'showing small signs of progress' his spokeswoman said on Sunday . Michael Schumacher is 'showing small signs of progress' as he continues to slowly recover from devastating brain injuries suffered in a ski accident, his spokeswoman said on Sunday. Speaking on live television, the driver's manager Sabine Kehm spoke of the F1 legend's recovery and how his 'little bit of progress makes us very happy.' Miss Kehm told German broadcaster ARD: 'There are short moments of consciousness and he is showing small signs of progress. 'There are moments when he is awake and moments when he is conscious. 'Of course I am not a doctor, but medically, there is a distinction between being awake and being conscious, the latter meaning there is an ability to interact with his surroundings. 'I don't want to disclose details out of respect for the family, but we have no doubt at all in the abilities of the doctors treating Michael, they are experts in their field.' Doctors put Schumacher . into a medically induced coma after he hit his head on a rock while . skiing at the French resort of Meribel on December 29. Miss Kehm . insisted Schumacher will be brought out of the coma - but did not indicate how long the process would take. She added that . if and when Schumacher is moved to a rehabilitation clinic - to begin . the long recovery process of learning to speak and move again - his . state of health will become a 'private matter' and no more news will be . forthcoming. She said: 'Michael Schumacher is in a coma and can not . decide what is reported about him. We of course know how he deals with . such things and try in his interest to handle these matters for him.' Sabine Kehm, Schumacher's manager, speaks on TV panel talk show 'Guenther Jauch' this evening where she discussed the driver's health and recovery . Her words this evening come just hours after International Automobile Federation president Jean Todt said the driver was still 'fighting' for his life and his future remains uncertain. 'I . see him very often and he's still fighting. He's fighting and we can . only hope and pray that it will improve over the future,' Todt told . journalists on the sidelines of World Touring Car Championship race in . Marrakech. 'It has been a tragedy this accident. A tragedy for Michael, a tragedy for his family. 'Michael is in very good hands with fantastic dedicated doctors in the hospital in Grenoble. 'Obviously, I'm very close to him, to the family,' Todt added. Sabine Kehm, pictured in January this year speaking with journalists, gave the update live on German television this evening. She said: 'There are short moments of consciousness and he is showing small signs of progress' Tonight, Miss Kehm told interviewer Guenther Jauch of the extreme lengths some fans have gone in order to get . close to the driver in hospital. She . said one man was stopped by security before he got on to Schumacher's . intensive care ward at the University of Grenoble Hospital posing as his . father Rolf. In . another instance two people who wanted to take a photo of the . 45-year-old racing driver on mobile phones were halted by bodyguards in . the hospital lobby. Schumacher suffered severe brain injuries . in a low-speed ski run on the slopes of the French resort and had to be airlifted to hospital where he underwent two . emergency operations. Since then he has reportedly lost almost half his . body weight and has fought back from a potentially life-threatening . bout of pneumonia.

"By . Sara Malm . A baby boy who was born with his bowel on the outside of his body has finally been allowed home after spending his first three months in hospital. Joshua O’Callaghan, from Widnes, Merseyside, was born five weeks in November last year. His mother Lynsey, 26, was told at her 12-week scan that there was potentially something wrong with her baby, but the extent of Joshua’s condition was not discovered until he was born. Happy at home: Joshua O'Callaghan, pictured in the arms of his parents Lynsey, 26, and John, 30, was born with his bowel on the outside of his body . Joshua was rushed to the operating table for emergency surgery and had to spend his first months in intensive care as he recovered. He was finally allowed home to Lynsey and his father John Rankin, 30, in February and was christened last week. ‘When he was born I could tell by the look my mum’s face that Joshua wasn’t right,’ said his mother, a shop worker, who already had another son Jackson, two, from a previous relationship. ‘It was such a shock to see my baby in that state. We were allowed a quick cuddle before he was whisked off to the intensive care unit. ‘Throughout our stay in hospital it was just one thing after another. It’s fantastic to finally get him home and start living as a normal family with Jackson and my partner John’s daughter Courtney.’ Acting fast: Little Joshua was just two days old when doctors rushed him into emergency surgery to treat his condition . Shock: Lynsey was told early in the pregnancy that something might be wrong with Joshua but did not know the full extent of his condition until he was born . Hope: Joshua was given two stomas in surgery, seen in the picture, and a colostomy bag, and his parents were told he would recover within two weeks . Joshua was suffering from a condition called Gastroschisis - a type of hernia - which affects around one in 2,000 births. This meant he was born with his bowel trapped in his umbilical cord. He was just two days old when he had emergency surgery to place his organs back inside his body. His mother said: ‘It was very scary. My tiny baby was surrounded by wires and machines all the time. ‘We thought after the surgery it would take him two weeks to recover and then we would have him home - but it didn’t work like that.’ Joshua was given two stomas - openings on the abdomen which allow stools and urine to exit the body - and a colostomy bag,. His parents were promised he would be better by his first birthday. Family: Despite the second operation and a longer recovery time, Lynsey and John have been told their son will go on to live a normal life . However, a short while later, his stomas became blocked and Joshua was rushed in for more surgery. He was finally allowed home last month. Despite being five months old, Joshua still weighs just 10lb, but no longer has a colostomy bag, and is expected to live a normal life. His mother said: ‘Some women get chance to enjoy their pregnancy, but not me. Knowing from 12 weeks that there was going to be something wrong with my baby made it hell. ‘Now we’ve finally got him home I can concentrate on making up for that.’ A spokesperson from the Luey Jacob Sharp Foundation, the UK’s only Gastroschisis charity said: ‘It is usually picked up by week 14 in the pregnancy and is a condition for which the cause is unknown, yet seems to be on the rise. ‘Awareness for the condition needs to be raised to achieve prevention. We would also like to campaign for care of pregnant mothers carrying gastro babies.’ For more information, visit the charity website.","Joshua O'Callaghan was born with his bowel outside his body .

"By . Sara Malm . A 31-year-old man has told how he managed to drop an astonishing 20 stone in 18 months – thanks to a new pair of insoles. David Sameiro has made an incredible journey, going from a 33st sedentary man with a fast food addiction to a svelte and avid walker. Free of the aches and pains that used to plague him, he now walks everywhere he can. Then and now: David, 31, from London, has lost . 20 stone in 18 months after he bought a pair of copper soles in November . 2012, that took away his joint pain and made it possible for him to . exercise again . The retail manager from West London credits a pair of copper insoles used to treat arthritis for getting him off his feet. Mr Sameiro began to pile on the pounds in his . late 20s and as his weight crept up, began to experience arthritis-like symptoms. By November 2012, he weighed 33 stone. ‘Back . then, my l life was unbearable - and it was impossible to exercise due to my . weight,' he told MailOnline. 'My social life was non-existent and I was often extremely . depressed.' Bigger guy: David says he always was a bit overweight growing up but the pounds started seriously piling on in his late 20s when his joint pain stopped him from exercising at all, making him depressed and isolated, which in turn saw him turn to food for comfort . He says that to most people, he probably did not seem to eat much. But . although he would have a normal cereal breakfast and sandwich and crisps . and a chocolate bar for lunch, he binged on takeaways and unhealthy . snacks at night. ‘I would . order the biggest size pizza, fried food, any takeaway,' he said. Svelte: Mr Sameiro is now looking for love . 'I didn’t want to . go out as people would stare at me; using public transport was . embarrassing due to my size.’ His . size saw him suffer from pain in his ankles, knees and lower back as . well as severe chafing. He soon found it too exhausting to even walk a . few yards - and decided things had to change. ‘I heard about The Original Copper . Heeler insoles so I bought two pairs and started wearing them. As far as . I’m concerned they saved my life. 'After . just ten days I noticed a massive reduction in pain and this meant I was able to . walk more. 'Then, after three weeks, I found myself walking half way to work and . half way home -the weight began to drop off.' He added: 'This . was so encouraging that I started talking walks in the evenings after . work and at the weekends instead of sitting at home snacking in front of . the TV. ‘As I progressed, I . also started to change my diet. I no longer binge on junk at . night, and often choose to have a soup or something lighter at lunch. 'I . still have the occasional takeaway, but it’s nothing like it was before. ‘I don’t want to go back. My life has turned around completely; I’m now looking for a relationship and want to start a family, something that I thought I would never be able to achieve.’ The apparent healing powers of copper were first pioneered by the ancient Greeks who used copper bracelets to ease aches and pains (the insoles claim to contain 14 times more copper than bracelets). David says the Original Copper Heels, made for arthritis sufferers, saved his life . Copper is an essential mineral in the body and is thought to keep blood vessels, the immune system and bones healthy. The Arthritis Foundation reports there . is no scientific research to prove the effectiveness from copper . bracelets. However it also says there is none to prove the contrary. Tony . Andrews, of The Original Copper Heeler, the company which invented the . copper insoles, said: 'I was passionate in finding a completely natural, . drug free solution to stop the torturing pain of this “quality-of-life” destroying disease. People from all walks of life are wearing the . copper heelers.'","David Sameiro, 31, was suffering from joint aches and pains due to weight .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Rare leopard spot fish have been bred in an aquarium for the first time ever. The colourful leopard spot goby fish, which are covered in bright red and orange spots, were virtually unknown around the British coast until the introduction of modern scuba equipment. But now they have been successfully bred for the first time in captivity at the Blue Reef Aquarium in Newquay, Devon and staff are hopeful the tiny hatchlings will continue to thrive. Hundreds of rare leopard spot goby fish have been bred at the Blue Reef Aquarium in Newquay, Devon . Jenny Youngs, who is rearing the hatchlings at the aquariums nursery said: 'Leopard spot gobies are definitely one of the most attractive of our native species. 'Their bright markings are all the more unusual as most other members of the goby family are far more drably coloured to match their rocky or sandy habitat. 'We're looking after literally hundreds of microscopic hatchlings with even more due to hatch out any day. 'We have a group of four adults here at Blue Reef but this is the first time they have bred. As far as we know the species is not on display anywhere else in the UK so we think this is actually a first.' The aquarium have successfully bred hundreds of the hatchlings, which are pictured here under a microscope . The species is thought to be native to the south west of England, with further populations reported in the north east of the country. The leopard spot goby lives in shallow seas below the low water mark in rocky areas and are occasionally found in rockpools. In the wild they feed on small crustaceans and other tiny invertebrates. Although records are scarce, experts believe the fish breed in the spring and are relatively short-lived - apparently dying once they have spawned.","The fish have been bred in captivity at the Blue Reef Aquarium in Newquay .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Following a high fat diet like Atkins or LCHF increases the risk of the most common form of breast cancer by more than a fifth, research has found. By increasing saturated fat in food and consuming fatty products was found to raise the risk of hormone-sensitive breast cancer by 28 per cent. Fatty diets also made it more likely for a woman to develop breast cancer marked by a defective HER2 gene. Danger food: A diet high in saturated fat can increase the risk for breast cancer by 20 per cent, research finds . A majority of breast cancers are driven by the female hormone oestrogen, and of these most are also sensitive to the hormone progesterone. Scientists who studied data on 10,000 patients found an association between fat consumption and breast cancer in these women. The same link was not seen in women whose cancers were neither hormone-sensitive nor HER2-positive. The findings, from the Epic breast cancer study involving more than 300,000 women in 10 European countries, are reported in the Journal Of The National Cancer Institute. Taking risks: High fat intake raise the risk of hormone-sensitive breast cancer by 28 per cent . 'The results of this prospective study on a large heterogeneous population of European women indicate that a high-fat diet increases breast cancer risk,' The authors, led by Dr Sabina Sieri from the National Tumour Institute in Milan, Italy, wrote. 'And, most conspicuously, that high saturated fat intake increases risk of receptor-positive disease, suggesting saturated fat involvement in the etiology (causes) of receptor-positive breast cancer.â€™ . High fat diets have previously been under fire for cancer risks as it often sees carbohydrates replaced with high-fat animal proteins. A British study from 2013 found that fatty snacks and fast food increased the risk for bowel cancer, the deadliest cancer form apart from lung cancer. It also raises the level of cholesterol in the blood and although not a direct link to cancer, high cholesterol could lead to heart disease and a by-product of cholesterol can fuel the deadly growth and spread of breast cancer, it was reported last year. Earlies this year Scientists at the University of Southampton found that the offspring of mice who were fed a high-fat diet were more likely to experience impaired blood flow in the brain, a symptom that is linked to Alzheimerâ€™s disease. A high fat diet in the mother meant that the offspring were less able to rid themselves of harmful sticky beta amyloid proteins, the accumulation of which is a key feature of Alzheimer's.","Atkins-type diets found to increase the most common form of breast cancer .

"By . Mark Prigg . Google Glass owners will soon be able to broadcast everything they see live online, raising new privacy concerns over the wearable computer. Livestream says its new app could be used by journalists, and even be worn by athletes during events. However, the firm admits the new app has major privacy issues - but says the benefits are worth it. The firm boasts the new app will allow users to 'go live' - but admits it raises major privacy concerns . The app uses a user's mobile phone to broadcast what they see live online, via either a cellphone or wifi connection . Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much.The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year.'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!' With a simple tap of the device and at the voice command 'OK Glass, Livestream,' Glass users can stream what they are recording to an online audience. The app is already available on iOS and Android is being used for a multitude of applications including citizen journalism, news coverage, sporting events, concerts and more. 'The possibilities of Livestream for Glass are endless,' CEO Max Haot said in a statement. 'From a reporter covering a protest, to an athlete competing in a sports arena, we believe that Glass will be instrumental in democratizing the future of live video streaming.' According to co-founder and chief product officer Phil Worthington, the app has been used in the past by citizen journalists to record and live stream major news events. But the first-person perspective that Glass provides makes the app even more valuable. The app could be used by sailors and other sportsmen to give viewers a new perspective on sport . However, the glasses could also be used to illegally bootleg concerts, for instance . Livestream was used to provide a live feed Twitter's initial public offering and is used at other big broadcasting companies. The app allows followers of the stream to post comments that will pop up at the bottom of Glass's interface. It can also post to Facebook when you begin shooting and will also provide on-demand tape to link once the user is done shooting. He admitted the new app was controversial. 'Yes, maybe there are privacy concerns, but I think the information it shares with the world is much more valuable than that,' he said. One of the limitations of the app is its drain on battery power, but Worthington said people dedicated to live streaming can connect an external a battery pack to shoot for longer durations. With a simple tap of the device and at the voice command 'OK Glass, Livestream,' Glass users can stream what they are recording to an online audience.","App makers claims journalists and athletes could use the app to broadcast .

"By . Wills Robinson . A glass of red can taste exquisite on holiday in the south of France, but have a hint of bitterness back home in front of the television. This is because wine tastes different depending on the conditions it is drunk in, according to scientists. Experimental psychologists at Oxford University believe light and sound affect how fruity, bitter or acidic the wine is, which means the tipple you drunk abroad will taste different when you get home. Taste: Researchers in Experimental Psychology at Oxford University believe that light and sound affect how fruity, bitter and acidic the wine is . Professor Charles Spence believes the results could change how bottles are labelled. In future bottles may have advice attached such as ‘drink while listening to classical music’ or ‘best served after dark.’ 'We’ve all been in that situation where you being a bottle of wine back from holiday and you excitedly open it with friends, only to find it doesn’t taste anything like you remember it did,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. 'Of course the wine is still the same. They only thing that has changed is your environment.' He added that wine drinkers should play music to recreate the atmosphere experienced on holiday or wait for a warm summers evening. Professor Spence will test the theory in a multi-sensory experiment at the Streets of Spain festival on London’s Southbank next month, . In a ‘Colour Lab’, he will ask visitors to rate how wine tastes depending on light and music. The . experiment works by shining different colours of light on the drinker with sounds . playing as they taste an unknown wine in a black glass. A study by the University of Tübingen in 2009 found that participants rated wine as tasting 50 per cent sweeter if drunk under red light, rather than blue or white. The latest experiment is being . sponsored by Spanish wine label Campo Viejo. Winemaker Roberto Vicente tested the lab and found that is own wine tasted different under a variety of lights. Weather: The research also suggested that wine drinkers should wait till a warm summers evening to drink their favourite bottle . Mr Vicente said he was amazed to find that his own wine tasted so different when the lights changed from red to green. 'In the white light at the beginning I could tell that this was my wine,' he told the paper. But he said when the red lights came on he thought: 'Oh my God, this is really ripe and really sweet on the palette and the bitterness has vanished’. A previous study by Oxford University found that when experienced tasters were given champagne in black glasses, they struggled to tell the difference between a cheap sparkling wine and an expensive bottle. Last year Salisbury District Hospital discovered that patients ate more if food was presented on blue plates. Studies have shown that humans appear to be attracted to red food because it signals ripeness, sweetness and calories.","Scientists think light and sound affect how fruity, bitter and acidic drink is .

"By . Mark Prigg . Uber is to begin offering a package delivery service in New York, the firm has announced. The controversial car firm which has come under fire for its 'surge' pricing policies, will offer deliveries by bike and foot for the first time, taking on existing services like Postmates. It will charge at least $15 for each delivery, and the service will initially only work in a small part of Manhattan, the firm said. The controversial car firm says its new courier option, UberRUSH, is like 'Uber for things' 'It's an Uber for things,' said Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber NYC. The new service, called UberRUSH, uses a courier on foot or on bike to deliver packages. 'With UberRUSH, your packages travel like a VIP. You get fast messenger pickups and immediate deliveries of the things you need to send,' the firm said. Messengers will only make deliveries within Manhattan below 110th Street to start. 'We’re working to expand quickly, and will update you as coverage areas change,' it said. The new service will use the existing Uber app to allow customers to book. Once a delivery is underway, both parties can track the courier via the app. Uber has not said how many couriers are signed up, but is appealing for more on its site. 'We’re looking to partner with the best messengers in NYC,' it said. The service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the company plans to roll it out to other cities. The service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the company plans to roll it out to other cities. It will compete with other app delivery services such as Postmates, which began in San Francisco and has been operating across Manhattan and Brooklyn for several months. Uber said its rates are calculated based on zone pricing. If a delivery begins and ends within the same zone, it¿s a flat $15. Each zone crossed during delivery is an additional $5, and additional stops may result in a higher fare. Uber said its rates are calculated based on zone pricing.

"By . Mark Prigg . Online restaurant reviews can give an insight into a person's personality and innermost thoughts, researchers have claimed. Researchers analysed over 900,000 Yelp reviews, and the results gave an insight in people's likes and dislikes. They found constant references to drugs and sex, and references to highly emotional life events. Positive reviews of cheap restaurants and foods often employed metaphors of drugs or addiction, such as 'these cupcakes are like crack' Positive reviews of expensive restaurants tended to use metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as 'orgasmic pastry' or 'seductively seared foie gras.' Longer words like 'sumptuous,' 'commensurate,' 'unobtrusively' and ""vestibule' were common/ . Positive reviews of cheap restaurants and foods often employed metaphors of drugs or addiction, such as 'these cupcakes are like crack, 'be warned the wings are addicting' and 'the garlic noodles should be outlawed! They are now my drug of choice.' Negative reviews were frequently associated with the language of personal trauma and poor customer service, for instance: 'We waited 10 min. before we even got her attention to order.' Women were more likely than men to use drug metaphors to describe their attitudes toward food. The foods most likely to be described using drug metaphors were pizza, burgers, sweets and sushi . Dan Jurafsky, the Stanford professor who led the study, said, 'Our goal was to examine online reviews not for what they tell us about restaurants, but rather for what they tell us about people, about the psychology of the person who wrote the review. 'We studied the meanings that are hidden in the way people use words and connotations.' The reviews covered restaurants in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Positive reviews of expensive restaurants tended to use metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as 'orgasmic pastry' or 'seductively seared foie gras,' with longer words. However, while positive reviews of expensive restaurants were rife with sensual and sexy metaphors, the good food at cheap restaurants prompted references to drugs. The study in the  journal First Monday, used software to investigate almost 900,000 reviews of 6,548 restaurants – from fast food to luxury restaurants – on Yelp.com. The researchers analysed words and sentiments in the reviews, searching for words like 'fail,' 'disappoint,' 'bad,' 'antagonize' and 'heartbreakingly' in bad reviews. Positive reviews of cheap restaurants and foods often employed metaphors of drugs or addiction – 'these cupcakes are like crack.' 'We talk about food as an addiction when we're feeling guilty about what we're eating,' said Jurafsky. Researchers found constant references to drugs and sex, and references to highly emotional life events. Negative reviews were frequently associated with the language of personal trauma and poor customer service, such as 'we waited 10 min. before we even got her attention to order.' Women were more likely than men to use drug metaphors to describe their attitudes toward food. Jurafsky said that prior research shows women are more likely to express cravings for foods like chocolate than men, and that they might be more comfortable expressing these feelings. The foods most likely to be described using drug metaphors were pizza, burgers, sweets and sushi.'Sense of self'. The team analysed over 900,000 restaurant reviews on Yelp . The team said they were stunned by how strongly the language of negative Yelp reviews resembled the language of people who have been traumatized by tragedies or the deaths of loved ones. 'Bad reviews seem to be caused by bad customer service rather than just bad food or atmosphere. 'The bottom line is that it's all about the personal interactions. 'When people are rude or mean to you, it goes straight to your sense of self.' The negative reviews function as a means of coping with service-related trauma, according to the study.'When you write a review on the web you're providing a window into your own psyche – and the vast amount of text on the web means that researchers have millions of pieces of data about people's mindsets, said Jurafsky.","Researchers say language used in Yelp reviews can give an insight into personality .

They also want to know how the sunlight-starved microbes get enough energy to survive and if they can cope with the high level of radiation found on Mars. Answers to these questions will shed light on whether bacteria could live on our neighbouring planet – and where to find it. For instance, if the sun and oxygen-starved bugs in the mine get their energy from iron and sulphur, the hunt could focus on places with these elements. If there is life on Mars, scientists will want to know its origins. One possibility is that life on Earth started on Mars and was carried here by microbes buried deep inside a meteorite.

Boulby Mine is located just south-east of the village of Boulby, on the north-east coast of the North York Moors in Redcar . Professor Cockell said: ‘There is absolutely no evidence for it but as a highly exploratory thought, you could go to Mars and look for Martian life and find that we have been Martians all along.’ If the bacteria at Boulby can survive the levels of radiation bugs would be exposed to travelling through space, the theory would seem more credible. The mine, which has over 500 miles of tunnels under Yorkshire and Cleveland and extends seven miles under the sea, is also being used to test scientific instruments which are bound for Mars. The technology could be adapted to improve detection and safety in mines. Other projects at the Boulby Underground Laboratory include the search for dark matter, the invisible ‘glue’ that holds the universe together.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If you think seeing a rocket launch from Earth is impressive, then take a look at these onboard views from Soyuz Flight VS07. The Arianespace rocket, which deployed Sentinel-1A to into orbit, provided the world with a front-row seat in space last week. Recorded last week during its 23-minute mission from French Guiana - an overseas region of France on the South American coast - multiple cameras covered the action from final countdown to separation of the mission’s payload. Scroll down for video... Highlights of the launch include the Soyuz first stage separation, the fairing separation - the nose cone that protects the rocket - and ejection of the rocket’s rear section. The video begins with the pre-launch steps as seen from two cameras - mounted on opposite sides of the medium-lift launcher. As the rocket emerges from the clouds and through the planet’s atmosphere, the Soyuz’s first stage boosters are ejected and make a fiery fall to Earth. Liftoff: The Arianespace rocket, which deployed Sentinel-1A to into orbit, provided the world with a front-row seat in space. It is pictured here on the launch pad in from the Spaceport in French Guiana . Up and away: As seen by two downward-looking cameras on opposite sides of Soyuz, the launcher begins its ascent through the clouds and away from Earth's atmosphere . Sentinel-1 is a polar-orbiting, all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services. The first Sentinel-1 satellite was launched on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana on 3 April 2014. The satellite will form the core of Europe’s Copernicus environmental monitoring network. Copernicus will provide operational . information on the world’s land surfaces, oceans and atmosphere to . support environmental and security policy making. After a 617 second burn, Sentinel-1A was separated at around 434 miles (700km) above the Earth to begin its life in orbit. The satellite’s solar panels and antenna were then deployed in a complex sequence that took around 11 hours. Flight VS07 was Arianespace’s seventh mission from French Guiana, and its Sentinel-1A passenger will form the core of Europe’s Copernicus environmental monitoring network. Copernicus will provide data on the world’s land surfaces, oceans and atmosphere to support environmental and security policy decisions in Europe. ‘The launch of the first Sentinel-1 satellite marks a change in philosophy for our Earth observation programmes,’ said Volker Liebig, Esa’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes. ‘In meteorology, satellites have been providing reliable data for weather forecasts for over 35 years. ‘With the Copernicus programme, we will now have a similar information source for environmental services as well as for applications in the security and disaster management domain.’ Ejection: A payload fairing - the nose cone used to protect a spacecraft - is separated from the rocket .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . These days the perfect pint comes in many forms - beers are flavoured with citrus fruits, jalapeno and even bacon. But now there is a brew made from fossils and it is said to taste 'sweet and untamed'. The founder of a palaeontology and geology organisation set out to find an untapped strain of yeast to make his strange brew in a bid to sneak science into drinks. An ancient brew: Bone Dusters Paleo Ale is made from bacteria discovered on a whale fossil (pictured). Two scientists looking for an ancient yeast sample from which to make their brew, discovered a new subspecies and plan on using different fossils to make more palaeontology-themed beers . The creation is called Bone Dusters Paleo Ale and it is said to taste sweet and fairly much like Belgium beer. Jason Osborne, of Paleo Quest, worked with a brewing scientist called Jason Akerboom from the Lost Rhino Brewing Company to create his unusual tipple, which includes yeast found on a 35-million-year-old whale fossil. The pair had worked before at a biomedical research centre in Ashburn, Virginia. Yeast, which is responsible for converting sugar to alcohol, is found in many places and using swabs and petri dishes, the duo discovered that it is found on the surface of fossils, Scientific American reported. Yummy: The scientific beer-brewing duo had ambitiously hoped that the wild yeast was a completely new strain, but instead of a new species, they captured a previously-unknown subspecies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pictured), which is well known to breweries and wineries . Mr Akerboom originally planned on extracting ancient yeast samples from inside pieces of amber, which has already been attempted by another brewery in California. But after discarding the Jurassic Park-inspired idea, the pair visited Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons, Maryland, to swab and collect dirt from fossils, according to Northern Virginia Magazine. They collected around 20 samples in total but were initially disappointed because ‘the samples were almost 100 per cent bacteria,’ but then they noticed that one containing cells from the extinct whale bones, was fermenting. They had ambitiously hoped that the wild yeast was a completely new strain, but instead of a new species, they captured a previously-unknown subspecies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is well known to breweries and wineries. Inspired: Jason Akerboom from the Lost Rhino Brewing Company originally planned on extracting ancient yeast samples from inside pieces of amber, which has already been attempted by another brewery in California. But they discarded the Jurassic Park-inspired idea (pictured) in favour of swabbing fossils . The new variant is called Saccharomyces cerevisiae var protocetus after the protocetid whale fossil from which they took the swabs. The duo fed the yeast with wort from the brewery’s ‘Faceplant IPA’ recipe and let the mixture ferment for a few weeks. Mr Akerboom told MailOnline: 'We did two test batches with the yeast I isolated from the fossil bone from the Calvert Museum and we are going to make a big batch on the April 17. The brewery in Ashburn, will be serving Bone Dusters Paleo Ale in their tasting room. 'It will also be served in Washington DC and in northern Virginia, at our normal outlets - local restaurants and bars,' he said. 'The yeast seems quite wild and untamed, and the flavour is very Belgianesque.' A portion of the profits from the venture are being donated to a fund that gives science equipment to underprivileged schools. The pair hope to collect wild yeast from south eastern Virginia’s Great Dismal Swamp and come up with more palaeontology-themes beers.","The brew is called Bone Dusters Paleo Ale and it is said to taste sweet and 'very Belgianesque' and will be served in selected bars in Virginia .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A carer was caught on camera stealing money from a trusting dementia sufferer who hid hundreds of pounds around her home. Janet Maddocks was caught red-handed after the victim's suspicious relatives filled her home with secret cameras. They then watched 57-year-old Maddocks taking money from the 73-year-old woman's handbag in the kitchen, before combing through her bedroom the following day. The family, who had streamed the camera footage to a laptop computer, then passed the CCTV tape to police. Caught on film: Janet Maddocks was prosecuted after the victim's suspicious relatives filled her home with secret cameras, including here when she rifled through the victim's handbag . Last month Maddocks, who had been hired through a private agency, was sentenced to 10 months in prison after she admitted two counts of theft, owning up to taking £30 from her charge. Callous: Maddocks would attend the woman's home to help with her meals and medication, but also searched her house for cash . The daughter of the victim, who has not been named, said that the family could not believe what they were seeing as they viewed the video footage. 'We were so angry that she was taking advantage of our mother. We felt completely numb by her actions, which have caused so much distress,' she told the Sunday Mirror. Maddocks, of Marple, near Stockport, had been one of several carers who would attend the woman's home to help with her meals and medication. The daughter said that the woman, who was often confused due to her dementia, would often leave money hidden around the house, drawing out £200 or £300 a week. 'But over a number of months we noticed that the money wasn’t in the usual places and one week there was only £8 left. I knew something was definitely wrong,' she said. The suspicious family then decided to install hidden cameras to pinpoint who had been taking the money, and a few weeks after setting up the CCTV network spotted Maddocks behaving suspiciously. Watching on the laptop, they saw her rummaging through coats, bags and pillowcases - all spots where the woman would leave her money. The daughter said Maddocks had appeared to be putting things into her pocket, although she initially did not believe that she was stealing due to Maddocks's role as a carer. Security: The victim's family had cameras all over the property, which showed Maddocks stealing in one room (top left) while the dementia sufferer was in another room (top right). This image is taken from the family's computer screen . However, she said that in another clip she saw Maddocks put her hand into a handbag, take out some money and put it under her bra strap while the grandmother was out of the room. Following her arrest, Maddocks initially denied stealing from her charge, but later admitted the thefts on October 8 and 9 last year when she was confronted with film evidence. The daughter said that Maddocks had admitted taking £30, although they believed that a lot more money had vanished. She added that she has not told her mother, but that she was aware that something was wrong. Maddocks pleaded guilty to two counts of theft at Stockport Magistrates' Court in December, and was given two five-month sentences to run consecutively. Detective Inspector Matt Hope, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was a sickening abuse of trust and the actions of Maddocks have had a tremendous impact on the victim and her family.'","Carer Janet Maddocks, 57,  was caught red-handed on CCTV footage .

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 06:41 EST, 16 December 2011 . The eBook price of Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs - Amazon's number-one bestseller this year - is higher than the paper edition on Amazon.com, after a deal between publishers to prevent eBook companies discounting without their permission . It's bad news for anyone who has eBook readers such as Amazon's Kindle, Kobo's readers, or Barnes and Noble's Nook sitting under the Christmas tree. An agreement between six major publishers has seen prices rocket for many books worldwide - some of which are more expensive than the paper version. The agreement includes major publishing houses such as HarperCollins and Penguin. The agreement reportedly forbids retailers from discounting eBooks without a publisher's permission. It's seen a huge surge in 'self-published' books as users of eBook readers turn to cheaper authors to escape rising prices. In the early days of eBooks, Amazon drove sales of its Kindle eBook reader by discounting heavily - leading readers to see eBooks as a 'bargain' version of their favourite reads. But that seems no longer to be the case. Consumers are increasingly angry at being charged more for an electronic version that they can't easily lend out or give away - even 'lending' schemes for eBooks tend to be tightly controlled and difficult to use. The Kindle edition of this year's eBook bestseller, Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs is $20.76 - the paper one is $17.49. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ken Follet's novel Fall of Giants was more expensive in an eBook version than it is in a physical version in the U.S. - $18.99 as opposed to $16.50 for the paper edition. The price for the Kindle Edition has now abruptly fallen to $7.49 - perhaps an indication of the fact that publishers and retailers are sensitive about the pricing issue. It could be suicidal for the publishing industry - of the top-selling novels on Kindle today, many of the top five are independently published novels such as Blood Guilt by Ben Cheetham ($1.54) and  Ruby Lake by Sherrill Willis ($4.47). Many of the top 20 are not from major publishers, or available in paperback editions - and books from top publishers are being driven down the charts. In Europe, the book industry is already under investigation for possible price-fixing - allegedly in collusion with Apple. The new Amazon Kindle Fire tablet is the latest in Amazon's line of eBook readers - but users may turn to other forms of entertainment after an agreement that has seen prices for electronic books rocket in both the UK and the U.S. Steve Jobs reportedly did not want Apple's iBook store to compete with Amazon's cheap prices, and helped brokered the deal between publishers. The European Commission is . investigating claims that Apple and the five publishing houses worked . together to keep eBook prices artificially high. It . is also suggested that the arrangement killed competition by ensuring . that Apple’s rivals, such as Amazon and Kobo, could not undercut its . prices. The boom in eBooks . is a goldmine for  publishers and technology firms, because the costs . are a fraction of those involved in printing, transporting and selling . books. Despite the savings, the prices of blockbuster eBooks are often higher than the real thing. For . example, Apple’s iTunes store is offering an eBook download of the . biography of its founder Steve Jobs for £12.99. Amazon charges just . £11.97 for the hardback version. Stephen King’s novel 11.22.63 is available for £9.99 as an Apple eBook, compared with £8.20 for the real book from Amazon. In The UK, the . Government is partly to blame for the high cost. The Treasury has . sanctioned an anomaly in the tax system which means VAT is charged at 20 . per cent on eBooks, but is not applied to real books. The European Commission carried out secret raids on publishers’ offices in March in an attempt to gather evidence. Yesterday . it announced a formal investigation to discover whether international . publishers HarperCollins, Penguin, Hachette Livre, Simon & Schuster . and Germany’s Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck have ‘engaged in . anti-competitive practices’. Officials . said: ‘The commission will in particular investigate whether these . publishing groups and Apple have engaged in illegal agreements or . practices that would have the object or the effect of restricting . competition.’ A parallel . lawsuit has been launched against publishers and Apple in the U.S. It . suggests eBook prices have been inflated by 33 to 50 per cent as a . result of collusion. A Pearson spokesman said: ‘Pearson does not believe it has breached any laws.’ Apple declined to comment.","Amazon's 'top selling' list floods with cheap, self-published authors as publishers hike prices .

Now he's negotiating a deal with FIFA to sell fish suppers at Arena da Amazonia in Manaus, and wants to serve them up in special cones in team colours priced at £2. He already has queues of tourists and locals outside his restaurant wanting to try the dish. Mario – known locally as Super Mario - said: ‘The people who are coming here will love them.‘The fish and chips are a bit different from the ones in Britain but they are becoming just as popular. ‘We have had lines of people out of the door coming to try them in our restaurant and we expect there will be 4,000 fans eating them at every game.’ Dish with a twist: The Brazilian chef puts his own spin on the classic English fish and chips . Outlet: Mario Freitas Do Valle is in talks to serve fish and chips in his Brazil restaurant . Instead of cod or haddock, Mario uses tabaqui, an Amazonian fish, and cuts it in half, then grills it before deep-frying it in batter. He already sells eight tonnes a month through different outlets in Brazil. Mario, the first Brazilian member of the National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF) said: 'We didn't have fish and chips in Brazil. ‘In Manaus, restaurants selling fish were either really expensive or really cheap - and not safe to eat in. Fan: Mario Freitas Do Valle said he fell in love with Britain's favourite meal on a visit to Aberdeen in 2001 . ‘But I remembered Aberdeen and the fish and chips I had and thought it would work.‘It has really taken off.’ England boss Roy Hodgson gave the fish and chips the thumbs up when he visited Mario's restaurant last month with Alex Ellis, the UK's Ambassador to Brazil. Mario said: ‘They came to see the stadium and how everything was going for the World Cup and they tried them. ‘Roy Hodgson said they were a bit different from the ones in Croydon, where he grew up, because they had less vinegar and didn't come with mushy peas. But he really liked them. ‘I think the England fans will be in for an amazing surprise when they come here for the first match against Italy on June 13. ‘I hope they win the match but it is our home tournament and everyone is football mad in Brazil and we won't accept second place.’ Andrew Crook, NFFF secretary joked: ‘It will probably take more than good fish and chips for England to win.’","Chef wants to sell traditional English dish in team-coloured cones .

"By . Becky Barrow . Action: More men should work part-time to end the stigma that blights many women's careers when they switch from full-time work, an academic claims . More men should work part-time to end the stigma that blights many women’s careers when they switch from full-time work, a leading academic will say today. Dr Tom Schuller slammed a culture in which too many able and well-qualified women are ‘under-promoted and under-paid’ in their jobs. He has coined the term the ‘Paula Principle’, which states that most women work at below their level of competence - that is, doing less than they are really capable of doing. It is the opposite of the ‘Peter Principle’, dreamed up in the Sixties, which states that men are typically ‘promoted to their level of incompetence’. That is, a man continues to be promoted until he is doing a job poorly enough not to be promoted any further. Dr Schuller, a visiting professor at the University of London’s Institute of Education, said: ‘Many women are consequently working below their true level of competence.’ He said there are many reasons for this widespread problem, which affects women in many different types of careers in Britain. While some women choose not to be promoted, others are held back by ‘covert or overt’ discrimination, a lack of self-confidence and insufficient contact with a senior manager who can mentor them. Another major hurdle for women is their caring responsibility, not just for their young children but also for their elderly parents who can need as much help as a newborn baby. Around 2.2 million men work part-time in Britain, according to the Office for National Statistics. They are over-shadowed by an army of six million women working part-time. Concern: Dr Tom Schuller, left, says too many females are 'under-promoted' and 'under-paid', while Timewise founder Karen Mattison ,right, has urged businesswomen who work part-time to speak openly about their jobs . Dr Schuller said there is a widely-held view that anyone working part-time is ‘not serious about their work and not serious about their career.’ He warned: ‘This will only really change when more men work part-time or do not stick to the conventional model of a continuous, full-time career.’ Dr Schuller, who is speaking on the issue in London tonight, said: ‘Men’s career patterns will need to change too. Too much of the emphasis on gender equality involves helping women to work more like men. ‘It is time to enable more men to work in ways that are currently the preserve of women. ‘Men need to stop thinking about a career only in terms of continuously moving up a vertical ladder and think positively about lateral moves, perhaps working part-time. ‘Above all, choosing work which uses their competences but does not go beyond them.’ Widespread problem: Dr Schuller believes many women are working 'below their true level of competence' It comes after a report, published last . year, found the majority of mothers have never been promoted since they . switched to working part-time after the birth of their children. The report highlights the career crisis . facing mothers around Britain, many of whom say they feel ‘trapped’ in . jobs for which they are ‘over-qualified’ and ‘over-skilled’. Around 1,000 people who work 30 hours or less a week - eight in ten of them women - were asked: ‘Since working part-time, have you been promoted?’ In a sign of the dead end which part-time work represents for many women, a staggering 73 per cent said they had never been promoted since switching to a part-time job. The independent research, commissioned by the flexible working champions The Timewise Foundation, only looked at part-time workers with well-paid jobs which pay up to £100,000 a year on a full-time equivalent basis. Karen Mattison, founder of Timewise and a mother of three boys herself, said: ‘Millions are hitting a wall at key points in their careers when they want to progress or move to a new role. ‘Doing so, without losing their flexibility, presents a real challenge, leaving many feeling trapped in their current jobs.’ She urged high-powered women who work part-time to speak more openly about their jobs, rather than keeping ‘under the radar’, and for firms to advertise if a job could offer flexible hours. She said: ‘Many women worry about being seen as less ambitious and less committed if they reveal they work part-time. The word ‘part-time’ is seen negatively. ‘It is seen as a different track that you are going on - the ‘mummy track’.’ Mrs Mattison said one mother was told to leave her cardigan on her chair on her day off to pretend she was working. A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: ‘It is simply bad business sense to overlook women’s skills in the workplace. ‘The key to ensuring we can continue the economic recovery is ensuring everyone can contribute fully at work, and that means ensuring the workplace is modernised to enable that.’","Dr Tom Schuller has slammed culture in which women are 'under-promoted'

"By . Simon Walters And Brendan Carlin . Rejuvenated Chancellor George Osborne is secretly plotting to run for the Tory leadership when David Cameron steps down, senior Conservatives claimed last night. And Mr Osborne’s allies are reportedly making plans to head off a challenge from the man he sees as his main rival, Boris Johnson. The Mail on Sunday has been told that hostilities have broken out between the two camps, the so-called ‘Friends of George’ (FOGs) and the ‘Friends of Boris’ (FOBs). Going head to head: George Osborne is secretly plotting to run for the Tory Leadership and Boris Johnson is seen as his biggest rival . Mr Osborne’s FOGs have accused Mr Johnson’s FOBs of making fresh attempts to find a Tory MP willing to give up his or her Parliamentary seat so that Mr Johnson could make an instant Commons comeback if the PM resigned. And the FOBs have accused the FOGs of lining up Education Secretary Michael Gove as Mr Osborne’s ‘running mate’ and having him undermine Mr Johnson by claiming the London mayor is ‘not serious enough’ to run the country. Sources close to the Chancellor say his ambitions have been revived by the economic recovery. And he may soon receive another boost with speculation that the influential Asian Voice newspaper will name him Politician Of The Year. Though there is no indication that Mr . Osborne would directly challenge Mr Cameron, friends say he is ready to . stand as the ‘heir to Dave’ in either of two scenarios: . Silver-tongued Michael Gove is one of the few willing to take on Mr Johnson in verbal jousts . If Mr Cameron loses next year’s Election and is forced to resign as the Tories go into opposition. Or, if Mr Cameron wins and, as many expect, stands down after holding a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU in 2017. When Mr Osborne – at 42, five years younger than Mr Cameron – performed confidently in the Commons last week, the benches behind him were packed with a growing army of Conservative backbenchers keen to join the FOGs. Silver-tongued Mr Gove is their uncrowned leader, seen as the ideal partner and one of the few willing to take on Mr Johnson in verbal jousts. His being the adopted son of a Scots fishmonger makes him a foil both to baronet’s son Mr Osborne and to Mr Johnson, who, like Mr Cameron, was a member of Oxford University’s notorious and privileged Bullingdon Club. Other members of the FOGs include Deputy Chief Whip Greg Hands, Business Minister Matthew Hancock and Tory MPs Harriett Baldwin and Nadhim Zahawi. Another FOG said: ‘George will never betray Cameron, but if the economy goes on improving he is the ideal continuity candidate. Boris and Theresa May are the two who could stop him, and Boris is the big danger. 'We know Boris is looking for a seat.’ Mr Johnson is believed to have ruled out returning to the Commons before next year’s Election. He has discussed the possibility of Richmond MP Zac Goldsmith quitting his seat so he can take it over in a by-election. But last night, another prominent FOB said: ‘Osborne effectively controls the Whips Office, which decides when a by-election takes place. His people will try to use that to stop Boris getting back into the House quickly so Osborne can stitch up the leadership. ‘But a Tory leadership contest without Boris will be worse than Hamlet without the prince.’","Chancellor 'secretly plotting to run for the Tory leadership'

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . Families should fix their mortgages to protect themselves against ‘a real risk of exposure to rising interest rates’, a senior member of the Bank of England said yesterday. Mortgages have never been cheaper since the Bank cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent nearly five years ago, the lowest level in its 320-year history. But the comments, from  Richard Sharp, will fuel families’ fears that rates are set to rise sooner rather than later. Mortgages have never been cheaper since the Bank of England cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent nearly five years ago, the lowest level in its 320-year history . They came ahead of a survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors saying house prices are rising at an ‘unsustainable’ rate and are a nightmare for people trying to get on to the property ladder or to climb up it. It says the problem is fuelled by the toxic combination of rising numbers of people wanting to buy but a chronic lack of homes for sale. While many parts of the country are not affected, the problem exists in London, many parts of the South East as well as various ‘micro markets’ – particular  villages or neighbourhoods – around the country. Grilled by the Treasury select committee yesterday, Mr Sharp, who sits on the Bank’s financial policy committee, was asked about fixed-rate mortgages. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors say house prices are rising at an 'unsustainable' rate and are a nightmare for people trying to get on to the property ladder . He said that, for ‘practical . purposes’, interest rates in Britain are ‘close to zero’. Mr Sharp . added: ‘So you have also got to make a judgment about the future. Certainly my judgment would be this would be a good time [to fix your . mortgage].’ Mr Sharp, who worked at Goldman Sachs for 23 years, does not sit on the Bank’s interest rate setting committee. His advice comes as the Council of . Mortgage Lenders said yesterday nearly nine in ten families who are . taking out a mortgage are choosing a fixed-rate loan, the highest number . since records began. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has urged mortgage lenders and borrowers to accept that interest rates could be much higher than the current level in years to come . One . expert said yesterday homeowners must accept that the Bank’s base rate . is ‘only going to go up.’ At present, the financial markets expect the . Bank of England’s base rate will be 3 per cent in five years’ time. In November, 88 per cent of  people . who took out a new mortgage or remortgaged their  existing deal opted . for a fixed-rate loan, according to the CML. A fixed-rate loan means they pay a fixed interest rate for a set period of time, such as a five-year deal charging a rate of 3 per cent. The CML said fixed rate mortgages have a ‘strong attraction’, particularly as they are so much cheaper than other types of deals at the moment. At the same  committee hearing, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, also urged mortgage lenders and borrowers to accept that interest rates could be much higher than the current level in years to come. He said: ‘We need to ensure that lenders and households consider their ability to service their mortgages and retain their homes in more adverse, higher interest rate, scenarios.’ Mr Carney also said house prices are likely to continue rising robustly until the middle of next year as the recovery picks up pace. He told MPs: ‘Our general expectation . has been for a continuation of current momentum – house price momentum, . mortgage activity, credit growth momentum – into 2014, before . decelerating around the middle of 2015 towards 2016.’ Across the board: House prices are rising in all regions but there is a big gap in the pace of increase . Outpaced: House prices paid by first-time buyers are rising faster than the wider market and those paid by home movers, the ONS data shows. But RICS warned of ‘a growing risk of another house price boom’ and said urgent action is needed by the Bank of England. The latest official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show house prices in London are rising at 11.6 per cent a year and 4.5 per cent in the South East. The RICS report, published today, said demand is being fuelled by the cheapest mortgages in history, the Government’s Help to Buy scheme as well as the increased availability of loans for people with deposits of less than ten per cent. Official figures reveal house prices are nearly 80 per cent higher in London than they are in the rest of the country.","Bank of England cut base rate to 0.5% nearly five years ago .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . If you have skydived and bungee-jumped from the highest bridges but still yearn for excitement, a holiday based on dangerous driving may be right up your street. One company is now offering car fanatics the chance to take on the world’s most dangerous roads in an adrenalin-fuelled two-day break, which it warns is not for those of a ‘nervous disposition’. A holiday-maker could choose to drive a Bugatti Veyron down the ‘Highway to Hell’ in the U.S. or negotiate Russia’s freezing winters and treacherous dirt roads on the Siberian Highway in a trusty Toyota Corolla – but the adventure has a hefty price tag. Scroll down for interactive map and video . For £200,000 you could drive a Bugatti Veyron down the 'Highway to Hell' in the U.S. try the terrifying Naga Parbat Pass in Pakistan (pictured) or negotiate Russia's freezing winters and treacherous dirt roads on the Siberian Highway in a trusty Toyota Corolla or a sleek supercar . The holiday lasts for two days and costs around £200,000. It is being offered by buyagift.com in response to demand from people who read MailOnline's feature about the world's 22 most dangerous roads. The tracks include the 'Highway to Hell' in the U.S. and the Siberian Highway in Russia. Drivers can choose a car to drive on their chosen journey, including a  trusty Toyota Corolla or a Bugatti Veyron. On the first day the driver will meet their instructor and see the track, before having some training. On the second day they take on the course themselves - along with an instructor - in a dual-controlled car of their choice. The two day adventure includes flights in a private jet and five star accommodation. The trip is bespoke - so its price and content is flexible - but the company warned that people will not be able to speed down a perilous cliff-top road in a supercar. It is not apparent how life insurance will be fixed but the company is confident it will make it happen. For £200,000, drivers can pick a car to borrow and choose one dangerous road from a list of the world’s 22 most perilous. The two-day adventure includes private flights and luxury accommodation as well as an experienced instructor to guide drivers around the tricky courses. Drivers choosing their journey - where one false move could be their last - can select a route from a cliff-top single track road with deadly drops in Pakistan to highways renowned for their bandits in Mexico. In fact, they can choose any of the locations shown on an interactive map, which includes 22 routes with ‘fear factor’ ratings and perilous facts about them. The map, which was created by Hertfordshire-based Driving Experiences and was featured on MailOnline earlier this year, led to the creation of the lavish mini-break. There is one full day of driving with an instructor in a dual-controlled car included in the trip. Included in the holiday is one full day of driving with an experienced instructor that will teach the driver to handle a car on roads such as the Trans Siberian Highway in Russia, which might look fairly safe, but has loose and icy surfaces . The brochure says: ‘If you’re looking to . travel further afield, look no further than the ‘Road of Death’ in . Bolivia. This incredible drive is suitable for only the most fearless . explorers – with narrow tracks winding round steep mountains and sheer . 1,000 metre drops, this location is considered among the most hazardous . in South America – luckily, you’ll be partnered with experienced . instructor, in case things get hairy!’ As the trip is completely bespoke, in theory a driver could choose a supercar to weave around cliff-top roads or on lethal gravelly pathways, but Buyagift.com said it might prove frustrating in some circumstances as people will not be allowed to drive recklessly and endanger their lives, so a more practical vehicle might prove more comfortable. There is a wide range of vehicles to choose from, from souped-up Nissan Skylines and reliable saloons, right up to supercars such as the Bugatti Veyron Supersport, which is the fastest street-legal production car in the world. ‘People will be driving in very controlled circumstances. There’s no way they will put their foot down. 'It’s about taking in the journey and watching the mayhem,’ a company spokesman told MailOnline. Drivers can choose from a wide range of vehicles in which to take on the dangerous roads, from souped-up Nissan Skylines and reliable saloons, right the way to top-of-the-range supercars like the Bugatti Veyron (pictured) - the fastest street-legal production car in the world . A spokesman from Buyagift.com said that anyone who goes on the holiday will be driving 'in very controlled circumstances' so they cannot race a Ferrari down the Guoliang Tunnel road, (pictured) for example. 'There's no way they will put their foot down. It's about taking in the journey and watching the mayhem,' he said . To begin the adventure, once a driver has boarded a private plane and touched down in their chosen location, they will meet their instructor and run through a full professional safety briefing. They will stay the night at a five-star hotel and then being let loose on the road the following day. ‘You’ll spend an exhilarating day behind the wheel, facing up to the tightest of corners and terrifying sheer drops, with severe weather conditions and battered roads providing an injection of adrenaline to this white-knuckle ride of an experience,’ the company said. It is not absolutely clear how insurance will be arranged, but Buyagift said that the trip is completely flexible and will be built to suit an individual's needs. The price could also be altered depending on the location of the chosen journey. The firm has received a number of enquiries from customers about the prospect of a trip, but no-one has snapped up the holiday yet. They warned that the short break is not suitable for anyone with a heart condition or nervous disposition and that drivers must have a valid driving license and passport. The interactive map, by Hertfordshire- based Driving Experiences is based upon the World Health Organisation's (WHO) global status report of 2013 on road safety and users can click on 22 locations to view the most dangerous roads. The popularity of the map inspired the adventurous £200,000 mini break . The holiday was created about after MailOnline featured a map of the world’s 22 most dangerous drives and many people expressed a wish to try their driving skills on some of the terrifying journeys. According to the map, the . North Yungas road in Bolivia is widely considered to be the world’s . most dangerous route and has even earned the nickname of ‘death road’. The . 40-mile stretch of single-track road meanders round cliffs and there . are no barriers to protect drivers going in opposite directions from . deadly drops. The interactive map is based upon the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) global status report of 2013 on road safety as well as other data sets. &lt;br/&gt; . Scotland's A726, otherwise known as the old A74 has a fear factor of four out of 10 n the map, which explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions. Buyagift.com said that is a UK customer chose the route for their 2-day holiday, it would not cost £200,000 . Each road is rated according to its ‘fear factor’ with the North Yungas scoring 10 out of 10, while Pakistan’s picturesque-sounding Fairy Meadows Road was rated the second scariest because of its ‘treacherous high altitude, unstable and narrow mountain roads.’ Factors such as altitude, safety precautions in place including barriers, local driving techniques, the condition of vehicles, road surfaces, annual road deaths per country and weather conditions were all taken into account when producing the map and surprisingly such dangers seem to appeal to many adventurers. Users can click on red explanation marks on the map to explore different deadly routes, where there are also facts about countries’ road rules and scary statistics. From cliff-top single track roads with deadly drops to highways rebound for their bandits, drivers could choose to take on the North Yungas road in Bolivia (pictured) which is widely considered to be the world's most dangerous route . If a driver chose the Trans Siberian Highway, pictured, they could potentially face the rain and uneven surfaces in a sports car - but the company offering the holiday warned that they would have to drive slowly and a vehicle with chunkier tyres would offer a more comfortable ride . The world’s longest road – the Pan-American Highway, which begins in Alaska and passes through countries in South America - is included on the map because of its high temperatures, landslides, impassable sections in wet weather and even livestock in the road. But closer to home, Scotland’s A726, otherwise known as the old A74, has a fear factor of four out of 10. The map explains that the seven kilometre stretch of road is renowned for head-on collisions and has racked up nearly 40 fatalities between 2000 and 2005. A high proportion of the accidents involved pedestrians or cyclists, while one fifth saw vehicles leave the road, which is exceptionally twisty for a dual carriageway and is also busy. Norway’s Trollstigen or ‘troll ladder’ comprises many hairpin bends and sheer drops which get particularly perilous in icy conditions, while Brazil’s Rodovia da Morte puts drivers at risk in a very different way. The ‘highway of death’ is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and is poorly maintained, with gangs and bandits along its long stretch. The map, which lists roads all over the world, was created to highlight the dangers of driving, as although road safety is improving, over 1.2million people are killed in road accidents each year and a further 20 to 50million are injured.

She said that . the only reason her sons were targeted was because they were Muslim, . adding that she saw footage of Tamerlan being killed 'really cruelly.' U.S. authorities are on their way to speak with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva in the aftermath of the bombings. Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store . ABC News reported on Tuesday that Mrs Tsarnaev failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest. If she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she . could be arrested on an outstanding warrant. Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothes from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store. She was charged with two . counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after . allegedly swiping the merchandise from the retailer's Natick, . Mass. location in June 2012. She was due in court on October 25 for a hearing in the case, but never showed up. The Lord & Taylor location is . not the same as the one on Boylston Street in Boston, where a . surveillance camera captured what police say is her younger son . dropping a pressure cooker bomb that was hidden inside a backpack. The family's lawyer Heda Saratova, asked for the family to be left alone and said that the parents had just seen . pictures of the body of their elder son and were not up to . speaking with anyone. Grief: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is pictured outside her home in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province in Russia's Caucasus . 'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video and cries.' The images and video she is referring to were taken by a resident of Watertown, Mass. and posted on his blog. They appear to show two men taking shelter behind a vehicle and taking aim at police . officers. The men are then . seen hauling out a pressure cooker bomb from a car and detonating it, filling the . street with smoke. The photographs, taken on the . eyewitness's phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the . scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that . left one man dead. Authorities say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ended the firefight when he jumped in the car . - which the suspects had allegedly stolen earlier - and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he also ran over his brother Tamerlan. Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks. 'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother,' she said. She added to CNN that she had spoken . to Tamerlan after the bombings and he told her he missed her and loved . her, and she said her 'loving' son even inquired about the cat. Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, . Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying . that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes. The statement read: 'Our heart goes . out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many . innocent people hurt after such a callous act. Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . 'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused. 'We . don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation . and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during . this difficult time.' The mother is from Dagestan, while the suspects' father is from neighboring Chechnya.

"By . James Chapman . Updated: . 06:56 EST, 27 February 2012 . Diesel soared to a record £1.50 a litre yesterday as Chancellor George Osborne made it clear that he cannot afford fuel duty cuts in next month's Budget because the country has 'run out of money'. The price was spotted at a Shell garage on the M6 near Coventry, with average diesel prices now standing at 143.61p and petrol at 135.39p. The cost of filling up has almost doubled since the fuel protests of 2000, and experts predict further increases because of instability in the Middle East. Soaring prices: Fuel prices pass the 150 mark at Corley Service Station, M6 near Coventry . Slashing prices: The discount offered by the supermarket giant is the biggest ever in the UK and will be welcome news for drivers . Campaign group Fair Fuel UK said it . planned a mass lobby of Parliament to combat what it calls an 'absolute . crisis' hitting families and businesses. But Mr Osborne signalled he will not . be able to repeat fuel-duty freezes or cuts, having already spent . billions to keep fuel duty 6p lower than it would otherwise have been. The Chancellor said the 'British . government has run out of money' and that 'all the money was spent in . the good years'. The days of 'unlimited' resources for the state were . gone for good. Despite forecasts that he will beat . his deficit reduction targets for this year by as much as £10billion, . the Chancellor said there was no room for tax cuts in next month's . Budget. Tory MPs are urging Mr Osborne to meet . the party's pre-election pledge to introduce a 'fair fuel stabiliser' to help cash-strapped motorists. Instead of implementing real reform of . the tax system – so fuel duty goes down when oil prices go up – the . Chancellor slapped a supplementary tax charge on oil and gas production . in the North Sea to help keep prices at the pumps lower. Before the election, the Tories hailed . the idea of a stabiliser as a classic example of 'fixing the roof when . the sun is shining', which would mean the Government saved money in the . good times to help in the bad. Currently, fuel duty is planned to . rise every year by at least the rate of inflation, regardless of what . happens to the price of oil. In addition, the other tax levied on fuel, . VAT, is charged at the standard rate. So as the price of fuel rises, the . amount of VAT charged also rises. Mr Osborne said yesterday he had already taken expensive steps to ease the pain of rising petrol and diesel prices. 'Fuel duty is 6p lower than it . otherwise would have been,' he said. 'I have shown willingness to . respond to international fuel increases and have taken action this year . to tackle fuel duty rises, which were planned by the last Labour . government.' It is estimated that the price of . diesel and petrol at the pump has risen by 25 per cent and 20 per cent . respectively over the past two years. Mr Osborne cut fuel duty by 1p a litre . in last year's Budget and announced in his autumn statement that a . scheduled 3p rise would be postponed until August. He said his changes . will save each family £144 a year. Road rage: Soaring oil prices and a planned rise in fuel duty could lead to protests like the 'Go Slow' demonstration of last May . The rising cost of crude oil is the key factor behind the soaring price of petrol. The biggest influence on prices at present are: . The price of diesel in the UK rose to an all-time high this month as speculators drove up crude oil prices and refineries failed to keep up with British demand . A YouGov poll yesterday revealed that . 58 per cent of adults think they are spending more on fuel than a few . years ago. Campaign group Fair Fuel UK plans to confront MPs on March 7, . and is due to hold talks with Treasury Minister Chloe Smith tomorrow. Spokesman Peter Carroll said: 'This is . an absolute crisis. Enough is enough. The current fuel prices are . killing the economy and stunting growth. 'The Government has to cut fuel duty to create jobs and stimulate growth to start getting the deficit down.' Supermarket giant Morrisons has . prompted a price war by slashing 15p off a litre of petrol for anyone . spending £60 in its stores, the largest discount ever offered in the UK. John Woodcock, Labour transport . spokesman, said: 'George Osborne needs to take action in his Budget. A . temporary cut in VAT, which is part of Labour's five-point plan for jobs . and growth, would mean an immediate drop in fuel prices and make a real . difference to families.'","Diesel prices reach eye-watering 150.9p a litre at M6 service station .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Dozing off at inopportune moments can be at best embarrassing and at worst life-threatening. Now a group of students have come up with a device that tracks a person’s alertness over time and ‘nudges’ them when they are at risk of falling asleep - which could help reduce road accidents if it is worn by drivers. The gadget called Vigo, claims to be the first wearable device to quantify alertness and can send a vibration alert to keep someone awake, or give them recommendations about when to take a break. Scroll down for video . A group of students have come up with a device (pictured) that tracks a person's alertness over time and 'nudges' them when they are at risk of falling asleep - which could help reduce road accidents . Wear Vigo whenever you need to be alert for an extended amount of time - such as through a work meeting or when driving. Connect Vigo to your mobile device through Bluetooth. Customise when, and how, Vigo nudges you. Tag the event when you’re finished so you can look back on the data later to find patterns in your alertness. The personal device tracks patterns in blinks and body movements to alert the wearer of the gadget in realtime about when they are getting drowsy. The creators of the device believe it could be used to keep people awake during long work meetings and more importantly, on the road. Almost 20 per cent of accidents on major roads in the UK are sleep related, 40 per cent of which involve commercial vehicles, according to government statistics. Sleep-related accidents, which most often occur in the early hours and after lunch, are more likely than others to result in a fatality or serious injury, so any device that could help to keep people alert, could potentially save lives. ‘The idea is simple - although your brain has a tendency to trick you into thinking you’re mentally fit enough to keep pushing on with your daily business, your body can’t hide when you’re tired, said the creators of Vigo, from the University of Pennsylvania. ‘With an infrared sensor, an accelerometer, and a clever algorithm, Vigo knows you’re drowsy before you do.’ A life saver? The personal device tracks patterns in blinks and body movements to alert the wearer of the gadget in realtime about when they are getting drowsy . The average blink takes one fifth of a second but there is a lot of information packed into that small amount of time. Vigo examines 20 parameters in blinks and watches how the variables change. This data, when combined with information about the activity a person is undertaking and their head motion, allows the device to measure mental energy and come to a conclusion about when a person is at risk of falling asleep. The gadget allows people to decide when and how it nudges them when they have been ‘idle’ for too long. An app works with the device and displays important information about alertness using a traffic light system (with green for alert and red for drowsy) so that users can pick out patterns in their routine and make changes . A person can be alerted by a vibration, LED light or even a 'pump up' song to help them refocus. Vigo's creators suggest the deice could come in handy at university or work to keep people focused on a task at hand . The Vigo device comprises: . A person can be alerted by a vibration, LED light or even a ‘pump up’ song to help them refocus on a task. The gadget begins to log data about an individual’s alertness the moment they start wearing the device and doesn’t stop until it is taken off. An app works with the gadget and displays important information about alertness using a traffic light system (with green for alert and red for drowsy) so that users can pick out patterns in their routine and make changes. ‘Maybe you’re more drowsy on weekday afternoons, or maybe you’re in a better state in the evenings than mornings. Vigo helps you understand yourself better so you can plan your day accordingly,' its creators said. The device, which weighs just 20 grams, connects to an iPhone or Android smartphone that supports Bluetooth 4.0 and functions like an ordinary Bluetooth headset so it can be used to make phone calls too. Vigo examines 20 parameters in blinks and watches how the variables change. This data, when combined with information about the activity a person is undertaking and their head motion, allows the device to measure mental energy . The graduates, who created the algorithm and prototype of the device to keep them alert in lectures, have been building the device in Shenzhen, China over the past couple of months and are now raising money on Kickstarter to put the gadget into production. The gadget, which is available in black or white, is on sale on the crowd funding site for $79 (£48) - with an expected retail price of $119 (£73) - and so far the project has raised $27,654 of its $50,000 goal.","Vigo tracks a person’s alertness over time and ‘nudges’ them when they are at risk of falling asleep .

"Southampton-based suppliers Reef Eden International have found demand is high for the new tanks . The accessory has a  special system providing a circular current to allow the creatures to constantly float as they would in the sea . As well as making interesting pets, the moon jellyfish also create a 'living lava lamp' effect to jazz up home interiors . By . Lucy Waterlow . Jellyfish are becoming an unlikely new favourite pet in British homes after specialist fish tanks launched to house them have proved a sell out. MailOnline reported last month how a U.S. firm could ship the high-tech tanks to the UK - but now a supplier in Eastleigh, Southampton, have made it easier for British buyers to adopt the unusual creatures with the new Cubic Jellyfish Aquarium. Reef Eden International are distributing the novel tanks - which can house up to 12 non-stinging moon jellyfish - across the UK. And managing director Simon Garratt said demand has been so high they have already sold out and are struggling . to keep up with demand. Scroll down for video . Take them home: Moon jellyfish can now be kept as pets thanks to the development of new tanks . Accessorise: The tanks come with multi-coloured LED lights that can be altered to match the decoration of a room and create a living lava lamp effect . Mr Garratt explained how keeping jellyfish has pets has been made possible thanks to the accessory's special system that provides a circular current to allow the creatures to constantly float as they would in the sea. He said: 'Previously people couldn't keep them . because the aquariums weren't available, and they can't be kept in . normal fish tanks because jellyfish require a current to swim. Water flow: The £775 accessory has a special system that provides a circular current to allow the creatures to constantly float as they would in the sea . Unusual pets: Up to 12 moon jellyfish, which don't have stings, can be housed in the tanks and the water flow means they won't sink to the bottom or get stuck to the sides . 'If there is no current, the jellyfish would stick in the corners of the tank or settle on the bottom. 'The systems that were available before were one-offs for big aquariums. This meant it cost tens of thousands . of pounds for an organisation to have one made, but now we are . manufacturing 50 to 100 at a time, it has brought the cost down . massively.' However the tanks still don't come cheap as they cost £775 from aquarium shops while the moon jellyfish have to be purchased separately from special stockists at prices between £29.99-£39.99. 'Better than a sculpture': The creatures make an interesting addition to living or office space . In demand: Stockists Reef Eden have sold out of the tanks as people clamour to get them in their homes . Care: The jellyfish need to be fed once every one to two days with special food . As well as making interesting pets, jellyfish are being marketed as away to add decor to the home or office as the tank is illuminated by multicolour LED lights - giving the impression of 'a living lava lamp'. The company's website states that the 'illuminated aquatic artwork' of the jellyfish aquarium beats any expensive sculptures and paintings. Mr Garratt added: 'There are LED lights down the centre of the tank which can be set to different colours or go through the whole spectrum and light up the jellyfish like a living lava lamp. 'The look of the tank is very modern and works as a display and can appeal to a lot of people because it looks great and because it's low maintenance.' The jellyfish need to be fed once every one to two days with special food which can be placed through a section at the top of the tank.","Southampton-based suppliers Reef Eden International have found demand is high for the new tanks .

"By . James  Nye . George Harrison was worth more than $300 million when he died in 2001, but the music legend's 82-year-old sister Louise Harrison now struggles to get by - living in a pre-fabricated home in small-town near Branson, Missouri. Louise Harrison says she has been cut off from the family. While George left his widow Olivia and son Dhani the lavish Friar Park, a 120-room Victorian mansion in Henley-On-Thames just outside London, Louise is unable to support herself without working - managing a touring Beatles tribute band. However, displaying the quiet stoicism her family is famous for, Louise says she 'doesn't mind not living in a castle because she would rather be broke than live rich and heartless.' A long way from Beatlemania: The Branson, Missouri, property that Louise Harrison calls home. She has lived in America for more than 50 years and says she wants nothing from the family of her famous brother . Gifted a $2,000-a-month pension by her brother for tax reasons in 1980 to help her get by, Louise found herself unceremoniously cut off by her brother's estate almost a year to the day after he died of complications from lung cancer in November 2001. Louise, who lives alone, found this sum of money to be adequate for her lifestyle. She was not given a reason why the allowance was stopped by Olivia, 65, or Dhani, 35, but knows she would still be receiving the money if George was alive. She said: 'I don't care about the money, it's been over ten years and I haven't made any ripples.' Louise moved to the US more than 50 years ago, following her first husband, even before The Beatles themselves launched a British 'invasion' of America in 1964. About George's payments, Louise said: 'It was my pension from him - it was his intention to make it last my lifetime. He said, ""Given my financial situation, there is no reason on Earth why my sister should ever be in need"". 'But I was never concerned about the termination of the pension, I have found a way to make a living. 'I don't have any blame for anyone and I was brought up as a Harrison and to be self-reliant.' Louise relives the glory days of the Fab-Four's rise to fame with the Liverpool Legends, the tribute band she manages. Touring with them regularly, she does make appearances with the band and entertains the crowds after shows with her fond recollections of her brother and, of course, John, Paul and Ringo. Getting by with a little help from her friends: Louise Harrison, pictured left with George in 1962, and right in 2002,  says she manages to be self-reliant and has a circle of friends in Branson, Missouri . Sprawling estate: Friar Park, the 120-room home in Henley-on-Thames where George Harrison lived with his wife Olivia and son, Dhani, before he passed away in 2001 . Beatle: George Harrison a year before his death at the Australian Grand Prix in 2000 (left), and during a rare public appearance in Los Angeles in 1992 . However, with the end of the touring schedule, business has been slow and money has become tough. She said: 'I am struggling for money, like everyone, but I am not on the breadline. I am not ""skint"", as they would say in Britain. I feel very fortunate to own outright the land that my two homes sit on - which is better than most.' While Missouri has a checkered reputation as a den of meth-production and drug addiction, Louise claims that she has seen none of that in her neighborhood of Merriam Woods, adding: 'My neck of the woods is carefully managed by the local assembly men and a vigilant police force.' Even so, Merriam Woods is a world away from Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, a stunning 120-room Victorian mansion that Harrison left to Olivia and Dhani. Conservative estimates value Friar Park at $40million. Louise has fondly spoken of growing up with her little brother in a small terraced Liverpool home. When we were Fab: Ed Sullivan with The Beatles Ringo Starr George Harrison (died November 2001) John Lennon (died December 1980) And Paul Mccartney On The Set Of The Ed Sullivan Show. 1964 . George was the youngest of four children and was doted on by his elder siblings. 'George was a smashing kid, always smiling. He was a great brother,' she said in an interview in 2009. 'I was very protective of him, he was just my little kid baby brother.' Louise moved to Illinois with her Scottish mining engineer husband, Gordon Caldwell, and had two children in the late 1950s. Meanwhile, back in Britain, George met a young man named Paul McCartney and together they joined a band named The Quarrymen. In October 1962, Love Me Do was released in the UK and the nation became gripped by the four mop-tops and their sensational style. However, at that moment, the band was unknown in America - a situation that their manager Brian Epstein hoped to change. Louise, stepped up to the task and she took it upon herself to visit every small-town DJ she could, asking them to play her kid brother's band's songs. Staggering: British rock group the Beatles performing their last live public concert on the rooftop of the Apple Organization building for director Michael Lindsey-Hogg's film documentary, 'Let It Be,' on Savile Row, London, England . Incredibly, she got their hit From Me To You played on a local Illinois radio station in June 1963 - the first known example of The Beatles getting airplay in the United States. She still has letters from Brian Epstein, expressing gratitude for how she helped them break America. 'I did all I could to help my kid brother,' she says. In 1963, George spent two weeks at Louise's home. He was able to walk the streets unrecognized, he went camping and played with a local band in front of a small crowd of 150. Five months later he returned to the US with The Beatles to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show - and the history of popular music changed forever. Louise traveled to New York to see her now world-famous brother and met John, Ringo and Paul and eventually George's then girlfriend, Patti Boyd - for whom he would end up writing the ballad Something. Louise recalls that the moniker of the 'Quiet Beatle' was bestowed on her brother - for the wrong reasons. George was in fact suffering a strep throat at the time and as a result couldn't speak to the press or address the hordes of screaming girls who had flocked to see him. The brother and sister spent the 1960s and the 1970s very close, but George reportedly distanced himself from her in the mid-Nineties, however - because he disapproved of the conversion of her old Illinois home into a 'Beatles bed-and-breakfast' inn, called A Hard Day's Night. Louise does not own the establishment, but did use her name to help promote it because the town had fallen on hard times. She was says that she was trying to help them economically. All those years ago: George Harrison with his parents Harold and Louise Harrison at home in Liverpool . When George lay dying in hospital in Staten Island more than 10 years ago they reunited. Louise was led into a room where she found a familiar, though diminished figure propped up in a reclining chair, clinging to life. The only other people present were Olivia and her sister Linda, and Dhani. They left Louise and George to hold hands and reconcile for 90 minutes. 'George was pretty frail, yet he was also still vibrant,' she recalled in a 2002 interview. 'His eyes were still bright. He was still George. He must have been in pain, but he didn't show it. We reminisced about our childhood, and his sense of humor was the same as ever. 'People always teased him about his sticky-out ears; now his oxygen tubes were hanging over them. He laughed and said: 'My ears finally came in useful for something.' As their time together drew to a close, George humbly apologized to his sister. 'You know, I could have been a lot more help to you; I'm sorry,' he told her. They parted with what she calls a 'Harrison hug'. George smiled weakly. 'Remember to pass it on, sis,' he bade her; she promised she would.","Louise Harrison is living in a very modest home in rural Missouri .

"By . Fiona Macrae . If you’ve over-indulged this summer, don’t despair – because it is possible to be fat and fit. Doctors say being overweight will not necessarily send people to an early grave because such a thing as ‘healthy obesity’ exists. In fact, up to one in four of those labelled obese are lucky enough to be fat and fit. They are physically fit, have normal blood pressure and process sugar easily, despite their generous proportions. Celebrities including Nigella Lawson (left) and Lisa Riley (right) have long said that it possible to carry extra weight and still be fit. Researchers now believe this is true, defining it as 'metabolically healthy obesity' Studies show that ‘sufferers’ of healthy obesity have a lower risk of various ills than others who are similarly overweight. One . 15-year-long Italian study found that the ‘healthy obese’ were no more . likely to develop heart disease or cancer – or die at any given time – . than those of normal weight. In . other studies, being fat and fit cut the risk of ill health, even if it . did not completely remove it. The figures come from German experts who . trawled years of research from around the world into the topic. Their . acknowledgement will no doubt be welcome news for the likes of cook . Nigella Lawson and singer Adele, who have long argued it is possible to . be fat and fit. Writing in a . medical journal published by the respected Lancet group, the medics . said accurately identifying those who are fat and fit would cut the bill . for obesity treatment. Adele said she would only lose weight if it affected her health and so far, she said, it hasn't . Gastric . bypass and banding operations cost taxpayers up to £85million a year, . as growing numbers of people become hugely overweight. Targeting . treatment to those who would benefit the most could ensure taxpayers’ money is best spent. The researchers said: ‘Potentially scarce resources . can be more effectively tailored … Some prevention and treatment . strategies can be very expensive and time-consuming.’ Genes . are thought to be key, but working out why some of our  bodies resist . the toll of excess weight could also lead to treatments to improve the . health of the obese who are not fortunate enough to fall into the . healthy category. Doctors normally gauge whether a patient’s size is a . health concern by using their weight and height  to calculate their body . mass index, or BMI. But . relying on BMI is controversial, as it does not distinguish between . muscle and fat, meaning some athletes are classified as obese. The . German researchers said using BMI alone was ‘insufficient’ and other . factors such as waist size, blood pressure and where fat is stored in . the body needed to be taken into account. But . much more research is needed before any formula is ready for use in . doctor’s surgeries. And in the meantime, the researchers say that the . obese should still think about losing weight. The . team from the German Institute of Human Nutrition and the University of . Tubingen said: ‘Prevention of obesity through healthy diet and physical . activity should be widely promoted.’ Writing . in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, they warned that . not everyone who is ‘healthy obese’ will stay that way. Dr . Ian Campbell, a GP and medical director of charity Weight Concern, said . it made ‘perfect sense’ that some people could be fat but healthy. But . he warned: ‘The science is not yet precise. There is always a risk that . you will develop problems later.’","Most people - including the medical community - equate lower weight with better health, but researchers say there is such a thing as 'healthy obesity'

"By . Rob Cooper . A teacher who force-fed a seven-year-old boy custard, restrained another child with a belt and slapped a third pupil across the face has been banned from the profession. Amanda Whitfield, 60, made the boy - identified only as Pupil A - eat the dessert even though he was crying and gagging at the time. The Teaching Agency panel ruled that feeding a child in this way was 'plainly inappropriate' and she was banned from the profession for two years. Force feeding: Amnda Whitfield, 60, made a boy eat custard when he was crying at St Stephens Primary School in Launceston, Cornwall . Mrs Whitfield was teaching children with learning or communication problems at St Stephens Primary School, Launceston, Cornwall, at the time. The panel was told on a separate occasion she slapped another seven-year-old, known as pupil E, across the face. And the teacher pinched a girl, identified as G, on the nose to force her to open her mouth.. In a fourth separate incident she used a belt to hold a child to a chair and then did not report the incident to more senior staff at the school. Feeding: A boy, seven, was force-fed custard, the panel ruled . The panel, chaired by Kathy Thomson, found five of the nine charges against Mrs Whitfield were proven as they ruled she was guilty of unacceptable professional conduct. They said that the teacher, who had worked at the school for 20 years, had previously enjoyed a 'long and excellent career'. However, she resigned from her post in September 2008. Her ban from the classroom is imposed by Education Secretary Michael Gove. In their ruling, the panel said: 'The proved facts, in our view, indicate misconduct of a serious nature . and conduct that falls significantly short of the standard of behaviour . expected of a teacher. 'We recognise the challenging circumstances in which Mrs Whitfield was working and the complex needs of the children.' They added: 'Mrs Whitfield's actions of inappropriate restraint, slapping a pupil and inappropriate feeding methods jeopardised the safety and well-being of children under her supervision; on these occasions, she failed to understand and act upon her duty to safeguard children in her care.' Mr Gove said that there was a risk the teacher would do the same things again as he backed the findings. He said: 'The facts found proved have put the wellbeing of young and vulnerable . pupils in jeopardy. Furthermore, Mrs Whitfield has shown no real insight . into her behaviour or the effects of that behaviour. 'The panel has judged that there is a real risk that her behaviours will . be repeated given her apparent inability to learn from her experience . and adapt her practices accordingly.' The teacher now has 28 days to appeal the decision to the High Court.","Boy had dessert forced into his mouth as he was crying and gagging .

"By . Sophie Borland . WEIGHT-loss surgery could be turning patients into alcoholics, researchers claim. They say gastric bands and other operations used to treat obesity can make people dependent on alcohol. Scientists in Norway are about to begin a study on 30 patients undergoing weight-loss surgery to see if it changes their body’s reaction to alcohol. Turning to drink: A new study will look at whether people undergoing weight loss surgery are more likely to develop alcoholism . They suspect it may alter the body’s chemistry making alcohol seem more satisfying and rewarding. A number of patients have reported drinking considerably more following surgery and a study in America in 2012 suggested it may double the risk of alcoholism. Magnus Strommen, from St Olav’s University, in Trondheim, Norway, who will lead this new study said: 'Some complications with this surgery are known, but an increased risk of developing alcoholism caught most of us by surprise. 'It seems it increases the availability of alcohol [to the blood], and, to make things even worse, from normally reaching a peak alcohol concentration at about 30 minutes, it can happen within the first five to 10 minutes after swallowing the drink. 'Hence, the effect of alcohol is dramatically altered, with the maximum concentration being both much higher and coming much sooner than before.' He said he had met several patients who had developed alcoholism following surgery. ‘They are, of course, not that obese any more, but are dealing with a serious new problem which jeopardises their very existence. ‘I have also spoken to former patients who are not abusing alcohol, but have damaged their social reputation because they suddenly get blackouts when drinking.’ The most common type of obesity surgery are gastric bypass operations whereby the stomach is made smaller so patients feel full more quickly. Around 5,400 procedures are performed on the NHS each year along with around 1,300 gastric band operations - which also shrinks the stomach. They are so effective that patients normally lose around half to two thirds of their body weight. Switching addictions: Researchers want to find out if weight loss surgery makes people turn to another addiction, such as alcohol . Referring to the Norwegian project, Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘This is a very interesting study and I look forward to seeing the results of the trial. ‘Food can be an addiction and if we mechanically take away or reduce the ability to eat food, they may turn to something else, like alcohol.' Only last month researchers at Imperial College London claimed that 2million Britons are now so fat they qualify for obesity surgery. Those fitting the criteria for were more likely to be women, retired with lower educational qualifications and having lower socio-economic status, the study found.","Researchers claim gastric bands and other operations to treat obesity might alter the body's chemistry and make alcohol more satisfying .

"By . Sam Webb . A stunt where a woman rode a horse into a supermarket as part of the 'NekNominate' craze has been branded 'senseless and foolish' by police. Inky Ralph, 21, was filmed by her laughing friends riding her thoroughbred cob Harvey into a branch of Tesco in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, before downing a can of Pepsi as part of a Neknomination challenge. Police say they are investigating and added that it was pure luck that no one was hurt - but the rider has defended her actions as 'harmless fun'. Horseplay: Inky Ralph in stills from the video showing her riding the horse into a supermarket . Neigh bother: The rider has defended her actions as 'harmless fun' As she enters the shop on her horse Harvey, she is confronted by a security guard and an announcement can then be heard calling for the duty manager. Miss Ralph turns to the camera and nominates friends of hers to complete their own challenge, as well as the security guard. The craze, which has taken off on social media sites, involves people completing dares and ending by downing a drink. As she doesn't drink, Miss Ralph downed a cola for the 'NekNominate' She told the Northern Echo newspaper: 'It was something nobody else had done. It was just harmless fun. Everybody seems to find it really funny. 'I didn't realise how far it would spread and how many people would see it. I have had messages from as far as Australia and people are calling me a legend.' But the police have said they will be arranging for those involved to attend their local station and are trying to establish what offences might have been committed. Chief Inspector Sue Robinson, of Durham Constabulary, said: 'On Monday afternoon police were called by staff at the Tesco store in St Helen Auckland reporting a number of young women had been in the premises, with one of them riding a horse. They allegedly threatened a member of staff before leaving a few minutes later. 'Officers have viewed the in-store security footage as well as the video clip which has been circulating on social media. 'Those involved are believed to be well-known to both staff at the store and to ourselves and we will be arranging for them to attend their local police station at the earliest opportunity. 'At this stage we are trying to establish what criminal offences might have been committed and discussions have taken place with the RSPCA in regards to the welfare of the horse. 'It goes without saying this was a senseless and foolish thing to do. There were a number of shoppers in the store at the time and it is fortunate no one was hurt.' Police said: 'At this stage we are trying to establish what criminal offences might have been committed' A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We are aware of the incident and the police are investigating.' 'NekNominate' has sparked controversy after two young men died in Ireland over the weekend that are believed to related to the drinking craze. Ross Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early hours of Saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was drinking spirits at the time of his death. Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination. Mr Byrne's family pleaded with people not to take part in the drinking game. Tragic: Jonny Byrne (left), 19, was discovered floating in the river at .

"By . David Wilkes . She has played on the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings soundtracks and performed with stars such as Madonna, Mick Jagger and Sting. But classical musician Kathryn Bassano struggled to keep in time with loan repayments on her £400,000 antique viola – and is now facing a legal battle to keep it. The 57-year-old, married to renowned conductor Peter Bassano, 68, is fighting in the High Court to prevent her beloved 211-year-old instrument being sold by her creditors. Court fight: Kathryn Bassano, 57, from Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire is battling in High Court to keep her 211-year-old instrument . The loans were taken out after the couple were hit with a £185,000 legal bill for a separate case in 2007. They lost a row over an unpaid builder’s bill of £16,000 on their £3million seven-bedroom home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. Mrs Bassano used the viola as ‘security’, it is claimed, to raise a series of cash loans totalling £280,000. Instrument dealers Alfred Toft and Peter Biddulph along with pawnbroking company Borro Loan Ltd, who provided the loans between them, claim the necessary repayments have not been made. They are asking the High Court to order that the viola be sold and the proceeds split between them to cover the debts which, with interest, are now said to exceed £500,000. The Bassanos claim that technicalities to do with the loan agreements mean they cannot be enforced by forfeiting the viola, which was made by feted Italian craftsman Giovanni Battista Ceruti in 1803 – and which they are desperate to save. Prized: A viola like Mrs Bassano's . Yesterday the court heard that Mrs Bassano first approached Mr Toft, a dealer in fine stringed instruments who lives in Penshurst, Kent, after a service at his local church. Mr Toft’s barrister Anthony Allston, said the dealer agreed to lend Mrs Bassano £100,000 in February 2010. Mr Allston added that both Mr Toft and Mrs Bassano had signed a document detailing the ‘loan agreement and security by way of a mortgage over the viola’. The terms of the loan were £100,000, to be borrowed for 12 months, at a monthly interest rate of 2.5 per cent, the barrister said. Ten monthly interest payments of £2,500 were made ‘then nothing else … none of the capital has ever been repaid’ the court heard. Mrs Bassano also borrowed £50,000 from Mr Biddulph. Mr Bassano, a former member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and previously professor at the Royal College of Music, argued that the loans made to his wife by the two instrument dealers did not comply with rules laid down in the 1974 Consumer Credit Act to control money-lending. Therefore, he claimed, the loans could not be enforced by forfeiting the viola. He and his wife are also contesting the validity of Borro Loan’s security over the instrument – for a £130,000 loan. The Bassanos argued that the viola is worth more than the £230,000 which would be raised should the judge order it to be sold. Mr Allston told the judge: ‘Mrs Bassano seeks declarations to the effect that the loan transactions between herself and Mr Toft and Mr Biddulph are unenforceable. ‘It is claimed by Mrs Bassano that Mr Toft cannot enforce the agreement because he needed a credit licence. Her husband makes it clear that she [also] intends to contest the validity of Borro’s security,’ the barrister added. ‘There can be no doubt that Mr Toft lent £100,000 to Mrs Bassano, none of which she has repaid.’ Mr Toft denied that he needed such a licence to recover his money, and told the judge: ‘I am not a money-lender.’ He added that the loan was ‘very much a one-off transaction’. Mrs Bassano did not attend court yesterday. Her husband is part of a 500-year-old musical dynasty, with a family tree linking him to six talented Italian brothers brought to England by Henry VIII to entertain the Royal Court. Outside the hearing Mr Toft said of the contested instrument, which is currently being held by an auctioneer: ‘It’s a nice viola – it’s a rarity. ‘Whoever buys it will probably sell it for about £400,000.’ The hearing continues.","Kathryn Bassano failed to pay back on the loan on her antique viola .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . The majority of first-time buyers are taking out record-breaking mortgages which last for more than 25 years, Britain’s biggest building society said yesterday. Some of the country’s biggest lenders now hand out loans lasting for up to 40 years, an extraordinary shift from the long-held tradition that a mortgage was for only 25 years. The longer life loans are a sign of the financial pressure on young people to buy when house prices have rocketed, although it means many will still be paying off their loan in their 70s. Today's first-time buyers are taking out record-breaking mortgages which last for more than 25 years . Yesterday the Land Registry said the average price of a home in London has gone over £400,000 for the first time to an average of £403,792. Seven boroughs in the capital have an average price of more than £500,000, including one where the average price is nearly £1.2million. The Nationwide said yesterday house prices have been rising for 13 consecutive months, the longest unbroken run of monthly increase since the financial crisis began in 2007. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, yesterday described the housing market as ‘over-heating’. Lenders such as Halifax, Lloyds and Nationwide now have a maximum term of 40 years. Others such as Santander, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland offer loans for up to 35 years. On average, a first-time buyer takes out a loan which lasts for 28 years, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. While . the monthly repayments are cheaper, the total cost of the mortgage . balloons because they pay much more interest on the loan. First time high: The number of first time buyers entering the market is the highest for over 10 years . Affordability worries: House prices relative to average earnings are rising to levels not seen since 2008 creating concerns that mortgage borrowers could start to overstretch their finances . Take the example of a couple taking out a £100,000 mortgage with an interest rate of four per cent. With a 25-year deal, their total interest bill is £58,351. With a 35-year deal, the total interest bill jumps to £85,965, according to calculations by the mortgage advisers John Charcol. Although their monthly repayments are cheaper - £528 per month for 25 years or £443 for 35 years – the extra ten years means they are paying an additional £27,600 in interest. Experts said the growing popularity of such longer life loans is a direct consequence of the disappearance of interest-only mortgages. Young people used to be able to take out an interest-only mortgage, which means their monthly payments were cheaper because they were not paying off a penny of the interest. As these types of loans have virtually disappeared, the only option is for first-time buyers to switch to a loan which a longer life. Ray Boulger, senior technical director at John Charcol, said: ‘A loan with a longer term is the nearest thing they can get to an interest-only mortgage.’ Robert Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, said: ‘There is a trend towards borrowers lengthening the term of their mortgage. Soaring: House prices have leapt nearly 9 per cent in the last 13 months figures released by Nationwide showed . ‘At present, 52 per cent of mortgages [lent to first-time buyers] are currently over 25 years, up from 40 per cent in 2007. ‘This may, in part, be to lower their monthly repayments, though the shift may also reflect that people are both living and working for longer.’ These figures are based on the experience of all mortgage lenders, not just Nationwide. Mr Boulger warned lenders’ age restrictions can cause problems for first-time buyers as many insist a loan must be fully repaid by the time a homeowner reaches 70 or 75. For example, a 35-year-old wanting to take out a mortgage for 40 years would not be allowed to borrow the money if the lender’s age cap is 70. Other types of buyers do not opt for longer life deals. People moving from one home to another typically take out a loan lasting for around 22 years. People remortgaging their loan typically choose an 18-year deal. Many first-time buyers choose a longer life loan but switch to a shorter deal when they can afford the higher cost.","Sign of pressure on young people to buy when prices have rocketed .

"By . Jill Reilly . A bogus roofer ripped off an elderly customer just three years after being let off by a judge for an identical scam. Danny Sherwood flicked a defiant V-sign as he walked free from court in 2011 despite admitting overcharging an 86-year-old woman £700 for basic repairs to her roof. This week he was back in court for overcharging a 73-year-old woman £2,150 for £630 work he carried out to her house. Sherwood comes from a family of . rogue traders in Bournemouth, Dorset - his brother and father have also both been convicted of ripping off elderly customers. Danny Sherwood sticks two fingers up at the law after evading jail for conning an elderly woman out of £700 - only to commit a bigger crime just three years on . In his latest scam Sherwood convinced the pensioner that her chimney was unsafe and needed removing although there was not anything wrong with it. The 30-year-old rogue trader then marched the woman to the cashpoint so she could withdraw £250 to pay him. Sherwood lied to his victim about his home address and failed to provide a receipt and written guarantee for the work to her roof. Sherwood comes from a family of rogue traders in Bournemouth, Dorset.  His older brother Kevin (left) was convicted of conning an 85-year-old man out of £1,300 for a job he said would cost £50. In January last year their father, also called Kevin, (right)  was sentenced to 12 months in prison for ripping off two elderly couples . He was only caught when she complained to her Trading Standards department once the work had been carried out in September 2012. Sherwood was found guilty of seven counts of fraud at Bournemouth Crown Court and will be sentenced next month. In 2011 he was spared jail after admitting carrying out £780 worth of work to a house having promised its owner he would repair a broken roof tile ‘for a fiver’. In the same year his older brother Kevin was convicted of conning an 85-year-old man out of £1,300 for a job he said would cost £50. He had tried to charge another £3,700 on top of the £1,300 for the straightforward repairs to roof tiles. Sherwood was found guilty of seven counts of fraud at Bournemouth Crown Court . Kevin Sherwood was given a nine months suspended prison sentence, 200 hours community service and told to pay £2,500 costs and £2,496 compensation to his victim. In January last year their father, also called Kevin, was sentenced to 12 months in prison for ripping off two elderly couples to the sum of £37,000. He charged one couple £25,000 after convincing them their whole roof needed replacing, then took £12,000 from another couple for unnecessary work to their bungalow. He was also handed an ASBO banning him from taking advantage of pensioners. James . Norman, the regulatory team manager at Poole council which prosecuted . Sherwood, said: 'This is a case of an elderly vulnerable woman being . exploited by a trader. 'We . are delighted with this verdict which sends a clear message to those . people who seek to defraud members of our community that Trading . Standards will use all means at their disposal to bring these traders to . justice.' Stuart Brown, from Trading Standards added: 'The south west has a higher than average proportion of elderly and vulnerable residents and therefore we are a particular target for rogue companies. 'Tackling doorstep crime is our number one priority for 2014. 'We will extend every effort to catch those rogue traders who bring misery to the doorstep of elderly and vulnerable residents trying to enjoy their retirement in peace.'","Danny Sherwood, 30, has been found guilty of seven counts of fraud .

"By . Richard Spillett . Commuters on the line where a fare dodger went five years without buying a ticket have hailed the mystery man a hero. A hedge fund manager is believed to have ducked the daily £24.50-each-way fare from his local station in Stonegate, East Sussex to London's Cannon Street by exploiting a loophole using his Oyster Card. But while train operator Southeastern have slammed his behaviour and hit him with a £43,000 fine, fellow passengers at the rural station have expressed their respect for the fare-cheat. The rural station of Stonegate, East Sussex was used by a hedge fund manager thought to be one the biggest fare dodgers in history . Local Dave Johnson, who also works in the City, said: 'I reckon he must have thought he was James Bond - hiding from the ticket inspectors in the loos and that. 'It would certainly make my morning more exciting. The fact he got away with it for so long makes you wonder whether you'd be able to get away with it yourself. 'I wouldn't give it a go though, I'd be too scared.' Another commuter, who said he also worked for a hedge fund, said: 'Good on him. Trains are too expensive anyway, and the service is rubbish. 'I wish I had the guts to do what he did. What a hero.' Another passenger on the line, who asked not to be named, added: 'I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally - the train companies hold commuters to ransom. 'The sky high fares just go up and up - the man's a bit of a modern-day Robin Hood.' Commuters on the man's train route have expressed sympathy with his method of beating the system. File photo . In the nearby village of Ticehurst, a waitress told The Independent that Southeastern trains should have been 'more on the ball'. 'It serves them right. How did he get away with it for five years? It puts the rail system to shame,' she said. It emerged today that, despite his five-figure fine, the man have got off lightly, because rules state he should have paid double the full fare. Other commuters were less sympathetic towards the man, who is believed to be one of the biggest fare dodgers in history. Robert Jack, who also catches the train to Cannon Street every morning, said: 'I probably get my ticket checked once or twice a week. The fare dodger got away with the scam for five years after 'tapping out' with his Oyster card when he got to London . 'I don't know how this guy got away with it for so long, but it's disgraceful. It's people like him who raise the prices for everyone else. 'Also, he could obviously afford the ticket because he paid his fine immediately. 'He should have the book thrown at him and be banned from the trains - that'll teach him for being so dishonest.' According to a report in the Sunday Times, the senior executive is believed to have travelled into London without buying any ticket and avoiding detection from 2008 until the end of last year. He was able to get off his train at London Bridge and cross a platform to catch a service to Cannon Street without having to go through any barriers. At Cannon Street, he used an Oyster card to exit the barriers, paying the then maximum £7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having tapped in. Fellow commuters have said the train companies 'hold passengers to ransom' and should be more vigilant . But on November 25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he had paid £7.20 and not the £2.30 for a single ticket. After being challenged, the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct fare on five journeys between London Bridge and Cannon Street. Suspicious investigators for Southeastern then discovered that the man had for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket from Stonegate. And within five days of being caught out at Cannon Street, the executive renewed his season ticket, leading Southeastern to believe he had been dodging the fare for his commute for five years. Rail Union TSSA have been left angry by the fact the man escaped prosecution by reaching an out-of-court settlement with the train company. Union leader Manuel Cortes said: 'There seems to be one law for the rich and one law for the poor when it comes to criminal prosecution. 'This guy can buy silence, but that isn't offered to most people who are caught fare dodging.' Southeastern said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court. The train company told the Sunday Times that the executive wanted to protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would have on his job. A spokesperson added: 'All customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him. 'The customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process.'","Hedge fund manager avoided full fare using an Oyster card scam in London .

However, unknowingly, the app store on the Samsung device saved her bank details and the young boy managed to purchase the additional games and rack up extra charges – sometimes at a cost of up to £64 a session. The family only realised what had happened when Samantha’s bank statement came through and showed she had been charged £409 by the Google App store. Father-of-two Mr Hooper, of Bridgend, Wales, paid the money back to his daughter but said he is angry that he couldn't get in touch with Google to complain. He said: ‘It was impossible to get hold of anyone. ‘There are barely any numbers online and when you do call the numbers, they refer you to websites. The family only realised what had happened when a bank statement came through showing a total amount of £409 in charges by the Google app store . ‘I just wanted to request a refund because I couldn't believe how much money we had been charged for a cheap kids' game. ‘We would normally watch what he is doing on the tablet but that day he went upstairs to say he was watching a film. Delivery driver Gary Hooper has hit out at Google for not having better protections on its apps and is hoping to get the charges refunded . ‘He ended up paying out for lots of Google stuff, costing as much as £64 at a time. ‘He had no idea what he was doing - he is only 10 and has learning difficulties.’ Mr Hooper and his wife Geraldine first decided to start fostering after feeling lonely when their daughters moved out. They took in the boy six months ago to give him a better start in life. Now the pair are hoping to get a full refund from Google for not having better protections on its apps. Mr Hooper said: ‘I don't understand why they can't make it harder for kids to buy these things. ‘Anybody can do anything on these tablets. It's unbelievable. ‘I understand Google wants to make money but with the millions of pounds they are making it can do something about taking money from hard-working people like us. ‘By the time most people find out how much these things cost and what's happened, it's too late.’ However, when approached, a Google spokesman referred to its support website, which states: ‘We provide password protection on the our Store app to help prevent accidental or unwanted purchases on your device.’ Five-year-old Danny Kitchen, from Bristol, made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software to help him play the game Zombie . The Hooper family are not the first to have landed a huge bill for games and apps on tablet devices. Last year, five-year-old Danny Kitchen, from Bristol, made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software to help him play the game Zombie. Danny had asked his father for a passcode to download a game called Zombies v Ninja, which involves touching the iPad screen to aim ninja-style weapons at cartoon zombies. His parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at their home. But by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen, Danny was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ammunition’. He bought dozens of in-game ‘weapons’ and ‘keys’ which cost up to £69.99 a time. His parents were refunded after they contacted Apple. Another similar case was that of  eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry who used the family iPad to play The Simpsons game Tapped Out and often bought the virtual doughnuts on offer to help progress through the game. However, he didn't realise that he was racking up an enormous £980 bill for his parents. Nick, left, and Lisa Rowland-Fry were left furious after their eight-year-old son Theo, right, ran up a £980 bill after buying virtual doughnuts on an iPad . Nick and Lisa Rowland-Fry, from Bristol, only realised that their son had spent the huge amount after their bank account had been completely cleared. They were refunded after contacting Apple representatives in America. Cameron Crossan also ran up a £3,700 bill on his father’s credit card by playing games on his iPad. Lee Neale, 43, faced a hefty bill after his daughter racked up the huge sum playing games on his iPad . Doug Crossan, 48, said he was horrified when his credit card company informed him of the amount his son had spent on the games in Apple’s online App Store. The 13-year-old was mortified by what he had done and his father said he was unaware he was being charged for the purchases. Lee Neale, 43, had his bank account frozen when his eight-year-old daughter Lily bought in-app extras while playing on a tablet using the password she had seen him entering when downloading items. Lily ran up a bill of more than £2,000 in just six days and more than £4,000 over the course of five months topping up rewards and enhancements in 74 transactions. Mr Neale claims the schoolgirl was unaware she was being charged 'real money' for the in-game purchases and asked to Apple to scrap the charge. The father, from Peasedown St John, Somerset, allowed Lily to use his iPad so she could play numerous games including Campus Life, My Horse, Hay Day and Smurf’s Village.","Gary Hooper has been left to foot hefty bill after foster son racked up costs .

"By . Sean Poulter . Continental-style cafes selling wine by the glass, deli-foods and gourmet cheese are being opened in some Waitrose stores in new ‘grazing areas’. The chain already offers coffee shops in competition to the big chains, but it is now looking to take on bars and restaurants by offering meals to ‘ladies who lunch’. The first of the food outlets is at a new Waitrose in Keynsham, Somerset, which took the building from the Co-op earlier this year, while more are planned across the country. No longer just a supermarket: Waitrose is trailing continental-style cafes where customers can sample wines and food on sale in the store . Another opened last week in a new store near Swindon, which is also trialling a fresh juice bar and a wine tasting area. The grazing areas, which include benches and tables, are provided next to the deli and bakery areas to allow customers to try upmarket, gourmet products that are on sale around the store. Customers can choose from platters serving ham, cheese and artichokes, together with a glass of wine for £7.50. The move is part of a shift by the major supermarkets to transform big box stores into miniature high streets with a mix of other services in the hope of turning a shopping trip into an event rather than a chore. Waitrose has had huge success in increasing the number of people visiting stores with its daily offer of a free coffee or tea to holders of its myWaitrose card, however it has upset some independent coffee shops. The chain also has plans to double the number of conventional in-store cafes, serving hot food from lasagne to ham hock pie, taking the figure up to around 200. It has also announced plans for 100 mini-gardening shops or pods outside stores this spring, selling grow your own vegetables as well as plants and other products. Expanding: Customers will be able to enjoy a glass of wine and food platter when they do their weekly shop . Marks & Spencer already offers deli-style restaurants serving wine in some outlets, while Tesco has added Giraffe family restaurants, Harris + Hoole coffee shops and Euphorium bakers to some ‘Extra’ stores. Tesco is also rumoured to be working on a high street takeaway food chain that would rival the likes of Pret a Manger. Moira Howie, the Waitrose nutrition manager, said there is a big change in eating habits and lifestyles, with people moving away from sitting down to breakfast, lunch and dinner towards snacking. Looking ahead, she said: ‘The idea of three square meals a day will give way to little-and-often grazing. ‘Consumers will monitor their own calorie intake and energy use through technology and specially designed apps. With an ageing population, smaller portions of nutrient-rich foods will be popular.’ The new continental style grazing areas selling wine are a major departure for the store, which was found in Acton, west London, in 1904 by Wallace Waite, Arthur Rose and David Taylor. The name Waitrose was adopted in 1908 after David Taylor left the business. Growing: Waitrose already has around 200 conventional cafes selling hot drinks and food . The chain was taken over by the John Lewis partnership in 1937 when it had just ten stores and it has now grown to more than 300 including more than 30 smalller convenience stores. Wine tasting is offered at Keynsham, Somerset, along with a food platter from the deli counter, which cost £5.95 each and include a selection of cheese, meats and bread. Adding a glass of wine takes the price up to £7.50. Waitrose said the ‘grazing area’ concept is a trial and therefore the company is unable to say how many other outlets will introduce them. Apart from grazing areas, it has also opened wine tasting areas at stores in Cambridge, Kingston and Kenysham. Stores offering wine tasting charge £3.25 a glass from the store’s range, while Waitrose also allows customers to buy a bottle of wine at the normal retail price plus a corkage fee for drinking it on the premises of £7.40. The firm’s managing director, Mark Price, is due to outline the next phase of the trials at the new Swindon store next month. The company operates a wine and food bar in the food hall of John Lewis at the Bluewater shopping centre, however it is now planning to run similar outlets in Waitrose supermarkets for the first time.","New 'grazing areas' let customers try gourmet foods on sale in the store .

"By . Alan Roden . and Ian Drury . Independence for Scotland will undermine the Royal Navy and cost the Ministry of Defence billions of pounds, Britain’s military grandees warned yesterday. In an unprecedented alliance, 12 of the country’s most senior defence and intelligence veterans have written to Alex Salmond condemning plans to scrap Trident if there is a ‘Yes’ vote in September. The First Minister’s controversial proposals would put the UK’s nuclear deterrent ‘in jeopardy’ and cast a ‘dark shadow’ over international relations, they said. Deterrent: Trident submarine Vanguard off Scotland . The MoD would be forced to shift the submarine-based deterrent from Scotland, incurring huge costs which would inevitably eat into the defence budget and hit the Navy. It would also potentially scupper Scottish National Party hopes of joining Nato, according to the former heads of the Army, Navy and the RAF. Fellow nuclear powers France and America, in particular, would be ‘concerned’ by the ‘unacceptable’ development because the military alliance has British-based nuclear weapons as a cornerstone of its protection. The former defence chiefs also warned that forcing the removal of the Trident nuclear missile system from its base at Faslane on the Clyde would cost ‘many, if not most’ of the 7,000 Scottish jobs there. The letter is the most significant intervention yet amid an ongoing row over the SNP’s defence strategy for a separate Scotland. Mr Salmond has drawn up plans for a £2.5billion annual budget for defence and security. That compares with £35billion for defence alone spent each year across the UK. Nationalists claim they can spend less because Trident missiles would be removed from Faslane by the end of the decade, although the SNP recently backed Nato membership – and still wants the protection of its first-strike nuclear capacity. Last year, Nato chiefs privately agreed that it may be possible to fast-track membership for an independent Scotland, but – crucially – only if there are no unresolved disputes with other countries, such as the rest of the UK. The letter to Mr Salmond has been written by Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff between 2009 and 2013. It is also signed by four former chiefs of the defence staff, four other first sea lords and chiefs of naval staff, a former chief of the air staff, the former chief of the general staff who commanded the British forces in Iraq, General Sir Mike Jackson, and Britain’s most senior intelligence civil servant after the 9/11 terror attacks, Sir David Omand. Intelligence veterans have written to First Minister Alex Salmond to condemn plans to scrap Trident . Sir Mark writes: ‘For the continuing UK such a demand [to remove Trident], not least in the timescale envisaged, would cause huge practical problems and upheaval for the Royal Navy and require massive additional expenditure – running into many billions of pounds – and would be deeply resented by many. ‘The negotiations with Westminster following a Yes vote, covering such vital matters as currency, financial settlements and re-allocating existing UK defence and other assets, can be expected to be complex and difficult. If the very future of the UK nuclear deterrent was also in the balance, it would inevitably sour those negotiations.’ Sir Mark’s letter warns of concerns if Scotland ‘pushed a unilateral nuclear disarmament agenda’. He says: ‘Nato could hardly be expected to welcome a new member state whose government put in jeopardy the continued operation of the UK independent nuclear deterrent – a deterrent which protects not only the UK but all of Nato as well.’ He also criticises the Scottish government’s White Paper on independence. ‘[Nato] would view with alarm the suggestion of a constitutional ban on nuclear weapons in Scotland,’ he writes. Sir Mark adds that ‘the very prospect of implementing the Scottish government’s policy would cast a dark shadow over the international reception given to a newly independent Scottish nation’. Trident missiles are carried on four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered submarines. The UK government is committed to maintaining and renewing the submarine patrols. A Scottish government spokesman said: ‘The estimated £170million that Scottish taxpayers contribute every year to the maintenance and running of Trident could be far better spent by prioritising our conventional defence needs.’","12 top defence and intelligence veterans have written to Alex Salmond .

"By . Richard Spillett . A top actress has told how she left her baby son at home for the first time since his birth and returned to find him dying in his father's arms. Irish TV star Leigh Arnold spoke at an inquest into the death of her two and a half week old son, Flynn, who is thought to have suffered Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) - where babies 'switch off' in their sleep. Miss Arnold said she went out with a friend to a restaurant near her home in Ashley, Cheshire in May last year but returned to find her newborn baby 'grey' and unresponsive. Leigh Arnold and fiance Steve Davies, in a picture she posted on Twitter, both spoke at the inquest, which found their baby son Flynn died of natural causes . A pregnant Miss Arnold and Mr Davies, pictured with their older son, Hunter (left). Miss Arnold told the court Flynn had shown no signs of illness before the tragedy . Heartbroken Miss Arnold, star of Irish series The Clinic, told the hearing: 'I got in and went to the living room and saw them both asleep. Flynn was lying facing up. 'I could see his whole body. He wasn't squashed. I saw by his face there was definitely something wrong. 'I just know that I screamed an awful lot and my legs went from under me - I don't remember an awful lot else. 'He was a perfect baby. He was healthy and extremely loved and adored and is missed every second of the day. Whether we will ever have an answer to what happened, I don't know.' Despite frantic efforts by the couple and paramedics to revive the baby, he was pronounced dead at Wythenshawe Hospital in Greater Manchester an hour later. Miss Arnold said that, after she had an emergency C-section with Flynn, everything in his short life had gone to plan. Mr Davies with a baby, not believed to be tragic Flynn, in a picture Miss Arnold tweeted in March 2013 . Miss Arnold, pictured at a TV awards night, told an inquest in Macclesfield, Cheshire that Flynn died on her first night out since his birth . Miss Arnold, who has hundreds of followers on Twitter, shot to fame on Irish TV series The Clinic . Described by doctors as a 'perfect baby', Flynn had shown no signs of illness in his short life and was drinking happily from his bottle around the time she left for the evening. She later phoned home to check up on him, because she was 'anxious about him', but was reassured after hearing him in the background. Fighting back tears yesterday, she said: 'I could hear him gurgling - happy gurgling. I knew they were having a lovely time.' Mr Davies later fell asleep cradling tiny Flynn at around 11pm and was awoken by Miss Arnold's screams when she returned from her meal at 1.30am. Miss Arnold, who also has a two-year-old son, Hunter, said: 'There were a lot of cuddles and a lot of love and the family all came over from Ireland when he was born. Flynn was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester but paramedics and doctors could not save him . 'On that day or the days before he had no temperature or cough and the health visitor said everything was normal. He was feeding perfectly and there was no difference from my last baby. 'I was invited out to dinner and didn't feel it was the right thing to do but, knowing it was only down the road, Steven said ""go and have a break"" and I knew he would be okay so I went out with my friend for dinner.' Mr Davies dropped his wife off at the . restaurant and visited the supermarket, returning home with Flynn at 8pm . while the family's au pair took care of Hunter. SIDS, also known as cot death, claims at least 300 babies in the UK every year and is more common in baby boys. Most deaths happen within six months of the baby's birth, usually when the baby is asleep at night. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought some babies develop a problem in the way they deal with certain stresses, which affects how they regulate their heart rate, breathing and temperature. The NHS tells parents they can cut the risk of cot death by placing a baby on their back to sleep, not smoking around them and regulating their temperature. More information is available through the NHS and The Lullaby Trust, which offers help for bereaved families through their helpline 0808 802 6868. He said: 'I went into the lounge with Flynn and he fell asleep on the chaise longue I put the TV on and took Flynn out of his cradle. He kept waking up then going back to sleep. 'I warmed a bottle up for him and he woke up again and had that. I was feeding him and Leigh called me to see if he was alright. I said he was OK and feeding at the time. 'I was feeding him and he was in my arms. I was laid down on the chaise lounge and he was in the crook of my left arm. That was the last thing I remember.' Dr Cate Lenton, a paediatrician from Wythenshawe Hospital, also described Flynn as a 'perfect baby', but added that cot death doesn't necessarily have to happen in cots. 'While they are asleep they just turn off,' she said. 'It is just a baby that stops while it is asleep.' An investigation by police and the Home Office was undertaken after Flynn's death, but it was soon determined nobody was at fault and nothing could have been done to save him. Home Office pathologist Dr Gauri Batra gave a cause of death as 'unascertained', but added that there was nothing at all to indicate an unnatural cause of death. Reaching a conclusion of death by natural causes, coroner Janet Napier addressed a tearful Miss Arnold and Mr Davies and said: 'Flynn is a very much-missed and very much-loved child. He was the light of your life as well as your other child. 'There was no evidence of any illness whatsoever. This was a sudden, tragic switching off in the sleep. I can't properly say how awful this is. I give you my sincere sympathy.' Miss Arnold and Mr Davies were due to wed last year but postponed the ceremony after Flynn's death. A date has now been set for May, with the couple expected to tie the knot in Ibiza, where Leigh's model sister Zoe live. Little Hunter will act as the ring-bearer. Miss Arnold shot to fame in 2003 when she became one of the biggest names in Irish television for her role as Dr Clodagh Delaney in RTE's The Clinic, playing the character for six series.","Leigh Arnold went out to a restaurant but returned to find her baby dying .

"By . Sam Webb . A farmer who lost his left leg, part of his right leg and suffered horrific  injuries to his arm in a potato harvester accident last year is determined to  be back at work by the autumn. Father-of-three Darren Taylor, who has a farm just outside York, suffered the devastating injuries after slipping  between the machine's rollers as he checked it in October. He fought for his life for 30 minutes as the heavy duty machine threatened to  drag in his entire body. Despite his injuries, the 44-year-old has amazed doctors with his  determination to get back to the job he loves. Mr Taylor said: 'I have had one prosthetic leg fitted and I am hoping to to be  walking by early summer and want to be back at work by the autumn.' Stoic: Farmer Darren Taylor and his wife Nicky. He miraculously escaped with his life but lost his left leg and part of his right leg after he was dragged into a potato harvester in a horrific accident . Speaking earlier this year, Darren described how he was 'literally doing the  splits', as his arm and leg were swallowed by the machine with his other limbs  still on the outside. As he tried to move his right leg to relieve some of the pressure it also  dropped in, this time up to the ankle. Mr Taylor said: 'It had just got my ankle and by now my left leg was in up to my  thigh. 'At this point I was waiting for it to chew my foot off and I could have just  have got the right leg out. Mr Taylor said: 'I looked down through the harvester and I thought an oil pipe had burst but when I got my bearings I could see it was my blood' 'I thought there was a chance it could take me right through but I just tried  to hang on as best as I could. 'I looked down through the harvester and I thought an oil pipe had burst but  when I got my bearings I could see it was my blood. 'If the pain scale was one to ten then this was 20, it was horrible. I was just determined it wasn't going to get me. 'I knew I was badly injured  but I was fighting to struggle my way out of it. 'I had to stay awake to keep out of the machine. I was shouting ""you're not  going to pull me through"".' Mr Taylor was trapped for half an hour before the  alarm was raised. It took another two hours to free him when specialist engineers had to be  called in to dismantle the machine. He was flown to Leeds General Infirmary by air ambulance where he spent eight  days in an induced coma and a further three months being treated. His left leg was fully amputated, his left elbow removed and the bottom of his  right leg amputated. Mr Taylor said: 'I wish it hadn't happened but the people around  me and the people in Leeds General Infirmary have been that good the least  thing I can do is be strong and appreciate what they have done for me. 'I'm still alive and there were moments when the situation might have been  different. 'I'm so grateful to the emergency services and all the medical staff.' He has been supported through is ordeal by his wife 47-year-old wife Nicky, who  helps out on the farm, and his children Olly, nine, Tia, 21 and Danielle, 27. Darren's story has featured on BBC One's Helicopter Heroes and will be on Countryfile on  Sunday. Mr Taylor on his tractor before the accident.

"By . Tim Shipman . Despite critics predicting misery, 45 per cent of benefit claimants whose income was cut has started looking for a job . Nearly half of benefit claimants hit by the cap on welfare payments are now doing more to find work, according to a poll. Since the cap was introduced a year ago this month more than 38,600 households have had the amount they are paid in benefits limited to £26,000 a year – the income of the average working family. Despite predictions by critics that the new rule would cause misery, the poll – conducted by Ipsos Mori – found that 45 per cent of those affected say they have been spurred to return to work. The poll of more than 1,600 capped households revealed that 28 per cent of claimants sent off more job applications to find paid work and 27 per cent said they are using agencies such as Jobcentre Plus, careers centres and recruitment consultants more regularly to help them find work. The research also revealed that while many people were already looking for work prior to being capped, 40 per cent of respondents said that they had been ‘more encouraged’ to find work as a result of the benefit cap. Latest figures show that nearly 4,300 households that were previously subject to the benefit cap have found jobs since the limit was introduced in April 2013. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith hailed the figures as evidence that the benefit cap is working. He told the Mail: ‘When we introduced the policy there was predictable scare mongering from Labour. They said the cap was unfair, and that it would lead to mass homelessness. ‘Yet again they denounced an eminently sensible and fair means of reducing the ballooning benefits bill and said we were destroying the welfare state. ‘Far from it. What Labour still fail to understand is that their reckless spendthrift ways put the whole system at risk because it was unsustainable.’ He added: ‘By capping benefits we send . a clear message: the only way to increase the amount of money you . receive is through work. The system we inherited from Labour had become a . trap. ‘By allowing those on benefits to receive more than the average household earns it made choosing a life on benefits too easy. ‘It sent the wrong message to benefit claimants as well as to the taxpayer who was footing the bill.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has hailed the figures as evidence that the benefit cap works . Capping benefits will save the Government around £185million a year for the next four years, but Mr Duncan Smith said the policy is about changing the behaviour of claimants as well as saving money. ‘That’s why what I find most encouraging about today’s findings is that people are recognising that the way to raise their income is by finding a job,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘Significant numbers of people are moving off benefits and into work, and those that haven’t found work say that they are more likely to look for work. ‘People are recognising that the way to raise their income is by finding a job. This is clear evidence that the benefit cap, along with so many of our reforms, is changing people’s behaviour and people’s lives for the better. ‘These findings should make critics of the cap think twice.’ More than 38,600 households have been affected by the cap, according to the most recent figures. Of those currently capped, more than 300 households had more than £300 a week capped from their income. Benefits for couples and lone parents have been capped at £500 per week, or £350 for a single. childless person.","Ipsos Mori poll found 45 per cent claimants now looking for work .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . More than 500 male pupils and staff at a French high school are to undergo DNA tests after a 16-year-old-girl was raped - and police exhausted all other leads. The testing of 527 men at the private Fenelon-Notre Dame high school in La Rochelle, south west France, was ordered after the girl was attacked in the bathroom of the school last September. In a legal first in France, summonses went out last week to 475 teenage students, 31 teachers and 21 others - thought to be either staff or males who were on campus at the time. Students arrive at the Fenelon Notre-Dame College in La Rochelle, western France. 527 males associated with the school have been ordered to undergo DNA tests after a girl, 16, was raped on in a bathroom at the school . Testing began today and is expected to last until Wednesday. Prosecutor Isabelle Pagenelle said so far no one had refused the tests - but warned anyone who decided not to give a DNA sample would be considered a suspect and could be taken into custody. The prosecutor said: 'The choice is simple for me. Either I file it away and wait for a match in what could be several years, or I go looking for the match myself.' Pagenelle's office, which required . parental permission for minors, says it will discard any DNA results . from people who were eliminated as suspects. The assault took place on September 30 in the pitch black and the girl unable to identify the criminal. A police van outside the private school, which educates around 1,200 pupils.

Summonses were put out to 475 pupils, 31 teachers and 21 others, thought to be either staff or other males at the school last week . The prosecutor added: ‘She was attacked from behind and in darkness, but a trace of DNA was found in the clothes of the young girl.’ Police recovered genetic material from the girl's clothing - but had no matches to it in the country's DNA database. The prestigious school has around 1,200 pupils - around half of which are boys. Chantal Devaux, the private Roman Catholic school's director, told French media: 'This happened during the school day in a confined space. 'The decision to take such a large sample was made because it was the only way to advance the investigation.' Devaux acknowledged all the results could still come back negative, sending investigators back to the drawing board. Pupils gather at the school gates.

In response, Pagenelle said: 'We think there is a strong probability that it's someone from inside, or at least someone who knows the building very well.' A male pupil today said the DNA tests were creating a ‘very uncomfortable atmosphere’. ‘It’s . the sense of suspicious which is the worst,’ he said. ‘Everybody has . their theories, but nobody really knows who the culprit is.’ Some 16 forensics specialists and other police officers were carrying out the tests, at a cost equivalent of some £4000.

"By . Mia De Graaf . A convicted murderer who kicked to death a paedophile in his cell had been encouraged to describe his violent fantasies during therapy sessions, it has emerged. Lee Foye, then 27, was serving a life sentence in Grendon Prison, Buckinghamshire, which houses a 'unique therapeutic community', when he repeatedly stamped on the head of child sex offender Robert Coello, then left him for dead. Today it has emerged Foye's attack came after months of lengthy discussions about his disturbing desires to attack strangers. Lee Foye (left) was 27 when he stamped on child sex offender Robert Coello (right) so hard he died in HMP Grendon, which provides unique therapy sessions. There, Foye was permitted to describe his dark fantasies . In one open session, he even told a group that Coello should be 'put down' for his crimes. Speaking at an inquest in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, today, Patrick Madikate, head of psychotherapy at Grendon's G Wing, said: 'He talked about having violent fantasies about people he didn’t know. There were people throwing stones at his mother’s house and hurling . insults. 'He felt at the time that he had violent fantasies of harming these people.' The . inquest also heard that Mr Mandikate had been told that Foye had . muttered 'he should be put down' about Coello, during a another group . session two days before he attacked him. However, Mr Mandikate said Foye’s fantasies were noted but not viewed as a serious problem as it was encouraged behaviour. 'In . therapy, if someone begins to talk about fantasies it is seen as a good . thing, as they are alerting us to thought processes,' he said. 'As long as they then sign up to not acting on those thoughts.' Grendon Prison (pictured) was opened as an experiment in 1962 to offer psychiatric therapy to inmates . Coello was jailed in 2006 after admitting four counts of rape, 11 counts of indecent assault and one count of penetrative sex, using a snooker cue, on the teenage female victim. Foye was serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of Lauren Strachan, 19, in August 2005, who he had apparently gone to for sex and then stabbed her 47 times when she threatened to tell his girlfriend. He was sentenced to a further life sentence with a minimum tariff of 31 years after the brutal killing in August 2010. Officials told the court there had been concerns about placing Coello in the prison with other inmates. 'I guessed who the victim was straightaway but I couldn’t guess the perpetrator,' said Geraldine Ackerman, a forensic psychiatrist on G wing. She . described Coello as unique in his presentation on the wing and said he . upset other members of his group in therapy by talking about his vile . offences before the group had become familiar with one another and . comfortable discussing their crimes. 'We . suggest people get to know them first before they talk about their . offences as prisoners, and people on the outside, find it very difficult . to listen to details of sexual offending against a child,' said Mrs . Akerman. 'We likened it [Coello discussing his offences before people were ready] to his . offending, as he was forcing something that wasn’t ready to happen.' However, . she said that there had been no feud or animosity between Coello and . Foye prior to the murder and the pair had little to do with one another. Inquest: Officials told Beaconsfield Coroner's Court there were concerns over placing Coello in Grendon . An inmate, named only as SB, said the incident took place as Foye went round cells demanding his CDs and games be returned. Someone told SB: ‘He’s in there doing him in’. 'I didn’t know what he meant,' SB said, 'but then I heard banging from across the hall.' SB looked into Coello’s cell through the flap and saw Foye standing over Coello’s body. Therapist Judith Coucill recalled the session where Foye muttered . 'people like that should be put down'. 'The . group were talking about issues over Robert Coello in that he had been . giving details of his offences to one member of the community,' she . said. 'This member was very angry and disturbed by this.' The . inquest heard that at one point the man who had taken issue with him . got up and left. He returned and Coello later got up and left, followed . by the other man. 'I believe it was at this point that I heard Lee Foye say ""people like that should be put down"",' said Ms Coucill. Coello and the man then returned and the meeting concluded, with no issues reported at a later staff meeting. Grendon Prison opened in 1962 as an experimental treatment prison for psychiatric disorders and is now a unique therapy centre in the UK prison system. Housing 238 prisoners separated into wards of 40, the prison provides daily therapy sessions in groups of eight as well as larger feedback sessions in their wing.At least 90 per cent of the prison’s population are on indeterminate sentences for serious sexual offences, murder and violent crimes.Inmates must apply and be accepted to move to Grendon, at which point they undertake up to 16 weeks of probation on a 'new inmates' wing. This is followed by another three months on regular wings. Throughout, their engagement with therapy sessions is assessed by staff.The prisoner's operational manager Chirstopher Dowthwaite said Coello’s murder was the first violent death in the prison’s history and that violent attacks were very rare as prisoners knew that violence would mean they were forced to leave.He added: 'By the end of their sentence, prisoners should understand their offending behaviour, confront it and obtain help for it.' Ms Coucill said this sort of comment happened regularly in therapy and similar issues were an everyday occurrence. Patrick . Mandikate, the prison’s head of psychotherapy, admitted he was 'uneasy' with the decision to place Coello on G Wing last year. He said: 'It was made clear to me in no uncertain terms that we needed to fill these beds no matter who was available.' He . added that he did not believe Foye had said Coello, from Reading, . Berkshire, should be put down as he was involved in the meeting when it . was supposedly said and never heard the comment. After . his arrest, Thames Valley Police asked Mr Mandikate about Foye . reportedly saying: 'I’m going to take someone, lock them in my cell and . kill them', but he said this had not happened either. Mr Mandikate said Foye had obsessed about building muscles and revealed he had used steroids to bulk up in the past, but also said he had shown signs of good progress and commitment to the treatment programme. The inquest heard that Foye and Coello were never in the same small therapy group but both lived on G wing, so would be together in larger feedback sessions. Richard Hulett, senior coroner for Buckinghamshire, heard evidence from Home Office pathologist Dr Robert Chapman, who confirmed the cause of death as severe head injuries, as well as the prison’s operational manager Christopher Dowthwaite. Mr Dowthwaite added that a report of concerns had been opened involving Coello before his attack, meaning he attended meetings with therapists and staff to monitor the issue. The situation was deemed resolved 10 days before the attack, and at a follow-up meeting with Mr Dowthwaite held four days before Coello’s death. 'He made no mention of Lee Foye when he had his post-closure review,' he said. The inquest is expected to last until next week.","Lee Foye was serving a life sentence when he attacked Robert Coello .

"By . Belinda Robinson . He was the butt of British jokes and even his German allies portrayed Mussolini as a clown. But now a British historian claims the Italian fascist leader was actually a mentor to Adolf Hitler - and says claims that his troops were cowards are a myth. Dr Christian Goeschel of Manchester University, says that the real . Il Duce was a guiding light behind the rise of Hitler - who idealised . his Italian counterpart and did not see him as a political stooge. Political satire: In this Beano cartoon strip, Mussolini is shown as a drunk.  The comic book took many swipes at the leader and the Nazis, with Hitler and his cronies being bested by the likes of Lord Snooty and Pansy Potter . Beano: Mussolini is once again the butt of the joke as he runs from a horse - 'Musso The Wop - He's a Big-a-da-Flop', became a lampoon of Bhim and he was shown as vain, stupid and greedy . In his new book called 'Mussolini and Hitler - a Fatal Friendship,' Dr Goeshel will attempt to set the record straight. The book is due to be published by Yale University Press in 2016. Most films and books portray Mussolini as a fool. However, Dr Goeshel says Mussolini was not the bumbling clown . that history has portrayed him as in popular culture. In the hit 2001 film Captain Corelli's . Mandolin, his fighting forces were cast in an unduly sympathetic . light. Dr Goeschel, an established authority on Hitler and Nazism, was concerned that little new research had been published on Mussolini since the early1960s. He was also driven by the portrayal of the Italian war effort in films such as Captain Corelli's Mandolin, starring Nicholas Cage, set on a Greek island. In the film, the Italians are seen as musical, homesick souls sticking up for locals against the much more brutal Germans. Even on TV, anyone associated with Mussolini has been depicted as slightly foolish. Captain Alberto Bertorelli, a fictional character in the BBC sitcom 'Allo 'Allo!, which ran from 1982 to 1992, was, as a result of Nazi Germany's alliance with Italy and Benito Mussolini made into Colonel Kurt Von Strohm's new assistant. Having something of an eye for the ladies, Bertorelli's main catchphrase was 'What a mistake-a to make-a!', after the occasional blunder. Television programme: 'Allo 'Allo cast Mimi Labonq (left) and Captain Bertorelli (second left) stand with Gruber and Colonel Van Strohm, right, from the Second World War sitcom . However, when Dr Goeschel started his research in 2010 a different picture of both Mussolini and the Italian war effort emerged. He travelled up to four times a year to Italy's Central State Archives in Rome to view the official records not normally seen by the public. While the public have access few bother to make the journey to the outskirts of Rome to view the material. Mussolini had an incredibly tight control over the Italian press and there was little press freedom and many comic strips even praised him for his achievements. It meant that there was hardly any satire allowed under Fascism. Fascists were notoriously weary of modernity and comic strips - which didn't fit well with Italian culture at the time. In fact, comic strips were regarded as Anglo Saxon democracies. Even harmless American hero Mickey Mouse was banned  - although it is said that the mouse was a favourite of Mussolini's children who enjoyed watching it . During the second world war, foreign comics were completely banned and Italian authors were not allowed to use speech balloons. However many foreign comics in the UK and US depicted Mussolini as a clown. A famous wartime cartoon, by Franco Caprioli, was kept secret by his family and published only in 1987. It shows a drunk Mussolini supporting an equally tipsy Adolf Hitler and holding the hand of an infant Emperor Hirohito of Japan. The work was kept secret due to fear of punishment by Fascists. He found written correspondence between Hitler and his role model Mussolini showing the boot was very much on the other foot in the early years of their relationship. Very early on, Hitler had requested a signed photograph from Mussolini. But Hitler was then an unknown figure and the Italian dictator did not bother to reply. The Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 was directly inspired by Mussolini's power grab the previous year. But Hitler messed his own attempt up. It was not until 1931, two years before Hitler completed his rise to power, that Mussolini deigned to send the future Fuhrer a picture. He signed it with his name and date - June 1931 - but there was no personal message. Great friendship: In 1931, Mussolini sent the Fuhrer a picture of himself which he signed and dated . Nevertheless, Hitler responded with a fawning letter expressing his gratitude to 'his Excellency Mussolini' for the photo, adding: 'It is a great honour.' Dr Goeschel said: 'It is only a small detail but I think it is highly significant. 'A correspondence then began between them - which had devastating consequences for Europe.' Dr Goeschel,35, says the Italian Fascists were a senior partner to Hitler until the mid-1930s, and helped the Nazis rise to power with helpful advice, such as gaining the support of the Middle Classes. Mussolini only came under Hitler's spell in the later 1930s - when everything started to go wrong for the Italian leader. Dr Goeschel added: 'We and indeed many Italians tend to play down the role and importance of Mussolini and Fascist Italy, often seeing it as more benign than Hitler and the Nazis. 'The romantic view of Italy has completely overshadowed 21 years of dictatorship. Right from the beginning, they used political violence against opponents. 'Mussolini also breached the Geneva Convention by using mustard gas in Abyssinia and there were war crimes in Libya and Croatia. Friends: Adolf Hitler, right, is pictured here with Benito Mussolini, left, as they watch fascist troops march past their  balcony in central Rome in this 1941 television file footage . 'The Italian fascists killed few people than the Nazis did. But that does not mean it was a more benign regime.' He added: 'Now the time has come to look at this material with a fresh eye and look at it more systemically. My aim is not to be moral judge but tell the true story. 'We need to probe more deeply into this because it is a very powerful myth. Italy has managed to wash its hands of what happened. 'After the war, there was concerted Italian effort to disassociate themselves from the Nazis. 'But the way we deal with our past has implications for modern politics: the Fascist salute can still be given in Italian football games with impunity; fans can throw bananas onto the pitch. 'Some contemporary Italian political parties have a lineage which can be traced directly to the Fascists.' Jokes about Italy's lack of military prowess and faint-heated approach to combat also did not stand up to scrutiny when he examined records of campaigns such as North Africa, Greece, the Balkans and Russia. He said: 'It was a very famous assertion that the Germans had to bail out the Italians out. 'But this notion is a post war myth - perpetuated by German war veterans who regarded the Italians as lazy and cowardly. 'The records show the Italians fought courageously and brutally - but were let down by bad leadership. 'Italians also fought on the Eastern front - and testimony by Russian POWs said they were just as brutal as the Germans.'","Mussolini was not a 'clown' claims British historian Dr Christian Goeschel .

"By . Amanda Williams . Emma Stanfield, a hospital radio DJ, is appearing at Oxford Crown Court on charges of sexual activity with a child . A female hospital radio DJ had sex with a 15-year-old girl after plying her with alcohol, a court has heard. Emma Stanfield and the alleged victim drank vodka before performing sex acts on each other on the sofa of a friend’s house, the court was told. Prosecutor Michael Riley told the jury at Oxford Crown Court that 40-year-old Stanfield knew the girl was under 16 because the victim’s friend had told her. The alleged victim, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, had recently ended a relationship with another girl and . was in the care of the local authority. The court also heard that Stanfield was seen with the girl by a male colleague at the community station 105.1FM in Oxford, and she wrote on Facebook: 'He thinks you’re 17, so that’s a relief.' Mr Riley told the jury of eight women and four men : 'There was a very significant age gap between the two of them. It was obvious this was a young girl. She (Stanfield) knew that she was under the age of 16. 'The Crown says the victim was not only under 16, she was also quite a vulnerable young girl because of her circumstances.' Stanfield had previously worked on Radio Cherwell, a 24/7 hospital radio station in Oxford run by a charity. The jury heard that Stanfield, from Oxford, met up with a friend for drinks on the night of May 27 last year, and ended the night sleeping on her sofa. When her friend left for work the next day, Stanfield began to drink vodka with her 16-year-old daughter, the court heard. Stanfield allegedly told her she was 'pretty' and 'hot' and asked if she was interested in girls. The girl replied that she was not, but that she had a friend who was - although she apparently warned Stanfield that she was under 16. Mr Riley said that after being told by her friend about Stanfield, the 'curious' victim went around to the house. The court heard that Stanfield gave her a glass of vodka before the three of them went to the radio station for a short time. When they returned, the 16-year-old was put to bed as she was unwell. Mr Riley said that Stanfield then turned her attention to the 15-year-old. 'What happened between them wasn’t to that extent without consent,' he said. 'Clearly she went along with it.' Stanfield undressed and the two performed sex acts on each other, including Stanfield kissing the girl’s breast, said Mr Riley. Prosecutor Michael Riley told the jury at Oxford Crown Court that 40-year-old Stanfield knew the girl was under 16 because the victim's friend had told her . Stanfield denies three counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity . After Stanfield left, there was a series of texts and Facebook messages between the two until the defendant was arrested on June 7, it was said. These included the one with her radio colleague, who had asked if they slept together. The jury heard that during police interviews, Stanfield made 'no comment' answers. She denies three counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. The trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles, continues.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . The Jeremy Kyle Show has been criticised for allowing a woman to abuse her teenage sister by calling her a 'crackhead' and a 'silly anorexic slapper'. Leah, 17, was accused of taking crack cocaine and spending time in 'crack dens' in the episode of the ITV programme, which was broadcast on September 23 last year. She also failed a lie detector test over whether she had stolen from her mother - causing her heavily pregnant older sister, Kelly, to tell her she was 'finished' with her family. Scroll down for videos . Under fire: The Jeremy Kyle Show has been criticised for allowing a woman, called Kelly (right), to abuse her 17-year-old sister, Leah (left), by calling her a 'crackhead',  a 'horrible little girl' and a 'silly anorexic slapper' 'Distressed': Leah (pictured, second left, with her boyfriend, Matt) was accused of taking crack cocaine and spending time in 'crack dens' in the episode of the ITV programme, which was aired on September 23 last year . Now, media regulator Ofcom has claimed the show breached broadcasting guidelines by not doing enough to prevent the teenager from becoming 'distressed'. In the episode, Leah could be seen sobbing and breathing heavily as she was repeatedly accused of drug abuse and stealing items, including a camera, jewellery and objects of personal value, from her family. Ofcom said she appeared 'visibly distressed, shouting, crying and breathing heavily' and was 'unable to defend herself' during the programme. In one scene, Leah could be seen shaking her head and wiping tears away from her eyes backstage as Kelly accused her of being a drug addict, a thief and a 'horrible little girl'.

Argument: Now, media regulator Ofcom has claimed the show breached broadcasting guidelines by not doing enough to prevent the teenager from becoming 'visibily distressed'. Above, Leah and Matt are pictured on stage . In another, the two siblings had a 'heated exchange' on stage, which saw the older of the pair shouting accusations at the younger while security guards restrained them from getting too close. Kelly could then be heard shouting: 'If you are going to do something, do it. Don’t just stand there flinching like a silly anorexic slapper'. Meanwhile, presenter Kyle told . viewers that Leah had a 'reputation' with the opposite sex and had . 'slept with 33 men' - to which, the teenager replied: 'Really?' Argument: Ofcom said Leah appeared 'visibly distressed, shouting, crying and breathing heavily' and was 'unable to defend herself' during the programme. Above, Leah protests against her older sister's allegations . Kept apart: The siblings' 'heated exchange' quickly escalated - with security guards forced to restrain them . Later in the show, Leah, who appeared on stage with her boyfriend, Matt, could be seen holding her hands against her head and breathing quickly in an apparent 'state of anxiety' as she received her lie detector results. Ofcom launched an investigation after receiving a complaint from a viewer who was concerned about the reliability of the test results given the distress they had appeared to cause the teenager. Following the inquiry, the regulator ruled ITV had failed to apply 'generally accepted standards' in the episode, which was aired at 9.25am. Upset: In this scene, Leah (pictured with her boyfriend, Matt) can be seen shaking her head and wiping tears away from her eyes backstage as Kelly accused her of being a drug addict, a thief and a 'horrible little girl' It added that Kyle had not appeared to tackle the teenager's distress in 'any meaningful way' - and at times, had 'reinforced' it. In a report, it said: 'The 17-year-old participant appeared very distressed at times. 'She . cried and shouted in response to the allegations of theft and drug . abuse, was visibly upset at references to her family's response to her . alleged behaviour, and at times appeared unable to defend herself and . respond to her older sister's threats and allegations. Presenter: Kyle told viewers that Leah had a 'reputation' with the opposite sex and had 'slept with 33 men' Talk show: Following an investigation, Ofcom ruled that Kyle had not appeared to tackle the teenager's distress in 'any meaningful way' - and at times, had seemed to 'reinforce' it. Above, the presenter speaks to Kelly . 'However, at no time did the presenter appear to respond to her distress.' Ofcom said the show had failed to explicitly reference the . support which had been available to the teenager from its production . team. It concluded: 'As a . result, viewers were not provided with sufficient information - and so . context - regarding the steps that the licensee had taken and had in . place to ensure due care was taken over her emotional welfare and . dignity, and to limit her distress. Separated: Ofcom launched the investigation after receiving a complaint from a viewer who was concerned about the reliability of the lie detector results given the distress they had appeared to cause the teenager . 'The offence caused . to viewers by the humiliation and distress of the 17-year-old was not . justified by the context.' The regulator accepted ITV's submission that it did not intend to mislead viewers about the . teenager's safety, welfare and dignity - nor did it mean to . deliberately try to distress her. It . also accepted that there had been an adequate amount of support and care provided. But it reminded broadcasters they needed to take care when including young . people in shows that involve conflict or confrontation to let the . audience know what steps have been taken to ensure the youngsters' welfare has . been protected. Following the investigation, ITV accepted that 'it might have been helpful' to indicate more clearly in the programme that support for Leah was 'ongoing'. But it added that it would have been 'evident' to the audience that care was provided to her throughout the show and that guests were 'monitored' by staff.","Leah, 17, was accused of taking crack cocaine by her older sister, Kelly .

"By . Sam Webb . A man has been killed and another injured after a £250 million building collapse in an exclusive part of central London this afternoon. The worker, believed to be in his 30s, was killed in the accident at the former U.S. Navy building, in Grosvenor Square, Mayfair. A spokesman from London Fire Brigade said a mini-digger on the second floor of the six-floor building fell to the floor below. The victim was confirmed dead by emergency medics at the scene. The two men had fallen from the second floor to the first floor. Victim: A man has been killed and another injured after a building collapse in Grosvenor Square, an exclusive part of central London, this afternoon . Emergency services at the scene of the accident in Grosvenor Square in Mayfair. The building is being converted into luxury flats . A construction worker, who did not want to be named, said the man who died was from Lithuania. London Ambulance Service, London's Air Ambulance and London Fire Brigade were at the scene. A police spokesman added: 'At least one other person has been injured. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed. 'Road closures remain in place. Officers are also advising anyone who was planning to attend a demonstration in the area from 18:00hrs today that it may not be possible to attend the pre-arranged location.'

The two men had fallen from the second floor to the first floor . McGee, the contractor responsible for the site, is liaising with the workers¿ families . A general view of the site in Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, central London, were the partial collapse occurred. It was formerly the U.S. Naval Building . Grosvenor Square, in London's Mayfair, is the site of a number of embassies, including the American Embassy, which has a significant presence there . It is believed the demonstration is related to the current unrest in Ukraine. Receptionist Salima Cherrad, 26, told Sky News: 'We saw a helicopter here in Grosvenor Square and we assumed it was something that happened with the guys and the scaffolding. 'There were lots of them who came out of the building at the same time and they were all gathering at one spot in the square.' A spokesman from the London Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 15.43 to Grosvenor Square to reports of an accident. 'We sent three ambulance crews, three single responders in cars, the Dangerous Area Response Team, London's Air Ambulance and two ambulance officers. 'Sadly one person, a man, was pronounced dead at the scene by Air Ambulance doctors. 'A second patient, a man, was treated for minor injuries and was taken to University College Hospital.' The building, which is close to the U.S Embassy, was sold in 2007 for £250m . and the new owners planned to turn it into 41 residential apartments. The Abu Dhabi Investment Corporation and property developer Finchatton . then bought the building for the same amount in April 2013, with . planning permission to convert the building into 31 luxury apartments. Declan Sherry, chief executive of site contractor McGee, said: 'At approximately 4pm today, an incident occurred on the construction site at 20 Grosvenor Square which required an ambulance to be called for two workers who were taken to hospital. 'McGee, the contractor responsible for the site, is liaising with the workers’ families. We cannot, therefore, release any further details at this time.' Property prices in Grosvenor Square have increased by a staggering 310 per cent since 2000, making it the most expensive square in London. A  police spokesman said: 'At least one other person has been injured. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed' A mini-digger fell from the second floor to the first.

"By . Mark Duell . In court: Deputy headteacher Gareth Williams, 47, of Cardiff, has pleaded guilty to 31 sex offences . A deputy headteacher who used a spy camera to film youngsters going to the toilet for sexual kicks also downloaded more than 16,000 child abuse images, a court heard today. Gareth Williams, 47, of Cardiff, appeared at Newport Crown Court in South Wales to plead guilty to 31 sex offences. They included eight offences of voyeurism relating to 'filming a person doing a private act in order to obtain sexual gratification', 21 counts of making indecent photographs of children and two of possessing child pornography. Disgraced Williams was arrested earlier this year, where he confessed in court to three charges. While he was remanded in custody, police carried out further investigations and uncovered more offences - dating from 2006 to January of this year. Wearing a blue jumper, he today appeared via video link from HMP Parc in Bridgend where the remainder of the charges were put to him. As each offence was read out, Williams kept his head bowed and answered ‘guilty’ to each count. Prosecutor Michael Jones said the total number of indecent images found on ‘various devices’ came to 16,237 while South Wales Police’s hi-tech crime unit found a further 679 ‘voyeuristic files’ belonging to Williams. Hearing: As each offence was read out at Newport Crown Court (pictured) in South Wales, Williams kept his head bowed and answered 'guilty' to each count . The case was adjourned so the Probation Service can complete a detailed report on the defendant - which includes a psychiatric evaluation. Judge Rhys Rowlands ordered for that report to be completed by May 15 - and sentencing would take place either the following day or after the weekend on May 19. At an earlier hearing, magistrates were told Williams placed a pinhole camera in a house so he could look at the genitals of children as they went to the toilet. The school cannot be named for legal reasons.","Gareth Williams pleads guilty at Newport Crown Court to 31 sex offences .

"By . Damien Gayle . Japan is on bird-flu alert after two confirmed cases at a farm in the country's south where more than 1,000 chickens have died. The slaughter of 112,000 chickens was today under way as efforts began to halt the spread of the highly pathogenic H5 virus after it was detected at a farm in Kumamoto prefecture. Another 56,000 chickens will be killed at another nearby farm under the same ownership, while road blocks have been set up to prevent the spread of the virus any further. Government workers in protective suits carry slaughtered chickens from a poultry farm in Taragi town in Kumamoto prefecture on Japan's southern island of Kyushu where there has been an outbreak of bird flu . The slaughter of 112,000 chickens was today under way as efforts began to halt the spread of the highly pathogenic H5 virus after it was detected at a farm in the area . Another 56,000 chickens will be killed at another nearby farm under the same ownership, while road blocks have been set up to prevent the spread of the virus any further . Officials moved quickly to quash concerns of a possible spread to humans, saying there is no risk from cooked chicken or eggs. The H5N1 virus causes many of the same symptoms as most other types of flu, but develops fatal complications in more than half of cases. The discovery marks the first bird flu case in Japan since 2011 when it was detected in Chiba prefecture, north of Tokyo, leading to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of birds. Yesterday Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga held a crisis meeting with ministers to discuss the outbreak. 'The government will take thorough measures to prevent wider infections,' he told the meeting, according to a report by AFP. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi added: 'As the initial response is key, we would like to closely coordinate with related ministries and Kumamoto Prefecture and take firm steps.' Workers prepare to bury slaughtered chickens. The H5N1 virus causes many of the same symptoms as most other types of flu, but develops fatal complications in more than half of cases . Prefectural government employees don their protective suits. The scare comes after two chickens tested positive for avian influenza, the first outbreak of the virus in Japan since 2011 . Kumamoto officials have already banned chicken farms within ten miles of the outbreak zone from moving any of their birds or eggs out of the zone. Public health workers equipped with biohazard suits were meanwhile sanitising the areas around the affected farms while others tested birds at other nearby farms for signs of infection. Road blocks have been set up to disinfect cars that have travelled through areas affected by the infection, to halt any further spread of the virus. Bird flu affects many species of domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese, as well as wild birds, and is usually not transmitted from human to human. However, when humans are infected it can quickly become very serious. Around half of people suffering confirmed cases of the H5N1 variant die from the illness, according to figures from the Word Health Organisation. Workers in biohazard suits are disinfected as they work in the outbreak zone . Thousands of chickens await slaughter. The H5N1 virus kills around half the humans that contract it . Like other types of flu, bird flu symptoms include a high temperature, aching muscles, a headache, cough and runny nose. But within days, sufferers may develop complications including diarrhoea, vomiting and chest pain acute which may eventually lead to respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. The virus is spread through direct contact with infected birds, an infected bird's droppings, or secretions from their eyes or respiratory tract, according to NHS Choices. Anyone who has been involved in farming, slaughtering, butchering or preparing infected poultry could be at risk, although the virus is killed by heat and cannot be transmitted through cooked food.","Outbreak is Japan's first since 2011, when 600,000 chickens had to be culled .

"By . Julian Robinson . Dressed in blue jumpsuits and crammed in to a courtroom dock, they were once the trusted henchmen of Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. A group of 30 of the deposed leader's senior officials packed into a courtroom cage in the country's capital, Tripoli, to face charges ranging from corruption to war crimes. But although the ruler's fearsome ex-spy Abdullah al-Senussi was in attendance, there was no sign of Gaddafi's sons Saadi Gaddafi and Saif Islam who are also on trial. Dressed in blue jump suits and sitting behind bars, Libyan officials under former leader Colonel Gaddafi attend their trial at a court in Tripoli, Libya . The court case, at Tripoli's Al-Habda prison, is seen as a crucial test for the North African states transition to democracy. Many of the charges relate to deaths during the the 2011 uprising, which expanded into a civil war that eventually ousted Gaddafi. The former Libyan leader was later killed after being captured by rebels. The trial began a day after interim . prime minister Abdullah al-Thinni announced his resignation after an . attack on his family and following the ousting of the previous prime . minister barely a month ago. The . International Criminal Court and other human rights organisations are . concerned over the fairness of Libya's justice system although the . government won the right last year to try Gaddafi's former spy chief . domestically instead of at the ICC.

"By . Joel Christie . A transgender student who will soon be legally classified as a man is at war with his Christian college in Oregon, who say they cannot let him live in male dorms because of 'theological commitments'. The sophomore, who only wants to be identified as Jayce M, has been attempting to establish where he will live next year, having spent this year in female housing. During that he has completed his sexual transition to become a man, according to KPTV. 'I have the right, as any other male, to live on campus with males,' Jayce told. Prepared to fight: Jayce M is on a campaign to be allowed to move into the male dorms at George Fox University in Oregon next year. Jayce recently completed his sexual transition to become a man . George Fox University, a Christian college, says they can approve the housing request due to 'theological commitments' The issue has sparked a big campaign on campus and off, with 14,000 people signing a petition on the housing debate in favor of Jayce . Jayce is hoping to move into the all-male dorms at George Fox University next year . 'I'm going to fight for that.' Jayce is in the process of officially changing his gender on his drivers license and Social Security card, which should be finalized Friday. In the past week, Jayce's fight has grown to more than 15,000 supporters. An online petition was started by Jayce's mother, Janice, who said she is trying to ensure her son's safety. The school has said they are not willing to approve Jayce's request because of their Christian beliefs. 'George Fox strives to be a Christ-centered community, and our residential facilities are single sex because of our theological commitments,' they said in a statement. 'The student's request to switch from female-only on campus housing to male-only on campus housing is one that many institutions would struggle with.' Jayce's attorney has recently filed a complaint with the Department of Education. 'Because it receives federal money, the university needs to abide by non-discrimination standards,' the attorney, Paul Southwick, said. Jayce, a sophomore, recently completed his sexual transition from a woman to a man . George Fox was founded by Quaker pioneers more than 115 years ago. Quaker theology emphasizes social justice and diversity, but the rights of transgender students are still being debated . The college's original decision said Jayce can't live with his male friends on-campus next year; instead, he could live alone in a single room, or live off-campus. Jayce hopes his fight doesn't have to come to the point of a full investigation. If it does, he's prepared to see it through. 'I'm hoping that the school will listen and grant me on-campus housing,' he said. 'For the future, I hope that I'll be able to pave the way for future transgender students as well as any other people that are being marginalized.'

"By . Sara Malm . Scientists have been able to develop potential treatment for nerve and brain disorders such as motor neurone disease and Alzheimer's with the help of a molecule normally found in Silly Putty. Researchers have been growing working spinal cord cells on a ‘carpet’ made from the same silicone polymer molecule which gives the popular children’s toy its unusual properties. The U.S. team found that motor nerves grew faster and more often on an ultra-soft material made from silicone polymer molecule polydimethylsiloxane, than it did on a normal rigid surface. Silly success: American scientists have been able to grow working spinal cord cells on 'carpet' made from silicone polymer molecule polydimethylsiloxane - also used in Silly Putty . The neurones also showed electrical activity comparable with that of motor nerves in the body. The study is the first to show that physical, as well as chemical, signals directly affect the development of human embryonic stem cells. Silly Putty, created by accident during Second World War research into potential rubber substitutes, bounces but also flows like a liquid and breaks when hit sharply. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is mainly responsible for the odd properties that have made Silly Putty a hit with children around the world. The new research involved coaxing embryonic stem cells to grow and develop on a soft ‘carpet’ made from PDMS threads. Important work: The 'silly putty carpet' could be used to develop potential treatment for nerve and brain disorders such as motor neurone disease and Alzheimer's (stock image) After 23 days, colonies of spinal cord motor neurones appeared that were four times purer and 10 times larger than those grown on traditional plates. Lead scientist Dr Jianping Fu, from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said: ‘This is extremely exciting. To realise promising clinical applications of human embryonic stem cells, we need a better culture system that can reliably produce more target cells that function well. Silly Putty was one of the most popular toy of the 20th century, a result of an 'accident' during the Second World War. It was invented by engineer James Wright in New Haven, Connecticut in 1943 as he was attempting to create a synthetic rubber. The result was not able to replace rubber - but its unusual qualities, the ability to flow like a liquid, bounce like a ball, or break given a sharp blow, made it a popular toy. By 1987, two million Silly Putty eggs were sold every year. The mass is composed of 65 per cent dimethyl siloxane (hydroxy-terminated polymers with boric acid), 17 per cent silica (crystalline quartz), nine per cent Thixatrol ST (castor oil derivative), four per cent polydimethylsiloxane, one per cent decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, one per cent glycerine, and one per cent titanium dioxide. ‘Our approach is a big step in that direction, by using synthetic micro-engineered surfaces to control mechanical environmental signals.’ The researchers, who describe their work in the journal Nature Materials, believe the technique could lead to better ways of guiding the ‘differentiation’ of stem cells. Differentiation is the process by which a ‘blank slate’ stem cell morphs into one of the body's more than 200 different cell types. Dr Fu specialises in amyotrophic laeral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease. The illness, suffered by UK physicist Professor Stephen Hawking, causes paralysis by destroying motor cells in the brain and spinal cord. The hope is that stem cell therapies might in future enable patients with motor neurone disease and other conditions affecting the brain and movement to grow new nerves. Professor Eva Feldman, from the University of Michigan's medical school, who is collaborating with Dr Fu, said: ‘For ALS, discoveries like this provide tools for modelling disease in the laboratory and for developing cell-replacement therapies.’ Dr Fu added: ‘Our work suggests that physical signals in the cell environment are important in neural patterning, a process where nerve cells become specialised for their specific functions based on their physical location in the body.’","Scientists grew working spinal cord cells on 'carpet' made from silicone .

"By . Wills Robinson . Nine men accused of a string of sexual offences involving a 14-year-old girl have walked free from court after the cases against them were dropped after an old twitter account was examined. The suspects, aged between 21 and 30, were accused of abusing a teenager in hotels and cars in London over six months last year. But prosecutor Samantha Cohen told the judge . there would be no evidence against them, after an old Twitter account . used by the complainant, a then-14-year-old girl , had been examined at . 'the highest level' of the Crown Prosecution Service and the police. Released: The nine men charged with a string of sexual offences were told they were free to go after an old Twitter account was examined . Desmond Agyei, 23, Edward Kofi Edunya, 23, Perry Murray, 24, David Sarpong, 23, Adedeji Atitebi, 21, Austin Odisi, 24, Justin Maynard, 23, Olanrewaju Sonde, 24 and Thamsanqa Sibanda, 30 - had originally been charged with 28 offences, including several rapes. It comes 48 hours after Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell was cleared of 12 child sex offences at Manchester Crown Court. The men, from London, remained silent as Judge John Bevan recorded not guilty verdicts. Friends and relatives in a packed public gallery applauded as the men walked free. Speaking as he left the courtroom, Mr Sonde said: 'It’s just a relief that this is finally over.' The precise content of the Tweets was not disclosed to the Old Bailey, but prosecutor Samantha Cohen said they had been reviewed at the ‘highest level.’ Social media: Prosecutors said the old Twitter account in question had been examined at the highest level . ‘The consequence of the review of that material which has been conducted at the highest level is that there is no longer a realistic prospect of a conviction of any defendant on any charge on the indictment,’ she said. ‘For that reason the Crown offer no evidence against the defendants in this case.’ She added: ‘This Twitter material had come to light because it had not be disclosed on two occasions by the complainant. Judge John Bevan said: ‘It has been considered with very great care and it is not for me to go into it. ‘It is unfortunate that it has happened so late and it is unfortunate that the defendants have been in custody.’","The suspects, aged between 21 and 30, cleared of abusing the teenager .

"By . Richard Spillett . Girls born to fathers older than 30 or younger than 20 have a greater risk of developing cancer in later life, according to a new study. Research found women whose fathers were younger than 20 at the time of their birth were nearly twice as likely to develop ovarian cancer in later life than those whose fathers were aged 25 to 29. The daughters of teenage fathers were also 35 per cent more likely to develop breast cancer, researchers discovered. New research shows that baby girls born to fathers older than 30 or younger 20 face a greater risk of developing certain cancers in later life . The study, due to be presented today, also found girls born to fathers aged 30 to 34 have a 25 per cent higher risk of cancer of the uterus than those whose fathers were in their late twenties. The research, prepared at the City of Hope institute in California, examined more than 133,000 women in the US state between 1995 and 2010. More than 5,300 of the women were diagnosed with breast cancer, 515 with ovarian cancer and more than 1,100 with endometrial cancer â€” cancer of the lining of the uterus. The study follows similar research that has examined how parents' age at the time of birth affects a their children's general health. Researchers were surprised at the apparent risk posed to girls born to teenage and younger fathers . But it is one of the first to focus specifically on the daughter's risk of developing the three main hormone-related cancers in adulthood. While researchers were not surprised to find a relationship between older fathers and an increased risk of hormone-related cancers, there were no previous studies suggesting girls born to younger and teenage fathers were also at greater risk. Yani Lu, who led the study, said: 'Our findings indicate that parental age, especially paternal age, at conception appears to be associated with a wide range of effects on the health and development of the offspring. 'We observed that young paternal age, as well as advanced paternal age, increase the risk of breast cancer. We also found that young paternal age increases the risk of ovarian cancer.' Researchers also pointed out that, while the study found a connection between a daughterâ€™s risk of cancer and her father's age when she was born, it did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. The study was due to be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research's (AACR) annual meeting in San Diego today.","Girls born to fathers younger than 20 have higher risk of breast cancer .

Mickelsen Safeguard Complex, became fully operation in 1975 . Radar: The pyramid building at the Complex is a radar facility that scanned the sky for any incoming objects that could harm the U.S. Armed and dangerous: While operational, the pyramid was armed with 30 Spartan missiles and 16 of the shorter-range Sprint missiles . Construction of the Complex was completed in 1975. The Complex's pyramid served as its Missile Site Radar base that essentially scanned all directions in search of airborne objects that may pose a threat to the U.S. The pyramid-shaped radar facility was complete with 30 Spartan missiles and 16 of the shorter-range Sprints missiles, all of which were held in underground launch silos. The location of the pyramid is cryptically explained as 'Northeast of Tactical Road; southeast of Tactical Road South' - a sparsely populated section of one of the most sparsely populated states in the U.S. As a whole, the Complex was armed with launch and control pads for 30 LIM-49 Spartan anti-ballistic missiles, and 70 shorter-range Sprint anti-ballistic missiles in support of the Army's Safeguard anti-ballistic missile program. Video from YouTube . Launch sites: The facility held ICBMs in several underground launch bunkers scattered throughout the Complex . General: The Complex is named for Stanley R. Mickelsen, a former commanding general of the U.S. Army Air Defense Command . On February 10, 1976, the site was officially deactivated - after less than a year of being operational. The Library of Congress, however, has a stunning set of images that shows the various states of construction and completion. The photos were taken for the government by photographer Benjammin Halpern and initially reported by Gizmodo. In all, the complex provided launch and control for 30 LIM-49 Spartan anti-ballistic missiles, and 70 shorter-range Sprint anti-ballistic missiles . The radar and site remain in service today as the Perimeter Acquisition Radar Characterization System (PARCS), located at Cavalier Air Force Station . Short-lived: The complex was deactivated on 10 February 1976 after less than a year of operation.","The Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex became operational in 1975 .

"By . Ashley Collman . A journalist wearing Google Glass had the device stolen and smashed right in front of his eyes in San Francisco this evening. Business Insider reporter Kyle Russell was covering a protest in the Mission district Friday night, where hundreds had gathered to voice outrage over Google lawyer Jack Halprin evicting tenants from his building. After the protest, Russell and coworker went to a cafe where they worked for an hour before packing up and heading to the 16th street BART station to go home. Business Insider reporter Kyle Russell had his Google Glass stolen and broken on Friday in downtown San Francisco. Above, a picture of Russell taken just hours before the incident . Against Google: Russell picked perhaps a bad day to wear his Google glasses. He was covering a protest against a Google executive who is evicting long-time tenants from his building . Without thinking, Russell kept his Google glasses on instead of storing them in his backpack and it was en route to the station that he had the $1,500 device stolen. In a story on Business Insider, Russell describes the moment he was mugged. He first heard a woman yell 'Glass!' and then the device being ripped off his face. 'I ran after, through traffic, to the corner of the opposite block. The person pivoted, shifting their weight to put all of their momentum into an overhand swing. The Google Glass smashed into the ground, and they ran in another direction,' Russell said. Not sure how to respond, Russell grabbed the remnants of his glasses and chased after the woman but eventually lost her. A cop car pulled up soon after and he gave a description of the woman to them but they were not able to locate the thief. While trying to file a police report, Russell tweeted about the attack and says he first received replies of overwhelming concern. Halt: Friday's protest got heated with participants blocking a Silicon Valley shuttle bus at one point . Friday's protest was directed against Google lawyer Jack Halprin . Then the onslaught of negative reactions came. 'At first, I failed to see the humor in what had happened to me,' Russell wrote. 'I had just been mugged, right?' But Russell eventually realized that his experience having his property stolen was similar to the protests he covered that very day, where long-time San Francisco residents were being kicked out of their homes by a Google exec. For them, the Google Glasses were a symbol of gentrification in the city. 'I was pretty shaken after seeing someone completely disregard my personal space and property without provocation. I imagine that feeling is only a shadow of what dislocated people in this city experience every day. 'And I can see why the person who smashed my Glass did what they did,' Russell said.","Business Insider reporter Kyle Russell was wearing Google Glass Friday night in San Francisco .

"By . James King . A 19-year-old Minnesota woman who had all of her fingers and parts of both her feet amputated after she passed out in front of her house in sub-zero temperatures after a night of drinking last year is on the mend and is re-learning how to do the everyday tasks most people take for granted. Alyssa Lommel nearly died on the cold December night when she passed out on her front porch - her body temperature when she was discovered by some passersby was only 26 degrees Celsius, which is two degrees colder than the temperature that typically causes a human heart to stop functioning. Many feared she wouldn't survive. Scroll down for video . Re-education: With the help of prosthetic devices, Lommel is re-learning how to do everyday tasks . Support: Lommel has received an outpouring of support since she nearly died after passing out on her porch in subzero temperatures . Amputations: Lommel lost all of her fingers and parts of her feet, which forced her to wear special boots to walk. She no longer uses the boots . 'We were all prepared to say goodbye at one point,' Alyssa's mother, Teri Lommel, told KARE11.com. Four months later, and Alyssa is now putting on her own makeup, sending text messages and showering on her own. 'She can already text faster than Mom,' Lommel's oldest brother, Adam, joked. In the fall, Lommel even plans to go back to school at the University of Minnesota in Duluth and living on her own. 'Initially I thought, ""I'm never going to . be able to do anything for myself ever again,'"" Lommel said. 'Once I . talked to (her friend Jess) it opened my eyes that I'll be able to do everything. She gave me hope for the future.' Putting on a brave face: Alyssa Jo Lommel (far left) has undergone another round of amputations, losing all her fingers and thumbs due to frostbite . Moving on: The 19-year-old lost all her toes on one foot and the tips of her toes on the other foot two weeks ago . Lommel was found passed out on her . porch at about 9:30 a.m. on December 7 by a woman and her boyfriend who . happened to drive by her house and noticed she was passed out. 'I saw a girl lying on the stairs and it . was definitely not normal,' said Ellen Johnson, a lifeguard from Alexandria . who found Lommel. 'It was the first brutally cold weekend . we had this winter.' Johnson . says when she found Lommel she was wearing a jacket and Ugg boots, but . no gloves - she says Lommel's hands were three times their normal size. Johnson then called 911 and Lommel was taken away in an ambulance. When she finally reached doctors, they thought she was about an hour away from dying. The . doctors were forced to cut her arms open to relieve the swelling and . attempt to get her blood to start circulating again. They also had to . cut open her stomach to make room for her lungs to expand. Frozen: Alyssa Jo Lommel, 19, was found unconscious by passersby after spending nine hours outside in subzero temperatures . Lommel was dropped off by her friends outside her home in Duluth, Minnesota, after a night of drinking, but she somehow ended up on the porch of her neighbors' house . Frigid weather: Temperatures in Duluth had dipped to -16 to -18, with a -36 wind chill Friday night into Saturday . 'I honestly don't remember anything from . that day,' Lommel said. 'I don't remember going to class, going to work . or anything. The whole day was kind of wiped out. To be honest, I don't . want to remember. I just want to move forward.' Following . the incident, observers argued that Lommel had no one but herself to . blame after getting so drunk she passed out - the fact that she is a . minor only added to the criticism. 'People can say that I was underage . drinking in college and that's what caused it, but in reality had it . been a sunny day, I would've woken up and been like, ""Oh my gosh, what . am I doing here,'"" Lommel said. 'I just want people to be aware that . this happens to people all the time, unfortunately. Beware of the cold.' Dangerous condition: Alyssa Jo suffered severe injuries to her hands and feet from exposure, and her parents say doctors are fighting to save her limbs from amputation . KARE . cites the Minnesota Department of Health's statistics that show cold . winter weather was a factor in at least 26 deaths between December 1 and . the end of February. Lommel was in a coma for three weeks following the incident. She came out of the coma on Christmas Eve. 'Once I woke up, I thought I felt fine. Granted, some drugs were helping,' Lommel said. 'I was ready to go home.' When she noticed the scar on her stomach from where doctors had to make an incision she commented 'badass.' Lommel had come out of the coma, but was unaware that she would need to undergo amputations. 'The hardest part is that we knew and it . was going to be hard to tell Alyssa,"" Teri said. ""We were three weeks . ahead of her in processing all the information because of the coma."" Party girl: Police say Lommel attended a party where she and her friends played a drinking game and she consumed at least 10 tequila shots . Premonition: Friday afternoon, Alyssa Jo tweeted that she was planning to have tequila shots that night . On December 30, Lommel's doctor told her what he needed to do. 'This isn't real, this isn't real, this . isn't real,' Lommel kept repeating until someone eventually turned on . the TV to break the tension. After the amputations, Lommel quickly learned that her life had forever changed. 'There was tears shed and it was . definitely hard, but after a while you realize, ""that's just me,'"" Lommel said. 'That is how I am. This is the new me.' But Lommel's recovery had begun - slowly at first. Athlete: Alyssa Jo boasted on her Facebook page in October 2012 that she had stuck her gymnastic routine . Uphill battle: Doctors are optimistic that Alyssa Jo would be able to walk normally again once healed, but she still has more surgeries ahead of her and will require prosthetics for her hands . Touch and go: Alyssa Jo's parents, Teri and Jay Lommel (pictured) have set up an online journal offering updates on their daughter's condition, which her mother described as 'wait-and-see' According to KARE, 'after only being allowed to use a feeding . tube, she was allowed to eat applesauce. After only being allowed to . consume thick liquids, she was able to drink a Diet Coke. Each time she . went to physical therapy, she was able to walk farther.' After . she was transferred to a hospital closer to her family, Lommel started . having breakthroughs in her recovery as she learned how to live life as . an amputee. The first milestone: Making pudding. When . she first attempted to open the package, the powder flew everywhere. But after some practice, she was able to figure it out - she used her . forearms to open the cap on a milk carton and to pour it in with the . rest of the ingredients. 'That . was another boost,' Lommel said. It also helped her realize that she . was now able to make her 'staple macaroni and cheese and . boxed mashed potatoes dishes.' 'I can do anything if I put my mind to it. It's just different than how I used to,' she said.","Alyssa Jo Lommel, sophomore at University of Minnesota, suffered severe hypothermia and tissue damage to her hands and feet in December .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Johnny Weir is reportedly back with estranged husband Victor Voronov despite a nasty divorce battle that had been publicly escalating since February. Voronov says the divorce is off and Johnny may move back into their home, but only if the figure skater agrees to publicly apologize, reports TMZ. The agreement also stipulates that Weir's mother Pamela must butt out of the couple's private life and personal finances. Are happy days here again? Johnny Weir and his estranged husband Victor Voronov have reportedly agreed to reconcile, but only if Weir pledges to publicly apologize to his attorney husband . According to the report, Weir was planning to move back into their home as early as Monday but the couple were seen bickering over their own reconciliation agreement. Come a long way: Voronov snapped this picture of a bite mark Weir allegedly left on hjis arm during an especially heated fight prior to the divorce filing . Weir filed for divorce from Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi Olympics. The split has sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes. Most recently, Voronov accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary restraining order by sending the email. 'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, . hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the . temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar. Voronov had the restraining order put . in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on . the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him. 'So . on Monday, Victor filed a police report with cops in Rutherford, New . Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal . trouble if the judge finds him in contempt for violating terms of the . temporary restraining order.' Voronov, . 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - including an . affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is . holding their dog Tema hostage. Nasty divorce: Weir, pictured naked on his show Be Good Johnny Weir, was accused by Vornonov of sending  nude photos and steamy messages to men online, and his husband also has nude images of him . Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him . In legal documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out of the closet and that he married him because his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling reality TV. In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him. These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags. Petty squabbles: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage . The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex, claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money. He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner. 'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in. 'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.' Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding husband . He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm. Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov. But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.' Happier times: Voronov and Weir on their wedding day in 2011 and (right) out and about in Manhattan .","Victor Voronov has reportedly agreed move back in with Weir only if he signs papers pledging he'll tell the world he's sorry for the high profile digs .

"By . Jill Reilly . A South African sign language interpreter accused of making up his own signs during a memorial to Nelson Mandela has faced charges for murder, rape and kidnapping, it was claimed today. Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, stood just a few feet from from President Obama and others who spoke at Tuesday's ceremony that was . broadcast around the world. South African news website eNCA reported that Mr Jantjie, who has schizophrenia, has faced charges for rape (1994), theft (1995), housebreaking (1997), malicious damage to property (1998), murder, attempted murder and kidnapping (2003) charges. The website said it was unclear if the 2003 murder case was ever concluded as the court file was found to be empty during their investigations. Scroll down for video . Thamsanqa Jantjie, 34, a South African sign language interpreter accused of making up his own signs during a memorial to Nelson Mandela has faced charges for murder, rape and kidnapping, it was revealed today. Mr Jantjie, 34, stood just a few feet from President Obama and others who spoke at Tuesday's ceremony that was broadcast around the world . It also reported that many of the charges brought against him were dropped, allegedly because he was mentally unfit to stand trial. Mr Jantjie was acquitted on the rape . charge, but he was convicted of theft for which he was sentenced to . three years in prison. The channel could not ascertain if he served the jail time. MailOnline has contacted the NPA for a comment on the claims. Mr Jantjie was today approached by a reporter for the Associated press who asked him about the criminal charges, but he refused to comment. The news is a further embarrassment to South African officials at it was revealed that Mr  Jantjie had faked sign language at the memorial event. Yesterday Mr Jantjie revealed he may have suffered a schizophrenic episode on stage after claiming he saw 'angels' at the event. He . said that his hallucinations began while he was interpreting and that . he tried not to panic because there were 'armed policemen around me.' Mr Jantjie gesticulates at his home during an interview in Johannesburg, South Africa . 'I would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said in his concrete home in a low-income Johannesburg neighborhood . When Mr Jantjie was shown video footage of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service he said 'I don't remember any of this at all' He added that he was once hospitalized in a mental health facility for more than one year. He said he worked for a company called SA Interpreters which had . been hired by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) for Tuesday's ceremony at Johannesburg's . 95,000-seat Soccer City stadium. He said he was paid 85 dollars (£52) for interpreting the event. But he also apologized for his performance that has been dismissed by many sign-language experts as gibberish. 'I . would like to tell everybody that if I've offended anyone, please, . forgive me,' Mr Jantjie said in his concrete home in a low-income . Johannesburg neighborhood . 'But what I was doing, I was doing what I believe is my calling, I was doing what I believe makes a difference.' 'What . happened that day, I see angels come to the stadium ... I start . realizing that the problem is here. And the problem, I don't know the . attack of this problem, how will it comes. Sometimes I react violent on . that place. Sometimes I will see things that chase me,' Mr Jantjie said. 'I was in a very . difficult position,' he added. 'And remember those people, the president . and everyone, they were armed, there was armed police around me. If I . start panicking I'll start being a problem. I have to deal with this in a . manner so that I mustn't embarrass my country.' Asked how often he had become violent, he said 'a lot' while declining to provide details. Mr Jantjie . said he was due on the day of the ceremony to get a regular six-month . mental health checkup to determine whether the medication he takes was . working, whether it needed to be changed or whether he needed to be kept . at a mental health facility for treatment. Claims: Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, claimed the man was simply making up his own signs . Address: U.S. President Barack Obama addresses the crowd while the interpreter stands next to him . Mis-matched: The man's movement's did not match that of the official interpreter, left . He . said he did not tell the company that contracted him for the event for . about $85 that he was due for the checkup, but said the owner of SA . Interpreters in Johannesburg was aware of his condition. Jantjie . said he received one year of sign language interpretation at a school . in Cape Town, and insisted that he has previously interpreted at many . events without anyone complaining. The AP showed Jantjie video footage of him interpreting on stage at the Mandela memorial service. 'I don't remember any of this at all,' he said. Today a South African deputy Cabinet minister admitted 'a mistake happened' in hiring Mr Jantjie. Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu said that government officials have tried to track down the company that provided Mr Jantjie but that the owners 'have vanished into thin air.' Deputy Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities Bogopane-Zulu apologized to deaf people offended around the world by what they say was Jantjie's incomprehensible signing. She says an investigation is under way to determine how Jantjie received a security clearance. South Africa's leading deaf association had yesterday claimed he was a fake and said he was inventing signs. Mr Jantjie has apologised for the incident and said he did not know what triggered the attack, saying he took medication for his schizophrenia . However, in a radio interview Mr Jantjie . said he was happy with his performance at the memorial to the . anti-apartheid hero, who died a week ago aged 95. He told Talk Radio 702: 'Absolutely, absolutely. I think that I've been a champion of sign language.' According to The Sun, Twitter users with sign language knowledge claimed the interpreter repeatedly used signs for 'donkey', 'lightning bolt' and 'prawns'. Eye Witness News meanwhile has reported trained sign language trainers said he also made reference to 'rocking horses'. Braam Jordaan, a deaf South African and board member of the World Deaf Federation, has said he believed the interpreter was making up signs as he went along. The . government, which was in charge of the mass memorial, has said it did not know who he was. Tribute: Military officers carry the casket of former president Nelson Mandela into the Union Buildings in the South African capital Pretoria, the seat of government where he will lie in state for three days . Citizens stood on top of bollards and clamoured to film the historic passing of the cortege on their phones . The ANC has also denied knowing about him although footage from two large ANC events last year showed him signing . on stage next to President Jacob Zuma. The controversy has come during South . Africa's 10-day farewell to Mandela, whose remains were lying in state . for a second day today at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where . he was sworn in as the nation's first black president in 1994. The . death of Nobel peace laureate Mandela triggered an outpouring of grief . and emotion - as well as celebration and thanksgiving - among his 53 . million countrymen and millions more around the world.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A deadly leopard stunned tourists by catching and then 'befriending' a frightened impala. The big cat seemed to shelve its predator instincts as it played and licked the young fawn. The rarely seen interaction was caught on camera by game ranger Chad Cocking, 29, in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Cuddling up: The young leopard rests its paw on an impala in Kruger National Park, in what tourists thought might be an extraordinary show of friendship between predator and prey . Friend for dinner: This leopard seems to play affectionately with an impala in Kruger National Park... but the cordial relationship didn't last long . Mr Cocking said: 'This was clearly far more of a game for the leopard than it was for the impala - but some moments could almost have been misinterpreted as bonding between the two.' Unfortunately the friendship was not to last and the leopard eventually got bored with its own game and ate the impala. The cat was well-known to rangers as a newly independent hunter named Nkateko - meaning lucky. Her mother had died from a severe infection caused by a wounded ear, which had actually been inflicted by Nkateko. Strange bedfellows: Tourists at Kruger National Park, in South Africa were amazed when predator appear to befriend prey . Where do you think you're going! The impala realises this friendship may not last and attempts to make a bid for freedom only to be firmly held in place by the hungry leopard . Mr Cocking was with safari guests when they found the young female carrying a live baby impala in her jaws. The 22-month-old leopard dropped the exhausted impala on the ground and waited for it to try and run away before pouncing on it again. It would then repeat the game. At one point the impala managed to escape by running underneath the tourists' Land Rover, where the leopard was too timid to approach. Bid for freedom: The young impala, clearly showing the injuries from its struggle with the leopard, momentarily escapes the predator's clutches . Normal service resumed: The temporary truce is brought to a violent end in front of stunned tourists as the leopard again grabbs hold of the impala . Chad, from Johannesberg, said: 'I had to make a decision. It was not my role to interfere so I decided to reverse and the leopard moved in again to reclaim her prize. 'Whenever the impala got up to run off, some of the guests would cheer it on, hoping that it would run away to safety, but the leopard was too quick and agile for this ending to ever come to fruition.' Mr Cocking said it was the first time he had seen this behaviour in his six years at the Motswari Private Game Lodge and more than 20 years visiting the area. He added: 'It was a touch sad, as it is never a pleasing experience to watch an animal suffer, but at the same time it was a truly remarkable experience to watch this rare behaviour first-hand.'

"By . Luke Salkeld . Sonia Barnett was delighted to receive a beautiful bouquet on Valentine’s Day. But her joy turned to horror when the flowers poisoned and killed three of her beloved cats. Miss Barnett did not know that ingesting any part of a lily can be fatal to felines, with even a small amount of pollen enough to kill them. Lauren Barker, 14 and her mother Sonia Barnett, 40, Hailsham, East Sussex who received a huge bouquet of flowers on Valentine's Day which contained lilies whose pollen poisoned three of their cats . Despite being rushed to the vet as . soon as they showed signs of discomfort, the cats – Tinker, one, . Charlie, five, and Miss Barnett’s companion of 17 years, Garfy – could . not be saved. Miss Barnett said: ‘Tinker was the first to die. Then Garfy went in my arms as I discussed euthanasia options with the vet. ‘Charlie survived a little longer but . she’s now buried in the garden along with the boys. I loved them all so . much, they were my babies.’ A fourth cat, Sparky, aged three, survived but there are fears that it has suffered permanent kidney damage. Although harmless to most animals, . lilies are highly poisonous to cats. Even if they do not deliberately . eat the flowers, the animals can brush against them and later, when they . wash, ingest tiny particles of pollen which have fallen on to their . fur. Yesterday Miss Barnett, 40, described . the shocking sequence of events after the  bouquet of lilies, roses and . carnations was delivered to her home in Hailsham, East Sussex. The mother of one, who works as a  gardener, said: ‘The flowers were a lovely Valentine’s surprise from an ex-partner. ‘I put them in a vase on the windowsill. I had absolutely no idea they could harm my babies. ‘I realised something was going horribly wrong when they suddenly went off their food.

I took him to the vet but ten minutes later . my friend came rushing in carrying Garfy. Cats Protection warn several types of lilies have been found to be deadly to cats, including Easter lily, tiger lily, rubrum lily, Japanese show lily, some species of day lily, and certain other members of the Liliaceae family. Ingesting just one leaf can result in severe poisoning, and within a very short time your cat will exhibit signs of toxicity. All parts of the lily plant are considered toxic to cats, and consuming even small amounts can cause severe poisoning. Kittens are particularly prone to being poisoned as they explore their environment, and older cats are often affected simply because they brush against the flower and get pollen on their coats. Later they groom the pollen off, and of course ingest the lily pollen as they clean their fur. The primary toxic effects are on the kidneys. Within minutes to hours of ingesting part of the lily plant, your cat may vomit, become lethargic, or develop a lack of appetite. As the toxin begins to affect the kidneys, these signs continue and worsen as the kidney damage progresses. Without prompt and proper treatment by a veterinarian, the cat may develop kidney failure in approximately 36 to 72 hours. ‘They looked terrible, they were . trembling and crying out. It broke my heart to see them in pain like . that. I had no idea what was happening.’ Experts warn that many common lilies . sold in Britain, including the Easter lily, tiger lily, rubrum lily and . Japanese lily, can cause kidney failure and sudden death if a cat . ingests any part of the plant or its pollen. Animals taken to the vet within six . hours can recover but their chances of survival diminish rapidly after . that. ‘I couldn’t believe it when the vet told me what had killed them,’ said Miss Barnett. ‘I can’t believe that the risks of . lilies have been well-established in other countries but we hardly hear . about it here. Thousands upon thousands of lilies will go on sale this . weekend for Mother’s Day and I’m petrified that it’s going to happen to . someone else.’ She and her daughter Lauren, 14, have . been visiting florists, shops and supermarkets and asking staff to put . up warning signs in time for Mother’s Day. Miss Barnett also has four  kittens, but fortunately they appear to have avoided contact with the flowers. The RSPCA urged animal lovers to consult its website for a full list of everyday items that can harm pets. A spokesman said: ‘Many people take it for granted that what is safe for them is safe for their pets. ‘We would urge everyone to check the . sort of items that could cause a hazard because we would hate to think . of anyone else having to go through what this poor woman has had to . endure.’ Richard Dodd of the British Retail Consortium said: ‘Pet owners need to be aware of this and other risks. ‘Flowers are sold at a wide range of outlets but our members  recognise how important this issue is. ‘Generally, they include a warning on the label of flower products saying that lilies are harmful to cats if eaten.’","Sonia Barnett, 40, was unaware lily pollen can blind, paralyse or kill cats .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Part-time workers who have to pay for five days' weekday service lose out heavily under the current inflexible system . New 'flexible' smart cards that allow rail season ticket holders to pay only for the journeys they actually make are to be trialled next year, Rail Minister Norman Baker announced today. The new scheme - welcomed by consumer groups - will be similar to the 'Oyster' card system used on London Underground which deducts cash from a smart electronic swipe-card and charges users only for the trains they use. Part-time workers who have to pay for five days' weekday service yet work only three lose out heavily under the current inflexible system, as do those who have to work weekends. The scheme could also include discounted tickets for those travelling in the slightly quieter periods at either end of the rush hour called the 'shoulder peak'. The aim is to make season fares more equitable and flexible and 'give commuters a better deal on the railways' said Mr Baker. He said: 'Millions of people no longer work traditional 9 to 5. Flexible ticketing must reflect that. It will give passengers a better deal by reducing the money they spend on fares and will spread demand across the network by encouraging them to take less busy services'. It is one of a range of options to 'modernise' fares as part of the Government's Fares and Ticketing Review. The full report is to be published soon. The Department for Transport will run a competition next year to select a train operator to run a pilot on a busy commuter route into London. Lib Dem Rail Minister Mr Baker said a more flexible approach using 'smart technology' was vital: 'Part-time workers and those who sometimes work from home have long complained they have to pay the full price for season tickets even though they do not get the full benefit. 'Under this pilot we will look at how we can give them a better deal and also reward those commuters who avoid the busiest rush hour services.' The new scheme - welcomed by consumer groups - will be similar to the 'Oyster' card system, pictured, used on London Underground which deducts cash from a smart electronic swipe-card and charges users only for the trains they use . Anthony Smith, chief executive of consumer champion Passenger Focus welcomed the announcement. Their own research showed that fewer than six out of ten weekday commuters (57 per cent) did so for all five days. And many worked weekends: 'We need a season ticket that is flexible with changing working patterns.' The Department of Transport said it had committed Â£45m to rolling out 'smart ticketing' across the South East .","Cards will be similar to 'Oyster' card system used on London Underground - charging only for journeys made .

"By . Joshua Gardner . The New York City furrier who sold Joe Namath his show-stopping Super Bowl coat has fielded phone calls from as far away as Dubai since Sunday from customers clamoring for their own coyote. 'He won the Super Bowl twice with this coat,' said Marc Kaufman of Namath, whose eye-catching attire stole the show on Sunday, kicked off days of social media frenzy and has now translated to big business for Kaufman. 'Most people spend $4 million for a 30 second Super Bowl commercial,' Kaufman told MailOnline, 'and I got paid $3,000 for my spot.' 'I have people I haven't spoken to for 30 years calling me': Marc Kaufman (right) is the man behind the now famous coyote coat worn by NFL great Joe Namath during the Super Bowl coin toss on Sunday and the furrier says business has been booming customers clamor for the coat . The furrier said Namath came to him the Wednesday before the Super Bowl, when lows dipped to 14F in New York, looking for something just right. 'He came to me and said, you know, it's supposed to be pretty cold, what do you have,' said Kaufman. Namath, a longtime fur lover, thought he hit the jackpot with his Super Bowl coat, but it turns out Kaufman's the one who hit it big. 'My website visits have increased 10-fold,' after Namath's memorable appearance, Kaufman said. 'Now we've both won the Super Bowl.' 'Now we've both won the Super Bowl': Kaufman says his visibility has gone through the roof since Namath's appearance, with his website traffic up 1,000 percent . Popular: Kaufman says his Manhattan store's popularity has surged since Namath's Super Bowl coin toss. The furrier's family has been in business since 1910 . Great minds: In that P. Diddy shot where he poses in front of a screen that shows the coyote clad Namath, Kaufman says the music mogul is actually wearing one of his store's coats . Kaufman admits that Namath has seen a surge in popularity, as well. 'He's the oldest NFL player to win the Super Bowl a second time,' joked Kaufman. While the phone is ringing off the hook with people across the globe trying to get their hands on the luxurious coat, Kaufman says even if he had a million, Namath wore that coat on Sunday like no one else could. 'That coat is 100 percent Joe,' he said. 'It has to be a certain look, a sporty look, this piece made the strongest impression.' That impression was a powerful one judging from the massive response. 'That coat is 100 percent Joe': Fur-loving Namath has seen a flurry of attention the likes of which he hasn't received since his NFL glory days...all because of a Kaufman coat . 'He's the oldest NFL player to win the Super Bowl twice': Kaufman has sold to many celebrities but says Namath's appearance has been one of the best for business . 'My phone hasn't stopped ringing,' Kaufman said. 'The outreach has been incredible.' Broadway Joe isn't the only high-profile celebrity who wore a Kaufman coat on game day. None other than music mogul P. Diddy donned one of the furrier's coats at an event he attended Sunday and even paused to take a pic in front of a massive TV screen alongside the image of Namath during the coin toss. Diddy even took the time to post that picture on his social media streams, as well as other snaps of him in the fur. 'We sell to quite a few celebrities,' said Kaufman, whose website features the likenesses of Drake, Vivica Fox, 50 Cent and Keisha Cole among many others. Now, thanks to Namath, he sure to be selling to quite a few more. Famous furs: P. Diddy (at left with Ashanti) is one of a cadre of celebrities who've flocked to Kaufman Furs. Eva Longoria is also a fan and even more notable names will undoubtedly be visiting Kaufman's Manhattan shop thanks to Namath's Super Bowl appearance .","NYC furrier Marc Kaufman has gotten requests from as far away as Dubai since the NFL great donned his flashy coyote coat at Sunday's game .

"By . Tim Shipman . The Chilcot report into the Iraq War has been held up by Tony Blair and must be published soon, Nick Clegg said yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister said that senior figures likely to be criticised by the inquiry should push for the report to be released – nearly five years after the probe was launched and three years after the final witness gave evidence. He spoke out amid reports that the process of declassifying documents to be published by Sir John Chilcot, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with President George W Bush before the war, has stalled. Blame: The Chilcot report into the Iraq War has been held up by Tony Blair (right), Nick Clegg (left) has said . Cabinet Office officials yesterday insisted that the declassifications will be completed ‘soon’. But only after that will inquiry chairman Sir John begin the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process of warning figures like Mr Blair, Gordon Brown and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that they face criticism over the decision to go to war. Mr Clegg yesterday expressed his frustration at the lengthy delays and suggested Mr Blair is to blame – a claim denied by the former prime minister’s office. At a press conference in Westminster, he said: ‘Clearly I think everybody would like for the Chilcot inquiry to be published. Inquiry: Mr Clegg spoke out amid reports that the process of declassifying documents to be published by Sir John Chilcot (pictured), including Mr Blair's correspondence with President Bush before the war, has stalled . ‘I really hope now that everybody involved, including those who know they will be subject to renewed scrutiny, will now accept that it is time. ‘This was one of the most momentous decisions in British foreign policy... It is quite right that as a country we understand the truth.’ A report yesterday suggested that Sir John’s review may not be produced until next year, potentially making Iraq an issue in the 2015 general election campaign – something that concerns Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has sought to distance his party from the Blair years. But last week Mr Blair denied knowledge of the reason for the delays, telling a journalist: ‘I don’t know anything more than you do.’ His spokesman acknowledged Mr Clegg’s reference, adding that he is ‘completely wrong’ if he believes Mr Blair is responsible for the delay.","Chilcot report into Iraq War has been held up by Mr Blair, says Mr Clegg .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The shocking details of how a mother allegedly tortured her 2-year-old daughter before burying her in a shallow grave have emerged. Little Tariji Gordon's body was found on February 11 in a leopard-print suitcase with three bite marks, two cigarette burns, two broken teeth, a patch of hairless scalp and bruises and marks on her head, back and bottom, according to evidence released Monday by prosecutors. A South Florida dentist matched the bite marks to the child's mother, Rachel Fryer, 32, of Sanford, and the woman's DNA was also found on the butt end of a cigarette, which had Tariji's DNA on the burnt end. Tragic: The body of little Tariji Gordon, pictured, was found on February 11 with three bite marks, two cigarette burns, two broken teeth, a patch of hairless scalp and bruises and marks on her head, back and bottom, according to evidence released Monday by prosecutors . Fryer is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter, aggravated child abuse and tampering with evidence and is awaiting trial in Seminole County Jail. She has pleaded not guilty. The tragic list of Tariji's injuries was released following a public records request by the Orlando Sentinel. Tariji died of a blow to the head on February 6, 2014, Dr. Predrag Bulic of the St. Johns County Medical Examiner's Office concluded. He said the toddler suffered major head trauma two to 24 hours before she died, according to the Sentinel. He also told police that if the little girl had received immediate medical care she would have survived the blow. Mother: The child's mother, Rachel Fryer, pictured left and right, is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter, aggravated child abuse and tampering with evidence . Fryer denies killing her child. Instead, . she told Sanford police she found her daughter unresponsive and tried . to revive her. When she was unable to, she said she caught a ride to . Crescent City and buried the little girl's body. The dead child was discovered on February 11, after her former foster mother learned she was missing and alerted police. Tariji had only been reunited with her mother two months before her death. The 2-year-old, her two sisters and her brother were put into state care around two years ago after the child's 2-month-old twin brother died. According to the Sentinel, investigators concluded Fryer had accidentally suffocated the baby when she fell asleep with him on a couch. She tested positive to cocaine the next day. Buried: This is the driveway to the property where Fryer admitted to burying the body of her 2-year-old daughter . Other evidence revealed in the newly-released records includes the girl's blood on a couch, in a hallway and above the bathroom sink. One of Tariji's sisters also told an investigator that Fryer regularly struck the girl because she soiled her panties and didn't do as she was told. 'Mommy Rachel is sick of her, and Mommy said that the child victim can't do anything, run, jump or go potty by herself,' a police report said, according to the newspaper. The mother's cell phone also allegedly contained photos showing a bruised and battered Tariji ahead of her death. Police said the sad images indicated the girl 'had been subjected to prolonged abuse' since she was returned to her mother's care.","Little Tariji Gordon's body was found on February 11 in Crescent City, Florida .

"By . Daniel Martin . The MP who first raised the alarm against Nigel Evans last night warned that Westminster was 'turning a blind eye' to sexual harassment in the corridors of power. Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, said she had faced 'rank hostility' from colleagues whom she accused of turning on her over her decisions to report allegations against Mr Evans. She said senior political figures have many 'questions to answer' over the culture of the Houses of Parliament, dubbed the 'Palace of Sexminster'. The MP spoke out days after fellow Conservative Mr Evans, the former Commons deputy speaker, was cleared of eight charges of sex attacks on young men, including one of rape. Speaking out: Sarah Wollaston said she had faced 'rank hostility' from colleagues whom she accused of turning on her over her decisions to report allegations against Nigel Evans . The case went to court after Dr Wollaston raised allegations she had heard from an alleged victim with the Commons Speaker John Bercow. Mr Evans said he had been the victim of a Machiavellian plot and said Dr Wollaston had 'decided to have it in' for him. But last night he claimed he bore no ill will towards Dr Wollaston. '[If I met her] I'd say, ""Hello Sarah, let's have a chat"", and no doubt at some stage we will,' he told LBC radio. 'It's difficult for anybody to be put in the position that Sarah Wollaston was put in, and then to think, ""What would you do if somebody came to you with something like that?"", and so I don't blame her.' It emerged last night that former Tory leadership contender David Davis had organised a welcome back to Parliament party for Mr Evans, the MP for Ribble Valley, to be held next week. After Mr Evans's acquittal a survey for Channel 4 News uncovered evidence of a culture of excessive drinking between some MPs and young male researchers in Commons bars. Writing for the Telegraph's website, Dr Wollaston said: 'This process was never going to be easy. But I have been truly shocked by the rank hostility since Mr Evans's acquittal, from those who seriously feel I should have done nothing. How can it be acceptable for a third of the 70 researchers interviewed by Channel 4 News to have experienced sexual harassment at Westminster? 'The people who truly have questions to answer are those who have for so long turned a blind eye to the reports of such harassment. I didn't, and don't, want to be one of them.' One of the alleged victims in the case spoke to police last May after telling Dr Wollaston what he claimed had happened. She informed Mr Bercow, who said it was a police matter after being told another young man had accused Mr Evans of rape. In court, Mr Evans said that the alleged rape had been consensual sex, and accused other complainants of telling 'absurd' stories as part of a co-ordinated effort to wreck his political career. Dr Wollaston wrote: 'Following his acquittal on nine charges of rape and sexual assault, Nigel Evans – the former Deputy Speaker – has claimed that I ""had it in for him"". 'Others have demanded that I apologise, and reflect on my role in the case. 'To them, I ask: What would you do if, in a social setting, someone told you that they had been sexually assaulted by one of your most popular colleagues? 'Would you have laughed off the allegation, or brushed it aside? I did not.' She revealed that since the verdict, she had spoken to the young men and 'offered to stand down as an MP if they feel that I pressured them to take the complaint forward'. 'Both are clear that I did not do so, and that I discussed with them the risks of doing so as well as their own concerns about protecting others,' she said. And she also rejected Mr Evans' argument that rape suspects should be given anonymity. 'Few cases make it to a courtroom and fewer still result in a conviction,' she said. 'Changing the rules on anonymity would slash reporting rates even further.'  Dr Wollaston, who is a GP, said she felt she had to pass on the allegations because she was a member of the Commons health select committee which has called for doctors to be struck off if they fail to report serious allegations about colleagues. 'It would have been rank hypocrisy to demand that standard from my fellow doctors, while failing to be prepared to do so myself,' she said.","Sarah Wollaston said she faced 'rank hostility' after reporting allegations .

"By . Ben Spencer . 'Game-changer': The Crispr technique for altering DNA is believed to be so accurate it could help cure diseases like HIV, and also save IVF babies from chronic conditions . Leading geneticists last night hailed a ‘jaw-dropping’ new form of gene therapy which could transform the treatment of incurable disorders. The new technique allows scientists to edit genetic information with great precision for the first time. The breakthrough means detailed alterations can be made to human DNA, potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anaemia, Down syndrome and Huntington’s disease. Scientists believe the technique is so accurate it might be used for gene therapy - replacing faulty genes with healthy ones - on incurable viruses such as HIV and diseases such as cancer. Controversially, it might also be used to correct gene defects in human IVF embryos, allowing disorders to be ‘ironed out’ before a baby is born. Previously gene therapy relied on using viruses to insert DNA at random into the human genome - an inaccurate and risky process. The new technique, called ‘Crispr’, uses ‘cutting enzymes’ to target specific parts of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, without introducing unintended mutations or flaws. Nobel Prize winner Professor Craig Mello last night described the new technique as ‘a real game-changer’. Writing in the Independent, he said: ‘Crispr is absolutely huge. ‘It’s incredibly powerful and it has many applications, from agriculture to potential gene therapy in humans. ‘This is really a triumph of basic science. It’s a tremendous breakthrough with huge implications for molecular genetics. It’s a real game-changer. ‘It’s one of those things that you have to see to believe. I read the scientific papers like everyone else but when I saw it working in my own lab, my jaw dropped. A total novice in my lab got it to work.’ 'Jaw-dropping': Nobel prize-winning scientist Craig Mello praised the technique, which he said even a novice could use . Prof Mello said that the technique ‘lowers the threshold’ for carrying out gene therapy on human IVF embryos. Gene therapy on sperm, eggs or embryos, which theoretically could eliminate inherited diseases in babies, is currently illegal in Britain and many other countries. But Prof Mello said the new technique could address many of the safety concerns of ‘germline’ gene therapy because it is so accurate, although he warned that its use in IVF was some way off because potential ‘off-target effects’ could lead to ‘unintended consequences’. Dr Dagan Wells, an IVF scientist at Oxford University, told the Independent: ‘If this new technique succeeds in allowing perfectly targeted correction of abnormal genes, eliminating safety concerns, then the exciting prospect is that treatments could be developed and applied to the germline, ridding families and all their descendants of devastating inherited disorders.’ ‘It would be difficult to argue against using it if it can be shown to be as safe, reliable and effective as it appears to be. Who would condemn a child to terrible suffering and perhaps an early death when a therapy exists, capable of repairing the problem?’ The technique might also have applications in agriculture, potentially accelerating the development of GM crops and livestock. The Crispr process, which stands for ‘clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats’, was dismissed as ‘junk DNA’ when it was discovered by Japanese scientists in 1987 . It has since been identified as a defence used by bacteria against invading viruses, and last year scientists in California published a landmark study showing it could be used to target any genome. In recent months scientists in American universities have used the Crispr process to edit the DNA of mouse embryos and even human stem cells grown in test tubes. Dr David Adams, a DNA scientist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, said the technique has the potential to transform the way scientists are able to manipulate the genes of all living organisms. ‘This is the first time we’ve been able to edit the genome efficiently and precisely and at a scale that means individual patient mutations can be corrected.’","The new 'Crispr' technique has been hailed as a game-changer by experts .

Fan's fantasy: Left, Riley Brown, dressed as the character Captain America, at New York Comic Con 2011. Right, Sabrina Ruiz, dressed as the character Poison Ivy . 'San Diego was the arena rock show; New York is the acoustic show,' Jeremy Corray, creative director at World Events Productions, told the New York Times. Mr Corray was making his first visit to the New York event this year to promote Voltron: The Defender Of The Universe, an animated series from the Eighties. He added that while the San Diego event has become an entertainment behemoth, New York's equivalent is 'more focused and manageable' for the business visitor. Nevertheless, Comic Con New York has . gone from strength to strength in recent years, with last year's show . attracting 96,000 visitors - ranking it the city's second largest even, . according to Crain's New York Business.

"By . Charles Sale . Andy Gray, recognised as the best football co-commentator in TV sport, will make a dramatic return to the English game on Saturday. Gray is back in the gantry alongside Ian Darke at the unlikely location of Stevenage’s Broadhall Way working for BT Sport on their live FA Cup coverage of the League One side’s fourth-round game against Everton. Former Everton striker Gray has not been heard on a football commentary produced by a British TV station since leaving Sky in 2011 after the controversy over his sexist comments off camera about assistant referee Sian Massey. Comeback: Andy Gray was widely renowned as the best commentator in the game before his Sky sacking . The future: Together with Richard Keys he built up an aura, and he may now return - this time on BT Sport . Since then he has worked alongside his former Sky colleague Richard Keys for talksport radio and for beIN Sports based in Doha. The . fact beIN Sports have agreed to Gray working for BT Sport, even on a . one-off basis, opens up some intriguing possibilities over future shared . football ambitions. It . will cause huge concern for Sky if beIN Sports and BT join forces for . the next Premier League rights auction. A BT spokesman said: ‘We are . delighted Andy can stand in for Michael Owen, who is overseas.’ Shock: Gray pictured shortly after leaving Sky . New ventures: Gray and Keys have sinced worked with talkSPORT, amongst others . Andy Hunt, former chief executive of the British Olympic Association whose flag-waving celebrity obsession during the Olympics was mocked by parody Twitter account Randy Shunt, has had his own postings on social media curtailed. Hunt had kept the Team GB association on his own Twitter account despite leaving the BOA a year ago. But the BOA have now belatedly put a stop to that following complaints. Chelsea's Eden Hazard, shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or that went to Cristiano Ronaldo, posted an Instagram of himself with a ‘Ballon de Bois’ trophy signed by all the Chelsea team. The wooden replica of the Ballon d’Or had been sent in by a Chelsea fan in Romania for the players to sign and Hazard saw the dressing-room photo opportunity. However, credit Chelsea for meeting supporters’ requests for autographs. Hoax: Eden Hazards' 'Ballon de Bois' was actually a present from a Romanian Chelsea fan . One remarkable feature of Manchester City’s assault on four trophies has been the unlikely harmony from boardroom to bootroom at a club that had previously been a byword for turmoil. Insiders believe the departure of Roberto Mancini, Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli — around whom a lot of the madness had revolved — has had a lot to do with the newfound calm. The club’s unity was displayed on Friday when manager Manuel Pellegrini, captain Vincent Kompany and football development executive Patrick Vieira all attended the relaunch of City’s women’s team for the FA Super League. Team spirit: Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira (centre) were at the relaunch of Manchester City's women side . Roy shootout shrink? The woeful penalty shoot-out efforts by England players this week will add to the scrutiny of the FA’s new performance services chief Dave Reddin, whose views on the psychology of taking penalties will be crucial in the build-up to the World Cup. England have gone out of major tournaments on penalties six times in the last 24 years and the spot-kicks by Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones and Adam Johnson in Manchester United’s Capital One Cup loss to Sunderland only underlined the problem. It will be Reddin’s call whether England need to take a sports psychologist to Brazil, with manager Roy Hodgson saying he is ‘interested to hear what Dave has to say about it’. And England don’t have a great track record in that area. Bill Beswick didn’t do much during Steve McClaren brief tenure, and Glenn Hoddle’s ludicrous faith-healer Eileen Drewery was a joke figure among the players. Will he, won't he?

"By . Sean Poulter . A potentially deadly MRSA superbug has been found in British milk for the first time. The superbug – already a problem in farm animals on the Continent – can cause serious and occasionally deadly infections in humans and is becoming a cause of udder infections in dairy cows. The strain of MRSA known as ST398 is resistant to antibiotics, so doctors find it difficult to treat infected people effectively. Superbug: A strain of MRSA has been found in British milk for the first time . In theory the bug should be killed off when milk is heat-treated in the pasteurisation process before it reaches the high street or doorstep. However, some people prefer unpasteurised milk and cheese in the belief it is better for them or tastes nicer. And farmers, vets and abattoir workers who come into contact with the cows and their calves can become infected, allowing the bug to spread into the wider community. That has happened in the Netherlands where the same strain of MRSA has caused illness among nursing home residents. MRSA ST398 was first seen in pigs in Holland in 2003. It has since become epidemic in European and North American pig populations and has spread to poultry and cattle. It is one of a number of superbugs that have emerged in recent years, apparently as a result of the overuse of antibiotics by farmers treating sick animals. Over time the farm animal bugs develop a resistance. Strain: Farmers, vets and abbatoir workers who come into contact with cows and their calves can become infected . The Soil Association, which campaigns for organic farming, is calling for a government investigation to establish the spread of the MRSA and a crackdown on the use of antibiotics on UK farms. Scientists from the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge tested 1,500 samples of bulk milk and found seven cases of MRSA ST398 from five farms in England, Scotland and Wales. They said the high level of antibiotic resistance in the bug means the findings are ‘of significance to both veterinary and human health’. Dr Mark Holmes, a senior lecturer in preventive veterinary medicine, said the discovery was made while looking for a different strain of MRSA found in cows and people. He said: ‘Until this discovery it was always assumed that this form of livestock MRSA was a problem on the Continent, but it has now jumped the Channel. It now seems that it is established in this country – perhaps one in every 200 farms. ‘If it ends up becoming more commonplace it will, sooner or later, cause disease in  people here.’ Dr Holmes said the major question is why MRSA is appearing in farm animals and whether this is linked to intensive farming and the associated heavy use of antibiotics. He asked: ‘Should we be thinking again about the type and range of antibiotics we use in farm animals? Is it wise to have a lot of preventive use of antibiotics, particularly in dairy cows? ‘They get a lot of mastitis – udder infection – because they are driven hard to produce a lot of milk, which is the only way farmers can make money. ‘I think you have to look at the pressures the supermarkets create by screwing the farmers down so tightly on costs.’","Scientists tested 1,500 samples of bulk milk and found seven cases of MRSA ST398 from five farms in England, Scotland and Wales .

"By . Tara Brady . Banks could be ordered to stop using premium rate numbers for customer helplines. Customers looking for help or to report a problem can be charged up to 41p a minute from a mobile when calling 0845 customer service lines. However, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is to launch an investigation into banks using the premium rates. Banks could be told they must stop using premium rate numbers for customer helplines . Last year airlines, train operators, high street stores and web retailers were ordered to stop using premium rate numbers for customer helplines. Banks and finance companies were exempt from the new controls as well as government departments which earned £56million from premium rate numbers in 2012 alone. The measure will be brought into force in June 2014. Now there will could be a crackdown on banks as well as insurance companies and credit card firms. Three-quarters of customer service and complaint helplines charge a premium rate. RBS and Barclays were the first banks to drop the charges six months ago. However, HSBC and Lloyds still use them. HSBC is just one bank which has not yet dropped using premium rate charges . The campaigning consumer group Which? launched a campaign earlier this year to try to get firms to drop expensive premium-rate numbers for customer helplines. A spokeswoman said: 'We're pleased the FCA agrees customers shouldn't have to pay a premium to talk to their bank or insurer. 'Changing the rules so financial firms can only offer basic rate helplines would be a big win for the 87,000 people who supported our campaign. 'Some of the biggest banks have already dropped costly calls so there is no reason why others shouldn't follow their lead. Crackdown: Three-quarters of customer service and complaint helplines charge a premium rate . 'We'd like to see all financial services firms change to basic rate lines as soon as possible, and not wait until new rules come into effect.' According to The Sun, the FCA's Director of Policy Christopher Woolard, said: 'Our consultation will propose the standardisation of the rules so that charges for consumer help and complaint lines are capped at the cost of a basic rate call.' Last year it emerged that Air France, Aer Lingus, Ryanair, National Express and Eurolines were using such numbers for those requesting travel assistance because they were disabled or elderly.","Customers can be charged up to 41p a minute from a mobile phone .

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . Hundreds of diners at an Italian restaurant in suburban New York may have been exposed to hepatitis A in the last few weeks after a waiter there was found to have the liver disease, the county health department said. People who ate at or who were working at La Fontana restaurant in the village of Nyack, about 20 miles north of Manhattan, between March 19 and April 1 may have been exposed to the virus, the Rockland County health department said. The department is urging diners and employees who were at the restaurant between March 29 and April 1 who have not previously been vaccinated to obtain a free hepatitis A vaccination. Local restaurant: Diners at La Fontana in Nyack may have been infected with hepatitis A . The vaccination is only effective if taken within 14 days of exposure and so will be of no use to people who were at La Fontana earlier in March, the department said. The liver-inflaming virus that causes the disease can be transmitted by eating something contaminated by traces of an infected person's feces. The time between infection and symptoms, in those who develop them, is between two and six weeks. According to the Mayo Clinic, your . body will clear the hepatitis A virus on its own. In most cases of . hepatitis A, the liver heals completely in a month or two with no . lasting damage. The disease causes jaundiced skin, itching, fever and nausea, according to the National Institute of Health. Fewer than one in 1,000 cases lead to complications that can be fatal. Exotic travel: A waiter reportedly contracted the disease while on holiday overseas . There was no indication on Saturday that any diners had yet developed the disease. The Health Department will offer free Hepatitis A vaccine to restaurant patrons and employees starting Saturday, April 12 from 11 am – 5 pm, Sunday, April 13 from 11 am to 3 pm and Monday, April 14 from 9 am to 12 pm at the Rockland County Fire Training Center, 35 Firemen’s Memorial Dr. in Pomona.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . This is the extraordinary arsenal of weapons belonging to gunman Alois Huber who shot dead three policemen and a paramedic in Grosspriel, Austria on Tuesday. In these startling images, the 55-year-old poacher's dedicated gun room can be seen in full - stacked from floor to ceiling with hundreds of shotguns. Other shooting paraphernalia, such as shotgun cartridges, can also be seen scattered all over the floor of the room in his remote farmhouse. Scroll down for video . Hoard: Alois Huber's arsenal of weapons, discovered by police in a room of his remote farmhouse . Disturbing: A large pile of deer skulls can be seen in one of Huber's rooms. Police say the poacher would kill the animals and take their heads back as a trophy . In another disturbing find, the Lower Austria Police Department discovered a room of 'hunting trophies' - namely the skulls of deer and other game he killed while poaching at night. An enormous mound of skinless deer heads, still with their antlers attached, can be seen in another of Huber's rooms. It is thought that Huber shot and killed the animals before he sawed off their heads and took them back to his house. He then left their decapitated carcasses rotting under bushes in the nearby woods, police have said. Hunter: Alois Huber, pictured, was questioned by police before he went on a 12-hour killing spree . In Austria it is illegal to hunt wild animals for the 'trophy' of their heads. Poaching is severely punished and offenders can get up to three years in prison. Hunters are licensed only after passing exams that test their knowledge of weapons, ballistics, hunting traditions, different kinds of game and their diseases - and a host of other disciplines. Police suspected Huber of illegal hunting and confronted him on Tuesday morning, pulling him over in his car while he was driving near to his home. The gunman then fled in his car, before shooting dead a member of Austria's . Cobra SWAT team at a police checkpoint. An . ambulance raced to the scene, but the gunman shot and killed its driver . as he tried to give first aid to the dying policeman, police have said. The attacker then fatally shot another police officer at a roadblock before barricading himself in the farm building. Later on Tuesday, another officer who . had been missing was found dead in his patrol car near the farm. The officer was killed . after the suspect carjacked the police vehicle and took him hostage. The three police officers allegedly killed by Huber have been named as Johann Ecker, 51, Manfred Daurer, 44, and Roman Baumgartner, 38. Paramedic Johann Dorfwirth was also killed. Following the shootings, Huber barricaded himself in a farm building near Melk, about 40 miles west of Vienna. Around 100 armed . police commandos and several army tanks surrounded the farmhouse before SWAT . teams stormed the building. Police found a charred body after pushing through a wall into a smoke-filled . hidden basement on the farm grounds. Regional . police spokesman Roland Scherscher told reporters SWAT teams discovered . the body after extinguishing a fire in a small cellar that was . accessible only through a hidden door. Forces: Tanks and police cars arrive on the scene near Melk, Austria . Heavy armour: Army tanks were called in to protect officers following the gunman's rampage . He . said the corpse was so badly burned that it was impossible to identify. However, police assumed it was that of the gunman - who had been holed up . on the farm grounds more than 24 hours before the charred remains were . found. Schercher added that police 'had to . push against the wall to enter the room' and that because 'the . perpetrator could have been hiding behind each corner,' the search took . more than four hours. Police . said final identification and cause of death would have to wait until . forensic experts had finished their work. Killed:Austrian Police Officers, members of the Cobra Unit, Johann Ecker 51, left and Manfred Daurer, 44 . Killed: Member of the Cobra Unit, Roman Baumgartner, 38, left, and paramedic Johann Dorfwirth . They said the assumption was . that the suspect had laid the fire. Austrian tabloid Krone  quoted a friend of . the suspect who said he confessed to the shoot-out in a telephone call from his home . as a police helicopter circled overhead and officers closed in. The suspect allegedly said: 'Unfortunately . it is true. I shot three policemen tonight. 'I am the Annaberg poacher. They . shot me too, in the stomach. But it doesn't matter. 'I shot Burgi (his German shepherd dog) and they are not going to get me either.' The newspaper quoted the friend as saying the suspected gunman had confided two weeks ago that he was schizophrenic. Police . said he fired the last shot about an hour before helmeted officers . wearing body armor and toting assault rifles piled into three Austrian . army tanks and moved in. Scene: An aerial view of the house where the poacher barricaded himself in . State Prosecutor Michaela Schnell says Huber is suspected in the illegal killing of numerous stags since 2005 and is also thought to have been the masked man who attacked a hunter with a knife two years ago, in what investigators now consider attempted murder. However those in the Grosspriel or the cluster of surrounding hamlets dispute the claim. They describe the 55-year-old as an expert who hunted legally and whose hobby turned into an obsession after his wife died about 15 years ago, leaving the childless widower with no close family. Those willing to talk about him after the trauma left by his rampage still don't believe that he was the man leaving the headless carcasses of deer in his wake. Innkeeper Martin Jaeger said: 'We often went hunting for rabbits and pheasant. There was never any talk of poaching.' The provincial government of Lower Austria ordered black flags flown from all public buildings in honor of the victims.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If ever you needed comfort food, it would probably be when you’re isolated in the vast expanse of space. Far away from loved ones and anything that resembles home, astronauts have long craved the type of food that can usually cure a hangover. So when a Russian cosmonaut said that what he’d really like on the International Space Station (ISS) was ‘fried potatoes’, Greek researchers set about to make it happen. The space snack that will never be: Greek researchers claim that frying chips in space would cause them to be soggy rather than crispy because there is no convection in zero gravity . Their initial experiments, funded by the European Space Agency, revealed that it was possible to make chips at forces three times the normal force of gravity. But in a recent paper, the researchers said that despite their early success, fried chips would in fact be soggy if they were made on the ISS. Researcher Thodoris Karapantsios began his experiments by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity, which is when the force of gravity is more than that on Earth. Researcher Thodoris Karapantsios began by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity. He found that at a force of 3-g (three times the gravity of Earth) the potatoes formed a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time.  standard centrifuge machine is pictured . Frying chips in space would leave them soggy rather than crispy, according to researchers. This is because for frying and boiling, convection is an essential part of the process. The . way the liquid, such as oil and water, circulates effects the rate at . which foods heat up. On Earth, the hot liquid at the base of a pan rises . because it’s not as dense as the cooler liquid above. This convection won’t happen in zero gravity causing soggy fries without a crust.

He found that at a force of 3-g, which is three times the gravity of Earth, the potatoes formed a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time. While the chips may not have tasted out of this world, they tasted as good as those fried normally. The professor, from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, said the same effect could be achieved by creating an industrial fryer that spins once a second or a home fryer that rotates twice a second, and he plans to patent a design. At the time, Professor Karapantsios said he suspects that the potatoes would boil rather than fry in space and added : ‘It will be important to know whether we can fry on Mars or the moon.’ But as Philip Ball at BBC Future noted, fried chips would be problematic on ISS.

"By . Claire Bates . Hoping for twins? Eating a yam won't make any difference . It is not just children who may be confused about where babies come from. A survey has revealed British couples also hold on to a number of old wives' tales when it comes to getting pregnant. Popular myths include drinking grapefruit juice or cough syrup and planting a rosemary bush. Even in this day and age some women trying for a baby say they think they have a better chance of conceiving if they avoid mints and will have twins if they eat yams. Others fear that eating strawberries or seeing mice during pregnancy could give their babies birthmarks. Another superstition is that a woman who gives gifts of silver will get pregnant, said family planning experts FPA as they launched specially created Fertility Awareness Kits. While much of the advice dates back centuries, some are more modern and scientific - such as advising men to wear boxer shorts to keep sperm at a more ideal temperature. Surprisingly, the survey found half of all couples do not know many of the basic facts about the best ways to conceive, such as when a woman is at her most fertile for instance. And because they get it wrong many couples then start to believe their lack of success is down to a medical problem, said the FPA, who surveyed 1,000 couples. 1. Yams help give you twins . 2. Boxer shorts make men more fertile (looser clothing may actually help) 3. Drink grapefruit juice to get pregnant . 4. Plant a rosemary bush to get pregnant . 5. Women, give a gift of silver to get pregnant . 6. Avoid strawberries - they give babies birthmarks . 7. Don't look at mice, they give babies birthmarks . 8. Drink cough syrup to get pregnant . 9. Men should take their socks off in bed . 10. Avoid mint . The health charity has launched new fertility guidance packs via its website in order to try and shatter some of the myths around pregnancy. The packs include basic information and guidance plus products like folic acid supplements - more useful to women trying for a baby than a rosemary bush or grapefruit juice. Natika H Halil, FPA director of information said: 'Many people trying to conceive have never been taught the basic facts about their own reproductive cycle. 'As a result couples may mistakenly believe themselves to be infertile, causing them to seek expensive fertility treatments and suffer a great deal of stress, when there is really no need. 'Equally, couples with a genuine problem may be waiting for nature to take its course, when in fact there is a fertility issue and they need professional help without delay.'

West Ham striker Andy Carroll received a bigger shock than his harsh sending off against Swansea when he returned to the Upton Park dressing room...Sky Sports News’ glamorous presenter Charlie Webster was in the ice bath!

She had taken a bow in the centre circle during half-time.

How long can the RFU justify their annual seven-figure spend on their 50-odd councillor blazers whose travel and accommodation to all Six Nations games are met by Twickenham?

No wonder the other unions have refused to feed the English blazers’ partners. Tradition: Stuart Lancaster has no qualms with the post-match Six Nations banquets . In these days of elite athlete management of all nutritional needs, it seems outdated that England’s rugby team still have to attend post-match Six Nations banquets.

So how long will it take them to rule on Cagliari owner Massimo Cellino’s controversial 75 per cent takeover at Leeds? This is especially when his advisors in England, Italy and the United States are strongly contesting that Cellino’s suspended sentences for fraud in 1996 and 2001 were politically motivated, as was his arrest a year ago on suspicion of attempted embezzlement concerning the building of Cagliari’s new football stadium.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From making babies to being struck by lightning, a new map has revealed the surprising things that countries are best at. The map is based on statistics gathered from across the internet - ranging from sources as diverse as the World Bank to the Guinness World Records. Created by online comic and website DogHouse Diaries, the map shows what each country leads the rest of the world in and the words picked - which are written across the country's geographical territory - are in many cases surprising. This is a map created by Doghouse Diaries showing what each country leads the rest of the world at . While Peru might make evoke images of Inca monuments and panpipes, according to the map, the country leads the world in sandboarding, a sport that involves surfing mounds of sand. Other surprising world leaders include Spain and its cocaine use as well as Algeria who leads the way in middle Paeleolithic flake tool techniques. However, some statistics confirmed stereotypes such as New Zealand being the best at sheep farming and rugby. The map, created by three friends based in Washington DC, also shows the Netherlands has the tallest people on average, Canada leads the way in the production of maple syrup and the U.S. eats the most hotdogs. Other surprising world leaders include Spain for its cocaine use and Latvia for having the most women per man in the population . Canada is the leader in maple syrup and asteroid collisions while Honduras is the murder capital of the world . People in Chile are best at staying married, while those in Chad are the most efficient at not wasting electricity, according to the map.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Investigators are trying to determine if Aaron Hernandez has accused the former NFL star of threatening to kill a prison guard. During an interrogation with an unidentified former inmate who served time in the Bristol County Jail with Hernandez, he was asked if he overheard Hernandez threaten to kill the guard and his family once he gets out of jail. Hernandez is currently being held in the Massachusetts jail until his murder trial as he was charged with the June 2013 murder of his acquaintance Odin Lloyd. Life behind bars: Investigators are looking into claims that Aaron Hernandez may have threatened to kill a guard because the man figured out how the former NFL star (seen at an August hearing) had tried to scam his way to more food . TMZ reports that the ex-inmate was asked if the alleged reason why Hernandez threatened the guard was because the unidentified guard apparently figured out how the athlete was trying to score more food from his cell. The former Patriots tight end is reportedly concerned that he is losing too much weight and is trying to get extra meals by eating half of the allotted plate and then putting a bug or unsanitary scraps in the dish in the hopes of getting a second serving. According to the ex-inmate, one prison guard figured out the plot and alerted his superiors to make sure that Hernandez didn't pull the stunt again. TMZ reports that the inmate is now being questioned by investigators, who are looking to see if Hernandez said something 'to the effect of... when he gets out of jail, he's going to ""kill the guard and shoot his family.""' What happens behind bars: Investigators have apparently turned to a former inmate who was serving time at the Bristol County Jail in Massachusetts (pictured) at the same time as Hernandez . Charged: Hernandez is being held in jail without bail for the murder of his acquaintance Odin Lloyd . They also asked if the 24-year-old imitated the noise of a 'machine gun round'. So far, the former inmate said that Hernandez definitely called the guard 'a b****' but he did not say that Hernandez ever said an explicit threat to the man or his family. This new inquiry comes just days after Hernandez's acquaintances were formally charged with murder in the death of Lloyd. Lloyd was a semi-professional football player that Hernandez knew because Hernandez's fiancée was Lloyd's sister. Lloyd was shot at point blank range and found miles from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, and investigators have been building a case around the claims that Lloyd knew about a 2012 double homicide that Hernandez and his friends were reportedly connected to. On Friday, a Bristol County grand jury indicted Carols Ortiz and Ernest Wallace in Lloyd's murder.","An ex-inmate who served time in jail with Aaron Hernandez has been asked about a possible threat the NFL star made to a guard .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Johnny Weir's ugly public breakup with husband Victor Voronov has become an equally out-there reconciliation. The flashy figure skater has fired back at Voronov's demands for a public apology with a bizarre and explicit post-nuptial agreement, reports TMZ. The 5-page document includes a list of no-no's like extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation, denies each the right to be 'in close range' of any exes and requires bi-yearly STD tests from both parties. Peace...with stipulations: Victor Voronov recently demanded a public apology from Johnny Weir as part of the couple's reconciliation and now Weir has hit back with a very specific and explicit, 5-page 'post-nup' agreement . The agreement addresses what was one of the juicier headlines to come out of the couple's bitter battle: cheating. Voronov at one point accused Weir publicly of engaging in threesomes outside the marriage and cheating with a porn star. The post-nup says those things are off-limits, as are aggressive flirting, oral sex and hookup via social apps like Grindr. While presumably legally binding, the agreement does not cease to be crafted in the most Johnny Weir of ways. Come a long way: Voronov snapped this picture of a bite mark Weir allegedly left on hjis arm during an especially heated fight prior to the divorce filing. Now, as long as everyone follows the rules, such gnashing fights should never happen again . A section about 'ultimatums' in the relationship ends with a loophole for the champion skater. 'If I give you one more day to get your bank records to me,' it reads. 'Then I want to have a free f*** of anyone I want.' The nasty divorce battle had been publicly escalating since February. Johnny . was reportedly set to move back into their home over the weekend, but . only if the figure skater agreed to publicly apologize to Voronov, TMZ reported. Voronov's agreement also stipulates that Weir's mother Pamela must stay out of the couple's private life and personal finances. According to the report, . Weir was planning to move back into their home as early as Monday but . the couple were seen bickering over their own reconciliation agreement, which likjely gave the skater the idea for his own legally binding document. Weir filed for divorce from . Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, . in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi . Olympics. Pettiness aside: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage . The split . sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed . his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages . to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes. Voronov . accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary . restraining order by sending the email. 'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, . hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the . temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar. Voronov had the restraining order put . in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on . the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him. 'So . on Monday, Victor filed a police report with cops in Rutherford, New . Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal . trouble if the judge finds him in contempt for violating terms of the . temporary restraining order.' Voronov, . 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - including an . affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is . holding their dog Tema hostage.

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A woman who was lured into seven years as a prostitute now works with at-risk youth  has spoken out to warn that sex trafficking can happen to anyone. Jasmine Marino-Fiandaca, speaking to SeaCoastOnline, said 'It's very real, and it's happening in your back yard, to girls from all backgrounds, whether middle class or lower class. 'I'm a white girl from America, and it happened to me.' Marino-Fiandaca said she was just 18 years old when she was 'groomed' into sex work by a supposed 'boyfriend' and lured away from her family. 'He groomed me,' she told the website. 'He bought me fancy clothes and shoes, spent money on me. He drove a Mercedes. I felt very special. He said, ""You could make a ton of money if you just worked in these massage parlors.""' Scroll down for video . Survivor: Jasmine Marino-Fiandaca, pictured, endured seven years in sex trafficking before she was able to leave . Soon enough, Marino-Fiandaca found herself working at a Connecticut massage parlor. 'It was disgusting and exciting at the same time,' she said, describing her first shift ever to  SeaCoastOnline. 'Here I was 18 and I just made $80 in 20 minutes.' Marino-Fiandaca was soon trapped, she said, when her 'boyfriend' forced her to hand over her earnings after every shift. When she tried to leave, she endured physical and verbal abuse. 'He would be very violent,' Marino-Fiandaca told SeaCoastOnline. 'Either that, or he would sit me down for hours and scream at me, humiliate me. He'd tell me I was no good, that I was ugly, that no one would ever love me. And he had a gun on him at all times.' The man later ordered her to work at the more upscale Danish Health Club in Kittery, Connecticut, she said. 'The couches were cushy; there was a big-screen TV,' she told the website. 'The customers were a little cleaner, a better class of man. Most were business men. And the prices were higher. Each time was $250.' Redeemed: Marino-Fiandaca shared this cryptic photograph on her Facebook page . Marino-Fiandaca told SeaCoastOnline she stopped working at the 'health club' before it was raided, but soon discovered she was pregnant. Her 'boyfriend' reportedly ordered her to get an abortion. Marino-Fiandaca told the site that over six months she was able to hide enough money and make an escape. Though her pimp later found her, she did not return to sex work. She did, however, develop drug problems with OxyContin and heroin. 'I lost my apartment,' she said. 'I slept on park benches, in people's cars. My family wouldn't talk to me. My parents said, 'it's over.' I loved my grandparents dearly and I couldn't see them.' Marino-Fiandaca told SeaCoastOnline she stopped taking drugs in 2007, and has been working since then with at-risk teenagers to prevent more stories like hers. 'Shame is what keeps you quiet,' she told the site. 'Shame keeps you secretive, because it's too intense. You're only as sick as your secrets. As long as you keep quiet, you can never be free. I want to tell young girls that they're treasured — because no one else is telling them.'","Jasmine Marino-Fiandaca spent seven years as a prostitute in New England .

MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell has been inured in a car accident and is expected to be off the air for several weeks while he recovers. The network put out a statement about the accident on Tuesday morning but gave few details about the host's injuries. They said that O'Donnell and his brother Michael were traveling outside of the United States and got into an accident while riding a taxi. They were treated by local doctors- though the location of the accident was not revealed- and have since been transferred back to the United States. Lawrence, 62, is being treated in New York and Michael is being seen by doctors in their hometown of Boston. The network said that both men are expected to make a full recovery but that will take at least a few weeks in the case of the MSNBC host. His colleague Alex Wagner will take over O'Donnell's show 'The Last Word' on Tuesday night and Ari Melber will take on the task on Wednesday and Thursday.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Two stars of popular new reality series Southern Charm were casting their enchanting spells long before Bravo's camera's starting rolling. Thomas Ravenel, 51, makes no secret of the 2007 cocaine bust that cost him his gig as South Carolina's Treasurer, but less known is his much younger girlfriend Kathryn Dennis' law breaking past. When the local celebutante, political scion and model was hauled into Berkeley County jail for underage drinking and disorderly conduct in 2012, authorities snapped the sexy mugshot of the century. Scroll down for video... A vision in orange: Southern Charm star and politician-turned-felon Thomas Ravenel makes no secret of his cocaine-fueled fall from grace, but less well-known is his girlfriend Kathryn Dennis' 2012 arrest for underage drinking (she was 20 at the time) and disorderly conduct . May-December: 51-year-old Ravenel's relationship with the 22-year-old local celebutante immediately raised eyebrows at garden parties across Charleston, South Carolina . For fans wondering how Dennis gets to . join the soapy series' main cast members in their drunken antics: the . 5-foot-11 redhead turned 21 by the time she showed up to heighten the . show's already impossibly high drama. Dennis . may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate . developer turned felon Ravenel, even with the 30-year age gap. Like Dennis, Ravenel also has a history of booze-fueled lawbreaking. Fertile for ground for drama: Dennis and Ravenel have a knack for having fun both separately and together. One recent episode of high reality show drama showed the couple in a doctor's office as they anxiously awaited Dennis' pregnancy test results, which ultimately came back negative . Not the father? Another Southern Hospitality cast member, self-proclaimed rascally raconteur Shep Rose was also worried he was the father of Dennis' baby that never was . Like gentlemen: In an encounter unrelated to the pregnancy, Ravenel invited fellow cast member Whitney Sudler-Smith to 'take it outside,' where he accused the show's resident southern dandy of sleeping with Dennis . He pleaded guilty just last March to driving drunk while summering in East Hampton, New York last July. The former Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign chairman had his license suspended for six months and was fined $1,400, according to the Post and Courier. While clearly a lot of fun while apart, Ravenel and Dennis know how to have a good time while together, as well. Dramatic turn: Dennis and Ravenel's romance has also created a stir outside the various love triangles . Talking trash: The pair drew snickers and sideways glances upon their arrival at a friend's party . A recent episode of their southern-gentry-on-the-rocks docuseries showcased Dennis' pregnancy scare, though it remained unclear if it was Ravenel who was the potential father or fellow star and self-proclaimed rascally raconteur Shep Rose. Lucky for everyone, except perhaps the show's avid viewers, Dennis did not end up being pregnant. Meanwhile, and despite not actually being a main cast member, Dennis' presence on the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama, intrigue and southern seduction. THOMAS RAVENEL: THE ONCE AND FUTURE SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICAL POWER PLAYER? Thomas Ravenel . Ravenel, who's 48 according to his BravoTV bio but 51 if you prefer to believe news outlets such as the Associated Press, was once a major up-and-coming force in Palmetto State politics. The millionaire former real estate developer held the state-wide elected office of South Carolina Treasurer and had served as chairman for Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign in the state before he was brought down hard in a cocaine scandal. Ravenel was indicted on federal drug charges in 2007 for buying less than 500 grams of cocaine to share with other people in late 2005. He was sentenced in 2008 to 10 months after his felony conviction. And what about now? Besides the Bravo gig, or perhaps because of it, Ravenel is reportedly eying a dive back into politics. The Republican ex-con told Andy Cohen early this month that he likely intends to run for U.S. Senate. 'And should the current U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham be the nominee, Iâ€™m going to throw my hat into the ring as a candidate because I think the voters need the opportunity to have a choice,' he said on Watch What Happens Live. Kathryn Dennis . KATHRYN CALHOUN DENNIS: POLITICAL SCION, MODEL, CELEBUTANTE, SEDUCTRESS . Kathryn Dennis raised the eyebrows of Charleston, South Carolina's garden-partying elite when she dropped onto the scene as Ravenel's girlfriend, but it's not her first lap around the disgraced politician dating pool. The 22-year-old was once involved with Thad Viers, a former state representative who resigned his office in disgrace in 2012 after he was arrested for harassing an ex-girlfriend. Her politico predilections may stem from her background as the daughter of two prominent political families. Dennis' grandfather was celebrated state politician Rembert C. Dennis and she claims to be a descendant of America's seventh vice president John C. Calhoun (hence the middle name).","Former South Carolina Treasurer Thomas Ravenel was put away for 10 months in 2008 on federal cocaine charges .

Beyonce, Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga are pop's poster girls well known for their penchant for glossy, highlighted and sometimes even rainbow locks, bronzed skin and perfect feline flicks.

Nicki Minaj wowed at the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday with a more pared-back look than we are accustomed to.

"Time for a beer: The SunGlass allows outdoor drinkers to use the sun to tell the time . Clever drinkers have come up with an ingenious way of telling the time while boozing - by turning a beer glass into a sundial. Friends Jackie Jones and Steve Chapman spent six months perfecting the glass, which when positioned correctly casts a shadow over the time of day. The pair came up with the idea after Steve asked Jackie, a professional sundial maker, to design a beer glass sundial to use at a beer festival he organises. Six months later they launched the SunGlass - and they have since sold more than 400. The clever device works by positioning it so the sun shines through a ring on the back of the glass onto vertical markings showing the months of the year. The height of the shadow then tells the user what time of day it is - and it is accurate to within a few minutes. Like all sundials, the SunGlass uses local solar time, a method of measuring time using the height of the sun, rather than Greenwich Mean Time, which clocks go by. Because of that it doesn't take into account British Summer Time. The SunGlass has been calculated to work anywhere in the world which is at a latitude of 51 degrees north, including Banff in Canada, Dresden in Germany and Kazakhstan. Ingenious: Sunlight goes through the ring onto the correct month... and then reveals the time by reading across the glass . The SunGlass costs Â£15 and can be ordered online. Jackie, 65, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'The idea for the SunGlass came about because Steve runs a beer festival in Brighton and asked me if it was possible to make a sundial from a beer glass. 'There is a type of sundial called a chalice glass which casts a shadow from the rim of a tumbler, and they have been around for 2,000 years. 'But no-one has ever made one from a beer glass before.' Thinker and drinker: Rob Jones with the sundial glass he developed with his friend Jackie Jones . She added: 'It took about two months just to plan and design the sundial and then it was another four months before the first glass was manufactured. 'I'm very proud of it - there's nothing else like it on the market. 'There's something rather lovely about only having to look to your beer glass to see if you've got time to squeeze another one in.' The earliest sundials date back to 3500 BC.","SunGlass has markings on the side that show the drinker what time it is .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Two teenagers accused of stealing three motorbikes in Bolivia were tied to a tree covered in fire ants . Two men nearly died in Bolivia after they were accused of stealing motorbikes by angry Amazonian villagers who tied them to a tree swarming with fire ants. The men, aged 18 and 19, were accused of swiping three bikes worth $3,700 (£2,200) from a village near Cochabambain, central Bolivia. Furious locals kept them captive for three days, demanding money to replace the vehicles, and eventually threw the men on to the ant nest to force their families to pay up. After the ordeal the two men were taken to hospital where one needed dialysis for kidney failure, and the other is still in intensive care. A sister of one of the men told a local radio station that the two men were only freed on Saturday after their families agreed to pay the ransom. She added that, if the money had not been paid, then the two teenagers would be dead. The ants used, known as plant-inhabiting ants, live inside trees, helping them grow by clearing other plants away that might compete with them for food or light. They are not generally aggressive and will only sting when attacked, usually when somebody accidentally steps on their nest or into their territory. The ants use mandibles to lock on to their prey, before injecting venom which can be fatal in large doses . They will use their strong front mandibles to bite the target, locking them in, before using their tail barb to sing repeatedly. Their venom is an anti-inflammatory, and in small doses can be used as a traditional cure for arthritis, but in large doses can be extremely poisonous, causing kidney and liver failure.","Two teenagers accused of stealing three motorbikes in Bolivia .

"By . Dan Bloom . It was the old man's anger immortalised by a rifle-toting Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. Now scientists have pinpointed the moment kindly old gents start shouting 'get off my lawn' - and it seems it's on their 70th birthday. A 15-year study found that although stresses and strains reduced for men after the age of 50, happiness still began to dip 20 years later. Get off my lawn! Clint Eastwood was 78 when he played isolated veteran Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino (2009) Menacing: Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. Researchers examined more than 1,000 war veterans over 50 . Psychologists interviewed more than 1,000 men repeatedly between 1989 and 2004 and found they had fewer 'hassles' as they got older and daily life became simpler. Yet their overall happiness then reduced around the age of 70 for a huge range of reasons, the scientists found. Bitter: A 78-year-old Clint Eastwood as Walt . They included health problems, declining brain power and the death of family and friends, lead author Carolyn Aldwin told National Public Radio's Linton Weeks. Dr Aldwin, of Oregon State University, said it was difficult to establish exactly what made men grumpy. She told NPR: 'I'm not certain anyone has studied this exactly. But we do know that the most difficult sort of caregiving is for Alzheimer's patients, who often have personality changes like irritability or hostility - that is, grumpiness - which make them much more difficult to deal with.' But the researchers could not say for certain whether the stress of caring for someone else was a direct cause of grumpiness, she added. The study examined 1,315 men aged . between 53 and 85, mostly war veterans, who were part of the . long-running Normative Aging Study established by the U.S. government in . 1963. Groups used by the study have also been used to look at smoking risks, stress and cardiac health. The findings, published in the latest edition of the journal Psychology and . Aging, said grumpiness in older men was caused by a mixture of . changes within the brain and external factors. Around four-fifths of the men said life became easier at age 50, but only 20 per cent said they were happier after they retired. Most of them agreed they were less happy after the age of 70, the report said. The boy's a menace! U.S. films are full of stereotypes of the grumpy suburban man, including Walter Matthau (left) as fed-up neighbour George Wilson in the 1993 version of Dennis the Menace . Stereotype: In Up (2009), Carl Fredricksen refuses to leave his house after his wife passes away . Clint Eastwood, who returned to the screen as embittered war veteran Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino (2009), was only the latest in a long line of suburban grumpy old men on the silver screen. They have included Walter Matthau, who played George Wilson in Dennis the Menace (1993) and one half of the self-titled Odd Couple in Grumpy Old Men (1993). Screen legend Jack Nicholson played a grumpy widower surrounded by people he did not like in About Schmidt (2002), while the animated character Carl Fredricksen in Up (2009) is so grumpy after his wife's death that he refuses to sell his house to developers. There is a shred of good news, however. No matter how grumpy they were at the start, most of the old men finally manage to crack a smile just before the credits start rolling.","Results were found by examining a group of pensioners over 15 years .

But now, she said, the answer was not so clear. She said: 'I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. 'If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congressman or either of my senators - and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know - maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.' It is not the first time Clinton, currently vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has spoken in these terms - she has previously given a similar response to Marlo Thomas, as published on The Huffington Post. And after delivering a keynote speech at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas last month, she said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed. Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her mother, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has said she cannot completely rule out ever running for office . 'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no. 'At the moment I find it pretty discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for public office as an option.' Last month, MailOnline reported on how Clinton told the tech conference what it was like growing up in one of America's most famous and powerful families - and how she learned to debate with them on major issues from the age of six. And while her father may have been the leader of the free world and her mother the U.S. Secretary of State, criss-crossing the globe solving international crises, they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text. 'I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea Clinton said, adding the latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents. Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.","Chelsea Clinton said question of running for office is no longer 'visceral no'

"By . Meghan Keneally . Michael Strahan's new deal to work on Good Morning America has been unveiled as he joined his future co-anchors for a brief introduction this morning. The former NFL player will be joining the morning news show 'several days a week' but will continue co-hosting 'Live with Kelly and Michael' every day. Both 'Live' and Good Morning America are ABC programs and the anchors regularly fill in for one another when on sick leave, but this is the most permanent connection between the two staffs. Scroll Down for Video . A part of the family: Michael Strahan (right) will be joining Good Morning America 'a few days' a week while still keeping his full time gig as a co-host on ABC's 9am talk show 'Live with Kelly and Michael' George Stephanopoulos specifically cited 'the way that you and Kelly (Ripa) all stepped in while Robin (Roberts) was away with her transplant' as an example of how Strahan was already a part of the show. 'It's a family and we appreciate you guys too,' Strahan said of him and Ripa. His introduction at the top of GMA's second hour this morning was brief- with a crowd cheering him in and gag gifts like an alarm clock and a giant coffee mug from his new colleagues- because he had to get out of the studio quickly to head uptown to the 'Live' studios to be there in time for the 9am show. When he sat down next to Ripa on 'Live' an hour later, he said that the introduction was 'good, it was quick'. 'Hopefully it's a match made in heaven,' he said. Strahan will formally start with GMA next week, working for the morning show a few times a week, but no one specified what time and filming constraints would be imposed in order for him to make his double shifts work. Pre-taped segments with live introductions, creative use of the various ABC studios in Manhattan, and scheduling Strahan in the first hour of GMA could all be used as possible ways to make the situation work. Earlier wake ups: The GMA co-hosts wake up between 2.45am and 3.45am to be ready for the 7am start to the show, so they welcomed Strahan to their ranks with a few helpful gifts . The addition of Strahan to the Good Morning America crew became more and more likely ever since Josh Elliott left on March 30. Strahan took over as Regis Philbin's permanent replacement in September 2012 and the show's audience responded with a strong ratings surge. Reports surfaced two weeks ago that the 42-year-old was in talks to join the GMA cast because Elliott's defection to NBC Sports left Stephanopoulos the only male co-host. Now GMA is headed by Stephanopoulos, Roberts, Lara Spencer, Amy Robach and Ginger Zee who replaced Sam Champion when he left in December to head up his own program on The Weather Channel. In the days immediately after Elliott's surprise departure, Strahan told the 'Live' audience that while he had gone for meetings with ABC executives about him working on GMA, nothing had been finalized and no version of the deal would result in him leaving the 9am talk show. Back in his chair: Strahan, seen on the 'Live' set this morning following the GMA debut, said that they hope the partnership with GMA will be 'a match made in heaven' 'This is what I do. This is me. This is my home. I love you,' he said to Ripa on air on April 2. Strahan already has a second job as a co-host on Fox NFL Sunday during football season, and he hinted that he plans to keep those ties strong though the evening filming schedule of the football program could cause an interference with his new extra-early morning wake ups. Details of his contract have also not been revealed, but in an earlier New York Times interview, Strahan's Fox NFL Sunday co-host Terry Bradshaw joked that Strahan was making $16million as a result of his 'Live' deal. Strahan wouldn't comment on his salary but brushed it off saying 'that's just Terry being a knucklehead. I wouldnâ€™t tell him what I was making because he might ask me for a loan.'","Michael Strahan was welcomed on the Good Morning America set today .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A thief was found with cigarette lighters, six watches, cutlery, nail clippers and a pen in his stomach after complaining of pains while in custody. Dariusz Piotrowski attempted to evade being brought to justice by swallowing the proceeds of his crime. The 39-year-old was in custody in Warsaw, Poland's capital, after being caught fleeing the scene of a house burglary. Dariusz Piotrowski was found with cigarette lighters, six watches, a fork, a spoon, nail clippers and other stolen goods inside his stomach, after complaining of pains when he was arrested . While he was being held in custody in the cells, Piotrowski complained of stomach pains, prompting officers to call in the police surgeon. Following an examination the doctor ordered an X-ray, baffled at the cause of the discomfort. But the surgeon was amazed at what the scan showed. The X-ray revealed a number of foreign objects inside Piotrowski's stomach, prompting medics to take the 39-year-old into theatre to remove the items. The operation took several hours and at the end of the procedure, cigarette lighters, six watches, a fork, a spoon, a pair of nail clippers and a pen were left on the surgical table. So unusual was the find, that the case has become an example of strange medical cases in the Polish Anaesthetics' Society, which posted the details on its Facebook page. The caption alongside a picture of the stolen goods, read: 'The patient ate them. 'The . patient was referred by the court to undergo psychiatric treatment . after it was proved the swallowed watches were stolen.' The 39-year-old was arrested in Warsaw, Poland. Doctors spent hours in theatre removing the objects, which Piotrowski stole during a house burglary . A police spokesman said: 'Officers lost sight of him briefly after chasing him, but then found him hiding in the bushes of a garden of a nearby house. 'It was while he was crouched down in the shrubbery that he probably took the opportunity to try to mask his crime by eating the objects he had stolen.' One officer said: 'It was a good job he wasn't standing next to any magnets. You have to imagine that he swallowed these things down without any fluid to help them on their way.' It is understood Piotrowski has told investigators that he has been able to swallow 'unusual' objects all his life - a strange ability that has aided him in his life of crime.","Dariusz Piotrowski was arrested as he fled the scene of a house burglary .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A videographer in Ohio has been accused of interfering with the flight of a medical helicopter by flying a remote-controlled drone through its flight path. Kele Stanley says that he is being unfairly charged and would have landed it immediately if he knew the medical helicopter was en route. 'I'm not an idiot,' the Springfield resident said. Man in question: Kele Stanley said he was shooting the video of the accident as a hobby and would have turned it over to local television stations . Stanley, a father, is facing a felony charge of obstructing official business and misdemeanor charges of misconduct at an emergency and disorderly conduct. He pleaded not guilty during a court appearance Monday and said he's going to hire a lawyer to fight the charges. The hobbyist was flying the $4,000 drone over a crash scene on Saturday morning to shoot photos and video. Authorities said both fire officials and a Clark County sheriff's deputy told Stanley to stop flying his remote-controlled aircraft because the helicopter was preparing to land, and that he refused. The helicopter was able to land and depart safely from the scene. Similar: Stanley was using a 'hexacopter' like this one that cost about $4,000 . Stanley, a 31-year-old copy-machine repairman and videographer, said he flew his remote-controlled 'hexacopter' about 75 feet above where a pickup had hit a tree in Moorefield Township near Springfield. He said he was shooting the video as a hobby and would have turned it over to local television stations, as he has done before. There currently are no regulations in Ohio governing private use of the unmanned aircraft, although law enforcement agencies must get special permits to use them. The Federal Aviation Administration bars the commercial use of drones.","Kele Stanley says that he was trying to take video of an accident in Springfield, Ohio but denies he was in the way of medical helicopters .

"By . Wills Robinson . The mother of an 11-year-old boy who tried to kill himself after classmates taunted him for wearing a My Little Pony backpack has revealed she was planning her son's funeral. Michael Morones' mother Tiffany found her son at their family home in Raleigh, North Carolina, after the suicide attempt in February. He had been constantly bullied at school for being a fan of the cartoon and would tell his mother he was tired of being 'ugly and stupid'. Oxygen to his brain was momentarily cut off after he tried to hang himself and doctors believes he could now be suffering from locked-in-syndrome. Scroll down for video .

Devastated: Mother Tiffany Morones-Suttle, pictured with stepfather Shannon Suttle, said she was planning her son's funeral at one stage . Despite the terrifying experience, his . mother reveals he is 'getting better every day'. Speaking to The Huffington Post, Mrs Morones-Suttle said: 'It's insane to think that we are even here. 'Sometimes our kids think they're strong and they're tough and they can handle everything, but as a parent it's our job to say, ""You know what, this is something I get to handle for you.""' She admitted her loneliest moment came when she started making arrangements for her son's funeral, but now the family are committed to getting his life back on track. 'He gets a little better every day, but there is still a long road ahead of him.' But she said it was a constant struggle because she has 'no idea what he is thinking or going through.' After a visiting a neurlogist last week, she was told her son could be suffering from locked-in syndrome, meaning he struggles to communicate and could be completely paralysed. Speaking with Michael's stepfather, Shannon Suttle, she described how she would see stories similar to her son's and ask herself: 'How does a child ever feel like that.' A concert featuring stars such as Sir Ian McKellan and Sir Patrick Stewart was held in New York last night to help raise funds for Michael . A website set up by his uncle has also helped increase awareness for his tragic story after going viral. My Little Pony is a TV show about cartoon horses and has its own online forums including My Little Pony Reddit. But fans of the show say they are being subjected to bullying and harrassment since the forums went viral. A documentary was recently made called My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic which tells the story of men who are fans of the show and call themselves Bronies. Popular: The My Little Pony animated series has a large male fan base, known as Bronies . However, they keep their love for the show a secret for fear of reprisals. At the time of Michael's suicide attempt, Mrs Morones-Suttle told WTVD: 'He would come home and say mum I'm tired of people being mean to me. That I'm ugly and stupid. 'It breaks my heart that people have no sense of community or respect or boundaries. More than 5,000 children between the ages of 10 and 14 have attempted suicide in the US so far this year, according to figures.","Michael Morones tried to kill himself at his home in Raleigh, North Carolina .

A California couple have been reunited with the wedding they lost two years ago - and it's all thanks to the message that was scrawled on the inside of the band. And Facebook, of course. Jenna Birchim was at Ellwood Beach in Ojai with her family when what she thought was a bottle cap that had washed up on the rocks was actually a ring. Ojai couple Sarah and Greg Lindsay (right) were reunited with a wedding ring they lost at Ellwood Beach two years ago, after Jenna Birchim (left) found it washed ashore and put a photo on Facebook . The power of social media: It took just four days for Jenn Birchim to track down the owner of this ring after she posted it on her Facebook page . The ring was lost here, at Ellwood Beach in California, close to Santa Barbara, two years ago and found recently . As she inspected it, Birchim found an inscription that said 'My Love, My Life, My Lobster'. She thought that meant it belonged to a fisherman, but either wat, it might be just be enough to try and find its rightful owner. Birchim put a photo of the ring on Facebook, which was subsequently shared over 25,000 times. One of the people that came across worked with a woman named Sarah Lindsay. Sarah knew straight away the ring belonged to her husband, Greg, because it was her message engraved on it. They had lost the band at the same beach two years prior. 'I thought it was somewhere in the Pacific,' Greg told KEYT. 'There's no way, I thought after losing it, there's no way it would come back on shore.' Amazingly, the picture had only been on Facebook four days before Sarah Lindsay came across it. This is the moment Jenny Birchim reunited Sarah and greg Lindsay with the lost wedding ring . Greg and Sarah Lindsay are expecting their first child together in August. They said it's 'unbelievable' to have found their lost wedding ring two founds after it was displaced . On Saturday, Birchim met with the Lindsays to give them back their ring. 'Totally resorted my faith in humanity,' Greg said. 'I was like wow, there are still honest good people out here like Jenn, to be able to do the right thing. So it was pretty cool.' But hang on, what does 'My Lobster' mean? Turns out it is a nickname Sarah and Greg have for each other, based on an episode of Friends.

A 13-year-old cancer sufferer who used his Make-a-Wish request to build a playground for his friends has died. Jose Montano from South Bay, San Diego, passed away on Sunday, just five days before what would have been the third anniversary of his diagnosis.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Vasectomies could be banned in Iran as abortion rules in the country are tightened to help boost the birthrate. Iran's parliament are set to make a U-turn on progressive family planning laws, to counteract an ageing population and double the country's population from 77 million to around 150 million. Tehran's conservative-dominated parliament, the Majlis, voted in favour of debating the move, which could include punishments for those doctors offering contraceptive services and abortions. The Iranian news agency Fars reported the majority of delegates voted in favour of the measures. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has repeatedly condemned his country's family planning laws. The majority of the country's politicians have voted in favour of debating plans to outlaw vasectomies and abortions to help boost the population . Last year the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned the country's current policy on contraception, saying it too closely reflected western lifestyles. The 74-year-old said, in October: 'If we move forward like this, we will be a country of elderly people in a not too distant future. 'Why do some couples prefer to have one... or two children? Why do men or women avoid having children through different means? 'The reasons need to be studied. We are not a country of 75 million, we have [the capacity] to become at least 150 million people, if not more,' reported Fars. Twenty years ago Iran introduced its birth control programme, which included subsidised vasectomies and free condoms. But in light of Khamenei's comments and views, the authorities have curbed the government budget for family planning. It means men can no longer be sterilised at a subsidised rate. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, families were strongly encouraged to contribute to a baby boom demanded by leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who wanted fast population growth to contribute to a '20 million member army' in support of the ruling theocracy. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad criticised the progressive family planning laws, offering money to couples who had children . In 1986, toward the end of the eight-year war with Iraq, census figures show the population's growth rate reached 3.9 percent — among the highest in the world at the time and in line with Persian traditions that favor big families. But the leadership just as quickly hit the brakes in the 1990s, fearing a galloping population could overwhelm the economy. Iran became a regional leader in family-planning options, including offering free or subsidised condoms and other contraceptives, and issuing religious edicts in favor of vasectomies. One clinic in Tehran promoted its vasectomy services in huge letters atop a water tower. Banners at public health care centers urged smaller families as a path to a better life. By 2011, the most recent period for which figures are available, Iran's population growth had fallen to one of the lowest in region — 1.3 percent. The official policy changes began in 2005 after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who called the birth control measures ungodly and a Western import. In 2009, he unveiled proposals for each new baby to receive $950 in a government bank account and then get $95 every year until reaching 18. Kamiar Alaei, a Harvard University alumnus who has been jailed in Iran along with his brother for pioneering Aids treatment, said he is concerned the U-turn could cause a rise in the number of women dying during childbirth. He told the Guardian: 'More than half of the population consists of young people between the age of 20 and 30… but they are not able to procreate because social, economic problems are stopping them from marriage. 'We have enough young people who will procreate when they marry in the coming years. 'Slashing contraceptive services altogether will only increase unintentional abortion and maternal mortality.'","Iran's parliament has voted to debate a U-turn on its progressive family laws .

"By . Reuters . A Munford, Alabama, man who tried to hire members of the Ku Klux Klan to torture and murder his African-American neighbor was sentenced on Monday to six years in prison. Allen Wayne 'Big Dad' Morgan, 30, pleaded guilty in October to charges of using interstate facilities in an attempt to commit a murder for hire.

Maurice Mosley, of having an affair with his wife. Allen Wayne 'Big Dad' Morgan of Munford, Alabama was sentenced to six years in prison Monday for attempting to hire the KKK to kill his black neighbour . Other reports claim that Morgan believed Mosley had raped his wife. Mosley is a convicted sex offender. Morgan wanted the man to have 'his d**k cut off' and to 'die a slow, painful death,' according to an audiotape of him that included racial slurs that was played in the courtroom sentencing trial. 'I want this man hung from a tree like he is an animal. I want his d*** cut off, and I want him cut. You're a hunting man right?' Morgan told an undercover FBI agent posing as a KKK hit man, according to an AL.com report. 'I want him hung from a tree and gutted.' In issuing the sentencing, U.S. District Judge Karon Bowdre described the case as a 'horrible soap opera.' The judge reduced the sentence, citing Morgan's service in the military. His lawyers argued that Morgan suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after he served in 175 combat missions in Iraq.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . More than 100 female pupils have been abducted from a Nigerian secondary school by Islamist insurgents, officials confirmed today. Police commissioner Tanko Lawan said the girls were abducted Monday night from a school in Chibok, Borno state. They were ordered on to the back of a lorry - with some escaping and running for their lives. A State Security Service official said gunmen killed a soldier and police officer guarding the school and took off with at least 100 students. Gunmen abducted a group of girls from a secondary school in Chibok, Nigeria late Monday night, officials say . President Goodluck Jonathan at the scene of the bombing, thought to have been carried out by Boko Haram . The men are believed to be members of the Boko Haram . Islamist group which has attacked schools in the northeast before as . part of their anti-government rebellion. The military did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Education Commissioner for Borno State Inuwa Kubo confirmed the incident at Chibok. He told reporters authorities were still trying to confirm the exact number of girls abducted as several students fled into the bush in the darkness during the attack. Audu Musa, who teaches in another public school in the area, said: 'Over 100 female students in our government secondary school at Chibok have been abducted. 'Musa . said he saw eight bodies in the area on Tuesday morning, but did not . give the identity of the victims. Things are very bad here and everybody . is sad,' he said. Twin blasts at a bus station packed with morning commuters on the outskirts of Nigeria's capital killed up to 75 people, reports suggest . Borno state's education authorities had last month ordered all of its schools closed to protect children after Islamists killed dozens of pupils in a February attack against a boarding school in neighbouring Yobe state. But a Borno education official, who asked not to be named, said the female students had been back at the Chibok school writing exams. Boko Haram, which in the Hausa language means broadly 'Western education is sinful', says it wants to carve out a separate Islamic state in Nigeria and has targeted schools, as well as Christian churches and police and government offices, in its violent insurrection against the Nigerian state. The raid on the school followed a bomb blast on Monday at a crowded bus station on the outskirts of the Nigerian capital Abuja, which killed more than 70 people. President Goodluck Jonathan said he suspected Boko Haram was behind the bombing. Extremists also are blamed for Monday . morning's explosion at a busy bus station in Nigeria's capital that . killed at least 75 people and wounded 141.","100 females taken from school in Chibok, Borno state, officials confirmed .

"By . Mia De Graaf . An intricate wooden ornament used as a doorstop for 40 years has turned out to be a Chinese relic worth over £250,000. The nine-inch-tall item is a carved brush pot dating back to the late 18th century when it would have been used to store calligraphers’ brushes. It was handed down generations until it reached the unnamed husband and wife, who used it to prop open their living room door. The intricate wooden ornament dates back 300 years but its owners, unaware, used it to prop open a door . Hoping to buy a car, the pair invited an auctioneer to their cottage home in Hertfordshire to value some other ornaments. But expert Richard Harrison was stunned when he spotted the brush pot on the floor, instantly recognising it as a Chinese masterpiece. 'It was on the floor in the living room being used to keep the door open,' said Mr Harrison. 'I knew what it was but just not how good it was. 'As soon as we were able to share the details of this brush pot with our network in China, it became clear that interest in this piece was going to be phenomenal.' At least 300 years old, the pot was crafted during the reign of Chinese emperor Quinlong. The carvings around the nine-inch-tall pot are classic designs of the Quinlong era in 18th century China . Despite its mistaken identity, auctioneers expect to see bidders offering up to £250,000 for the item . The brush pot, which is 12 inches wide, is a rare example of Zitan artwork and is carved from a single piece of wood. Mr Harrison said its heritage could see bidders offer up to £250,000: ‘We gave it a pre-sale estimate of £20,000 to £30,000 which the owners were gobsmacked with and very happy with. ‘But that price has encouraged many interested parties. ‘We expect our phone lines to be fully booked on the day of the sale and we know many Chinese specialists are travelling to our auction room specially to be able to bid in person. ‘With that level of interest, we could see it realise a sum of a quarter-of-a-million pounds.’ Originally, it would have been used to store calligraphers' brushes. It has since been handed down generations . The couple in Hertfordshire were shocked by the price prediction as they tried to sell less valuable items . The intricate figures show hundreds of boys setting of firecrackers and climbing traditional buildings . The images show dozens of figures in a popular Chinese subject known as ‘The Hundred Boys’ around the outside. Mr Harrison added: 'It is a wonderful thing. The carving is very much three dimsensional almost and shows figures of little boys doing things like setting off fire crackers. 'It is a real tour de force and is in superb condition which is remarkable given what is was being used for. 'A piece like this only serves to show the hidden value of items which may have been lying in people’s homes for years.'

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A marijuana-smoking mother who left her infant in a car seat on the roof of her car when she drove off, has been sentenced to 16 years of supervised probation. Catalina Clouser, 21, pleaded guilty to child abuse after police found her five-week-old son abandoned in the middle of an Arizona intersection at about midnight in June 2012. He was alive and unharmed. The then 19-year-old admitted to police she had smoked pot at a friend's house before driving off, and didn't realize he was on the roof or that he was missing until she got home. Clouser was sentenced to three months of deferred time in jail, but won't have to serve that time if she successfully completes probation. In court: Catalina Clouser, 21 (pictured left and right) pleaded guilty to child abuse in court on February after leaving her five-week-old baby on the roof of her car in 2012 . Lucky to be alive: Clouser's son (both pictured) was just five-weeks-old when he fell off the roof of her moving car in 2012 . According to police, Clouser had . smoked 'one or two bowls of marijuana' with friends because she was . upset that her boyfriend had been arrested on DUI charges earlier that day.

Immediately after the incident, the baby boy was put in the custody of Child Protective Services, but appears to be back in her care. Clouser was sentenced in the last week by Cynthia Bailey of Maricopa County Superior Court.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Rapper Flavor Flav has admitted chasing his girlfriend's son with a kitchen knife during an argument at their Las Vegas home . Rapper Flavor Flav has today admitted chasing his girlfriend's son with a kitchen knife during an argument. At an earlier hearing the 17-year-old said Flav threatened to kill him before grabbing a kitchen knife, chasing him to his bedroom and plunging the blade through the door. The 55-year-old reality TV star was facing 12 years behind bars for felony assault charges, but had them reduced to misdemeanor offences at the last minute after the court heard he had reconciled with his family. The attack happened at the artist's Las Vegas home in October 2012. Flav, who appeared in court under his real name of William Jonathan Drayton Jr, was sentenced yesterday at Clark County District Court to probation and four months of domestic violence counseling. During his defence statement Flav said he loved the boy, now aged 18, calling him a 'son', but neither he nor his mother were in court. The entertainer was initially charged with felony assault and child endangerment with a weapon, but pleaded guilty to attempted battery and battery constituting domestic violence. After leaving the courtroom, Flav pulled his signature clock necklace from underneath his red T-shirt before speaking to reporters. His defence attorney said they don't expect today's ruling to affect an upcoming felony speeding and driving without a license case in Mineola, New York. Flav added: 'I'm standing here in front of the camera, not behind bars.' Scroll down for video .

Flav was initially facing 12 years behind bars on felony assault charges, but they were reduced at the last minute after the court heard he has reconciled with the boy and his mother . The New York charges stem from Drayton's Jan. 9 arrest while driving to his mother's funeral on Long Island. Attorney Kristina said Drayton was paying fines to resolve that case. If Drayton violates terms of the agreement in the domestic violence case, he could face up to a year in county jail, Judge Kathy Hardcastle said. Flavor Flav has been performing on tour since his induction last year with the rap group Public Enemy into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Hardcastle set an Aug. 18 court appearance to close the case if Drayton completes counseling.

"By . James Gordon . A contestant on the Wheel Of Fortune who ended up losing out on a $1 million prize after mispronouncing the correct answer says a mixture of nerves and adrenaline got the better of him. Julian Batt, a freshman at Indiana University was given more than one opportunity to win large prizes including a one million dollar prize, and even a car, but he kept flouting his own Achilles heel. In the now famous clip of a quiz show calamity, Mr Batt guessed the all letters to the answer 'The Mythological Hero Achilles' but instead of pronouncing it the proper way, he said 'A-chill-us' with a hard 'A'. His answer was rejected by the show's rules and cost him the chance to win $1 million. Scroll down for video... Julian Batt is thrilled at the opportunity to win $1 million and he even guesses all of the letters in an answer, but when it comes to reading the answers off the board, he unfortunately makes a memorable mistake . The 'Mythological Hero A-chill-us' answers Batt incorrectly and his poor pronunciation costs him $1 million . 'Wheel of Fortune' rules dictate that contestants must use 'the generally accepted pronunciation' when trying to solve a puzzle. 'I . didn't have a lot of time to really process,' he told the Indiana Star. 'I was just going to say it how I thought it would sound. You have to . stay positive. You have to keep the game going. And you can't let one . buzzer discourage your performance for the rest of the game.' After . making a meal out of two further puzzles, newspapers and TV news shows . called him the 'Worst Wheel Of Fortune Contestant Ever'. Later on in the game, when Batt had the opportunity to win a car, all he had to do was guess the M and the N in the phrase 'The World's Fastest Man.' Yet again, he failed. Then he had an opportunity to solve a puzzle once more. Instead of stating the correct answer as 'on the spot decision' he said it was 'on the spot dicespin'! Next, the almost lucky contestant has the opportunity to win a car but unfortunately he fails to answer correctly again . Had Julian guessed the letter M and N, he would have won a car but unfortunately he guessed incorrectly . 'Social . media and the media, they're going to say what they're going to say,' Mr Batts said. 'They have their opinions. But at the end of the day, . look at the end result. I won the show. I was the champion of the . episode. Despite what happened in between, if you look at what happened, . I still won.' 'It's the . 'Wheel of Fortune.' Crazy stuff happens all the time. It's a crazy . game,' Mr Batts said. 'With those puzzles that I didn't solve, you have . to keep moving forward. You don't have a lot of time to stop and mourn . that you've lost the earnings that you could've won. 'I've . realized as a student, that stuff happens on the spot. Stuff happens . when you least expect it, and you have to be prepared to adapt and . continue to look forward and not look back.'

Alarmingly, they only discovered the samples had vanished after carrying out a routine inventory.

'The tubes concerned have no . infectious potential,' a statement from the institute said. 'Independent experts . referred by health authorities have qualified the risk as “nil” in . regards to available evidence and literature on the survival of the SAS . virus.' Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious, serious and potentially deadly respiratory illness. Caused by the SARS coronavirus, it kills around 10 per cent of those who become infected. It has flu-like symptoms that usually begin two to ten days after infection, including high temperature, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain and loss of appetite. It later affects the respiratory system, causing additional symptoms such as a dry cough and breathing difficulties. As an airborne virus, SARS is spread in a similar manner to the flu and common colds. It was responsible for the deaths of almost 800 people during the 2003 outbreak in Asia. Source: NHS . The institute, which was the first research body to isolate HIV in the 1980s, discovered the samples were missing during a routine inventory, according to The Local. It immediately contacted France's drug and health safety agency, ANSM, which carried out an 'in-depth' investigation into the disappearance. But despite spending four weeks searching for the missing vials, it has been unable to locate them, according to the statement. Now, the institute has formally asked French authorities to investigate the disappearance. Researchers believe the samples may have been destroyed - either by accident, or without any record having been made. 'The theory of human error is the most . probable, but we are not ruling anything out,' said  Christian Bréchot, director general of the institute. Institut Pasteur, founded in June 1887, was named after Louis Pasteur, who made a number of remarkable breakthroughs in modern medicine. The French chemist and microbiologist discovered the principles of pasteurization and microbial fermentation - and created the first ever vaccines for rabies and anthrax.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Two conjoined twins separated at the chest last year are expected to be released from the hospital this week. Owen and Emmett Ezell were born last July, were joined at the abdomen and chest and suffered from other medical problems that made them living apart a risky proposition. They had been hospitalized since their separation last August, and are still being fed through tubes in their abdomens, according to KDFW, but are well enough to take the next steps of their recovery at a rehabilitation center. Just after birth: Emmett and Owen Ezell were born joined at the abdomen . Separated: They were surgically separated one month later . This is the next step to getting the boys home with their family,’ the hospital said in a press release. The two boys weighed a combined 11 pounds, 15 ounces at birth and grew to weight of almost 16 pounds by the time of their surgery, according to CBS DFW. The Ezell’s spent the past several months moving from a feeding tube to an IV to their current state, breathing on their own and healing from their surgery, according to NBC DFW. They also shared a liver and bowels, and also suffered from a rare medical disorder where their intestines were left outside their bodies and covered only by a thin layer of tissue, according to CBS DFW. Conjoined: The twins lived joined together for about a month before their separation . Holiday spirit: They spent Christmas in the hospital, but that didn't dampen their moods . With family: The twins are pictures with mother Jennifer and brother Ethan . Rehab will help the boys heal further, but it will also be an opportunity for the boys’ parents to learn how to manage the feeding tubes until they can eat on their own. It is not clear how long they will need to rehabilitate until they are allowed to go home. Hospital sources told NBC DFW the boys are scheduled to be released Wednesday.A celebration will be held by hospital staff in their honor. The family has been blogging about the twins’ recovery since they were separated, but the last post was made two weeks ago. They are raising money to help pay for the boys’ medical care through the sale of t-shirts on the blog and through donations.","Owen and Emmett Ezell were joined at the abdomen and chest when born last July .

"By . James  Nye . Two British brands came together on the deck of an American aircraft carrier in New York City on Monday night to announce a partnership which will one day send the first paying customers into space. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Land Rover announced the joint venture during a glitzy ceremony on the retired and storied USS Intrepid. The firms said it demonstrated their shared vision of pioneering spirit, technological innovation and sense of adventure. Featuring SpaceshipTwo, the world's first commercial passenger carrying spacecraft and Land Rover's new Discovery Vision Concept car, they confirmed that Land Rover will now be the official vehicles for all Virgin Galactic's future astronauts. Scroll Down for Video . Intrepid partnership: Land Rover, the British brand synonymous with adventure, has revealed a long-term global partnership with Richard Branson's pioneering commercial space venture, Virgin Galactic . British giants: The partnership will see Land Rover's become a part of daily life for the Virgin Galactic team and its intrepid customers as they arrive in New Mexico for training . The partnership will see Land Rover become a part of daily life for the Virgin Galactic team and its intrepid customers as they arrive in New Mexico for training. Land Rover will base a fleet of vehicles at the Virgin Galactic test centre in the Mojave Desert, California and at its operational New Mexico base, Spaceport America. The announcement was revealed in dramatic fashion on board USS Intrepid, a former aircraft carrier and now a museum dedicated to the exploration of sea, air and space and anchored on the Hudson River. Land Rover’s first act as exclusive partner was to bring a unique full-size replica of SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise to New York, where it joined the Space Shuttle Enterprise upon the Intrepid. Future: Land Rover unveiled its concept car which features technologies that will be added into a new fleet of Discoveries. They include Gesture Controls, which allows the drivers to open doors, activate indicators and turn on the headlamps using their hands . Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic, said, 'We couldn’t be more delighted to have Land Rover join us on our incredible journey. It is hard to think of a brand which is more synonymous with exploration and adventure. 'We look forward to crossing the final frontier together and to a long and fruitful partnership.' Like the Space Shuttle, SpaceShipTwo is the first of a revolutionary fleet of reusable human spacecraft. Revealed alongside SpaceShipTwo was Land Rover’s Discovery Vision Concept, the company's vision of Land Rover’s future family of Discovery vehicles. The vehicle uses augmented reality technology to display a ‘see-through’ view of the terrain ahead, making the front of the car ‘virtually’ invisible from inside the cabin. Gesture Control allows you to open the doors, operate the indicators or turn on the headlamps simply by moving your hand, while Laser Referencing projects visible markings, symbols and imagery onto the ground ahead to aid low speed or difficult maneuvers. Phil Popham, Group Marketing Director of Jaguar Land Rover said 'This is a marriage of two of Britain’s most iconic brands who celebrate shared values, a pioneering spirit and a true sense of adventure. One day soon: In this image, SpaceShipTwo is shown igniting her hybrid rocket motor which will take paying customers into space . More than 200 VIP guests witnessed the two game-changing vehicles, which were revealed against a Manhattan background and an awe-inspiring projection mapping sequence. Courtesy of Land Rover, SpaceShipTwo, will remain on display at Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum for the public to view from 15th to the 22nd April. It will sit alongside Enterprise, the prototype NASA orbiter that paved the way for the space shuttle programme and the record-breaking and revolutionary supersonic passenger airliner, the Concorde. Last April, SpaceShipTwo made its first powered flight over the Mojave Desert. To date, the company has accepted more than $70 million in deposits for space flights from about 580 people. That’s about 10 percent more people than the total number who have ever gone to space, said Virgin Galactic. Test flight in January: It was the first flight in which a Virgin Atlantic pilot sat in the cockpit . Joined: SpaceshipTwo is seen tucked beneath twin-fuselage WhiteKnightTwo as it flies into the New Mexico skies . SpaceShipTwo is a enhanced version of SpaceShipOne. The original rocket plane, which won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for private spaceflight in 2004 in Mojave, now lives at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. '2014 will be the year when we will finally put our beautiful spaceship in her natural environment of space.

"By . Associated Press . Authorities in Phoenix say former pro wrestler The Ultimate Warrior died of cardiovascular disease. Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick says that's the finding from an autopsy conducted Thursday by the county Medical Examiner's Office. The 54-year-old wrestler's given name was James Hellwig. He collapsed on April 8 while walking with his wife to their car at a Scottsdale hotel and was pronounced dead at a hospital. Scottsdale police have said there were no signs of foul play. The Ultimate Warrior was one of pro wrestling's biggest stars in the late 1980s. Remembering a wrestling star: Warrior, pictured, died on April 8 due to cardiovascular disease . Less than 24 hours before his death, The Ultimate Warrior put on his signature airbrushed trench coat, shook the white ring ropes, and, for a few fleeting minutes, the wrestler billed as hailing from Parts Unknown was back home in the wrestling ring. 'Speak to me, Warriors!' he bellowed on 'Raw', back on TV after an 18-year absence. He soaked up the applause from a New Orleans crowd chanting his name and pulled out a neon mask that replicated the face paint he wore in the ring for every main event battle with Hulk Hogan and Randy 'Macho Man' Savage in the 1990s. Warrior cut a promo to show how much he appreciated his return to the WWE. In the wake of his death, Paul 'Triple H' Levesque, a wrestler and top WWE executive, said 'We are all grateful to have had the opportunity to get the closure with him, to work to get him back on that platform. 'Knowing him now, there could have been no better send-off, really, for him, than that. It was everything he would have dreamed off.' After ending his estrangement with the company, Warrior was in the spotlight again earlier last week, making appearances at WrestleMania 30 and on 'Monday Night Raw,' and he was inducted into the WWE Hall of fame. His last promo on WWE's flagship show seems almost eerie now with his triumphant return overshadowed by his sudden death. 'No WWE talent becomes a legend on their own,' Warrior said. 'Every man's heart one day beats its final beat. His lungs breathe their final breath. And if what that man did in his life makes the blood pulse through the body of others, it makes them bleed deeper and something larger than life, then his essence, his spirit, will be immortalized.' The Ultimate Warrior, seen in this archival photo, personified the larger-than-life cartoon characters who helped skyrocket the WWE into a mainstream phenomenon in the late 1980s and early 1990s . The Ultimate Warrior personified the larger-than-life cartoon characters who helped skyrocket the WWE into a mainstream phenomenon in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Warrior dressed in face paint, had tassels dangling from his super-sized biceps and sprinted to the ring when his theme music hit. He'd shake the ropes, grunt and howl, and thump his chest while the crowd went wild for the popular good guy. In an era when the WWE targeted kids as its primary audience, Warrior was a perfect fit with a spastic entrance, blood-pumping music, flowing locks and always dressed in electric colors from head to boots. His rambling, incoherent promos both energized and confused fans, and Warrior would often stare down at his hands as he spoke, as if he was summoning magical powers out of his fingertips. He made his debut with the promotion when it was known as the World Wrestling Federation in 1987 and wrestled on and off for the sports entertainment empire until 1996. The Ultimate Warrior became the first wrestler to defeat Hogan in a WrestleMania match in 1990 when he used his finishing running splash for the pin. He won the championship in front of 67,678 fans at Toronto's SkyDome in a match billed as 'The Ultimate Challenge.' 'It's one of the great WrestleMania main events ever,' former WWE star Sean 'X-Pac' Waltman said last week. The Ultimate Warrior would defeat Savage the next year at WrestleMania. Savage, who died in 2011, Hogan and Warrior were all enormous personalities with gaudy costumes and memorable catchphrases. They led the WWE's transformation from a promotion running weekend arena shows and Saturday morning TV into one booking events at the largest stadiums around the world with millions watching every Monday night. More than 5.1 million viewers watched Warrior's final appearance last week on 'Raw.' WWE Chairman Vince McMahon tweeted: 'We are all so sad the Ultimate Warrior has passed away. Our heart is with his wife Dana and his two daughters.' In an era when the WWE targeted kids as its primary audience, Warrior was a perfect fit with a spastic entrance, blood-pumping music, flowing locks and always dressed in electric colors from head to boots . 'Vince said to him a couple of days ago, ""I've always loved you. Sometimes, I didn't like you, but I always loved you,""' Levesque said. Warrior and McMahon posed for a picture less than 24 hours before his death that Stephanie McMahon tweeted, 'Never say never.' Waltman attended the Hall of Fame ceremony and saw Warrior before he went on the stage to make his speech. 'I got a sense he wasn't well,' Waltman said. 'It was sad to me. He was kind of hunched over. He used to have such great posture. You just had this sense that he wasn't well. But he was in great spirits. He came up to (other wrestlers) and gave them hugs.' The Ultimate Warrior had a falling out with the WWE over various issues, including money, and did not appear on its TV shows after July 8, 1996, until last weekend. Levesque said he spent 18 months getting to know Warrior and both sides put hard feeling aside to bring him back into the WWE fold. He said Warrior was like a ""kid reborn"" to headline Saturday night's Hall of Fame class. Warrior had signed a deal to work as a WWE ambassador. 'It was time to move on and get past all of it,' Levesque said. 'In some ways, when you've been in this business and in the WWE, you're all brothers. Can we get back to being brothers?' The WWE Network is set to air tribute programming dedicated to Warrior this week. ## . Warrior was the only Hall of Famer feted with his own moment last week. His final words to the crowd are ones wrestling's fanatics will surely take to heart. 'The spirit of The Ultimate Warrior will run forever,' he said.","Authorities say The Ultimate Warrior died of cardiovascular disease .

A 13-year-old boy was shot through the eye when he was hit by two stray bullets after a gunman opened fire in a street in New York. Gama Droiville was with his aunt outside a Brooklyn pizzeria when the gunman opened fire yesterday afternoon, police have said. The teenager was hit twice in the head, with one of the bullets going through his eye. He was rushed to hospital where he was described as being in a serious but stable condition. The boy's aunt Laurieuse Droiville, 37, told the New York Daily News she heard the shots before trying to run away from the area with Gama and his cousin. She said: 'Next thing I know he was on the floor. He was saying he can't see.' Rufino Salazar, manager of the pizzeria, said the teenager's aunt screamed 'My boy is dying' as  he was brought into the restaurant.

"By . Alex Greig . and Francesca Chambers . The principal of a Delaware middle school and her 10-year-old daughter have been killed in a car accident. Delaware State police and the Milford School District confirmed that 42-year-old Tricia Martin of Camden died at Christiana Hospital following the 10:40pm crash Friday near Frederica. Her daughter Taryn Martin was pronounced dead at 12.45am Sunday at A.I. Dupont Children's Hospital. A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. this Saturday for both at the Torbert Funeral Chapel in Dover, Delaware. The burial will immediately follow from 12.30 to 1pm at Lakeside Cemetary. Tragic accident: Taryn (left) and her mother Tricia Martin (right) both died after a car accident Friday night . Unexplained: The mother and daughter were driving home around 10:20pm Friday night when their vehicle veered into the oncoming lane . According to the News Journal, Tricia Martin was driving a 2009 Acura MDX SUV westbound when her car crossed over into the eastbound lanes and veered off the road into a ditch, hitting a telephone box and fence. 'For unknown reasons the Acura crossed over the eastbound lanes and off the south side of the roadway where it drove along a ditch line, colliding with a telephone box and fence,' said police spokesperson Gary Fournier. It then hit an embankment and flipped onto its side back onto the road in the eastbound lane. Tricia Martin was in the car and her daughter got out to get help from a vehicle that had pulled over when another car hit both Taryn Martin and the Acura, pushing the car into the ditch and flipping it upright. Martin was the principal of Milford Central Academy, which has more than 1,000 students in 6th through 8th grades . Makeshift: A memorial sprang up Sunday at Tricia Martin's parking spot at the school after students and friends heard about the accident that claimed the lives of the mother and daughter . Tricia Martin was ejected from the car onto the road, and Taryn Martin was thrown onto the side of the road. The driver of the second vehicle was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries. Martin was the beloved principal of Milford Central Academy, which has more than 1,000 students in 6th through 8th grades. Milford superintendent Phyllis Kohel says Martin’s death is 'heartbreaking' for the school district.

"By . Hayley Coyle . Poor proposal: Richard Curtis revealed that he 'might' propose to long-term partner Emma Freud during an interview - which she then read in the newspaper . He has penned some of the most memorable and endearingly awkward love scenes in romantic comedy. So you might think that when it came to proposing to his own girlfriend, scriptwriter Richard Curtis would know how to avoid pitfalls. Unfortunately, though, the 57-year-old creator of Love Actually and Notting Hill has botched his attempt at a proposal to Emma Freud in toe-curlingly bumbling fashion. When asked in a radio interview about marrying Miss Freud, his partner of 22 years, Curtis blurted out: ‘I think I might.’ Miss Freud, 52, was less than impressed when she read about his comment in a newspaper on Saturday, the day before it was broadcast. She jokingly called it ‘my worst ever marriage proposal’. Miss Freud tweeted: ‘Whaaaat? First I’ve heard about it. Is this what you call a proposal? In the telegraph??? #notsoromanticafterall’ Later the broadcaster added: ‘Just for the record I am not getting married. He would have to ask me in person. Or at least on Twitter.’ Curtis, whose other rom-com hits  include Four Weddings And A Funeral and Bridget Jones’s Diary, made his gaffe during a recording of Radio 4’s The Reunion. He told the programme’s host Sue MacGregor that he had written Four Weddings ‘as an attempt to explain to my mother why I wasn’t getting married’. Where's the romance? Miss Freud, pictured with Curtis in 2008, said she would only accept a proposal made in person - or 'at least on Twitter' He added: ‘I have to say it didn’t work. She was still very unhappy with the situation for the next 15 years, although, do you know, I’m thinking about it. I think I might.’ Curtis has previously said that he and Miss Freud, who have four children, became an item after they kept meeting at weddings – another source of inspiration for the low-budget 1994 film. Four Weddings, starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, went on to become one of the most successful British films ever.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The missing Malaysia Airlines plane was 'thrown around like a fighter jet' just after it lost contact with the authorities in a bid to dodge radar, Malaysian military investigators believe. Flight MH370, which disappeared more than a month ago en route to Beijing, is thought to have climbed to heights of 45,000ft - 10,000ft above its normal altitude - before plummeting to just below 5,000ft. The new lead in the investigation comes as the methodical search being carried out in the Indian Ocean continues amid fears that the jet's black box may have run out of battery. Scroll down for video . Painful: A woman offers prayers for the victims of the missing flight - who are all thought to have died . Survey ship HMS Echo, as a Lockheed P-3 Orion flies overhead, in the southern Indian Ocean helping in the underwater search for the flight recorder from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Pilots:  Zaharie Ahmad Shah (left), 53, and Fariq . Abdul Hamid, 27 (right) were in charge of the plane . The drastic manoeuvres which must have been taken for the plane's alitutude to change so suddenly suggest that the plane was deliberately trying to avoid radar signals and disappear, a source said. Speaking to the Sunday Times, the source said: 'It was being flown very low at very high speed. And it was being flown to avoid radar.' The new theory comes as the painstaking search for any sign of the jet - which was carrying 239 people - continues in the Indian Ocean. Four strong underwater signals were picked up last week - hoped to be from the black box - but nothing new has been detected for five days. Once officials are confident that no more sounds will be heard, a robotic submersible will be sent down to slowly scour for wreckage. 'We're now into day 37 of this tragedy,' said aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas. 'The battery life on the beacons is supposed to last 30 days. We're hoping it might last 40 days. However, it's been four or five days since the last strong pings. 'What they're hoping for is to get one more, maybe two more pings so they can do a triangulation of the sounds and try and narrow the (search) area.' A Royal Navy vessel - the HMS Echo - has now arrived to join the international hunt and is working round the clock to locate any signs of wreckage. Survey ship HMS Echo is in the southern Indian Ocean helping in the underwater search for the flight recorder from the missing jet. Hydrographic survey ship HMS Echo was diverted from work in the Indian Ocean to help in the hunt, and arrived on Thursday in the area of the southern Indian Ocean where 'pings' thought to be from the missing plane had been detected. Search: Buddhists at a retreat near Kuala Lumpur offer their own prayers . Candlelit: The ceremony comes as hope flickers after a week of optimism . Candlelit: The ceremony comes as hope flickers after a week of optimism . The ship has been diverted from its regular duties to assist in the search for the missing plane since 'pings' were heard coming from the ocean earlier this month . The 'pings' were possibly emitted by the Malaysia flight's black box, which puts a strict time limit on the search, as the black box only has about a month of battery power, and has been missing for a month already . Working alongside ships and aircraft from seven other nations, the two Royal Navy vessels face the same race against time to find the black box flight recorder . Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said on Friday that crews had significantly narrowed down the search area in the hunt for signals which authorities are confident are from the missing jet. But he said the signal from the Boeing 777's flight data and cockpit voice recorders is fading - batteries powering their locator beacons last only about a month and it has been more than a month since the plane disappeared. Ocean Shield, an Australian ship towing a U.S. Navy device to detect signals from the beacons, first picked up two underwater sounds consistent with the 'pings' last Saturday, followed by two more in the same general area on Tuesday. Searchers are trying to pinpoint the location of the source of the signals so they can send down a robotic submersible to look for wreckage and the flight recorders. HMS Echo, whose specialist equipment has been specially adapted to pick up sonar pings from the jet's missing black box, is supporting Ocean Shield by understanding the signals it is picking up, its commanding officer said. Speaking from the ship today, Commander Phillip Newell said they are working in conditions after inclement weather caused difficulties interpreting signals picked up underwater. He said: 'It's been challenging. Over the last couple of days we have been conducting oceanographic observations to support Ocean Shield. 'The key thing is to help their understanding of what is going on, and how it is affecting the ocean column.' Crew of the HMS Echo, Kev Rail and Stephen Boyd, prepare the ship's Undulating Oceanographic Recorder for deployment . He said there had been some difficult weather conditions which had 'messed up' the water column, making it hard to understand some signals being picked up. 'The key challenge is to try and refine all of the observations they are making. They are doing that at the moment but it's challenging. 'Looking out of the window right now, what we are seeing is Ocean Shield to the south of us conducting further observations. 'She is trying to get in a position so she can then observe on the seabed, and then through the water column, the pings from the black box, which involves physically moving the ship.' He said another challenge is directing Australian navy P-3 Orion aircraft which drop sound-locating buoys, each dangling a hydrophone listening device about 1,000 feet below the surface, into the water. Cdr Newell said he and his crew are conscious of the importance of their task and need to refine the search area while the black box's signal can still be detected. 'At this stage it's a challenge trying to refine this position so that when they put a submersible into the water they will be in a position where they can identify what is on the seabed correctly. The ship is designed for long stays at sea, and could potentially continue its search for up to 60 days . Also aiding Australian vessel Ocean Shield in the search effort is the U.K nuclear submarine HMS Tireless . 'We have got to give them the best advantage we can and within that they will get to the position where they have the best refined position that they can search.' He added: 'In anything like this I am very conscious, I have 20 years experience of trying to find things on the seabed, it's pretty much my day job. 'I have a brilliant team, young, bright and enthusiastic and we are working 24/7 to cover the sea bed and observe on the surface. 'There's a sense that we are playing an important part in this role and we are keen to get it right. 'In terms of purpose, it's key to make sure that we detect anything that can help in the investigation.' Before arriving in the latest search area HMS Echo had already searched 6,000 square miles of ocean - an area 10 times the size of Greater London - 1,000 miles north-west of Perth with Chinese vessels after sensors picked up a possible signal on April 5. The Plymouth-based ship was gathering data on her way from Oman to the Seychelles when she was diverted to join the international search for the Malaysia Airlines plane. Apart from a 12-hour stop in the Maldives to take on supplies and change some of her crew, the survey ship has now been at sea continuously for six weeks. Cdr Newell said: 'We are a ship that's designed and built to operate for long periods at sea. We can carry provisions for 60 days at sea, and fuel to go pretty much halfway round the world', and said the ship would carry on helping with the search, providing as much support as it could to Ocean Shield until its tasking is reviewed later in the month. The search is also being helped by nuclear submarine HMS Tireless.","Search continues - but it is possible plane's black box batteries have failed .

The trio had gone to the locker room upstairs when smoke started filling the venue in the early hours of Sunday, trapping them. Eventually the floor collapsed, dumping them on to the fire below. Mihaela Tuca, 24 (left), Nicoleta Vasiliteanu, 23 (centre) and Nicoleta Cengher, 22 (right), all died in a fire at a club where they were working illegally after firefighter's weren't told they were inside . The trio had gone upstairs into the locker room when smoke filled the venue. Firefighters say they were trapped there until the floor gave way, dumping them on to the flames below . A fourth dancer, 19-year-old Nicoleta Buirencu, was still on stage when the fire took hold and was pulled out by firefighters, but was badly burned . A fourth dancer, 19-year-old Nicoleta Buirencu, was still dancing on stage when the blaze started and was pulled out alive, although she was badly burned. George Karam, 60, owner of the Beirut Club in the popular seaside resort of Constanta just east of the capital Bucharest, fled together with guests and staff when the fire broke out. Firemen believed the building had been evacuated, but when they searched the building three hours later after the fire had burned out, they discovered the bodies of the performers. Mariana Szarkany, Nicoleta Cengher’s mother, said: 'That owner is an evil man. He counted his chefs, he counted his waiters, he counted his bartenders. 'Why did he not tell them about the other girls? Did he forget about them? Did he forgot about those who were the stars of the show and brought all the glamour?' Nicoleta Vasiliteanu’s mother Maria added: 'They brought my girl's body out and took her to the morgue. 'I saw the place burning, had I known my girl was upstairs, I would have gone through the fire for her! Why didn’t they tell me? Why did the boss say all the personnel had been evacuated?' Owner George Karam, 60, allegedly fled the club without telling firemen there were still dancers inside . GRAPHIC CONTENT: Miss Buirencu was pulled alive from the flames but was very badly burned . The blaze broke out on Sunday morning and gutted the Lebanese restaurant in Constanta . A friend of the girls said: 'It is so tragic, Miheala had been working as an exotic dancer since she was a teenager and really struggled to get some recognition. 'She didn't want to simply be one of the people that gets undressed on stage and wanted to bring something a bit more classy to the area, she had a very tasteful act which she had really worked on over the winter that involved belly dancing and a lot of acrobatics, she made all the costumes herself and worked out the routines. 'Things had finally started to come together for her. She and the others were really packing in the crowds and it looked like it was going to be a great season, and then finally this happens.' Miss Tuca had been working in the region as a dancer since she was a teenager, and was looking forward to a bumper summer season after landing on offer to dance at the club. She brought along her friend Miss Vasiliteanu to join the show, and the pair also recruited Miss Cengher, a singer, along with business student Miss Buirencu who was looking to subsidise her student loan. The four made their own costumes and had managed to get a huge following in the first month working at the Lebanese restaurant, which also had an adjoining casino. On the night of the fire, three of the girls had just finished a performance and gone upstairs to the locker room leaving Miss Buirencu on stage. Survivors of the blaze said that thick smoke had suddenly started to fill the building, and everyone had fled at the same time. Mihela Tuca was experienced and had been working as a dancer in the region since she was a teenager . Miss Tuca had recently landed a contract to work at the restaurant which also had a casino attached . Miss Tuca recruited her friend Nicoleta Vasiliteanu (pictured) to work with her at the Lebanese venue . Miss Vasiliteanu (pictured) was left to burn to death along with a third dancer, Miss Cengher . When firemen arrived, they went into the restaurant and managed to pull Miss Buirencu to safety. But they said that they had not been told about the other dancers, all of whom were working in the building illegally. A fire brigade spokesman confirmed: 'When the blaze was extinguished, we went inside to dampen it down. That was three hours later, and it was only then that we found the three badly burned bodies. 'They must have been trapped upstairs by the smoke, and probably waited in vain for rescue that never came. The group made their own costumes and amassed a large following at their first month working in the club (pictured, Miss Tuca on stage) All four of the women had been working at the club illegally, and police are now investigating .

'Nobody told us they were there, and at some stage the floor of the room they were in collapsed, dumping their bodies into the burning restaurant below.'

The short clip then captures the moment the bear finally manages the perfect throw, which is expertly caught by the boy. There are two polar bears kept at Rio Grande Zoo, twins Kiska and Koluk, though it is not known which one is in the video. The pair are clearly fun-loving animals as their enclosure includes a 14ft waterslide, along with an air-conditioned ice cave, a 14ft deep swimming pool and waterfalls. According to the boy's father, Miguel Armenta, the bear had been throwing the Frisbee for some time, trying to get it high enough for his son to catch . They were born at Utah's Hogel Zoo in 1996, but moved to Albuquerque in order to have enough space to grow into 1,000lb adults. In the wild cubs are fun-loving creatures, tackling and wrestling with each other, but adults tend to be unsociable, preferring to hunt and live in isolation. That doesn't mean they can't enjoy themselves, however, and have often been filmed running and jumping in the snow, or sliding down large snow drifts on their stomachs.

"By . Associated Press . More than 100 years after dinosaurs were first displayed on the National Mall, T. Rex - the king - is joining the Smithsonian collection after a 2,000-mile journey from Montana. Paleontologists and curators unveiled parts of a nearly complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton Tuesday, including its jaw with teeth as big as bananas, at the National Museum of Natural History. FedEx delivered the dinosaur bones in a special truck carrying 16 carefully packed crates that were kept at room temperature for the four-day trip. Scroll down for video .

Quite the find: The original fossilized bones of this T. rex arrived at the museum Tuesday and will be reassembled for display . Fossils:  In 1988 the Wankels discovered the fossilized bones while hiking in a rugged section of a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Montana. Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time . Boxed-in: A crate containing the fossilized jaw bone of The Nation's T. rex The crate, is one of 16, containing the remains of The Nations T. rex, . A large leg bone and the T. rex teeth . drew 'ahs' as Museum Director Kirk Johnson told a crowd that the . skeleton ranks as one of the top five T. rex skeletons discovered . because it's about 85 percent complete. 'It lay in the ground much as it had died on the shores of a stream in Montana just over 66 million years ago,' Johnson said. It was discovered in 1988 on federal land in Montana and is one of about half a dozen nearly complete T. rex skeletons that have been uncovered. The prize fossils have been tough to acquire. The Smithsonian set out to buy one at auction in 1997 but was outbid for that T. rex named Sue. She went to Chicago's Field Museum for $7.6 million. Almost 30 years:  The dineosaur was discovered by a Montana rancher near Fort Peck Reservoir in 1988 which is owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Nations T. rex is on loan to the Natural History Museum for 50 years . Delicate: The fossilized bones of a 65-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex are encased in plaster and held in padded crates after being shipped from Montana . Monumental: For the first time since its dinosaur hall opened in 1911, the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History will have a nearly complete T. rex skeleton . Special delivery: FedEx is delivering the dinosaur bones in a truck carrying 16 carefully packed crates . Enormous: Montana State University Administrative Director of Palentology Pat Leiggi rests his hands on the fossilized right femur of a 65-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex . Large: Formerly known as the Wankel T. rex, the nearly-complete dinosaur fossil was discovered in 1988 in eastern Montana and will be the centerpiece of the museum's new 31,000-square-foot fossil hall, which will open in 2019 . Now the Smithsonian's specimen could become the most prominent with its new home in one of the world's most-visited museums. About 7 million people visit the natural history museum each year, and it offers free admission. Kathy Wankel, a Montana rancher who discovered the bones in 1998 during a camping trip, said she initially spotted about 3 inches of bone sticking out of the ground and dug out a small arm bone. She said she's proud to see the fossil in a national museum. 'We were so thrilled we had found a bone; we called that a mega find,' she said at the museum. 'But I think now this is a mega find.' Paleontologists from the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont., excavated the fossil, and it's been housed there for the past 25 years. At the Smithsonian, the skeleton will be mounted upright for the first time. Many people think of the T. rex as the ultimate dinosaur, and it's the first thing they want to see, paleontology curator Hans Sues said. Its name is a combination of Greek and Latin meaning ""king of the tyrant lizards,"" and it was one of the largest predators to live on land. 'In some ways, I think of it as the most American of all dinosaurs: this big, huge animal that was dominating its ecosystem,' Sues said.

Bone by bone: The so-called Wankel T.rex - named after Kathy Wankel who discovered it - was about 18-years-old when it died and is considered second for extensiveness and preservation . Finders:  In 1988 Montana ranchers Kathy Wankel (L) and her husband Tom Wankel discovered the fossilized bones of a 65-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex while hiking in a rugged section of a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Montana . Scientists want to learn more about how T. rex related to other animals and what its short arms were used for. Visitors can get their first look over the next six months as curators unpack, examine and 3D scan the skeleton. But it will take five years for the museum to overhaul its dinosaur hall, with the T. rex mounted as the centerpiece of a $48 million gallery devoted to the history of life on Earth. It's slated to open in 2019. While pieces of the exhibition have been updated over time, this will be the first comprehensive reimagining of the dinosaur hall, Johnson said. 'There's so many things that have happened in science in the last 100 years that this will be a great new hall,' he said. The T. rex is on a 50-year loan from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the Smithsonian that could be extended. Washington's current 103-year-old dinosaur hall closes April 27 for renovations. A temporary dinosaur exhibit will open later this year. Happy times: From left to right, Kirk Johnson, Sant director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, poses with Montana ranchers Kathy and Tom Wankel, Lt. Gen.

Quite the catch: The loan of the T.rex to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History is on par with the museum's 1929 acquisition of the priceless Hope diamond .

"By . Bianca London At London Fashion Week . Last year saw her staff occupying an empty front row, but this season, Somerset House was packed to the rafters for Holly Fulton's  S/S14 offering. Best known for her graphic designs and signature printed motifs, Fulton drew inspiration from the seventies but added a modern twist courtesy of structured shapes and a shot of denim. With soft focus siren Noosha Fox as her muse, Holly's collection was a celebration of woozy summer days, glittering nights and morning lounging. Scroll down for video . Sights of the 70s: Holly Fulton unveiled a thoroughly pretty version of the 1970s during her LFW show . Modern: Fulton's 1970s inspired pieces were given a modern makeover courtesy of geometric print . The Holly Fulton woman is one with nonchalant, head-turning confidence, and she translated it into something you can wear via luxurious geometric prints on soft silk trousers and pleated separates. Models took to the catwalk in delicate jackets, violet lattice print dresses and some seriously bling crystal chokers which glistened against the light. Accessories came in the form of sugary lilac and powder pink clutch bags with chunky block wooden heels. Denim was key, providing the designer with a matte fabric to contrast with lustrous silks, while dresses and trousers were embellished with digital prints featuring ribbons and flowers. It was bold, modern and crisp and light, with romantic florals used to give a nod to the lost 1970s world of Laura Ashley and flower power. Nonchalant: Chunky knits were paired with buttoned mum skirts . Contrast: Low key denim was paired with lavish printed silk . Ladylike: Print was given a chic edge with pleated skirts . Success: Fulton's show was packed with appreciative onlookers including Jameela Jamil who sat front row . This season saw Fulton attempt a few (not always successful) experiments with cork, which she explained, were inspired by the geometric concrete freezes of William Mitchell. The front row was occupied by the ever-present Jameela Jamil and fashion stalwart Hilary Alexander, who had mixed feelings about the show. Speaking to MailOnline, Alexander said: 'Some of it I liked but it was the styling... I wasn't quite sure about the styling. I liked the way it was ladylike but done in a much more frumpy way. It was flowing and long where previously, she was much more structured.' Alexander added: 'I'm a big Holly Fulton fan. No one can make a show as sexy as she can.' Holly Fulton has teamed up with eBay to offer a special capsule collection. The exclusive edit - which is priced between £70-£120 - will give consumers the chance to own seven premium pieces from her Autumn / Winter 2013 collection, inspired by 70s art school rockers and seductive muses.

"By . Paul Bentley . Hiding her face behind a silk scarf, sunglasses and her long blonde hair, Mayka Kukucova is escorted from a Slovakian police station. The 24-year-old model was finally in custody yesterday in her native country four days after the shooting of her millionaire British ex boyfriend on the Costa del Sol. Kukucova had been on the run but stunned officers on Tuesday by handing herself in at a station close to her parents’ home in a small Slovakian town. Scroll down for video . Mayka Marica Kukucova, pictured for the first time since she allegedly went on the run. She was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia . Wearing a carefully chosen designer outfit including £300 Gucci sneakers, designer sunglasses, and covering her face with a silk shawl, she leaves a member of her police escort to carry her expensive designer handbag . She now faces extradition back to Spain accused of killing her former boyfriend Andrew Bush, who was shot twice in the head on Saturday at his £2,500 a month villa. Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am. His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush’s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK. Maria Korotaeva, 20 (left and right), the most recent girlfriend of murdered millionaire Andrew Bush, 48 (left), has told how the pair arrived at Mr Bush's Spanish villa to find ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting . She took refuge in Mr Bush’s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer. Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was ‘crazy’ with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship. She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape. Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested on Tuesday in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain. Kukukova handed herself in and has since been transferred to cells in Trencin, Slovakia, where she was photographed early yesterday morning. Mayka Marica Kukucova and Mr Bush before they split up. She is accused of murdering him at his home . Kukucova has been accused of being a 'madly jealous' ex who killed Mr Bush to stop anyone else having him . Officers carried a Louis Vuitton handbag for the model, as she shielded her face behind a large scarf. Despite her dramatic trip home and a night behind bars, she appeared to have made an effort with her appearance. Wearing sheer black leggings, £300 Gucci trainers, and a top with elaborate detail, she kept her face hidden behind a scarf and large sunglasses, which she wore inside. Her father Lubomir Kukuca, 50, said his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run. Mr Kukuca is seriously ill with cancer, so it is thought the model wanted to see him before she was arrested. Miss Kukucova’s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said: ‘I don’t want to speak before my daughter does. ‘No one can imagine what we are going through at the moment. Korotaeva described Kukucova (pictured) as a 'snake' and branded her an 'uneducated psycho' ‘We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.’ It is thought Kukucova drove across several unmanned borders to reach central Europe. It is also possible, however, she may have flown to Slovakia on an ID card before an international arrest warrant was received by her home country. Friends in Slovakia suggested she may have evaded police with the help of her new boyfriend Peter Kucharik, a bodybuilder in his 20s who works for an armed security firm. Miss Korotaeva says Kukucova argued with Mr Bush before she heard shots  (pictured, Mr Bush and Miss Korotaeva on a Valentine's break in Paris) Miss Korotaeva (left), a business student at  UWE in Bristol, claims she heard three gunshots before Mr Bush's ex came running out of the house with a 'crazy cold' look on her face . Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge' Miss Korotaeva paid tribute to her 'amazing' boyfriend, saying he 'changed my life for the better' Mr Kucharik has not been seen at work since Saturday, when friends said he was trying to get to the airport. His phone has been switched off since and his boss told the Mail no one had been able to get hold of him. It is not yet known when Kukucova might be extradited. Extraditions usually take a week, but they can happen in as soon as 48hours, according to experts. There are fears Slovakia could try to block Kukucova’s return to Spain but under EU laws this would be very difficult and diplomatically disastrous. Long journey: Kukucova was arrested  after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia. The town is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Estepona, Spain . Kukucova is expected to be taken straight to court in Estepona on arrival in Spain after being booked in at a local police station for routine checks. A judge in charge of the probe will then decide whether to release her on bail or remand her in custody while a full-scale investigation into Mr Bush’s violent death continues. Mr Bush’s Russian lover flew to the resort of Adeje in Tenerife yesterday to be comforted by family. After Kukucova’s arrest, she wrote on Facebook: ‘Yesssss!!!! Justice!!!!’ Earlier, she wrote: ‘My angel, my teacher, my LOVE..the perfect Man. ‘I still think it’s not true, it’s a film, it’s a dream. Not real. I love you baby and I know you will be looking after us from there.’ She said Kukucova was a ‘poisonous snake’ who was madly jealous after breaking up with her older lover and felt it had to be ‘her or no one’. Mr Bush’s family have said they are ‘absolutely over the moon’ that Kukucova is in custody. Slovakian police declined to comment yesterday. A spokesman for Spanish police said: ‘A woman wanted for questioning in relation to an incident at Cancelada near Estepona at the weekend has been arrested in Slovakia on foot of an international arrest warrant.’ She has taken to twitter and Instagram today to praise Mr Bush, calling him her 'teacher' who 'changed my world for better [sic.]' According to Miss Korotaeva, Mr Bush couldn't stand to hear Kukucova's name and his family resented her . Samantha Mason, who has a 19-year-old daughter with Mr Bush, is thought to be comforting Miss Korotaeva . Police have now recovered the Hummer which Miss Kukucova is believed to have fled in, but are still hunting for a Slovak woman in her mid-20s .","British jeweller Andrew Bush, 48, found dead at Costa del Sol villa .

"By . Meghan Keneally . New spin: The parody video plays off of Sorkin's HBO show The Newsroom . Aaron Sorkin fans had reason to rejoice Tuesday morning as comedian Amy Schumer released a parody video of his show, The Newsroom. The parody version took the writer's iconic walk-and-talks, moral dilemmas and sexual politics to a different venue: a fast food restaurant. 'The Foodroom' gives a four-minute foray into the fictitious world of McDalmonds, where a cranky male manager is in a moral lock-of-horns with his corporate overlords. Sound familiar? Similar plot lines . have been used in many of Sorkin's shows, whether it be the latest . iteration in The Newsroom or earlier series like Sports Night or Studio . 60 On The Sunset Strip. (If 'corporate' was subbed out for . 'Republicans', there would be examples in The West Wing as well.) Showing . that the spoof was done in good fun, the male protagonist was played by . Sports Night alum Josh Charles, while his pesky female sidekick and . former flame is taken on by Schumer. Walk-and-talk: The parody film was made by comedian Amy Schumer (seen in the background) and Josh Charles, who previously starred in Sorkin's earlier TV series Sports Night . In . the clip, Charles' charactor JJ McAhoy (which is a clear homage to Jeff . Daniel's character in The Newsroom, Will McAvoy) is resistant to a . healthy change that his overlords want to make in adding apple slices to . their kids meals. 'Silly me, I thought we stood for something around here,' McAhoy says in disgust. Schumer, . whose sketch comedy show will feature the clip on her Comedy Central . show tonight, goes on to buck him up and encourage him to take first the . pragmatic route before returning to his moral high ground. Moral highground: Though the spoof centers around a fast food chain's resistance to healthy food, it takes its cues from themes seen in much of Sorkin's work . Big finish: The romantic sub plot also mimics the gender relations on Sorkin's shows . In a romantic interlude, she takes a jab . at the way in which Sorkin's female characters are portrayed as at times . hapless and entirely beholden to their love interests. Poking fun: Aaron Sorkin has taken part in previous parodies, including one on 30 Rock . 'I worked my way up to be a GM of a Sbarro in Tel Aviv, and then one day, I was stuffing cous cous into a calzone and then one day I realized a woman's life is worth nothing except if she's making a great man greater,' she says as they share a private moment by a deep fryer. This is far from the first time that Sorkin's distinctive style has been spoofed by famous fans, as former West Wing stars have created their own videos in the guise of their old characters to help get out the vote for one of their siblings who was running for office. The Oscar-winning writer himself has poked fun at his walk-and-talk formula in an appearance in 30 Rock. Sorkin is currently believed to be putting the final touches on the script for The Newsroom's third season which will air in September, but he has appearances scheduled at the Tribeca Film Festival next week and the Nantucket Film Festival in June, where he is being honored with their Screenwriter's Tribute. Until the HBO show returns, or his fast-paced writing style gets back on the big screen with his Steve Jobs biopic, fans can get quick refresher through the spoof.

"By . Leon Watson . Five stolen chihuahuas including a Crufts champion worth £20,000 have been reunited with their owners after being found 130 miles from home. Valenchino Chihuahua Xena, who was named Best Puppy in Breed at Crufts 2014, was snatched with four other dogs from a house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, on Thursday. After a nationwide hunt was launched to track them down they were finally found in a portable dog cage in Culcheth, Cheshire. Back home: Xena was named Best Puppy in Breed at last month's Crufts and is worth £20,000 . Unhurt: Xena may have been targeted for breeding because her puppies would be worth thousands of pounds . Owners Mal Hilton and his partner Lucy Hilton were left devastated by the theft of Xena, her grandmother Angel and her mother Io, as well as two others called Pandora and Evie. Last night the Hiltons told of their relief when they heard the prized pets had been found unhurt, but 'traumatised'. Mr Hilton said: 'We've not slept since the burglary - fearing we'd never see them again. Our kids cried non-stop.' Mrs Hilton told The Sun: 'We'll never leave them again.' The dogs were found in Cheshire, 130 miles away from their home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire . Expensive: Xena's mother Io is worth £3,000 and was one of five chihuahuas stolen in the raid . The grandmother of Crufts champion Xena, Angel, who was also stolen by the thieves in East Yorkshire . Jogger Mark McCombe, 29, heard them barking by a farm track and took them home. He then rang police. The raiders broke into the Hiltons' house in the village of Lissett, near Driffield, by smashing a window with an iron bar. Xena is worth £20,000 while the others are worth £3,000 each. Fourteen-month-old fawn longcoat Xena, whose show name is Valenchino Made of Candy, has won at many shows but her crowning glory was being named Best Puppy in Breed at Crufts last month. She has also qualified for Crufts 2015. Humberside Police said investigations will continue. Mystery: Pandora, a Russian tri smooth coat, one of the chihuahuas stolen in the raid in Yorkshire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . With the same name as a Christian saint and a son called Gabriel, it might have been with a sense of inevitability that Terisa Tuffin discovered a holy sign as she prepared some food. Mother-of-one Terisa was slicing an orange when she saw the heavenly figure of an angel appear in front of her. Nursery school teacher Terisa, 41, said that she found the sighting of the angel in her kitchen reassuring after she had a spate of bad news. Her nine-year old son Gabriel had recently been diagnosed with a kidney problem, and she had discovered that her child maintenance payments were to be cut. Mother Terisa Tuffin found an angel looking back at her when she was making her daughter's packed lunch . The orange was the only piece of fruit that she had at home in Lindfield, West Sussex. She said: 'I decided to cut it in half and put a half each in Gabriel and my 13-year old daughter Tarlie's packed lunch for school. 'When I noticed the angel appear it brightened my mood and it was as if someone was watching and looking after me' she added. 'My son has been quite ill and there was unfortunate news about the maintenance payments so I was feeling a bit sorry for myself, so it was a lovely image to see.' Seeing holy images in everyday objects is a surprisingly regular occurrence. In Florida Patti Burke found this Goldfish cracker, with a cross-like marking and halo-like circle, and believes it was a sign from God . A man shared a photo online of a Cheeto treat which he claimed was shaped like Jesus . When Fred Trucluck flipped over the piece of carton in Florida this year, he discovered a white marking which he said looked like Jesus Christ . This massive image of Jesus was spotted while searching Google Maps in Hungary . This year alone, Christians in Florida claim to have seen a goldfish-shaped biscuit with a cross and halo on it, and Jesus on the back of a carton. Another American believed he had seen a Christ-like figure in his cheesy crisps.

"By . Tim Shipman . Fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden is guilty of treason for leaking details of eavesdropping operations by GCHQ and the NSA, Liam Fox declared yesterday. In a speech in the United States, the former defence secretary said the former spy has endangered the lives of British spies and their families by revealing the techniques used by the intelligence agencies to al Qaeda and foreign enemies. And he accused the editor of The Guardian of ‘egotism and self-importance’ for continuing to print Snowden’s revelations after being warned that they damaged national security. Former Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fix accused Edward Snowden of 'treason' for leaking secret NSA documents to US journalist Glenn Greenwald . Dr Fox ridiculed the claims of Snowden sympathisers that his revelations have been in the public interest because they have cast light on the extent of cyber surveillance by the security services. He told the American Enterprise Institute think tank: ‘Snowden thinks of himself as a cyber-age guerrilla warrior but in reality, he is a self-publicising narcissist. ‘He did not find or expose anything illegal. Let us not imbue his cowardice with higher motives. Let us not confuse his egotism with public service. Let’s not call his treachery by lesser terms. For once, let’s say what we mean. Let us call treason by its name.’ Dr Fox pointed out that Snowden, who has said he did not want to live in a surveillance society, first took his revelations to ‘the internet-blocking, cyber-attacking and increasingly militaristic’ Chinese state and is ‘currently snuggled up with Putin’s henchmen’ in Moscow. Dr Fox accused The Guardian of showing ‘contempt’ for the Government’s efforts to limit the damage from the leaks. Dr Fox said the information released by Edward Snowden (pictured) could be used to identify British intelligence assets and their families . British spies destroyed computers at the paper’s offices which contained the Snowden documents on the grounds that terrorist groups and foreign spies could hack into them. But the paper simply sent a further copy of the data to the New York Times so they could continue working on the story outside the UK. Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald’s partner David Miranda was caught travelling with a computer hard drive containing 58,000 ‘highly classified UK intelligence documents’. Dr Fox said: ‘It is clear that the material seized from Miranda contained personal information would allow security staff to be identified, including those deployed overseas. This poses serious dangers to staff including a risk to life, both to intelligence officers and their families.’ Dr Fox accused Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger (pictured) of  showing ¿no sense of understanding, never mind remorse, about what damage might have been done to the security of the country¿ . Accusing Snowden’s collaborators of ‘pathetically amateur behaviour’, he added: ‘Their toxic mixture of ignorance and arrogance is compounded by basic incompetence in the way in which information has been handled.’ Dr Fox said Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger has shown ‘no sense of understanding, never mind remorse, about what damage might have been done to the security of the country’. ‘This attitude is testament not only to the egotism and self importance of the man but the feeling of impunity that both he and Greenwald seemed, and still seem, to exhibit.’ Snowden released the top-secret cables to US journalist Glenn Greenwald (right) who used his partner David Miranda to courier computer drives containing the information through Heathrow Airport . The former minister, who is tipped to return in David Cameron’s next reshuffle, said there is a ‘legitimate debate’ about ‘whether GCHQ have infringed on the personal privacy of citizens’. But he said too little attention has been given to ‘the material threats posed by the Snowden disclosures’. ‘We have actually seen chat among specific terrorist groups at home and abroad, discussing how to avoid what the now proceed to be vulnerable communications methods,’ Dr Fox said. ‘No doubt these terrorist groups are extremely grateful to Snowden and Greenwald and their accomplices for these useful tools in their war against our citizens, our Armed Forces and our way of life.’ He added: ‘It is not our security agencies who undermine freedom or democracy. It is the terrorists, the criminals and the enemies of our country who seek to do so. What sort of distorted logic suggests that compromising our security agents, potentially putting their lives in danger, is a service to democracy?’ Dr Fox said Snowden's leaks did not show any evidence of GCHQ (pictured) acting illegally .","Dr Fox accused Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger of 'egotism and self-importance'

"By . Amanda Williams . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Sophia Blackburn bit a chunk from a woman's ear because she turned off UB40 at a pub disco has been jailed for four years . A single mother of two who bit a chunk from a woman’s ear because she turned off UB40 at a pub disco has been jailed for four years. Sophia Blackburn, 24, sunk her teeth into Stacey Wilkinson's ear - scarring her for life  - during a fight next to a disc jockey booth. Blackburn, from Bradford, clamped her teeth on Wilkinson’s left ear while pinning her on the dance floor. Part of her tooth was found sticking in Miss Wilkinson’s left ear and her thumbnail was bitten away in the attack. The horrific wound needed 35 stitches, and now Miss Wilkinson has quit her job because she is mentally and physically scarred. The women were in the Horse and Groom, Wibsey, Bradford, West Yorkshire, on 25 May, last year, when they began to argue. Miss Wilkinson said: 'My uncle was the DJ on the night and he’d asked me to sort out the last three songs for the night, which would take us up to 11pm. 'UB40 had been playing and when I put the next track on she just went nuts and attacked me.' Others intervened in the melee. Blackburn was convicted by a jury at Bradford Crown Court last month of wounding Miss Wilkinson with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm. Blackburn flew into a rage when she did not get her choice of dance music, Bradford Crown Court heard. She punched Miss Wilkinson to the floor, got on top of her and sank her teeth into her ear. She bit half of it off and spat it out before leaving the pub. Blackburn, 24, sunk her teeth into the ear of Stacey Wilkinson (left)  - scarring her for life  - during a fight next to a disc jockey booth . Miss Wilkinson, 25, said: 'We were going out to celebrate my partner Steve's brother's girlfriend becoming pregnant and went to a couple of other places before we got to the Horse and Groom pub around 11 pm. 'Apparently Sophia and her friends had been asking for music all night, and the DJ Mick had let them type the songs they wanted in because he's dyslexic, but I wasn't aware of this because I hadn't been there. 'Around quarter to 12, the landlady said just three more songs could go on before closing, so Mick asked me to type them in from the playlist. 'UB40 was on at the time but I wasn't aware anybody had put the song on. I was just helping Mick out because of his dyslexia. 'Sophia came over and started shouting at me about it and I told her it was nothing to do with me and she should speak to Mick. All of a sudden she came running at me, punched me and we fell into a table. I was in complete shock. 'The table flipped over, and we fell backwards, me underneath and Sophia on top of me. She grabbed hold of my hair and then started biting my ear. The women were in the Horse and Groom, Wibsey, Bradford, West Yorkshire, on 25 May, last year, when they began to argue . 'I put my thumb in her mouth to get her off but she ended up biting my fingernail off. I had hold of her head and I was terrified to let go in case my whole ear came off. 'Eventually everyone got her off me, but along with it was some of my ear, and there was blood everywhere. 'I was in shock. I could feel the pain and see the blood but I wasn't sure what had happened. 'A glass hit Mick in the eye and his decks and laptop fell and smashed. Glass was everywhere. 'Even now everything is surreal. It was such an odd night. I wish I didn't go out. Stacey Wilkinson, victim . 'I don't know why she felt the need to attack me over changing a song. Whatever I put on, she must not have liked it.' 'You have shown no real regard or consideration for the evil you perpetuated that night,' Judge Robert Bartfield told her. Miss Wilkinson was left with a deformed ear needing further surgery. 'This is a terrible disfigurement for a woman,' the judge said. Prosecutor Andrew Kershaw said Blackburn had a conviction for battery and a reprimand for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He read from a victim impact statement by Miss Wilkinson in which she spoke of the fear, paranoia, loss of sleep and anxiety she had suffered since the attack, which left her needing 35 stitches. Miss Wilkinson said: 'UB40 had been playing and when I put the next track on she just went nuts and attacked me' She had given up her job in a nursing home because she no longer wanted to wear her hair up and she was shy and anxious in her social life because she felt disfigured. In mitigation, Blackburn’s barrister, Tina Landale, said it was a spontaneous assault in drink and her client was shocked by the consequences. After the case, Detective Constable Ailsa Jones said: 'This was a shocking attack which has left the victim scarred for life. We hope the sentence handed down today will help to give her and her family some closure.'","Sophia Blackburn, 24, sunk teeth into Stacey Wilkinson's ear during brawl .

"By . Jill Reilly . and James Tozer . A woman who lost a two-year court battle over a family heirloom has claimed the ‘cursed’ £230,000 vase ruined her life – and that she is now being forced to sell her home. Andrea Calland, 47, found the Chinese ornament in her garage and decided to sell it, expecting it to raise a few hundred pounds. But the vase sold for a staggering £228,000 at auction – and Miss Calland became embroiled in a lengthy legal fight with her former mother-in-law over who should keep the money. Andrea Calland, 47, found the 'ugly' pot in her garage and decided to sell it, but was shocked to discover it was a rare antique . Her former mother-in-law, Evelyn Galloway, launched a legal bid for the money, claiming she had only lent the vase to Andrea and it was not hers to sell. After a lengthy court case Miss Calland was made to pay £180,000 to Mrs Galloway and the legal costs have left her with massive financial problems. The mother-of-three has claimed the five inch, gilt-copper vase is 'cursed' after the cost of the case left her bankrupt and facing eviction. Miss Calland, from Ruthin, North Wales, said she has now been forced to put her home up for sale to clear her debts. The 250-year-old decorative vase, made of gilt copper, was commissioned by the Chinese emperor Qianlong, and was looted from the Summer Palace in Peking during the Second Opium War of 1860 . She . said: 'It was an ugly piece of china, it was five inches high and . tacky. It was something you would see in a Chinese takeaway. 'It . has ruined my life, I wish I had never set eyes on it really, I’ve lost . everything I’ve ever owned in the world because of it. 'I owe over £100,000 in legal fees, as well as all the money I have lost on the vase already.It’s ridiculous, I just wanted a few quid for my daughter’s laptop that was all. 'I can’t believe I had got myself into such a mess, over a stupid vase. Andrea Calland with daughter Sophie George and her former mother-in-law, Evelyn Galloway as they pose in a photo taken in late 1990s . 'If I go bankrupt it won’t be through choice, all my bills are up to date and I don’t have that much debt. 'I haven’t had a family Christmas with my children for two years, I’ve used all my savings, pawned my jewellery, sold my car, I don’t own a computer, and most of the contents of my house have gone. 'I emailed the new owner, who is a revered Chinese antiquities buyer. He believes it could be cursed because despite advertising it heavily around the world he couldn’t get shift of it.' Andrea Callar (second from left) from Ruthin in North Wales who sold a vase at auction which fetched £228,000. However she was forced to give the proceeds to Evelyn Galloway, her former mother-in-law (centre) Miss Calland’s nightmare first began in 2009 when she decided to sell a number of items of bric-a-brac at auction to buy her daughter Phoebe, 17, a laptop for her birthday. She took the items to Byrne’s, in Chester, where the vase was given a reserve price of just £500. To her surprise it was bought by a leading Oriental art dealer for £228,000, who whisked it off to be displayed in New York. Andrea Callard's only asset left is her beloved home, a pink stone cottage in the Welsh market town . Miss Calland with her former husband Steven and his mother at a family Christmas . But, after reading about incredible sale price on the front of her local paper Mrs Galloway recognised it as a missing family heirloom and began the lengthy two year legal battle. The 250-year-old decorative vase, made of gilt copper, was commissioned by the Chinese emperor Qianlong, and was looted from the Summer Palace in Peking during the Second Opium War of 1860. It was bought by Mrs Galloway’s father, James Alker, a keen art collector, at a sale in Birkenhead, Merseyside, in 1956. He passed it on to his daughter Mrs Galloway, who claims to have loaned the heirloom to her son, Steven, 52, and Miss Calland in the early 1990s. Following their split Miss Calland claimed the family never asked for the vase back. In 2011 however a judge ruled she was not entitled to the windfall because the 18th century case was never hers to sell in the first place. A wooden ornament that a couple used as a doorstop for 40 years has turned out to be a Chinese relic worth £250,000. The nine-inch tall item is a carved brush pot dating back to the late 18th century, when it would have been used to store calligraphers’ brushes. The unnamed couple inherited the ornament, which propped open their living room door. A heavy wooden ornament an unnamed couple used a doorstep in their Hertfordshire home for 40 years, turned out to be a Chinese relic worth over £250,000 . But when they invited an auctioneer to their home in Hertfordshire to look at some other items, they discovered its true value. Expert Richard Harrison spotted the doorstop on the floor and instantly recognised it as an 18th century Chinese brush pot. He said: ‘The carving is three dimensional almost, and shows figures of little boys doing things like setting off fire crackers. ‘It is in superb condition, which is remarkable given what it was being used for.’ Miss Calland's former conservatory where the Chinese vase used to sit on a table by the back door . Although the case came to an end the freelance science tutor now faces financial ruin after she was unable to cover the extortionate legal costs, despite selling her possessions. Her only asset left is her beloved home, a pink stone cottage in the picturesque Welsh market town. Andrea Calland  lost a legal battle with her former mother-in-law over rights to a £228,000 vase . 'I have no sofa, no TV, no fridge, all that is left in my house is a bed, washing machine, and a one-ring camping gas stove to cook off,' she said. 'The next stage is that they are going to force my house to auction. 'I put my house on the market for £210,000 in 2009 straight after the court date. 'It’s now reduced to £170,000 because it won’t sell. The flooding has put a lot of people off, it is a known flood risk area. 'The next stage is that their solicitors have sent a formal letter saying that I have had all the time in the world with things and it is still not sold. 'I have done everything, fitted a new carpet, kept it decorated, it is in a good form. 'If it is not gone by the end of April they will force me back into court which is yet more fees I can’t afford. 'If it goes to auction and doesn’t raise enough to cover everyone else’s bills I have a serious problem.' Speaking in 2011, Mrs Galloway said: 'The whole thing has been appalling. 'We could not stand by and let Andrea walk away with all that money. It is an awful lot and we had no idea the vase was worth that amount.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Fort Hood shooter Major Nadal Hasan can continue to represent himself while on trial for killing 13 people during a Texas military base shooting rampage, a judge ruled today. Defense lawyers asked the judge to take over his case on Wednesday and the trial was abruptly stopped after just one day in session because one of the attorneys claimed Hasan was purposefully trying to be convicted and executed. But the legal team, who have been helping the Army Psychiatrist, not representing him, were told by Judge Col. Tara Osborn that Hasan was only disagreeing on strategy and is fit to stand trial as his own lawyer, ABCNews reported. In this courtroom sketch today, Maj. Nidal Hasan, second from right, sits with his standby defense attorneys Maj. Joseph Marcee, left, and Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, second from left, as presiding judge Col. Tara Osborn looks on . In this courtroom sketch today, Staff Sgt. Michael Davis, a victim of the Fort Hood shootings, testifies during the trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan . Judge Osborn said: 'Standby counsel . may not agree with the way the accused is proceeding, but Major Hasan . determines his strategy, not standby counsel,' WFAA-TV reported. The standby attorney thinks Hasan is intentionally trying to get the death sentence for the 2009 rampage. Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, Hasan's lead court-appointed standby attorney, said . yesterday that he is willing to step in and be Hasan's defense lawyer . but asked that his responsibilities as co-counsel be minimized if Hasan . continues to work toward being executed. It . is 'clear his goal is to remove impediments or obstacles to the death . penalty and is working toward a death penalty,' Poppe told the judge . overseeing the case at the Texas military base. Hasan responded: 'I object. That's a twist of the facts.'The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, then cleared the courtroom yesterday. Ulterior motives: A standby lawyer argued Maj. Nidal Hasan (shown here in court on Tuesday) is trying to blow his defense so that he is sentenced to death . Blatant: During his brief opening statements on Monday, Hasan said that all of the evidence would show that he was the shooter, and it is unclear how he plans to defend his actions . Admitted shooter: Major Nidal Hasan, seen here in 2010, is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on Fort Hood Army base in 2009 . On Tuesday, he told jurors during a less than two-minute opening statement that the evidence would 'clearly show' he was the shooter, but that it would 'only show one side.' He also questioned only two of the first dozen witnesses, who included one soldier who was shot seven times during the November 2009 attack on the sprawling Army post. Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. If convicted, he would face the death penalty. Poppe said Hasan was acting as his own attorney in a way that, 'we believe is repugnant to defense counsel and contrary to our professional obligations.' Hasan repeatedly asked the judge to allow him to explain why Poppe's claim was wrong, saying: 'Your honor, Col. Poppe has made an assertion that is inaccurate. I'd like to clarify that.' Osborn paused for nearly half minute before asking that Hasan explain his argument in writing. He said he wouldn't do that. Osborn then closed the courtroom to discuss the matter. No witnesses were called Wednesday. Hasan, an American-born Muslim who was paralyzed after being shot by officers responding to the attack, said he was as a soldier who switched sides in what he described as a war between America and his Islamic faith. Hasan wanted to plead guilty to murder and attempted murder, but military rules forbid guilty pleas in death penalty cases. Precautions: Armed guards (seen here Tuesday) surround the courthouse on the Texas military base . High security: All cars are being checked for explosives as Fort Hood is operating under extreme caution during the trial . Hasan had also asked to argue that he carried out the shooting in 'defense of others,' namely members of the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan, but the judge denied that strategy. His defense strategy still remains unclear. During Tuesday's testimony, he occasionally took notes on a legal pad. While two defense attorneys remained on stand-by, Hasan rarely turned to them for advice. No American soldier has been executed since 1961, and military prosecutors showed that they would take no chance of fumbling details that could jeopardize any conviction down the line. Connected: The government has said that Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen . The long-delayed trial was years in the making after judges in the case had granted a series of delays. A fight over Hasan's beard, which violates military regulations, led to a stay shortly before his trial was expected to begin last year and eventual replacement of the judge. The trial is playing out amid high security at Fort Hood, where armed guards stood in doorways and 15-foot stacks of shock-absorbing barriers obscured the view of the courthouse. Jurors were told to prepare for a trial that could take months, and Hasan, who is in a wheelchair, needs regular breaks.","Maj.

"By . James Tozer . An actress returned from her first evening out following the birth of her son to find him dying in his father’s arms after they fell asleep together on the sofa. Leigh Arnold, a well-known television star in her native Ireland, was urged by fiance Steve Davies to take a break from looking after their two-and-a-half-week-old son Flynn and have dinner with a friend. But on her return she found Flynn ‘grey’ and lifeless as his father slept. Leigh Arnold and fiance Steve Davies who postponed their wedding after their son's death . Despite the frantic efforts of Mr Davies and paramedics to revive him, Flynn was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later. Now an inquest has ruled that Flynn had succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or cot death. Doctors who gave evidence at the hearing told the distraught couple there was nothing more they could have done. The actress, who is best-known for playing Dr Clodagh Delaney in Irish medical drama The Clinic, told the inquest she collapsed when she realised her son’s life was in danger. The actress, who is best-known for playing Dr Clodagh Delaney in Irish medical drama The Clinic, told the inquest she collapsed when she realised her son's life was in danger . Miss Arnold, 34, said: ‘Flynn was lying facing up. I could see his whole body. He wasn’t squashed. I saw by his face there was definitely something wrong. ‘I just know that I screamed an awful lot and my legs went from under me. I don’t remember an awful lot else.’ She added: ‘He was a perfect baby. He was healthy and extremely loved and adored and is missed every second of the day.’ Miss Arnold told the hearing Flynn had shown no signs of being ill in the days preceding the tragedy, and said she had left him feeding happily from his bottle on the night he died. She said: ‘I was invited out to dinner and didn’t feel it was the right thing to do, but knowing [the restaurant] was only down the road Steven said, “Go and have a break”, and I knew he would be OK.’ Mr Davies, a company director, told the hearing in Macclesfield he and Flynn had visited the supermarket after dropping off his fiancee at the restaurant. He returned home to the village of Ashley in Cheshire at 8pm, where the family’s au pair was taking care of Flynn’s one-year-old brother Hunter. Mr Davies, holds a child not thought to be Flynn. Mr Davies fell asleep at around 11pm the night his son died, only to be woken by Miss Arnold's screams . Mr Davies said: ‘I put the TV on and took Flynn out of his cradle. He kept waking up, then going back to sleep. I warmed a bottle up for him and he woke up again and had that. ‘Leigh called me to see if he was all right. I said he was OK and feeding at the time. ‘I was feeding him and he was in my arms. I was laid down on the chaise longue and he was in the crook of my left arm. That was the last thing I remember.’ Mr Davies fell asleep at around 11pm, only to be woken by Miss Arnold’s screams when she returned from her meal at 1.30am. A police investigation undertaken after Flynn’s death determined nobody was at fault and nothing could have been done to save him. Earlier this year Miss Arnold said she was taking 'one day at a time' following the tragedy . Paediatrician Dr Cate Lenton told the hearing Flynn was a ‘perfect baby’, and explained that cot death doesn’t always occur in cots. ‘While they are asleep they just turn off,’ she said. ‘It is just a baby that stops while it is asleep.’ Home Office pathologist Dr Gauri Batra gave a cause of death as ‘unascertained’, but added there was nothing at all to indicate an unnatural cause of death. Reaching a conclusion of death by natural causes, coroner Janet Napier told the tearful couple: ‘This was a sudden, tragic switching off in the sleep. I can’t properly say how awful this is. I give you my sincere sympathy.’ Miss Arnold and Mr Davies were due to wed last year but postponed the ceremony after Flynn’s death in May. They are now due to marry in Ibiza next month with Hunter, now two years old, acting as ring-bearer. Earlier this year Miss Arnold told an Irish newspaper she was taking ‘one day at a time’ following the tragedy, and had only just started to think about looking for acting roles. She added: ‘It’s been the most awful year of my life, obviously, and I would very much like to have the confidence to go out and start looking again.’ NHS advice on preventing cot death includes placing a baby to sleep on their back in a cot, and avoiding falling asleep with them on a sofa or armchair.","Leigh Arnold was urged to take a break from looking after her son by fiance Steve Davies .

He rejected allegations that he was part of a plot to hack countless celebrities and politicians. Unacceptable: Andy Coulson, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey on Tuesday with his wife Eloise, has described phone hacking as 'lazy journalism' He told the Old Bailey: ‘I would have thought it was intrusive, I would have thought it was a breach of privacy and I also thought it was lazy journalism.’ Coulson, later Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of communications, said he knew about journalists’ ‘dark arts’, such as surveillance, but said he meant only on the ‘acceptable, legal side of the law’. Coulson resigned as editor in 2007 as royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for hacking the phones of Palace aides. He told the Old Bailey he regretted not asking more questions about how journalists knew of ‘phone traffic’ – who was in phone contact with who.

"By . Emma Innes . A little girl who has had three open-heart operations is to be whisked away for a dream holiday at Disneyland. Ella-Louise Dee, five, could be facing a heart transplant after an attempt to repair the organ failed to have the impact it should have. As a result, the primary school pupil regularly turns blue and is often breathless, her mother Alice Holton, 23, says. Ella-Louise Dee, five, was born with a heart defect and has had to have three open-heart operations. She is now also facing the prospect of a heart transplant. She is pictured with her mother, Alice Holton, 23 . So to give her a boost while waiting to find out her new treatment plan, friends, family and the local community have got together at two separate charity events to raise £5,000 to send Ella-Louise, Ms Holton and Ella-Louise’s father, Darren Dee, 26, to Disneyland Paris. Ella-Louise's problems were first spotted at her mother’s 20 week scan during pregnancy. Ms Holton, from Middlesbrough, said: ‘We found out at Ella-Louise's five month scan that she had a heart defect and the doctors said she would need a heart operation when she was born. ‘I got to hold her for one second and then they took her straight away. It was really hard. They monitored her oxygen saturation and at three weeks old she had her first op.’ Ella-Louise was born with an atrioventricular septal defect which meant there was a hole between the upper filling chambers and the lower pumping chambers of her heart. It also meant she only had one valve between the atria and ventricles instead of the normal two. Ella-Louise's parents were told she had a heart defect at her mother's 20 week pregnancy scan . Ella-Louise's family and friends have now raised enough money to take her to Disneyland while they wait to hear what treatment she will need next. She is pictured in hospital . Ella-Louise was at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital for three months before she could go home. ‘She was fine until she needed another operation after a couple of years,’ said Ms Holton. ‘She was very blue and breathless and didn't have much exercise tolerance at all. ‘If she went outside for exercise when she got in her lips would be very blue. ‘It was also noticed on her scan that her valves were getting a bit blocked so they needed to operate.’ Ella-Louise was put on medication and scheduled for another operation in the summer of 2010, when she was one and a half. Ella-Louise had surgery in 2012 which was meant to be a 'full repair' of her heart but it was unsuccessful . She then had her third open-heart operation in November 2012 which her mother says was supposed to be a ‘full repair’. But the operation didn't have the required effect and a transplant may now be needed for Ella-Louise who is currently on five types of medication and also has a non-functioning spleen. ‘After that they thought that she'd hopefully not have to have any more operations, but that didn't go to plan,’ said Ms Holton, who is Ella-Louise’s full-time carer. ‘They don't really know what the issue is but she's still really blue and breathless and she's supposed to have gone a lot pinker and have more breath. ‘They are a bit stuck on what to do - it might have to be a transplant now.’ Due to her heart problems Ella-Louise gets very breathless and has a tendency to turn slightly blue . Friends and family organised a pool and darts marathon as well as a charity fun night at The Acklam Garden City - and raised an impressive £5,000. ‘It was absolutely brilliant - a great night,’ said Ms Holton. ‘She got a bit tired at 10pm but she was up dancing and really enjoyed herself. ‘She's a really, really happy little girl who tries to go on the trampoline longer than she should! ‘Sometimes I have to tell her to sit down and calm down but she just wants to be out with the other kids.' She added: ‘She absolutely loves Disney and we want to create a fantastic memory for her.’","Ella-Louise Dee has a heart defect and had surgery at three weeks old .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A Banksy artwork has been removed from a wall just hours after it was tracked down to a Bristol street. The piece, called Mobile Lovers depicting two lovers embracing while checking their mobile phones, with the man looking suspiciously like former prime minister Tony Blair, was initially posted to Banksy's website yesterday but with its whereabouts unknown. It was then today tracked down to a street in Bristol within sight of the city centre, but within hours it was taken down by members of the Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project with crowbars this afternoon. Mobile Lovers by Banksy, left, was tracked down to Bristol today but just hours later it was removed for safe keeping, right . But the group insist that rather than just taking the art work, they are actually keeping it safe from harm and are inviting people to the project to view the work. They then plan to auction off the piece of art as they were told the work was left for them and they hope it could bring in around £100,000. Leader of the youth club Dennis Stinchcombe said: 'He has given it to the club. He couldn't give it to us directly as the gates were locked so he put it as close as he could. He has done it to help the right people. 'Somebody was saying it is worth £40,000 but I am hoping for £100,000. It has been authenticated on his website but I am going to try to get it officially done as well. The new Banksy mural, right, features two lovers . embracing while checking their mobile phones. The man featured in the . work suspiciously looks like former prime minister Tony Blair . Three men from the Broad Plain & Riverside Youth Project board up the doorway after removing the Banksy . 'We will let people come and see it in here for a while then get it to Bonhams for valuation. 'The money will allow us to do everything we could dream of. It will stand us in good stead for the next 120 years.' The work was only on show on the Bristol street for a matter of hours before it was taken down by the Riverside Youth Project. Robert Darke, a boxing coach at the project told Mailonline: 'We had a bit of an issue as it is a bit of a rough area and we were really worried it would either be vandalised or stolen. 'So we have taken it in for safekeeping. A notice where Mobile Lovers once stood, directs people to the youth group if they want to view the work for a small donation . 'We need to raise £120,000 to stay open and we thought it would be a good idea if we put it on display and people could throw in a few pounds to see it. 'People were a bit adverse at first but they seem to be coming around to us and realise we are doing it to help a good cause. 'We would like to consider Banksy might have placed it where he did on purpose although we could never prove it. 'It was just on a flimsy bit of wood 10 metres away from the premises so we would like to think he is helping out as he's from Bristol so might know the area.' A notice where the Banksy image once stood now directs people to the Riverside Youth Project if they want to view it. The Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project where the latest Banksy artwork was taken to and is now on display . Leader of the youth group Dennis Stinchcombe, also explained he had been urged to take the piece down by a friend of the elusive graffiti artist. The 58-year-old added: 'I was approached by somebody who knows Banksy very well. 'He's an artist himself and he said 'you need to take that Dennis, get it into that club - it's what it is meant for' 'Banksy never does his street art on pieces of wood - they are always on walls so they can't be taken away. The Banksy artwork was tracked down to Bristol using this image that appeared on the artist's website . 'We need £120,000 to keep going and our fundraising appeal has so far only brought a few thousand pounds. 'Now we've ended up with a Banksy on our doorstep. 'It is a dream come true. I'm absolutely buzzing.' Mr Stinchcombe, who has been working at the youth club for the past 40 years, spotted the piece at 9.15 am yesterday. Before it was removed, a man and a woman visiting the artwork try to recreate Banksy's new image called Mobile Lovers . He did not believe it was an authentic Banksy until a friend pointed out that it had been confirmed on the artist's website later that day. The piece had stood unguarded until this afternoon, when he received the tip off from the unnamed man. 'We have taken it off the wall carefully, it isn't damaged at all,"" he added. 'If anyone wants to see it they can come in here and put a donation in the box if they feel like it. People gathered to get a snap of the new Bristol artwork by Banksy . The new image did look out onto the A4032, the main road leading into Bristol from the M32 motorway but has now been removed for safe-keeping . 'I think it is beautiful, I’m a fan of his work. Whatever way you look at it the man is a genius. 'It isn’t bad graffiti, like this tagging nonsense you see - it is a real work of art. Speaking before the piece was removed, George Ferguson, Mayor of Bristol said: 'It's good to see another witty Banksy raid on his home city - respectfully painted in a blocked up doorway. 'He is part of what gives Bristol its artistic, creative and subversive spirit which makes us such a sparky place. 'I hope it will be respected and protected as we would want for any other legitimate work of street art.' Avon and Somerset Police were unable to confirm whether they were investigating the removal of the art work. It is also unclear who owns the wall where the mural was placed.

"By . Associated Press . A male police officer has been dressing as an Amish woman hoping to scare off a man suspected of exposing himself to Amish children. Pulaski Township Sgt.

I felt this guy was pretty much a predator who was preying on kids who had no means of communication. Basically, it’s all Amish population through there,' he added.

A mother-of-two who claims she was brutally attacked at a party has said she is too scared to leave the house after her face was stamped on by a woman wearing stiletto heels. Melanie Langley's face was left battered and bruised with bloody holes in her forehead after she claims she was set upon by two women at a house party. Now the 39-year-old mother, of Great Eccleston, Lancashire, says she may need a skin graft after chunks of flesh and hair were ripped from her head. Ms Langley said: 'I was backed into a corner and one grabbed my hair and pushed me to the floor, then the other stamped on my head. 'I was supposed to start a job on the Monday, but I couldn't leave the house for two weeks because I was such a mess. 'My face was so swollen and I was covered in cuts and bruises. 'The cut on my head looks like it's going to scar so I might need a skin graft. I've had to get my hair cut off because they put glue in it and the hairdresser couldn't get it out. 'My hair was lovely and long but now I've had to cut it really short and it's almost still bald on one side. 'I don't want to go out the house for people to see the way I look and I'm terrified I'll run into the women again. 'At the moment I have no confidence at all and so I stay in the house when I finish work. 'I just don't understand why it happened,' Ms Langley said the ordeal happened at around 9.30pm at a party thrown by friends on February 2. She said it has not only left her with physical scars, but the mental affects of the attack have harmed her whole family. She said: 'The police have told me there's not enough evidence and the case is closed because they can't get anyone to give evidence. 'It has been absolutely horrific for my whole family but now we need to try and move on from it. 'I'll never forget what happened but I'm trying to put it behind me as best I  can. She claims she was brutally attacked at a party and has said she is now too scared to leave the house after her face was stamped on by a woman wearing stiletto heels .

They decided to go after they bumped into a friend in a village pub who told them about the gathering. But he says he was horrified to burst into the living room after hearing screams to see the attack taking place. He said: 'Me and my friend had gone into the kitchen to pour a lager and we heard screaming going on. 'We came out of the kitchen and it was so horrific it was untrue.

The mother-of-two said she was backed in a corner and stamped on on the head by the two women . He said after he managed to break the fight up, they left and he called police when they arrived home. 'As soon as the police turned up, they interviewed her. She said she was not going to press charges but the day after, as soon as she saw her injuries, she changed her mind.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police appealed for anyone with information about the incident to come forward. She said: 'The assault was thoroughly investigated, and a 22-year-old woman voluntarily attended a police station and was spoken to as part of the enquiry. 'All the available evidence was presented to the Crown Prosecution Service, who advised police that there was insufficient evidence to charge. 'If anybody has any information which they believe could assist with this investigation, they are asked to call police on 101.'","Melanie Langley's face was left battered and bruised with bloody holes .

A father feared he would lose his arm after he was savagely attacked by a dog being walked by a six-year-old boy. Jamie Farrell, 30, was left with gaping wounds exposing his right arm to the bone after being attacked in Bradford, West Yorkshire. The Japanese Akita latched on to the joiner's forearm as he went to fetch tools from his van on Thursday, leaving him to fend off the animal with his bare hands. Mr Farrell, 27, said: 'I was working on a house and I went outside to get some more tools. 'As I got to the bottom of the garden path, the dog came from nowhere and went straight for me. There was nothing to provoke it, it was just angry. 'I thought it was going to pull my arm off. I had to grab hold of its neck with my other hand and literally pull it off me so it would let go. 'It went for my leg, and when I got it off me again it went back for my arm. I was bleeding all over the place, I thought it was going to finish me off. 'I got back into the house and was given towels to stop the blood. It was scary.' The dog was being walked on a lead by a six-year-old boy when it broke loose and attacked Mr Farrell. It is believed the child managed to get the dog back under control following the attack, but Mr Farrell is calling for it to be destroyed. He said: 'I want the dog to be put down, because if it did what it did to me to a child, they would never survive. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

'My arm is my livelihood,' said Mr Farrell. 'I need it to do my job and look after my family. 'I like dogs, I grew up with them and I’ve had Labradors and Dobermans. A neighbour had Rottweilers and Akitas before and I’ve always got on with them. 'My arm is my livelihood,' said Mr Farrell.

"By . Leon Watson . Dangerous: A drawing pin in Richard Cooper's front tyre during the Wiggle New Forest Spring Sportive on Saturday . Saboteurs angry at bicyles 'taking over' country roads targeted a cycling event by scattering nails, putting lives of riders in danger. Nails were strewn along the road in a New Forest village as more than 2,000 cyclists took part in an 84-mile ride which has angered locals. Police are investigating the incident in Bransgore, Hampshire, which saw more than 20 participants in the Wiggle Sportive suffer punctures. Opponents of the event had put up posters listing 15 villages and towns on the route and urging residents to raise the alarm if entrants caused trouble. New Forest East MP Julian Lewis today condemned the sabotage as 'absolutely reprehensible' and vowed to raise the matter in Government. Dr Lewis said: 'It does not help anyone when people, however frustrated they feel, do something that could lead to a nasty accident or at the very least a nasty confrontation. 'I'm hoping the cause of the provocation will sooner rather than later be sorted out, but taking the law into one's own hands is not the way forward. 'Doing something illegal and dangerous is never the right thing to do.' Dr Lewis said talks were taking place with Government ministers and national park chiefs to resolve tensions between residents and cyclists. He added: 'This whole issue is absolutely being focused on by local elected representatives right up to Government ministers. 'I would appeal to the community to disassociate themselves from these actions.' Martin Barden, director of UK Cycling Events which organised the Wiggle Spring Sportive, criticised the vandalism. He said: 'There were a handful of locals who tried to disrupt the event, and marshals had to clear that up. 'It is something nobody wants to see but we do not have much control of that. We are surprised and saddened to see it happen.' Mr Barden added he hopes the event - which raised more than £3,000 for Oakhaven Hospice in Lymington, Hampshire - will return in October.

He described seeing one incident where a herd of cattle was 'spooked'. Mr Hockley said: 'There are a few cyclists who had that 'hell for leather' mentality - but that was a minority. 'I did see some cyclists overtake on blind bends and narrow lanes and one even overtook me on a right hand turn on the wrong side of the road. 'Most of the riders rode in single file, and nearly all of them behaved very well.' Last spring's Wiggle Sportive was disrupted when drawing pins were scattered across the road and motorists formed a roadblock to slow competitors down. And at a second event in October, in the dead of night, wreckers pulled down signage and sprayed mud across the road.","More than 20 cyclists in the Wiggle Sportive race suffered punctures .

"By . Katy Winter . One of the most iconic brands in existence, Cadbury’s distinctive purple and white logo has been a stalwart image on confectionery shelves across the UK for over a century - and never more so than at Easter. As the supermarkets and shops begin once again to overspill with chocolate chicks, bunnies and eggs in the run up to Good Friday, a historic set of pictures shows the evolution of the Cadbury’s Easter Egg. From the very first dark chocolate egg made in 1875, to the birth of the crème egg in 1971, and today’s mass production of the popular milk chocolate egg, these photos give a fascinating insight into the development of one of our tastiest traditions. The manufacturing line making Cadbury's Easter Eggs in 1930. The eggs were decorated and had their plain shells enhanced with chocolate piping and marzipan flowers . Two women at the Cadbury's chocolate factory in Bournville, in the West Midlands join together chocolate Easter egg halves in February 1932 . The factory in Bournville is still used by Cadbury's today. Here wrapped milk chocolate eggs are prepared to be packed into their their cardboard boxes . Cadbury’s began in 1824 when John Cadbury opened a shop in Bull Street selling, among other things cocoa and drinking chocolate, which he prepared himself using a pestle and mortar. The Cadbury manufacturing business was born in 1831, when John Cadbury decided to start producing on a commercial scale and bought a four-storey warehouse in nearby Crooked Lane. Only a few years later in 1875 Cadbury produced their first Easter egg. The earliest eggs were made with dark chocolate and had a smooth, plain surface. They were filled with sugar-coated chocolate drops known as 'dragees’. An intricately decorated cardboard presentation shell for Cadbury's Easter Eggs used between 1920-1925 .

The lid of the box is decorated with traditional imagery of Easter and you can glimpse similar floral designs on the egg itself . The oldest and biggest Easter Egg in Cadbury's possession. It dates from the 1930's and would have been purchased by the upper classes of British society . An magazine advert showing the design for an egg in 1930 stating it costs 3 shillings and 6 pence .

Later Easter eggs were decorated and had their plain shells enhanced with chocolate piping and marzipan flowers. Cream-filled eggs first appeared back in 1923. But the Cadbury Creme Egg we know and love today didn’t hit the shelves until 1971. Sales really took off in 1975, when Cadbury Creme Egg became a cult through the power of TV advertising.

They’re made in two halves, both filled with white and one additionally filled with yellow fondant. The two halves are closed together quickly and there it is - a Cadbury Creme Egg. With its milk chocolate shell, creme fondant and yellow 'yolk’ Cadbury Creme Egg is absolutely unique in the market, and over 200 million of them are sold in the UK every year.","Cadbury's was started in 1824 and they made their first  Easter Egg in 1875 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . It is always good form to wear a sunhat at the beach - but at one sandy spot today hard hats were more in order. In Eastbourne, Sussex, today hundreds of tons of gravel were sprayed from just off-shore by a giant dredger drafted in to repair the devastation caused by the huge storms this winter. Miles and miles of English coast was battered by high winds and powerful waves, which has sped up the rate at which the beach is dwindling. The process of longshore drift - where natural tides gradually shift sand and sediment along the shoreline - was put into overdrive by the unnaturally fierce weather. In an attempt to restore the shrinking sands, the Envrionment Agency and local councils have begun using the dredging vessels - such as the Sospan Dau pictured below - to suck up sediment from one point along the beach, mix it with water and spit it back out. The process, known as rainbowing, should help protect the beach in years to come. Scroll down for video . Gravel: The dredger sprayed a mixture of sediment and water, as workmen looked on, in a bid to repair the damage caused this winter . Spray: The dredger could be seen in Eastbourne, Sussex, today topping up the sediment by the beach . Operation: Local authorities and the Environment Agency have deployed the dredgers along the English coast . Decline: The dredger has been brought in to counter longshore drift, which gradually moves sediment away from Eastbourne's beach . 'Rainbowing': The ship sucks up sediment further along the shore then spits it out at the necessary point . Imperative: The work was necessary after the impact of this winter's storms, which moved more sediment than usual from the beach . Top-up: The process should secure the integrity of the beaches for the time being .","Huge dredger was seen spraying mixture of sediment and water onto the beach at Eastbourne, Sussex ."

"By . Mark Duell . Two men today appeared in court in the first British prosecution for female genital mutilation. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 31, a registrar at Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, has been charged with one count of an offence contrary to the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. He will be tried alongside Hasan Mohamed, 40, who faces charges of encouraging an offence of female genital mutilation, when the case is heard at London's Southwark Crown Court in May. In court: Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena (left), 31, of the Whittington Hospital in North London, and Hasan Mohamed (right), 40, who is not a medic, face the first charges brought under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 . Leaving the hearing: Mohamed, whose address was not read out in court, is charged with intentionally encouraging an offence of FGM under section 44(1) of the Serious Crime Act 2007 . Mohamed also faces a charge of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring Dharmasena to commit an offence of female genital mutilation. Both men indicated they would enter not guilty pleas at a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court today. Committing the case for a preliminary hearing at Southwark Crown Court on May 2, Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said there was no legal precedent for a case of this kind. ‘This is the first offence of this type to go through the courts,’ she said. Workplace: Dr Dharmasena is a registrar at Whittington Hospital (pictured) in Archway, north London . Female genital mutilation has been a criminal offence in the UK since 1985 but new legislation in 2003 introduced a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. 'This is the first offence of this type to go through the courts' Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot . The 2003 act also made it an offence for UK citizens to carry out or procure female genital mutilation abroad, even in countries where the practice is legal. Dr Dharmasena, of Ilford, Essex, is charged with an offence contrary to section 1(1) of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. The section specifically forbids anyone from removing or mutilating part of a woman's genitals. Mohamed, whose address was not read out, is charged with intentionally encouraging an offence of FGM under section 44(1) of the Serious Crime Act 2007. They were both granted unconditional bail.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . The Royal Navy has revealed its latest 3D radar system which can track missiles - before knocking them out of the sky. The cutting-edge system, called 'Artisan', was tested by some 180 sailors on board HMS Iron Duke off the coast of Portland today. It tracked a sea-skimming target, before launching a Seawolf missile - which crashed into the object seconds later. Scroll down for video . Trial: The Royal Navy tested its 'Artisan' system on board HMS Iron Duke off the coast of Portland today. It tracked a target, before launching a Seawolf missle (above) - which crashed into the object seconds later . The dramatic moment, caught on camera by crew members, was the first time the system had been used to track a moving target ahead of a missile launch. And it has been deemed a success - with experts saying the 'Artisan' system could be used by the Navy in the future to counter any threats in the skies. 'I’m pleased the team performed well . and we achieved the firing quickly and efficiently,' said . Lieutenant Commander Chris L’Amie, who directed the firing from the frigate’s operations . room. 'It really boosted . confidence in the new radar ahead of Iron Duke’s deployment.' New technology: The dramatic moment, caught on camera by crew members, was the first time the system had been used to track a moving target ahead of a missile launch.

Frigate: And it has been deemed a success - with experts saying the 'Artisan' system could be used by the Navy in the future to counter any threats in the skies. Above, HMS Iron Duke, where the tests were carried out . Today, sailors used the system to track the target, which was being dragged along the surface of the sea by a long tow wire attached to an aircraft. They then passed the data to the Seawolf missile to follow and shoot - before successfully blasting the object out of the sky with a direct hit, according to a Royal Navy statement. The trial, which took place as the frigate made its way back to its home base in Portsmouth, followed eight weeks of tough training in Plymouth. 'We had just finished . eight hard weeks of training where we’d used Seawolf in simulation mode . to defend ourselves against hostile aircraft and missiles,' said . Lt Cmdr L’Amie. Blasting off: Sailors launch Seowolf missiles off the deck of HMS Iron Duke using Artisan - or 997 - software . “To cap off the training with . a live shoot was hugely satisfying.' Iron Duke is the first ship in Britain's fleet to have Artisan - also known as 997 in the Navy - and has been testing the system around the UK since completing a refit last year. The revamp also saw her receive the latest version of Seawolf – a missile which has protected Navy frigates from air attack for more than 30 years. Lieutenant Commander Jim Hyde, whose Short . Range Air Defence (SHORAD) team is responsible for both Artisan and the . upgraded Seawolf, was also on board Iron Duke for the successful shoot. 'Following . a challenging trials and development programme, today was significant . as it was the first time we have conducted a live firing with 997,' he . said. 'It was rewarding . to see both the new radar and the upgraded weapon system operate . together perfectly, successfully demonstrating end-to-end combat system . performance, and validating a lot of hard work done by agencies across . MOD and in industry.' At work: The system can track 800 targets simultaneously - and can even register objects 125 miles away . Artisan is being fitted to the Navy’s Type 23 frigates, as well as its two new aircraft carriers and assault ships Ocean and Albion. It could also be the principal air radar of the Type 26 combat ships, successor to the 23s, which enter service next decade. Astonishingly, the system can track up to 800 targets simultaneously - and can even register objects 125 miles (200 kilometres) away.","New system, called 'Artisan', tested by sailors off coast of Portland today .

"By . Ben Spencer . Some of England’s best-loved beaches could be turned into no-go zones for swimmers under tough new EU rules. Tourism bosses predict a disaster for local businesses if popular resorts are placed on an environmental blacklist over water quality. When the new European directive is enforced in May 2015, the rules on water safety will become twice as stringent overnight, rendering dozens of beaches which are currently safe off-limits for swimmers. Warning: Tourism bosses warn the new rules could be disastrous for local businesses across Britain's coast . One in ten of England’s 400 registered bathing beaches will fail the new tests, according to Environment Agency projections. Signposts will be erected at sites that do not meet the tough new standards, warning swimmers against entering the water. Ironically, 39 of those English beaches that could be on the EU blacklist were declared safe by the Marine Conservation Society today. Even more remarkably, seven beaches which could fail next year are deemed to have ‘excellent’ water under the existing rules and are today included in the charity’s Good Beach Guide 2014. Coastal residents and tourist industry representatives accept higher standards on water quality are needed – but say to suddenly double the strictness of the tests is ‘unfair’. Water quality is highly dependent on weather, with a wet year causing more pollution to run into the sea. So taking one test and then planting a sign on the beach telling people it is unsafe for swimming is not representative, residents fear. 39 of the beaches that could be on the EU blacklist were declared safe by the Marine Conservation Society . Malcolm Bell, of Visit Cornwall, said: ‘These changes make it look as though things have got worse.’ Porthluney Cove and Seaton,  two popular Cornish beaches, are among seven that are considered ‘excellent’ – the highest grade – in today’s guide but are projected to fail next year. Mr Bell said: ‘If you have a tourism business near one of those beaches it becomes a major issue. The tourists move on, but it is not so easy to move your business. Water quality is not static – it depends on the conditions, the weather and events out of your control. A better system would be to have live information on water quality and conditions.’ All three beaches at Blackpool  in Lancashire – each of them deemed safe according to today’s Marine Conservation Society report –  face having warning signs erected next year, despite huge investment in cleaning up sea water at  the resort. Iain Hawkins, who runs eight tourist attractions in the town including Blackpool Tower, said: ‘Of course it is not fair. These changes should be brought in over a period. ‘The biggest attraction in Blackpool is the beach. If we were to lose that it would be a disaster.’ Other beaches that could fail include Mothecombe in South Devon, Seaton Carew North in County Durham and Spittal in Northumberland, which are currently all ‘excellent’. The Marine Conservation Society’s report only found six English beaches that would fail on the current tests. Under the new rules 45 would fail. Rachel Wyatt, coastal pollution officer at the society, said: ‘It’s great that we are able to recommend more beaches than ever for excellent water quality and it shows just how good British beaches can be. ‘But the main challenge now is maintaining these standards, whatever the weather.’ An Environment Agency spokesman said: ‘There have been major improvements in the quality of bathing waters over the decades. ‘Around nine in ten English beaches already meet the higher standards that come into force next year, but we cannot afford to be complacent.’","New European directive enforced in May 2015 tightening water rules .

She has dazzled audiences with her on-screen appearances and is used to being the centre of attention on the red carpet. But actress Thandie Newton was taught to keep a low profile when she was growing up – to try and protect her from horrific racist abuse. The 41-year-old star of Crash, who was raised in Penzance, has vivid memories of her family being bullied because of their race. She said her father Nick, who is white British, tried to protect them – but her mother Nyasha, a Zimbabwean, wanted her daughter to avoid attracting attention to minimise the amount of verbal abuse her family were subjected to. The British actress recalled: ‘It was a beautiful environment, but very backward when it came to racial politics. ‘I was getting good grades, I was a really happy, sparkly child and she [Thandie’s mother] was aware that the more I was achieving, the more resentment there was from other people. But I didn’t understand, I was only little.’ She added: ‘Just walking through the town was drawing attention to ourselves – so of course that  has an effect on how you want your kids to be.’ Miss Newton, who was born in London and spent the first three years of her life in Zambia, said she and her younger brother Jamie were the only black children in the area and were treated as outsiders.

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . James McVay, who has a history of mental illness, has been sentenced to death for killing a South Dakota nurse as part of a plot to assassinate President Barack Obama . A man with a history of mental illness has been sentenced to death by a jury for killing a South Dakota hospice nurse as part of a plot to assassinate President Barack Obama. James McVay pleaded guilty but mentally ill to murder in 2012 in connection with the stabbing death of 75-year-old Maybelle Schein. McVay, 43, said he killed Schein and stole her car as part of his plan to drive to Washington and kill the president. The Sioux Falls jury chose the death penalty, though jurors could have sentenced McVay to life in prison without parole. Authorities said McVay walked away from a minimum-security prison in July 2011 in Sioux Falls and was mixing cough syrup and alcohol when he climbed under Schein's slightly open garage door, entered her house, killed her and drove away in her car. After Schein's car was reported stolen, police used a tracking service in the vehicle to find McVay on Interstate 90 near Madison, Wisconsin. He was arrested after a brief chase. Madison Police Officer Kipp Hartman testified that he was trying to get McVay to reveal his name when McVay began saying he 'killed a little old lady' in South Dakota and stole her car to get to Washington, D.C., to kill the president. Prosecutor Aaron McGowan said McVay stabbed Schein nine times, with the final blow cutting her vocal cords and carotid artery, causing her to bleed to death within 16 seconds. But public defender Traci Smith yesterday said McVay's characterization by the prosecution as monstrous did not square with the facts of the case or his history, the Argus Leader reported. Smith said McVay's mental health was not properly monitored or cared for by the prison staff. She added that McVay poses no threat when his illness is cared for. McVay, 43, said he killed Maybelle Schein (pictured) and stole her car as part of his plan to drive to Washington and kill the president . 'The state has continually downplayed the effect of mental illness,' Smith said. The jury, made up of seven men and five women, agreed last week with prosecutors that McVay's crime met two aggravating circumstances that would allow the state to impose a death sentence. The first deemed the offense outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman; the second found that the defendant committed the offense for his own benefit or the benefit of another. Public defender Amber Eggert during the . trial argued before the jury that McVay has suffered from mental illness . as well as alcohol and drug issues for much of his life and his life . should be spared. Madison Police Officer Kipp Hartman testified that he was trying to get McVay to reveal his name when McVay began saying he 'killed a little old lady' in South Dakota and stole her car to get to Washington, D.C., to kill the president . She said that the night before the killing, McVay mixed alcohol with a DXM-based cough syrup, which can cause hallucinations. McVay said he awoke briefly at 3am to find spiritual entities surrounding him and awoke again hours later to find them still there, telling him to follow through on his plan, she told jurors. 'That was the sign he was going to get the transportation and the final stuff he needed before going to Washington, D.C.,' Eggert told the jury. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, earlier this month said the death penalty is traditionally reserved for the worst of the worst, and it's rare for a state to seek the punishment of death after finding someone guilty but mentally ill. 'I just don't know of any cases in which you have (such) a verdict, and then the state still seeks the death penalty,' he said. Dieter said the guilty but mentally ill verdict gained popularity in a dozen states as part of the public outcry over John Hinckley being found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982 in the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. The jury on Monday deliberated for a little more than five hours. After the verdict was announced, McGowan said the jury 'made a brave decision.' 'I think they made the correct decision,' McGowan said. McVay's defense team did not speak to the media after the hearing. Some of them wept after the verdict was read, news outlets reported. Three other individuals are on death row in South Dakota: Rodney Berget, Charles Rhines and Briley Piper.","James McVay pleaded guilty but mentally ill to murder of South Dakota nurse .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A farmer has been fined after one of his bulls ran rampage in a small town in eastern Romania after he forgot to tie it up when he went to the pub. Hercules the bull caused mayhem in Bralia while his owner Baltasar Nagar, 47, was enjoying a drink in the town tavern. After a while, Hercules got fed up grazing on grass alongside the road in Braila and decided to hit the tarmac for more action. Scroll down for video . Running a red light: Hercules the bull ran rampage in the small town of Bralia in eastern Romania after his owner went to the pub and forgot to tie him up . Hercules was caught on CCTV as he suddenly charged at policeman Eugen Vasilescu, 39, who was directing traffic. Hercules impaled him on his horns and hurtled down the road with him before shaking him loose like a rag doll. ‘It was incredible, like a scene from a wild west movie,’ said pedestrian witness Andrei Neagu. ‘One second the cop was directing the traffic as usual and the next he is riding the bull from the business end of his horns!’ Witnesses came to the aid of the unfortunate policeman who suffered chest, groin and head injuries from his encounter with the beast dubbed by local media as the ‘mad bull of Braila.’ Bully: Hercules, seen behind the red car, charged at policeman Eugen Vasilescu, seen in bright yellow, and impaled him on his horns . T-horn in his side: Hercules attacked the policeman,who suffered chest, groin and head injuries from his encounter with the beastly bull, and Hercules' owner ended up paying £200 for his pet's rampage . CCTV caught the whole episode on film, including the moment Hercules impales the poor policeman . ‘He just came out of nowhere,’ said officer Neagu. ‘I didn't stand a chance.  I know one thing now though - I will never be a matador. 'When you see such a powerful creature stomping towards you, you have to have respect for it.’ Surveillance cameras caught the whole episode on film and aided local prosecutors this week to slap Mr Nagar with a £100 pound fine for leaving the animal unattended. He was also ordered to pay a further £100 in compensation to the injured officer Neagu. Hercules was caught after about an hour, with the help of a veterinarian who tranquillized him.","Hercules the bull attacked a policeman on Romanian street .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Angela Merkel likes to play it safe in public - and it seems that in private the German chancellor is no different. Mrs Merkel has been pictured on holiday with her rarely-seen husband Joachim Sauer in the same Italian city the couple have been visiting for decades. The pair were spotted browsing shops in Sant'Angelo on the island of D'Ischia, near Naples in the Mediterranean. Chancellor Angela Merkel is on holiday in the fishing village of Sant'Angelo with husband Joachim Sauer (right) The couple were photographed walking along the seafront on the island of D'Ischia where they have been going on holiday for decades . They are thought to be staying in the five-star Miramare Spa Hotel on the south of the island, which comes with its own private beach, and balconies overlooking the ocean. Guests are also given exclusive use of the Aphrodite Apollon Thermal Gardens spa centre which has 12 natural thermal pools, a naturally heated sauna and a gym. Prices start at £160 per night but can go up to £280 for some of the more expensive suites. As a world leader there is never a good moment to go away, and Mrs Merkel's break was interrupted yesterday while discussing the Ukrainian crisis with David Cameron, who is also on holiday. Despite the distraction she managed to squeeze in a visit to Pompeii, and was also spotted coming back from some of the island's natural hot springs. The couple were spotted out shopping in the town. They also found time for a day visit to Pompeii, and went for a dip in the natural thermal baths on the island . Hopefully this break will be more successful for the chancellor than her last getaway, when she fell over and broke her hip while cross-country skiing . Last year Mrs Merkel was pictured in her swimming costume as she visited the same baths with her husband and young grandchildren, looking 'the most relaxed we've ever seen her', according to the German press. However in 2006 a row erupted after a UK newspaper printed pictures of Merkel changing into her bathing costume at the same baths. The coverage prompted an official complaint from the German government, though they decided not to take legal action. Even with the prying eyes of the world on her, that trip was markedly more pleasant that her skiing holiday this winter, when she fell over and broke her hip. The chancellor was on a skiing trip in Engadin in Switzerland when she fell. She thought she suffered only bruises but a medical examination when she returned to the German capital Berlin showed she had actually broken a bone. Doctors told her she will have to rest for the next three weeks while the injury heals. The couple have been visiting the same destination for decades. In 2006 a UK newspaper was rebuked by the German government for printing pictures of Merkel changing into her swimming costume while on holiday in the village . Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said said: 'She suffered serious bruising in connection with a partial fracture on her left posterior pelvic ring. We understand she was going at slow speed on a cross-country ski course when the accident occurred.' Merkel is not the only world leader on holiday in the run-up to Easter, as David Cameron and his wife Samantha are also taking a break in Lanzarote. The couple and their children Nancy, Arthur and Florence are spending six days on the island in a £200-a-night restored 18th century farmhouse, away from the main resorts. The retreat has been styled with an Indonesian theme. It includes carved Buddha statues, has its own yoga hall, swimming pool, hot tub  and ‘chill-out’ area with hammocks – ideal for a Prime  Minister who reputedly has a taste for 'chillaxing'.

"By . Hugo Gye . The grave of a First World War soldier has been saved from destruction after it was swallowed up by a huge sinkhole. Private Francis Ryan fell victim to the flooding which hit Britain earlier this year, as his headstone was almost lost in the 20ft-deep sinkhole. But engineers from the Ministry of Defence have now succeeded in repairing the hole and restoring the cemetery to its original glory in time for the centenary of the Great War. Swallowed up: The grave of Private Francis Ryan was at risk from a 20ft-deep sinkhole . Saved: The MoD has now filled in the sinkhole and laid new turf over the affected area . Private Ryan, from Ireland, died in 1915 aged 40 while serving with the 3rd Battalion, King's (Liverpool) Regiment. He was buried in Wales's only military cemetery, at Pembroke Dock in the south-west of the country, in the shade of a Scots pine. In February, a sinkhole was caused by natural water erosion through the limestone beneath Private Ryan's grave. The 6ft-wide hole swallowed up Private Ryan's remains, leaving a tangle of rocks and tree roots visible. His headstone was thought to be in danger of falling in too, along with five other graves surrounding his. Fighters: Private Ryan served with the 3rd Battalion, Royal (Liverpool) Regiment, pictured here in 1915 . Risk: Six graves nearest the sinkhole were fenced off to stop visitors from injuring themselves . Lost: Private Ryan's remains were swallowed up by the earth, but his headstone has been preserved . MoD workers have now filled in the chasm and laid down fresh turf to make the graveyard look as good as new. A spokesman said the engineers avoided the disturbance of exhuming Private Ryan's remains, and filled the sinkhole with a clay-grout mixture. 'It was necessary to close the cemetery in January last year for health and safety reasons after a grave collapsed - creating a large opening and damaging two adjacent graves,' she said. 'An appropriate repair has now been carried out following detailed assessment work. 'We were determined to see the graves restored in time to commemorate these men's sacrifice during the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.' Work: The engineers used a mixture of clay and grout to shore up the graves and preserve them . Soldiers: Members of Private Ryan's battalion pictured relaxing during training in Lancashire . Pembroke Dock district parade marshal David Boswell added: 'I am very happy that they have saved Private Ryan's headstone from falling into the sinkhole. 'They have filled the sinkhole in and covered it in a fresh piece of turf and it looks wonderful. 'Now the public can return to the cemetery and pay their respects to the soldiers who gave their lives for their country. 'We will be holding a service of remembrance in August to mark the centenary and we have the cemetery back to its best so we can remember our fallen.' The cemetery is the final resting place for 23 Commonwealth troops from the First World War and 51 from the Second World War. Pembroke Dock was formerly home to a number of Royal Navy ships, before becoming one of the major bases of the RAF.","The grave of Private Francis Ryan was hit by a sinkhole earlier this year .

She . said: 'I’ve tried and tested enough make-up to know that budget brands . have upped their game and there isn’t the same disparity in quality that . there used to be.' Testing Makeup Revolution, however, has been a budget revelation for Jane; in the pictures below on the right she's wearing designer make-up that costs £156, and in the other, on the left, make-up from Makeup Revolution that costs £14. 'Budget beauty brands often aim at younger girls who naturally have less disposable income, but in the case of Makeup Revolution it’s suitable for all age groups, regardless,' she said. On her eyes she used Redemption Palette Iconic 1, £4, containing twelve eye shadows; a mix of matte and shimmers for picture one and for picture two, she used Chanel Les 4 Ombres in Tisse Gabrielle with four shades that have a high sheen. Cheap vs expensive: Jane, pictured, left, wearing Makeup Revolution and, right, wearing expensive products - can you tell the difference? 'I like to wear my eye-shadow dark and blending is often quite a challenge with blacks and greys, but with Redemption, it’s completely easy - in terms of faultless blendability, it outshone my Chanel colours. In terms of wear, there was no discernible difference between the two,' she said. As foundation, she wore Estee Lauder Re-Nutriv in picture Two, costing £63. 'It’s my go-to foundation because it contains a hefty whack of anti-ageing ingredients and every little helps!,' she said. 'In picture one I used Makeup Revolution The One Foundation, and of all the Makeup Revolution products that I’ve put to the test, it’s the one I like least. You need to really shake the bottle to get it mixed and it’s rather runny. It gives very sheer coverage and personally, I feel I need a little more. 'However, if you’re blessed with flawless skin and love a natural look, then it’s worth £4 of anyone’s money,' she explained. Value for money? Makeup Revolution, including £4 blushers and £4 foundation, is hoping to match its high-end competitors on quality . For lips, in picture two, she used Dior Lipstick, £26, which she described as 'beautifully creamy' and 'very luxurious', but in picture  one she used Amazing Care Lipstick #happylips from Makeup Revolution. 'There is no difference in feel or depth of colour and other than you may find you have to re-apply Makeup Revolution, £3, a little more often, it’s an easy wear and an incredible bargain,' she said of the product. Jane cites her favourite Makeup Revolution item as the Vivid Cheek Lacquer, £3. She said: 'It’s high in pigment and blends very easily onto the cheeks for a pop of colour. In picture two I’m wearing YSL Babydoll Kiss & Blush, £27, a cheek and lip cream that’s also easy to blend and gives a healthy flush to my cheeks. 'However, I’d say you would be very pushed to tell the difference in performance both on colour pigment and longevity. Cheap as chips: The new range, although mixed when it comes to quality, starts from just £1 at Superdrug . 'If anything, the surprise isn’t that Makeup Revolution is such good value, it’s that the mark up on high-end products is no longer a secret. This experiment has made me really wonder just how much over the odds we’re paying for products that work no better than their cheaper counterparts. 'I’ve been using the Redemption palette for over two weeks now and I’m completely unable to tell the difference between that and the costly shadows I used to love.' With recent research by Debenhams revealing that even if you go for high street names rather than high-end designer brands, the cost of your average basic make-up bag still adds up. They found that the typical . woman’s ‘everyday’ make-up bag in the UK contains 14 items; with mascara, . eye liner and concealer the most prevalent products, and the most . common brand names being Rimmel, Maybeline and Clinique so perhaps Makeup Revolution is on to a winner. Team Femail also gave the products a . whirl. We found The One Foundation to be near impossible to apply due to its . watery consistency and for anyone looking to conceal blemishes and dark . spots, the coverage wouldn't be enough. If . you suffer from any skin conditions or adult acne, we would advise . avoiding the product and instead opt for Giorgio Armani's Luminous Silk Foundation, £35 - duly recommended by Dr Frances Prenna-Jones, who works her magic on Kate Moss and Louise Redknapp. The eyeshadow was better but the accompanying brushes were very poor quality and made applying them challenging. The . nail varnishes, on the other hand, were a firm favourite. Available in a . host of on-trend colours (we love the nude), they were easy to apply, . glided on smoothly and had a good matte texture and some serious staying . power - even without a base and top coat. Lipsticks were as . good as you'd expect for £1 and while they come with a lip gloss, which . essentially feels like you're getting two for the price of one, we prefer MAC cosmetics when it comes to pigment, moisturising benefits and staying . power.

"By . James Rush . Teacher Margareta Dragut has been charged with allegedly forcing young women and girls into prostitution . A Romanian teacher has been charged with allegedly forcing forcing young women and girls into prostitution. Award-winning teacher Margareta Dragut allegedly trafficked young women she sold into prostitution. Prosecutors this week confirmed they were charging her and her boyfriend Claudiu Giorsan Belecciu, the alleged ringleader of a trafficking gang. They say that they have identified a number of suspected victims, but police believe there may be more and confirmed that they were still looking to identify as many of these other victims as possible. They are investigating whether the alleged victims included schoolgirls that she had worked with directly - or whether it was only young girls from other schools. A police spokesman said: 'It is highly likely she used her position in teaching to groom young women for prostitution.' Colleagues of Dragut, 41, who worked at the Mihai Eminescu high-school in the Romanian city of Constanta, were reportedly shocked at her arrest in January. The school principal Camelia Ciurescu said: 'On Friday she came to school as usual, she never missed a lesson and never ever had a professional problem. 'I did not expect her to do that. Although we assume charges are not directly related to her teaching activity, we can not ignore them because they are so serious.' Prosecutors claim she worked with her boyfriend Belecciu, 47, who was also the trafficking gang leader, and that she posted adverts and photos on the internet offering underage schoolgirls who were working in the 'Pink Cats' massage parlour in the city of Constanta, and in other resorts on the Black Sea. Prosecutors also claim members of the group had people helping them in other state institutions, including two police officers, Lucian Borcea and Nicolae Peniu, who had the role of protecting the suspects and escorting prostitutes to their meetings. Colleagues of Dragut, 41, who worked at the Mihai Eminescu high-school in Constanta, were reportedly shocked at her arrest in January . All the male members of the gang are still behind bars in investigative custody, while Dragut has been the only member of the gang released on bail. The identities of Dragut and her boyfriend were exposed following police raids at the massage parlour and the homes of gang members. Prosecutors say the group members began their business recruiting young girls in 2012.","Margareta Dragut accused of forcing young women into prostitution .

"By . Leon Watson . A top Tory official who allegedly spent taxpayers' money on a hotel room used for a sex party has been removed from a list of candidates to become an MP, it emerged today. Iain Corby, who is being investigated by Parliament's expenses watchdog, has been struck off the list of candidates approved by Conservative Central Office. It follows the publication of a series of embarrassing messages the official exchanged with another man on Grindr, a gay dating app. Partying: Details of salacious messages sent by a top Tory official on a gay dating service were revealed last week. The exchanges involved Tory official Iain Corby (pictured, left, with an unidentified man) They refer to ‘cute boys’, ‘orgy’, . ‘gay party’, ‘hottie MPs’ and ‘all in one bed’ said to be ‘on offer’ in a . luxury hotel suite hired for Tory researchers at the party’s annual . conference in Manchester. The messages name two top Tory MPs: one of the most senior Government Ministers and an MP tipped as a future Party leader. It is claimed the exchanges were one of . the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based . Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for  by MPs via . taxpayer-funded expenses. Connected: Mr Corby sent the messages to another man via Grindr. Above, the official's profile . Each Tory MP pays the PRU £4,000 a year for research services. The MPs claim it back from IPSA as an expense. Insiders say there was near panic at 10 Downing Street when the Grindr messages were reported to David Cameron last month. He ordered an urgent investigation, which led to Mr Corby’s departure in an attempt to limit the damage. The ‘sex party’ on MPs’ expenses . at Manchester’s Light ApartHotel, where rooms cost up to £2,500 a night, . was first revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week. The body . responsible for MPs’ expenses and pay, the Independent Parliamentary . Standards Authority (IPSA), is now investigating the hotel 'sex party'. IPSA rules state 'staffing expenditure . may not be claimed for any party political activity.' Nor can MPs claim . expenses for 'attendance at political party conferences'. The Independent reported that Downing . Street and Tory whips were made aware of complaints against Mr Corby . before his resignation and the publication of the Grindr conversations. Aspiring . Tory MPs have to pass a series of tests before they are eligible to put . themselves forward. The final decision on which candidate to select is . down to local party activists.

Revealed: The exchanges involved Tory official Iain Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses . Scene: The comments refer to a luxury hotel suite at Manchester's Light ApartHotel (pictured), where rooms cost up to £2,500 a night. It was hired for Tory researchers at the party's annual conference in Manchester . Iain Corby testified at the trial of Nigel Evans, the former Deputy Speaker, after being one of several senior Tory Conservative Party figures who were approached in 2009 by a young Tory researcher. The researcher claimed the former Deputy Speaker acted improperly however, Mr Evans was cleared of all charges last week. Despite this, the trial exposed a culture of excessive drinking between some MPs and young maleresearchers in Parliamentary bars. Former Deputy Speaker: Nigel Evans said innocent people who are 'dragged through the courts' should not face 'financial ruin' after he was cleared of a string of sex assaults . Mr . Corby told the court in his evidence last month that he spoke to the . researcher in a meeting following an incident involving Mr Evans when . they had been staying together.

He said: ‘I think the question was “do you really want Nigel’s career to end because of this” and I think very quickly (the alleged victim) backtracked from that.’ Mr Corby said he got the impression that the complainant was ‘happy’ once he was assured Evans would be asked to apologise and warned about his drinking. Mr Corby also said he been encouraging Mr Evans to come out as gay before he did, adding: ‘What I did think is that Nigel would be a lot happier coming out of the closet.’ Mr Corby, head of the Policy Research Unit which works for Tory MPs, stood down from his roleearlier this month.","Iain Corby struck off the list approved by Conservative Central Office .

"By . Daniel Martin . Proved wrong: Ed Miliband's entire election strategy hinges on the cost of living, which is now affordable, figures show . Ed Miliband faces a fresh crisis as his ‘cost of living card’ evaporates ahead of the election. Figures out later this week are expected to show that pay rises are now outstripping inflation for the first time in six years. This means Labour’s entire election strategy – to blame the Coalition for presiding over a ‘cost of living crisis’ – will effectively become redundant. At the weekend Chancellor George Osborne used a speech in the US to crow that Labour were ‘wrong about the past and they are wrong about the future’. And Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg used his monthly Press conference to lambast Labour for having created the squeeze on living standards  in the first place by ‘crashing’ the economy. Mr Miliband faced further criticism yesterday from Alan Milburn, a former Labour health secretary, who called on the party to court business if it has any hope of winning the election. Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Milburn said Labour needed to ‘embrace an avowedly pro-business agenda and match it with a more pro-business tone’. Economic figures are expected to show that inflation has fallen from 1.7 per cent in February to 1.5 per cent in March; while growth in weekly earnings has risen from 1.4 per cent to 1.8 per cent. If it is confirmed that wages are rising faster than the cost of living, this will mean Britons will feel like they have more money in their pockets – and will be less likely to listen to Labour’s warnings. Mr Clegg said Labour had been proved wrong time and time again since the last election, and will have nothing left to say at the election if their ‘cost of living crisis’ line is proved wrong. ‘First they said making cuts and saving was not necessary – a remarkable thing to say when you had the largest peacetime deficit in this country ever and the largest structural deficit anywhere in the developed world,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘Then they said that by imposing savings, that was going to stop growth. Then they said that a million more people were going to be unemployed – every single one of those allegations by the Labour Party has fallen by the wayside and has proved to  be wrong. It comes as Osborne told a US audience Labour was 'wrong about the past and is wrong about the future' ‘And if this latest suggestion from the Labour Party that somehow living standards  will somehow never improve again also proves to be wrong, what on earth does the  Labour Party have to say on the most central issue of the day – namely how we manage our economy, come May of next year.’ Mr Clegg said the reason why there had been a squeeze in living standards was  that Britain had ‘suffered the largest cardiac arrest in  our economy’ since the 1973 oil crisis. ‘I find it remarkable that in addition to denying any responsibility for the crash in the first place, they are denying any kind of maturity in accepting that you need to take difficult decisions to clean up the mess that was created by the Labour Party in the first place,’ he said. ‘The Labour Party have then gone on to somehow claim that the pressure on people’s living expenses had got nothing to do with them either. ‘I just think this consistent abdication of responsibility; this persistent refusal to apologise for having crashed the economy in the first place … shows a real paucity of credibility on the economy. ‘As people’s living standards improve and the pressure on living standards is eased, I wonder what is left for Labour.’","Pay rises now outstripping inflation for first time in 6 years, figures show .

Moyes, who faces former club Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday, is in the throes of planning a £150million overhaul of his underperforming squad for the summer and is looking for players to stake a claim to remain part of his plans. In a rare piece of good news for Moyes, it emerged that Robin van Persie has stepped up his fitness routine as he continues his recovery from a knee injury. The United striker released a Facebook video that shows him lifting weights and running while training alone in the gym. Van Persie begins by performing half-a-dozen squats while resting a barbell on his shoulders, then runs at high speed while bouncing on a trampoline and then sprints to the far side of the hall. It raises the possibility Van Persie could return to action for United before the end of the season and also hands a major boost to Holland ahead of the World Cup in Brazil. Taxi!

Megan, mother to Jake, ten, Jodie-Leigh, nine and Sophia-Rose, two, battled with depression after the birth of Sophia-Rose, just as Jessica was facing the same problems after having her son Mason, also two. But support worker Megan, also studying psychology at university, said somehow the rabbits helped the pair through their darkest times.

'We want to give families and children as much joy through owning them as we get,' says Jessica. 'These rabbits have helped bring us together and pull each other through it.' Jessica . and Megan breed a new litter of rabbits each month and sell them to . families all over the country after rearing them from birth.

"By . Ralph Ellis . Follow @@ralphellis56 . Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football. This week, Luis Suarez seems to be feeling the pressure of being Liverpool's focal point as they try to get over the line, why Chelsea will miss Nemanja Matic in their quest for Champions League glory and Andros Townsend might be sweating on his World Cup place... 1. Is the pressure of trying to take Liverpool across the line to a Premier League title starting to affect Luis Suarez? The . Uruguayan has been on pretty much perfect behaviour all season with . only four yellow cards all season before Sunday, compared with 11 last . year as well as his controversial clash with Branislav Ivanovic. On . Sunday he took less than five minutes to get booked for a bad foul, and . was fortunate not to get a second yellow for taking a tumble in search . of a second half penalty. Proceed with caution: Luis Suarez is shown the yellow card by Mark Clattenburg on Sunday . Taking a tumble: Suarez goes down a little easily under the challenge of Vincent Kompany . Frustration: Suarez has a moan as Martin Demichelis stands over him . 2. If there is one player Chelsea will miss in their bid to land another Champions League it is midfielder Nemanja Matic. The . Serb, cup tied in Europe but a key part of the Premier . League side since he returned to the club from Benfica for £21million in . January, created Demba Ba’s winner at Swansea. It . was the fourth goal he’s made, but it is his defensive midfield work . that has been key for Jose Mourinho.  In 13 games he’s now made 43 . tackles, 48 clearances and 28 interceptions. The shield: Chelsea will miss Nemanja Matic (right) in the Champions League, especially his defensive work . 3. Andros Townsend was being hailed as . English football’s big new hope after he helped clinch World Cup . qualification on his debut back in October but is now sweating on . whether he’s even in the squad. Recovered . now from the hamstring injury which kept him out of the opening matches . in Tim Sherwood’s time as Spurs boss, he hasn’t been able to force his . way back in the team. While . fellow winger Aaron Lennon played a part in all three of Tottenham’s . goals, Townsend was a sub for just the final five minutes at West Brom, . and has only once played 90 minutes in the last 14 games when he has . been fit. Peripheral figure: Andros Townsend (right), played just five minutes as substitute for Spurs on Saturday . 4. Felix Magath started work at Fulham after the transfer deadline, so the only player he was able to sign was Mahamadou Diarra, who was out of work and trying to prove he’d beaten a persistent knee injury. The former Real Madrid midfielder, released from Craven Cottage last summer because of his fitness issues, has proved an inspired choice. Saturday’s win over Norwich made it two wins in two appearances for the 32-year-old whose work has given far more protection to Fulham’s fragile defence. Inspired: Mahamadou Diarra (right) has returned to Fulham and the club have won both times he's played . 5. As if Sunderland didn’t have enough . problems after five defeats in a row, they will have to do without . defender Phil Bardsley for two of their last six games. The . 28-year-old, branded 'the most unprofessional player I have ever worked . with' by previous boss Paolo Di Canio, only had to negotiate one more . game without a booking to reach the deadline to escape a ban under the . FA’s totting up process. Instead . he picked up his 10th yellow card in 33 matches for a clumsy foul on . Steven Naismith early in the second half of the 1-0 defeat by Everton. Banned: Phil Bardsley (right) is suspended for two matches after picking up his 10th booking of the season . 6. Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski did his chances of finding a new club no harm with his penalty shoot-out heroics in the FA Cup semi-final win over Wigan. The 28-year-old, a free agent this summer after turning down a new deal at the Emirates because he wants regular first-team football, has not played a single Premier League game this season. But in his cup appearances – which also included a penalties win at West Brom in the Capital One Cup – he’s let in just seven goals in nine matches. Saving his career? Lukasz Fabianski's FA Cup penalty heroics might just help him find a new club . 7. Noel Hunt has been a target for angry Leeds fans after a miserable season since his free transfer move from Reading – a midweek fanzine pointed out his record in 15 matches was no goals, no assists and just 10 shots. The Republic of Ireland striker is still searching for his first goal but he does at least now have an assist to his name. After coming on as sub it was his clever flick that opened up Blackpool’s back line to enable Luke Murphy to score the second of his goals in a 2-0 win. Assist: Noel Hunt (back) celebrates with Luke Murphy after setting him up for Leeds' second goal . 8. With former Spurs and Reading midfielder Darren Caskey as his dad, and ex-Brentford and Reading stiker Nicky Forster now his step-dad, Brighton’s youngster Jake Forster-Caskey shouldn’t struggle for career guidance. It’s not clear which of them – or whether it was both – advised him to turn down both Arsenal and Aston Villa as a youngster in the hope of getting more games if he signed for Brighton. Either way it looks a good decision.  The England youth midfielder, who will be 20 later this month, has now played 31 games this season and got his third goal in the 3-0 win over Charlton that lifted the Seagulls into the Championship play-off zone. Wise move: Jake Forster-Caskey turned down Arsenal and Aston Villa and is reaping the benefit at Brighton . 9. David Marshall earned the Match of the Day plaudits for his saves that helped Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to a much needed win at Southampton, but there’s another Cardiff goalkeeper building a reputation behind him. Simon Moore, 23, who moved to Wales from Brentford last summer, has helped Steve Cotterill work miracles at Bristol City since going there on loan. When Moore arrived at Ashton Gate at the end of January, City were second from bottom and three points adrift of safety.  They have lost only two of seven games Moore has played since – and Saturday’s 1-0 win at Walsall lifted them to 13th place and the chance of a top half finish. Safe hands: Simon Moore has been in excellent form on loan at Bristol City from Cardiff . 10. Barnet went down from League Two with 51 points last season, and it is beginning to look as if it will need another record haul to achieve survival this term.The 46 points which Northampton have after a 1-0 win over Burton would have been enough to ensure survival in all but two of the 10 previous years.All the result did this time, however, was to set up Friday’s trip to Wycombe, above the 23rd-placed Cobblers on goal difference only, as a huge Easter encounter.","Luis Suarez fortunate not to be sent off in Liverpool's win on Sunday .

"By . Bianca London . Is your habit giving you wrinkles?  The repetitive pursing of the lips can cause permanent creases and lines, and toxins found within cigarettes can weaken the muscles around the mouth, leading to an increase in women seeking non-surgical treatment . Yellow teeth, bad breath and lung disease are just some of the unwanted side effects of smoking but now female smokers are seeking surgery to help ease mouth wrinkles caused by the habit too. With recent research revealing that a higher percentage of women are choosing to quit the habit altogether, one company has seen a surge in women seeking treatments to tackle what has been dubbed as the 'Pack a Day Pout' in a bid to rectify years of damage. CACI, a company who provide non-surgical solutions, claims to have seen a 78 per cent increase in women looking for non-surgical treatments to help ease the lines that have appeared due to smoking. Dean Nathanson, MD of CACI . International, explains: 'The lines are due to the repetitive . pursing of the lips and can cause permanent creases, and toxins . found within cigarettes can weaken the muscles around the mouth - this . encourages grooves to appear on the epidermis which can be really . difficult to remove.' In . response to this increasing demand, CACI has launched the £25 Ultimate Lip . Plump - a 20 minute non-surgical treatment that claims to work by utilising a . combination of resurfacing techniques and patented 'wrinkle comb' technology. This, combined with high frequency . electrical stimulation and photo skin rejuvenation, claims to serve as . a non-invasive alternative to dermal fillers. The Pack A Day Pout is no new phenomenon and the cosmetic industry has been cashing in on the side effects of smoking for a while. Speaking about the effects on the lips and possible treatments, Dr Mark Holmes from McIndoe Surgical Centre said: 'Smoking increases lines by reducing blood flow to the area, direct damage from the heat of the cigarette and repetitive pursing of the lips. Before and after: CACI has launched the Ultimate Lip Plump - a 20 minute non-surgical  treatment that claims to work by utilising a combination of skin resurfacing and patented wrinkle comb technology to beat the 'bar code' lines above the lips . 'I use volbella. A soft dermal filler by Juvederm to break up these lines - what I refer to as ""bar codes"". Results last up to 12 months.' Mr Brent Tanner, Consultant plastic surgeon who works out of the Spire Tunbridge Wells Hospital, Nuffield Health Brighton Hospital and Montefiore, Hove, added: 'The orbicularis oris muscle is a circular muscle around the mouth. When you smoke, suck, etc, it goes into activity. Beat the lines: CACI's treatment uses high frequency electrical stimulation and photo skin rejuvenation, which claims to act as a non-invasive alternative to dermal fillers . 'For people that smoke, this process is continually happening and so the skin above the muscle wrinkles, because all the little fibrous bands between the muscle and the skin are moving and the skin’s thickness, is thinned. 'Therefore, over the years, these wrinkles become very deep. If a person were to stop smoking these wrinkles would not get any worse and theoretically they might improve because the collagen in the skin can reform, however they are unlikely to completely go.' Dr Vincent Wong added: . 'Smoker's lines are very difficult to get rid of (especially when . they are deep) and usually require multiple sessions and a combination . of various treatments e.g. microneedling, Botox  injections and . strategic placement of dermal fillers.' 'Treatments for this area include Botox into the actual lip area to stop them moving - however the problem is that this could potentially cause a lop-sided smile,' said Mr Brent Tanner. 'Fillers can be injected into the wrinkles and if done appropriately they can work as they thicken the skin. 'Another option is deep peels, such as a CO2 laser and phenol peels. They ""burn"" the skin down to the level of the wrinkle and it then re-heals and regenerates more smoothly. 'However, this is quite an aggressive treatment and you have to be very careful to stay out of the sun until it has completely healed.' Dr Raina Zarb Adami said:1. The ageing process: as we age, loss of fat under the skin occurs. This usually acts as a strut and support to the overlying skin. The middle layer of skin (the dermis), due to cessation of production of collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid, and the epidermis thins.  These depletions result in a thinner skin on the upper lip which therefore wrinkles. Also, with age, the cutaneous (white) upper lip lengthens and the red (vermilion) lip shortens and inverts into the mouth, appearing thinner. 2. Repeated action of the muscle around the mouth (there is a muscle surrounding the mouth opening lying immediately under the skin of the red and white lips, called orbicular is oris) cuses these wrinkles to appear more (same as the wrinkles that appear not he forehead in people who frown a lot).  Skin wrinkles always occur in a direction perpendicular to the underlying muscle fibres. 3. Smoking accelerates the ageing process due to direct deleterious affect on elastin and collagen and on the enzymes which break down these building blocks (matrix metalloproteinases) Foundations with wrinkle-busting properties may have taken the beauty world by storm last year but this summer is all about lip glosses with anti-ageing benefits and the beauty maestros at NARS have the first offering. With a new formulation, NARS Lip Glosses claims to contain nourishing ingredients that hydrate and smooth fine lines leaving lips soft and supple. The addition of Sea Lavender claims to help protect against signs of ageing. Scientific results have proven that Sea Lavender Peptides, which are rich in the potent antioxidant polyphenol, significantly limit the stress on the skin caused by harmful UVA rays and radiation.

"By . Deni Kirkova . and Scarlett Russell . Britons will not tolerate queues in stores as a new report reveals most would pay to use a self-service check out. Many of the 54 per cent who said they would pay for the privilege claimed they are used to the instant automated service offered online. New research into British shopping habits also found people want a hands-off experience, using technology to guide them, as 70 per cent of people use their mobile phone to aid their trip. Express delivery: In a new survey, British shoppers say they much prefer to use self-service checkouts because they are quicker and there are fewer cues . And when shoppers do want to speak to sales assistants, they expect more expert knowledge than they can find out online, finds the How We Shop Now report by Westfield. The financial costs to . retailers who exhibit poor service to shoppers with a zero-tolerance attitude - . of whom there are many - is a staggering £5.4bn. Savvy shoppers are also looking to technology for guidance and inspiration - 57 per cent are tempted by interactive digital displays. Two thirds say they’d be interested in virtual mirrors, which allow customers to try on clothes in front of a mirror see how something looks on without ever entering a fitting room. Retail guru Mary Portas says: 'In a world where the shopper truly is king, every retailer must maximise every touch point. 'People will vote with their feet, they expect a great experience. Ultimately, we will always ask ""did I come in and get what I wanted?""' Similarly, the report found our expectations of the shopping environment and the service we receive play a significant role in how we are shopping, which could be worth £5 billion a year in lost sales due to bad service. Purse friendly: Alex Gerrard is often spotted out and about in London and Liverpool shopping. The financial costs to retailers who exhibit poor service to shoppers is a staggering £5.4bn . Technology is making us crave efficiency and demand improved shopping spaces. Shoppers want inspiration and originality; they demand the whole package - from high-end brands to entertainment venues - all within one location. As Britons become accustomed to the simplicity of online transactions, we become less tolerant of poor service. Today, two-thirds of shoppers would never use a store if it provided bad service. And the self-assured 35-44 group are the least tolerant in this respect. As a result, retailers who fail to deliver excellent service are missing out on more than £5.4 billion of sales. In fact, more than half would storm out if we had to wait too long for a changing room or had to queue too long to pay when tills are unmanned. A similar number refuse to put up with a messy store. And don't hassle them, as 41 per cent will flee if frequently accosted by staff members asking if they need help. Increasingly, shoppers also want the entire shop to be faceless, not just the till point. They are less interested in staff assistance, with more than half preferring to be left alone unless they specifically ask for guidance. Even luxury shoppers, who value butler service, prefer non-intrusive staff. When buying luxury goods, if visiting more expensive stores, three-quarters of us suddenly expect exceptional treatment, especially working mothers. Professionalism is essential as three quarters of luxury shoppers (those who regularly visit high-end stores) demand it. Luxury shoppers are also more likely to want retailers to offer up alternative options if an item is out of stock and to provide an adjustment service. Similarly, almost half expect paid for express delivery to be offered. In terms of technology, almost twice as many luxury store lovers think having a free wi-fi service is important compared with standard store shoppers. A nationwide . programme of research was carried out across 8,000 UK shoppers between . June 2013 and January 2014 by Westfield. It reveals not only How We Shop Now but . how the future of shopping is changing.","Some 70 per cent of Brits use their mobile phone to aid their trip .

"By . Sara Malm . A British schoolgirl is battling one of the world’s rarest diseases which attack every organ in her body on a daily basis. Millie Hough, aged seven, suffers from Alstrom syndrome, a genetic disorder which has seen her become close to blind-deaf and suffer from kidney failure and dilated cardiomyopathy  as well as a series of other debilitating illnesses. Alstrom is so rare that Millie, from St Agnes, Cornwall, is just one of 60 sufferers in the UK, and one of 266 cases worldwide. The odds of inheriting the disease are just over a million to one. Brave: Millie Hough, seven, from St Agnes, Cornwall,  has genetic disorder Alstrom syndrome, an illness which causes multi-organ dysfunction . Although Millie still attends school four days a week, and loves practicing swimming and judo, her parents know that she will inevitable need an organ transplant in the future. Her mother Michelle said her and her businessman husband Ben first noticed symptoms when Millie developed a strange sensitivity to light. After numerous several doctors’ appointments the couple were given the grave news she was suffering from Alstrom syndrome. The . disorder is inherited which means both Michelle and Ben will have . carried the faulty genes without being affected themselves. Alström Syndrome is a very rare recessively inherited genetic disorder. Both parents have to carry the gene mutation for the child to be affected and the disease can make itself known in the first weeks of a child's life. In nearly all cases, children suffer progressive loss of sight and hearing, obesity and insulin resistance, photophobia and nystagmus. It is also common to suffer from liver and kidney failure, type 2 diabetes, cardiomyopathy and bladder and bowl problems. Ms Hough, 41, who is now her daughter’s full-time carer and a volunteer for the national charity Alstrom Syndrome UK, said the diagnosis was ‘devastating.’ She said: ‘Alstrom syndrome affects . all the organs in the body. It was such a shock to be told and when I . read the signs and prognosis it was just horrific. ‘The chances of getting it are a million to one and only 60 people have been officially diagnosed with it in the UK. ‘I . remember thinking, ‘wouldn’t it be horrific if she lost her sight’ but . now it’s the life-threatening problems like heart failure which are . scary.’ First described by Carl-Henry Alström . in Sweden in 1959, Alstrom syndrome is a result of 79 possible mutations . in the gene ALMS1. Tragedy: Millie, pictured with her mother Michelle and family friend Rik Bennett who is running the London Marathon to raise money for Millie, is almost blind, nearly deaf and has severe kidney problems . The . earliest symptoms include childhood obesity, blindness due to congenital . retinal dystrophy, hearing loss and photophobia (sensitivity to light). Sufferers . often develop early-onset type 2 diabetes, renal and hepatic . dysfunction affecting the liver and kidneys, bladder and bowel problems, . and cardiomyopathy, where the heart is weakened and enlarged. Future prospects: As her condition worsens, Millies family knows she may need a heart transplant as well as other organs . It’s likely that Millie will eventually need a heart transplant to survive and will have a reduced life expectancy. Michelle said: ‘Heart failure is a massive worry and when she needs the transplant. 'Will there be one there and will anyone be kind enough to donate their loved one’s organs? ‘I just hope that medical advances will improve and her chances of surviving will be better. ‘She is just the most loving little girl and she will give anything a go. 'She knows what’s wrong and we don’t hide it from her. ‘We try and do everything that you would do with a normal child. ‘Her life may not be as long as we were expecting or would want it to be, and we just don’t know what her life expectancy will be, but we appreciate every minute with her and she has taught us to live like that. ‘She just brings so much to my life. She is wonderful and if I had the choice not to have her at all or to have her with Alstrom syndrome I would have chosen her every time.’ Alstrom syndrome UK is run by volunteers like Michelle and every donation goes to researching the rare disorder.

"By . Sara Malm . Elderly people who show signs of dementia, but do not yet have Alzheimer's, have a 30 per cent lower risk of dying from cancer, a study has found. Although scientists cannot explain how, it appears OAPs with memory and thinking problems are less likely to develop cancer. The Spanish study put over-65s through thinking skills and memory tests and followed the participants for an average of 13 years. Lower risk: A Spanish study found that over 65s showing signs of dementia, but not yet diagnosed with Alzheimer's are 30 per cent less likely to die of cancer . It found that the group which had a fast decline in performance in the tests were 30 per cent less likely to die of cancer. ‘Studies have shown that people with Alzheimer's disease are less likely to develop cancer, but we don't know the reason for that link,’ said study author Dr Julián Benito-León of University Hospital 12 de Octubre Madrid, Spain. ‘One possibility is that cancer is underdiagnosed in people with dementia, possibly because they are less likely to mention their symptoms or caregivers and doctors are focused on the problems caused by dementia. The current study helps us discount that theory.’ The study involved people age 65 and older who did not have dementia at the start of the study. They took tests of memory and thinking skills at the start of the study and again three years later, and were followed for an average of almost 13 years. The participants were divided into three . groups: those whose scores on the thinking tests were declining the . fastest, those whose scores improved on the tests, and those in the . middle. No links: Although it appears over 65s with memory and thinking problems are less likely to develop cancer than those who do not, scientists could not answer why . During the study, 1,003 of the participants died - and 34 per cent were in the fast decline group. A total of 21 percent of those in the group with the fastest decline died of cancer, according to their death certificates, compared to 29 percent of those in the other two groups. People in the fastest declining group were still 30 percent less likely to die of cancer when the results were adjusted to control for factors such as smoking, diabetes and heart disease, among others. ‘We need to understand better the relationship between a disease that causes abnormal cell death and one that causes abnormal cell growth,’ Dr Benito-León said. ‘With the increasing number of people with both dementia and cancer, understanding this association could help us better understand and treat both diseases.’ The study was published in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.","Spanish study tested over-65s on their memory skills over 13 years .

"By . Sara Malm . A boy was diagnosed with leukaemia during a visit to his optician after four doctors missed the symptoms in the space of two weeks. James Morley, 13, was repeatedly taken to doctors at the beginning of 2012 after his parents became worried he was uncharacteristically breathless, lethargic and suffering temperature spikes. Doctors kept telling his mother Pamela there was nothing wrong with him, and one even carried out tests. Blink of an eye: James Morley, 13, was turned away from doctors four times before his optician found a bleeding in his eye and prompted tests for leukaemia . It was not until James complained that he was seeing everything with a pink tint that Mrs Morley, 47, booked an appointment with an optician in her home town of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. Optometrist Sunny Boyal found that James had a large haemorrhage and oedema (a build-up of fluid) on his left eye. Mrs Morley said: ‘As soon as I told the optician what James' symptoms were they said I must bring him down straight away.’ She told how the optometrist immediately referred James to King's Mill Hospital, in Mansfield, where the consultant confirmed the bleed and sent the young boy onto a paediatric ward. Diagnosis: The circled areas who the areas of the eye that caused concern when James saw the optician . There he was told he was suffering from a form of leukaemia and would need to be admitted to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Mrs Morley said: ‘As soon as that doctor said something was not right I was singing hallelujah - I knew all along that something wasn't right and it had been so stressful to be told over and over that he was fine. ‘As a mother you instinctively know when your child has something seriously wrong with them. ‘All his life James had been so hyperactive; he was bouncing off the walls most of the time so we were worried about him when he suddenly changed and was out of breath, tired and getting temperature spikes.’ ‘I wasn't prepared to just accept the . doctors' word that James was fine. And it's lucky that I did keep . pushing for an answer - because the earlier you find the cancer the . better the chance of survival,’ Mrs Morley added. James . underwent a number of tests at the Queen's Medical Centre and was . eventually diagnosed with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic . leukaemia - a rare illness in children. Cancer: James' parents watched their son go from 'bouncing off the walls' to becoming lethargic and breathless and were rightly convinced something was wrong . Mrs Morley said: ‘When James got his diagnosis it was a huge shock for the family, but thanks to Sunny we were able to catch the leukaemia in the early stages so were stayed positive.’ As part of James' two-year treatment, which included normal chemotherapy, he became the first child in the UK to trial the drug Dasatinib - which only became available for trial on children immediately after diagnosis. Even though James was the first child . in the country to take the drug, his parents didn't spend much time . worrying about the drug - instead focusing on the improved survival rate . from 55 per cent to 85 per cent. Mrs . Morley said: ‘Not much was known about the drug at the time, but we . were advised that it would improve James' chance of survival so didn't . think twice about it.’ Emma Astwood is the paediatric haematology consultant at Nottingham Children's Hospital. She said: ‘Acute lymphoblastic . leukaemia is the most common type of leukaemia, but Philadelphia . positive only accounts for three to five per cent of child cases. ‘It means the leukaemia is more difficult to treat than normal.’ happy ending: James, pictured at Queens Hospital Notting during his treatment, is now in remission . But after successful treatment James’ mother, his father Martyn and younger sister Adele, seven can look positively to the future. ‘Things are going well and he is classed as in remission now. He could relapse but we are carrying on with his treatment. It will be five years before he can be classed as in full remission. ‘Our experience really has opened my eyes to how important it is to make sure your children see an optician regularly - I didn't realise the kinds of conditions that they can pick up. ‘It's not an exaggeration to say that Sunny saved my sons life. ‘Sunny is definitely on a pedestal - he's a proper hero.’ James and his family have been supported by the charity when You Wish Upon a Star, which aims to grant the wishes and special VIP treats to children suffering from life threatening illnesses.","James Morley, 13, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2012 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Swiss surgeons have successfully rebuilt the noses of five skin cancer patients using their own tissue. The team rebuilt patients’ nostrils using a revolutionary technique in which cells were taken from their nasal septum. One year later, all recipients were satisfied with their ability to breathe as well as the cosmetic appearance, and did not report any side effects. Growing noses: The Swiss team grew white, glossy cartilage in the laboratory after taking cells from the patients' nasal septum, and were able to build new nostrils for five skin cancer patients . The nose is the most common place for skin cancers other than melanoma, because of its exposure to sunlight. Surgeons are often forced to cut away parts of cartilage from the nasal septum, ear or rib as grafts to functionally reconstruct the area from where the tumour has been removed. But this painful and invasive procedure involves major additional surgery, and has been associated with complications at the site from which cartilage has been removed. The Swiss researchers attempted an alternative method by extracting the cartilage cells, called chondrocytes, from the nasal septum of each patient. Success: None of the five patients suffered any side effects from their new noses one year later (stock image) After multiplying the cells using growth factors for two weeks, they were seeded onto collagen membranes that act as a framework or scaffold for new tissue and cultured in the lab for a further fortnight. This generated cartilage 40 times larger than the original biopsy. When the engineered grafts were ready they were shaped according to the defect and implanted, reports The Lancet. Professor Ivan Martin, from the University of Basel in Switzerland, said: ‘The engineered cartilage had clinical results comparable to the current standard surgery. 'This new technique could help the . body to accept the new tissue better and to improve the stability and . functionality of the nostril. 'Our . success is based on the long-standing, effective integration in Basel . between our experimental group at the Department of Biomedicine and the . surgical disciplines at the University Hospital.’ He . said the breakthrough opens the way to using engineered cartilage for . more challenging reconstructions in facial surgery such as the complete . nose, eyelid or ear. The same engineered grafts are currently being tested in a parallel study for articular cartilage repair in the knee. However, . Prof Martin added: ‘Despite this optimism, the use of these procedures . in the routine clinical practice is still rather distant, as it requires . rigorous assessment of efficacy on larger cohorts of patients, and the . development of business models and manufacturing paradigms that will . guarantee cost effectiveness.’","Swiss surgeons successfully rebuild five skin cancer victim's noses .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A seven-year-old who suffered from blisters so painful they stopped her eating and blinking, has found out she is allergic to a long list of household products, including soap and shampoo. Niamh McGroarty would erupt in rashes and blisters on her body, some so severe they would prevent her from opening her mouth, and for years the family had no clue as to what caused it. Niamh and her mother Sheila Armstrong, 29, from Birmingham, West Midlands, now know the little girl is allergic to a common preservative, known as MI. Reactions: Niamh McGroarty, pictured with her mother Sheila Armstrong, is allergic to preservative Methylisothiazolinone (MI), which can be found in household products such as shampoo, paint and glue . Niamh has suffered prolonged flare ups since the age of four, but it has only been the past few months that the family have realised the cause of her allergic reactions. Niamh now must avoid a huge list of everyday and household products such as soap, shampoo, sun cream, baby wipes, glue and paint. Ms Armstrong said: ‘Niamh has had severe reactions regularly since the age of four, which can last up to a month. There is no cure. ‘She is in a lot of pain and has gone days without eating because her mouth has been so cracked and sore. ‘For years we didn’t know what was causing Niamh’s flare ups and she was suffering more and more. The doctors thought it was impetigo, but the cream they gave her just made the reaction worse.’ She adds: ‘It is a nightmare because this cheap preservative is in virtually everything. ‘There is no treatment to stop it- we just have to keep checking everything she comes into contact with. Allergy: Niamh, seven, would get blisters and severe rashes all over her body, particularly on her face . ‘I have to make sure Niamh takes her own sheets if she goes to stay at a friend’s house and she knows not to use any soaps or even towels in other people’s houses. Sheila believes baby wipes were the original cause of Niamh’s allergy and from then on she has flared up after contact with any other products, sometimes even resulting in overnight stays in hospitals. Sheila said: ‘We are just so relieved to now know what is causing her reactions. As a mother it breaks my heart to see her suffer, especially when she began being bullied because of the rash on her face. Niamh’s allergy is so bad she can even have a flare up weeks after contact with a product. She said: ‘It breaks my heart to see Niamh suffer but she has come to terms with it now. ‘I just want to know why our children’s heath is being risked at the expense of saving money.’ Silver lining: After years of allergic reactions, the family finally knows what is causing Niamh's flareups and can avoid the preservative . Niamh has now learnt how the say the full name of the preservative, Methylisothiazolinone, so she can let others know about her allergy. Niamh said: ‘I have to make sure I check everything I use now. Even the paints and glue at school can cause my face to flare up. ‘I just have to be careful now.’ Sheila and husband John, 40 are now worried about paint they used to decorate their house with, months before they knew the cause of Niamh’s allergy. Sheila said: ‘We have just painted our house but now I have found out MI is in wall paint as well, so I am worried the paint will spark a reaction in Niamh. ‘There are no ingredients on the back of the tin, so I am desperate to find out whether it contains MI. ‘It’s not something we can just brush under the carpet- life will be harder for Niamh, but she is brave and has comes to terms with it, and is learning how to manage her allergy every day.’","Niamh McGroarty is allergic to preservative Methylisothiazolinone (MI)
