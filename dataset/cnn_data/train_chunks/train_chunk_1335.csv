"Leeds defender Giuseppe Bellusci has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for alleged racist comments directed towards Norwich striker Cameron Jerome. The incident occurred in the Sky Bet Championship match between the two sides at Carrow Road on Tuesday October 21, which finished 1-1, when Jerome complained to referee Mark Clattenburg that he was verbally abused by the 25-year-old Italian midway through the first half following a confrontation between the two players. Clattenburg stopped the game and had words with both dugouts following the exchange. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome complained to referee Mark Clattenburg during the match . Jerome and Giuseppe Bellusci, who maintains his innocence, clashed during the Championship encounter . The FA confirmed they were investigating Jerome's allegations and, in a statement, alleged that Bellusci's comments 'included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race.' The statement read: 'Leeds United player Giuseppe Bellusci has been charged with misconduct for a breach of FA Rule E3 which is alleged to have occurred during the fixture between Norwich City and Leeds United on October 21 2014. 'It is alleged Bellusci used abusive and/or insulting words towards Cameron Jerome, of Norwich City FC, contrary to Rule E3(1). 'It is further alleged that this breach of Rule E3(1) is an 'Aggravated Breach' as defined in Rule E3(2), as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race.'

Bellusci has been accused of aiming racist language towards Norwich striker Jerome (left) Leeds owner Massimo Cellino defended Bellusci in the aftermath of the incident, but suggested he could even be shown the door should he be found guilty. 'Bellusci is no racist,' he told the Yorkshire Evening Post. 'I spoke with him and he said 'you must be joking, I said nothing like this to him (Jerome).' He is surprised by this. He is shocked. 'I don't allow racists at this club and I won't allow racists at this club ever. If one of my players is a racist, I'll kick his a**e and kick him out before the FA has a chance. 'Bellusci says he spoke (to Jerome) in Italian. I don't know if he (Jerome) speaks Italian too but Bellusci swears to me he said nothing racist. 'He was p****d off, sure, because he got hit in the neck and the face but he denies anything racist. I believe him and and I'll support him. 'I'll write to them to clarify my position on Bellusci and racism. If any Leeds player was shown to be a racist, he'd be out. That's my philosophy and my promise.' Leeds reacted by releasing a statement confirming Bellusci would be contesting the charge. The statement on the Leeds' official website said: 'The player has consistently made it clear to the club that he did not use racist language. 'The club understands that there is no third party evidence supporting Mr Jerome's allegation. Accordingly, the player will be contesting the charge.'

"As if travelling at Christmas wasn’t stressful enough. Ryanair has now unveiled a festive version of its notoriously annoying on-time jingle. Passengers travelling on the budget airline over Christmas will be treated to a blast of trumpets accompanied by a New Year message when their planes arrive on schedule. It has been created to replace the current bugle blast played over the aircraft’s tannoy system when the flights arrive on time. The airline expect to carry 3.5million passengers over the Christmas period. The music is accompanied a message that says: ‘Happy Christmas from all of us at Ryanair. ‘We wish you and your family a healthy and prosperous New Year. See you on board in 2015.’ The new landing music has been unveiled in a festive video made by the airline’s staff. The video was shot at Ryanair’s Dublin HQ and features employees from the company dancing to the music. On time: Ryanair plays the First Call bugle blast every time one of its flights arrives on schedule . There is even a cameo role from Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O’Leary, who jokingly despairs at the music. Passengers thought they would soon be hearing the end of the jingle after the airline announced it was scrapping the bugle blast following an online survey. It was in May this year that the flier gave in to people power after holding a vote via Twitter over whether or not to keep the annoying refrain, whose official name is First Call and is used in the army. Customers overwhelmingly voted to ditch the tune, a taped version of which is played over the speakers each time a flight lands on time. Over the years, customers of the Dublin-based carrier have regularly complained labelling the end of flight bugle call as 'annoying' or 'cheesy'. Huge criticism: Ryanair asked on Twitter whether it should stop playing the noise on flights that land on time . Ryanair said it would drop the bugle following the Twitter vote, but have now announced they will replace it with another tune next year. The move to drop the bugle comes as part of a massive charm offensive to change the airline's famously belligerent attitude to criticism. It has also followed some of its budget rivals by allowed allocated seating, fewer restrictions on luggage and an improved website for bookings. Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement: 'We asked our followers on Twitter to vote on whether we should change it. 'The people have spoken and after hundreds of votes, they've voted for change, so we're looking forward to unveiling our next customer improvement soon.'","Passengers will be treated to a blast of trumpets and a New Year message .

"Despite a lack of consistency and cutting edge, Brendan Rodgers still believes his 10th-placed Liverpool team can challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League this season. Unfortunately for Rodgers, the history books firmly suggest otherwise with no team since the Premier League's inception finishing higher than sixth after being 10th at Christmas. A third decent performance in a week saw Martin Skrtel salvage a point with a header in the seventh minute of added time as they drew 2-2 with Arsenal on Sunday afternoon. Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool can finish in the top four despite being 10th at Christmas . Martin Skrtel celebrates after scoring a dramatic equaliser against Arsenal in injury time at Anfield on Sunday . In 1993, Graeme Souness led his Liverpool to sixth place after spending Christmas in 10th . Ian Rush, pictured playing against Ipswich, scored 14 domestic goals as Liverpool finished in sixth in 1993 . Speaking after the game, Rodgers declared: 'Can we now challenge for the top four? Yes. Absolutely. The most important thing is that we are moving in the right direction again.' While Liverpool have at times impressed with the pace, pressing and passing which was associated with their run to second place last season, they have collected just 22 points from their 17 games which finds them languishing in mid-table. The last club to finish as high as sixth after a spending the festive period in 10th was, in fact, Liverpool in 1993. During that season, with club legend Graeme Souness at the helm, Liverpool were had earned 28 points from their opening 20 games, winning eight compared to Liverpool's six victories since the start of the current campaign. Rodgers may be backing his side to make history, but with Liverpool's frontline of Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini, Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert scoring just two Premier League goals between them so far, Reds fans will be calling out for a star striker such as Ian Rush, who bagged 14 league goals for the club during the 1992-93 campaign. There's little doubt that Liverpool will be in far better shape after the return of injured frontman Sturridge. In his absence others have had to weigh in with goals but they haven't done nearly enough as Skrtel's late effort against Arsenal took the club's tally to just 21 in 17 matches. Since 1992, London trio Chelsea, Tottenham and Fulham have all spent time in 10th position at Christmas with mediocre second halves of the season to follow. In the 22 season, only eight teams have managed to finish in a higher position than their festive spot with Newcastle and Blackburn managing to finish in seventh during their respective seasons in 2005-06 and 2007-08. Only one team has ended up being relegated from the top flight after being mid-table ahead of the new year, with Blackpool ending their 2010-11 Premier League season in 19th position after a disastrous second half of the season. Liverpool will not fare that badly, but fourth seems a long way away. Liverpool's summer signing Mario Balotelli is yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League .

"Roy Hodgson claims his highlight of 2014 was being applauded by England supporters following the national team’s disastrous World Cup showing in Brazil.

We then went to the fans to thank them — really probably expecting them to not be terribly grateful for our thanks — and the reception we got there was really quite incredible. ‘I think if you said to me “tell me one thing in 2014 that’s had a major effect on your life” I would say that.’ This England fan did a fine line in gallow's honour as England crashed out in the group stage .

"Arsenal may have been leading against Liverpool with just minutes of the game to go but damning statistics from Sunday's Premier League encounter suggest the Gunners were lucky to come away from Merseyside with a point. Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel towered above the Arsenal defence to power home a header to rob Arsene Wenger's men of three points deep into nine minutes of injury time. The Gunners responded swiftly to Philippe Coutinho's opener as Mathieu Debuchy levelled a minute later before taking the lead courtesy of a neat finish from Olivier Giroud only to lose the match at the death. Martin Skrtel climbs highest to score with his head and claim an injury-time point for Liverpool against Arsenal .

Olivier Giroud puts the ball through the legs of Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones to give Arsenal the lead . However, while the sight of Nacho Monreal and Per Mertesacker ducking as  Skrtel rose through the air to level will disappoint Arsenal fans, the post-match stats will be more of a concern. From goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny having to deal with 27 shots to frontman Alexis Sanchez doing more defensive work than four of Arsenal's five defenders, the Gunners put in a laboured performance on Merseyside and will need to improve ahead of their Boxing Day clash against QPR. Arsenal defenders Per Mertesacker and Nacho Monreal both ducked as Skrtel powered home a header . Giroud and Co may have been all smiles after going ahead but statistics from the game make for grim reading . Arsenal faced more shots (27) on Sunday than they have in any other Premier League game for 11 years. The Gunners have dropped 11 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season.

"On-loan Liverpool midfielder Luis Alberto did not wait around when Malaga boss Javi Garcia called him from the bench to bring him on as a substitute against Elche. With his side level at 1-1 in the 73rd minute at Elche's Estadio Manuel Martinez Valero, Alberto came on to replace central midfield team-mate Sergi Darder.

Head of the Ski Sale Nicolette Tomkinson told MailOnline Travel: ‘Over time we have seen the Ski Sale increase in popularity among private individuals looking to acquire posters depicting specific skiing destinations. This personal interest among clients in certain resorts or mountain regions that relate to their own experience of skiing has led to a significant increase in ski posters being purchased as pieces to complement the interior décor of their chalets. 'The most popular ski posters tend to be those that depict the world’s most important, glamourous and well-loved ski resorts, including St Moritz, Klosters and Davos; all of which will feature in the 2015 sale. 'The value of a work is primarily determined by its availability, condition, and the artist. Whether the posters depict mountain ranges, skiers in action or one of the glamourous resort hotels, collectors remain attracted to the works for the colourful and decorative designs which can still be acquired relatively inexpensively.' These iconic posters are offered alongside 25 lots of vintage Louis Vuitton travel luggage. Estimates range from £800 to £80,000.","Christie's in South Kensington, London hold a 'ski sale' in January each year .

"Britons who are jetting abroad to the US or Caribbean to fix their post-holiday blues are being warned about hidden hotel costs which could amount to hundreds of pounds in additional fees. Holidaymakers should read the fine print before they book ‘too good to be true’ deals as they could be hit with larger-than-expected bills when it’s time to check out. Hotels in Las Vegas, New York and Florida, for example, were found to charge up to £50-a-day extra for non-negotiable so-called ‘resort fees’, according to researchers from Which? consumer magazine. Expedia and Hotels.com failed to adequately show the $28-per-day fee to stay at Las Vegas' Wynn Hotel . The potentially misleading offers have seen  Expedia reprimanded by the industry watchdog . Which? researchers found that the fees were ‘easy to miss’ on at least two major travel websites as the extra charges were detailed away from the main room price. Which? travel editor Jill Starley-Grainger said: ‘It can pay to check the small print on travel deals as we've found the price on some hotel-booking sites could be misleading by not including non-optional add-on charges. ‘Remember the golden rule - if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.’ Under EU rules any travel website must display any hidden costs explicitly and not bury them in the small-print. Hotels in New York were among those found to charge up to £50-a-day extra for so-called ‘resort fees' However, details were often included in the terms and conditions found in small-print as a footnote to a webpage, the study found. The potentially misleading offers have seen online travel giant Expedia reprimanded by the industry watchdog and victims have been urged to complain. A deal for the Westhouse Hotel in New York was advertised on its website with all taxes and fees included, whereas in fact a mandatory resort daily charge of $30 (£20) was payable on departure. Along with Expedia researchers analysed deals on Ebookers, Hotels.com, Opodo and Lastminute.com. Of the five leading sites Expedia and Hotels.com failed to adequately show the $28-per-day (£19) resort fee to stay at the five-star Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas. Holidaymakers are being warned to read the fine print before booking hotels in destinations such as Florida . Rooms at the Wynn were £180 per night at the time the researchers checked. The resort fee is payable per person, so won't be linked to the price of a room. In both cases the extra charge only emerged after scrolling down the page or clicking through to another. Which? said the extras needed to be ‘much clearer’ and appear alongside the room price at the top of the page. In response Expedia announced it was planning to overhaul the way it displays the fees and had made some initial changes. Hotels.com said it was also looking into the issue. An Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) spokesman said: ‘If anyone has concerns that an advertiser isn't being up-front about non-option charges we encourage them to get in touch with us.’","Which? magazine is telling tourists to read the fine print before booking .

Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed with the brain disease about three years after he retired from boxing in 1981. Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be counting down the days until he can call upon the services of star striker Daniel Sturridge once again. With Sturridge sidelined and his former strike partner Luis Suarez now in Barcelona, the Reds are crying out for a potent finisher. Incredibly Rodgers' side have had a staggering 44 shots at goal in their last three Premier League outings against Arsenal, Manchester United and Sunderland. But they have managed to score only two goals in that period. Mario Balotelli and Raheem Sterling have squandered superb opportunities in recent league games . Sterling was foiled by David De Gea in Liverpool's recent 3-0 defeat against Manchester United . In fact, only 21 of those 44 shots were on target which is a frightening statistic considering  Rodgers signed two international strikers in Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert in a bid to fill the  void left by Suarez's departure. Liverpool ran riot against Arsenal at Anfield last season with Martin Skrtel and Sterling both scoring twice while Sturridge was also on target in an emphatic 5-1 thrashing. But the Reds are no longer striking fear into the opposition and only claimed a point against a lacklustre Arsenal on Sunday thanks to a 97th-minute equaliser by Skrtel. Indeed they were just minutes away from losing their eighth league game of the campaign. In contrast they lost just six league games during the entirety of last season. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has played just three Premier League games so far this season .

"When you're sitting in traffic, sipping your morning coffee, and dreading your commute to work, think of Thurmond Alford. Since 2012, Alford, 44, has traveled 220 miles (seven hours total), going through three major cities, nine different counties, and passing three large rivers almost every weekday for narly 12 years. Not for any special occasion or life-threatening circumstance, but as part of his daily work commute. Scroll down for video . Travel: Thurmond Alford, 44, (photographed) has traveled 220 miles (seven hours total) almost every weekday for nearly 12 years . Family: Thurmond said he decided to take on the long commute because everyone he loves is in Richmond, VA . Support: Alford said he doesn't mind the commute, because his family support him . Alford lives in Virginia's Chesterfield County, but works in Washington D.C. at the U.S. Department of Justice. This calls for a 3 1/2 hour commute to and from work each day -- a total of seven hours. Alford was offered his 'dream job' in 2002 which paid three times what he had been making, Alford told CBS News. There was no doubt that Alford would take the job, he said, but his family and everyone he loves is in Richmond, VA. So, there was only one thing to do: make the seven-hour commute each day for the sake of his family. Alford told WTVR that he's put 27,000 miles on his 2014 Mazda 6 in just seven months. He spends almost $45 every three days for gas, he gets an approximately $70 oil change every two weeks, and a $40 tire rotation every month to keep his car in good shape, according to Richmond BizSense. Commute: Alford goes through three major cities, nine counties, and passes three large rivers nearly every day during his commute . 'Every two weeks I was changing oil,' Alford told CBS News. 'The guy at Jiffy Lube, he knew my first name. He knew my football team.' But, Alford only uses his car to drive part of the commute, getting a carpool ride to the D.C. Metro. 'Everybody has a monkey on their back– an issue they have to deal with,' he told WTVR. 'My issue is my commute, and I accept it.' It isn't all bad though, Alford says the long commute is worth it because it means he is able to stay close to his family.' 'It's all about family, if you don't have family, what are you going to do?' Alford told CBS. For more videos, please go to YouTube . Morning: Alford's commute begins in the morning at 4am and he arrives at the U.S. Department of Justice at around 7.30am . Trains: Alford drives 80 miles to a parking lot outside of Fredericksburg, he then rides with a friend to another parking lot in Arlington, from there, he takes two trains to downtown Washington . In May, Alford was chosen by Washington Radio station WTOP 103.5 FM as the winner of its 'Commuter Idle' contest for his grueling commute. As a prize, Alford won a limo ride to and from work one day and $1,000 for gas, BizSense reports. The DOJ reimburses Alford for his Metro cards. Alford's commute begins around 4am each weekday and the father-of-two arrives at the DOJ around 7.30am. Alford drives 80 miles to a parking lot outside of Fredericksburg, he then rides with a friend to another parking lot in Arlington, from there, he takes two trains to downtown Washington.

"Rangers chairman David Somers could barely be heard amid boos and heckles as he told shareholders at the club's annual general meeting of an 'anti-Rangers feeling' pervading through Scottish football. Somers and his fellow board members were roundly booed as they took to the stage on the Ibrox pitch little over 12 hours after announcing Ally McCoist had been removed from his position as manager and placed on garden leave. Somers, Derek Llambias and brothers James and Sandy Easdale were greeted with chants of 'out, out, out', 'sack the board' and 'scumbags'.

Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias steps out of a taxi as he arrives at Ibrox stadium . Rangers board members (from left) James Easdale, David Somers, Derek Llambias and Sandy Easdale . Rangers have major self-inflicted financial problems and need to recoup most of their £8.3million annual losses before the end of the season just to keep the club afloat. Somers attempted to deflect the blame elsewhere but his speech was roundly booed. He said: 'In these past 12 months, I have been surprised at a number of things. Firstly, the highly negative aspect of most of the media reporting regarding Rangers. 'Secondly, because it is clear to me that a stronger Rangers is good for Scottish football, I have been very disappointed to realise that outside of Ibrox, there sadly still exists a great deal of anti-Rangers feeling, perhaps (although I hope not) even in the football establishment.' Somers also claimed that a season ticket boycott launched by former oldco director Dave King and backed by fans has put the club in fresh peril. The club had 36,000 season ticket holders last term but home attendances this campaign have dropped as low as 19,000. Somers said: 'Rangers' return to the top flight of our game, I am sure you will agree, will be more easily achieved if everyone who cares about the club works together for the betterment of Rangers. Rangers shareholders make their way into Ibrox stadium for Monday's club AGM . Leaflets are handed to shareholders as they arrive at Ibrox on Monday morning . 'This turbulent year has seen people calling for a season ticket boycott, seen the disruptive creation of a season ticket trust for a while and other negative ideas. 'Such negativity is expensive for Rangers as it reduces season ticket and overall ticket sales, increasing the likelihood that I will have to borrow money to cover the shortfalls created. Our path to restoring Rangers to where we all want the club to be can only be achieved with the continued support of all supporters, shareholders and business partners.' Somers, who has placed assistant manager Kenny McDowall in charge of first-team affairs, also said there had been a 'chasm between the talented young players being developed at Murray Park and our first team'. Former Rangers chairman Malcolm Murray (centre) arrives at the club's stadium . Former Rangers director Paul Murray (centre) makes his way towards the entry gates . He added: 'We need to focus on ways of developing our own young players for the first team rather than continually buying in players.' Amid the jeering there was laughter as Somers admitted 'we have got more work to do' and even louder laughter when he said: 'We need to rebuild the board with suitable people.' New chief executive Llambias, who was appointed on the back of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's £3million loan to the club, was introduced to booing but he did prompt some applause following his address. The former Newcastle managing director claimed he had helped the St James' Park club 'stand on its own two feet' and would roll up his sleeves to get Rangers back on its feet. He added: 'Not everything I do will be popular but everything I do will be in the club's long-term interests.' Somers asked fans to 'refrain from any disruptive behaviour' and added: 'If anyone gets too rowdy I will have to ask you to leave.' Ally McCoist shouts instructions to his players during his last match in charge of Rangers on Saturday . He then sparked more jeers when he announced he would take two questions at a time, further enraging supporters by saying: 'When you get to be chairman of Rangers you get to do it your way.' Somers said one of the main weapons in bridging the funding gap was a planned share issue - they need three-quarters of votes to go their way in the related resolution at the AGM. Former Rangers player John Brown stood up to huge applause to ask what involvement Ticketus had in the ownership of Murray Park and Ibrox and what role former directors Charles Green and Imran Ahmad had in the club. He also called the Easdale brothers 'stooges' and criticised Somers for failing to have the decency to say a good word about McCoist, 'who gave this club everything'. Somers was adamant there was no involvement from Ticketus, who put in more than £30million to the club during Craig Whyte's brief and disastrous tenure. And he added: 'I was fascinated when I first became chairman because some people seemed to think I was some sort of love child of Imran Ahmad or Charles Green. I have never met either of them and I can say the people beside me have no involvement with them. 'I respect Ally's decision. I will never say a bad word about him. He will always be a Rangers legend.' Mike Ashley (left) and Llambias watch Newcastle United take on Arsenal at St James' Park in May 2013 . Somers defended the board's decision to accept Ashley's £3million interest-free loan over a £16million offer from Dave King and another deal from Brian Kennedy. Somers said: 'I get frustrated with Dave King. I know a lot of you think he is the messiah. The simple reality is that I asked some simple questions because in the past Rangers have done some terrible deals. They were not difficult - the same as I asked to Brian Kennedy and Mike Ashley: show me the money and names of the eight people in your consortium. He didn't do that. 'But the reality is he has cost the club millions of pounds with the season ticket trust and him advising people to boycott season tickets.' The board revealed they had a meeting with the Scottish Football Association on Tuesday to see what is expected of them in relation to disciplinary charges over Ashley's interests in two clubs.","Rangers held their annual general meeting at Ibrox on Monday .

"The war of words over Delon Armitage’s three-month ban continued as disciplinary chiefs branded the former England international ‘an habitual offender’ with ‘an appalling disciplinary record’. Armitage was found guilty of conducting himself in an unsportsmanlike manner at Welford Road earlier this month, with details of the Toulon full back’s post-match bust-up with Leicester supporters revealed by Sportsmail. His lengthy suspension prompted a furious backlash from comic-book tycoon Mourad Boudjellal, who owns the Top 14 club and threatened to sue those who testified against the 31-year-old. Toulon's Delon Armitage was described by an official disciplinary committee as 'an habitual offender' The 31-year-old appeared in front of the independent panel following allegations he had sworn at some fans . Toulon supporters hold pictures of Armitage during the French Top 14 match between Toulon and Lyon . The independent disciplinary panel released their full judgment on Sunday and revealed that Armitage, who pleaded not guilty, admitted to twice telling Leicester supporters to ‘f*** off’ after the 25-21 defeat in the East Midlands. ‘We considered the player’s previous record and concluded that he is an habitual offender against the laws of the game, and one for whom there needs to be a deterrent to combat a clear pattern of offending, both on and off the field,’ read the judgment. ‘The player is without doubt an exceptionally talented individual, but he has an appalling disciplinary record, both on and off the field.’ In his time at London Irish the fullback was banned for five weeks for a dangerous tackle on Bath's Tom Biggs . The England star was also suspended from the Saxons squad after being arrested for an alleged assault . Armitage’s comments were made in earshot of children and his previous history counted against him when the three-man committee made their judgment. His latest rap is likely to be challenged by Toulon. The player was found not guilty of calling supporters ‘inbred *****’ at half-time but was found guilty for an altercation witnessed by Leicester fan Stephen Hampson, whose 11-year-old son approached Armitage for an autograph. ‘The player signed Master Hampson’s programme, though he declined to be photographed with him,’ said the judgment. ‘As the player left the pitch-level walkway and started to go up the steps, there was an interaction with a group of Tigers fans. Armitage faced a disciplinary hearing for this dangerous high tackle on Scotland's Chris Paterson . Northampton Saints fly half Stephen Myler was the victime of a punch by Armitage - then of London Irish . Armitage comes to blows with Munster's Keith Earls  after a late tackle on his team-mate Paul Hodgson . ‘The player admitted in his evidence that he had sworn at them and had used the words “f*** off” twice and raised his hand/arm in a dismissive wave away, which he had not intended to be threatening. ‘Mr Hampson told the committee that the player seemed very agitated and was shouting in an intimidating and threatening manner and used the words “f*** off, I’ll f****** come down there and sort you out. F*** off — come on then, come on then f*** off”.’ In his defence, Armitage said that he had been the subject of ‘banter and abuse’. His previous disciplinary record meant the ban was extended from eight to 12 weeks. The judgment read: ‘We were not impressed by the player when he gave evidence and was questioned.’ The Toulon star holds aloft the 2013 Heineken Cup with Jonny Wilkinson following their win against Clermont .","Toulon's Delon Armitage stood in front of a rugby union disciplinary panel .

"The key role Pope Francis played encouraging talks between Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro left fractures among his flock in South Florida, where many older Roman Catholics equate the Castro brothers with the devil. Many Catholics worldwide have expressed pride in seeing Francis stirring hopes of progress in communist Cuba, but some Cuban-Americans say their spiritual leader betrayed them. 'I'm still Catholic till the day I die,' said Efrain Rivas, a 53-year-old maintenance man in Miami who was a political prisoner in Cuba for 16 years. 'But I am a Catholic without a pope.' Many Catholics have expressed pride in seeing Francis stirring hopes of progress in communist Cuba, but some Cuban-Americans say their spiritual leader betrayed them . Rivas said he cried when Obama surprisingly announced a reversal of a half-century's efforts to isolate Cuba. Then, when he learned of Francis' role, he got angry. Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski acknowledged that some Catholics are ""concerned or suspicious,"" but said many more exiles welcome the breakthrough, despite their suffering. 'The pain is real, but you can't build a future on top of resentments,' Wenski told The Associated Press in an interview. The Vatican has been reaching out to Cuba at least since Pope John Paul II, who declared during his historic 1998 visit to the island, 'May Cuba, with all its magnificent potential, open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba."" Discussions continued under Pope Benedict XVI, who visited Cuba in 2012. And Francis, the first Latin American pope, has advocated for an end to the U.S. embargo since participating in John Paul's visit to Cuba as the soon-to-be-named Cardinal of Buenos Aires. Larisa Alonso talks to a reporter at Our Lady of Charity Catholic church in Miami about how many Catholics have expressed pride in seeing Francis stirring hopes of progress in communist Cuba, but some Cuban-Americans say their spiritual leader betrayed them . Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who is close to Francis, set up the papal visits and has been decisive in improving ties between the church and the officially atheist state since becoming Havana archbishop in 1981. This frustrates some older Catholics who wanted the church to use its unique position inside Cuba to take a harder line. 'The church is contaminated,' said Miguel Saavedra, a 57-year-old Miami mechanic who leads an anti-Castro group and wears a gold cross as a sign of his Catholic faith. Exiles incensed by the diplomacy openly wonder: Was Francis strong-armed by President Barack Obama? Does he understand how terrible the Castro brothers are? Was he perhaps making a foolhardy bid to cement his change-making image? 'I don't know what the pope was thinking,' said Jose Sanchez-Gronlier, a 53-year-old lawyer who said he was persecuted for his faith until leaving Cuba as a teenager, and will never forget watching the government seize a convent near his childhood home. 'I see a certain naivete in the pope,' he said. Anti-Castro protester Jay Fernandez holds a a sign in the Little Havana area of Miami . Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American from Florida who has led the Republicans' criticism of Obama's executive actions on Cuba, also took a swipe at the pope, telling reporters in Washington that he would 'ask His Holiness to take up the cause of freedom and democracy.' All this is familiar territory for Francis, who has spent a lifetime navigating the after-effects of the Cold War in Latin America. In his writings before becoming pope, the Argentine church leader criticized Cuban state authoritarianism as well as the U.S. embargo, and called on both sides to talk out their differences. As pope, he wrote to both Obama and Castro suggesting that a thaw could begin by releasing prisoners. But Arturo Suarez-Ramos, a 50-year-old Miami waiter who was a political prisoner in Cuba for 27 years, said Francis is reaching for more headlines after insisting that homosexuals and divorced people are welcome in church. 'He's trying to get a legacy at any price,' Suarez-Ramos said. The Catholic Church remains the dominant religious force in Cuba, though attendance at Mass is low after decades of official atheism. It has long provided an alternative power center where at least some criticism of the government was possible. Its mediation role could be seen as a reason to trust the promises of change that both Obama and Castro made this week, but many remain wary. Jay Fernandez, a retiree who left Cuba in 1961, said Francis acted like a beggar, taking whatever scraps of concessions the Cuban government offered. Anti-Castro protesters and former Cuban political prisoners Efrain Rivas, left, and Arturo Suarez, right, expressed their disagreement on Wednesday's announcement that the U.S. and Cuba will begin taking steps to restore full diplomatic relations . 'He wants to be everywhere, he wants to be liked by everyone,' Fernandez said. 'That's his job to be a peace guy, but it doesn't accomplish a damn thing, especially in Cuba.' U.S. bishops also have long called for an end to the embargo and for improved relations with Cuba. Engagement can do more than isolation to open up Cuban society and improve human rights and religious liberty, they said. That message seemed to connect with some attending midday Mass at Ermita de la Caridad, a church dedicated to Cuba's patron saint. 'This is the best thing that could have happened,' said Lucresia Leon, 70, who left Cuba during the 1980 Mariel boatlift, when 125,000 fled the island. She smiled widely, saying 'Everything will be fixed.' Draped in the bright purple vestments of Advent, the Rev. Juan Rumin Dominguez, who arrived from Cuba nine years ago, said accepting change is not a simple thing. 'It's not easy, but the faithful people in these kinds of situations know to trust in God' the priest said. 'We are a faithful people. We have confidence because God has his plan.' Historian Jesus Mendez, a Cuban exile who teaches at Barry University and has written about the Latin American church, said most Catholics will welcome the pope's intervention as an effort to increase religious freedom on the island. 'He's very concerned over the decline of Catholic fervor, primarily in Europe but also even in the United States and Canada, so of course he sees it important to have a high profile for the Catholic Church in Cuba,' Mendez said.","Many older Roman Catholics equate the Castro brothers with the devil .

"Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech looks set to stay at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season, after his agent admitted that a January move isn’t on the cards for his client. But the second-choice stopper’s representative opened the door to a move to Barclays Premier League rivals Arsenal and Liverpool, saying Cech would be interested if they were to come in for him. Czech Republic international Cech has been Chelsea No 1 for the past decade but found his starting place taken by returning loanee Thibaut Courtois for much of this season. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech won't be leaving the club in the January transfer window, according to his agent .

Cech (left) and Courtois compete for ball during training - and their battle extends to Jose Mourinho's thoughts . And despite talk that Cech is unhappy with his place on the bench, it now seems he won’t be moving when the transfer window opens next week. ‘It’s unlikely Petr will leave Chelsea in the January transfer window. The club and coach want to keep him to help win the title,’ his agent Viktor Kolar told Czech newspaper Sport. But Kolar also admitted that staying in England is an option for the keeper. ‘I think Arsenal should have made an offer to him. I think Petr would be considering it,’ he said. ‘Liverpool need to strengthen their position in goal and they know Petr will be available in the summer. We’ve been in contact with Real Madrid but they don’t need a keeper just now.

"Queens Park Rangers have opened talks with Charlie Austin about offering him a new contract. The striker hit his first Barclays Premier League hat-trick to help his side come from two goals down to beat West Bromwich Albion at the weekend. It took his goals tally to 11 in 15 games this season making him the league's leading English goalscorer behind only Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa in the scoring charts. Charlie Austin celebrates with the match ball after scoring a hat-trick for QPR against West Brom . Austin, still only 25, has 18 months remaining on his current deal which he signed in 2013 when he joined the club in a £4million move from Burnley. He is fast becoming one of the hottest properties in England and QPR chiefs have started initial discussions with the player's representative about extending his stay. Both parties are said to be relaxed about the current situation and in no hurry, with a busy set of festive fixtures ahead. Austin is set to see his weekly wages increase from £28,000 to between £50,000 and £60,000 . QPR striker Bobby Zamora (left) has urged the club to extend team-mate Austin's deal at Loftus Road . It is understood Austin is set to potentially double his £28,000-per-week deal to between £50,000 and £60,000 and extend it to 2018. His form this season – his first in the top flight – has attracted attention from England manager Roy Hodgson and his scouts. Back in November, Hodgson said: ‘I think Charlie Austin is doing very well at QPR and he’s a player we have our eyes on.' Since then, he has netted six goals in six appearances. There is no doubting his importance to QPR after manager Harry Redknapp admitted they 'might as well go home' if they sold the player and striker partner Bobby Zamora urging the club to extend his stay.

"Singer Joe Cocker has died aged 70 after a battle with lung cancer . Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have led the tributes to rock and blues singer Joe Cocker, who has died at the age of 70. Cocker, best known for his cover of the Beatles' song With A Little Help From My Friends, died at his home in the U.S. last night after a battle with lung cancer. The prolific star, who released 40 albums over a career spanning half a century, became such good friends with the Beatles that they would play him their new songs before they had even recorded them. Sir Paul said: 'It's really sad to hear about Joe's passing. He was a lovely northern lad who I loved a lot and, like many people, I loved his singing. 'I was especially pleased when he decided to cover With A Little Help From My Friends and I remember him and (producer) Denny Cordell coming round to the studio in Savile Row and playing me what they'd recorded and it was just mind-blowing, totally turned the song into a soul anthem and I was forever grateful for him for doing that. 'I knew him through the years as a good mate and I was so sad to hear that he had been ill and really sad to hear today that he had passed away. 'He was a great guy, a lovely guy who brought so much to the world and we'll all miss him.' Beatles drummer Ringo Starr paid tribute to his friend, tweeting: 'Goodbye and God bless to Joe Cocker from one of his friends, peace and love.' Cocker was 'without the doubt the greatest rock/soul singer ever to come out of Britain,' his agent Barrie Marshall said. His success as a blues and rock singer lasted decades, with the Beatles cover reaching number one in 1968. Cocker found international fame following his performance at Woodstock in 1969, where his storming set was regarded as one of the highlights of the festival. He won his first Grammy in 1983 and an Oscar for his duet with Jennifer Warnes, Up Where We Belong, which was used in the soundtrack of Richard Gere film An Officer And A Gentleman. He will also be remembered for his 1975 hit You Are So Beautiful and Delta Lady. Scroll down for video . The singer from Sheffield had a career lasting more than 40 years with hits including You Are So Beautiful . On the road, Cocker shared stages with the Rolling Stones and partied with Rod Stewart and Jimi Hendrix . The prolific star from Sheffield had a career lasting more than 45 years and played his last gig in June . Cocker's agent said the singer was 'simply unique' and 'it will be impossible to fill the space he leaves in our hearts' His 1987 album Unchain My Heart was nominated for a Grammy, although it did not win. Cocker was nominated for a Brit Award for Best British Male in 1993 and, in 2007, the rock legend was awarded the OBE for services to the music industry. The singer never stopped releasing new material, topping the charts in Germany just last year. His last gig came in Hammersmith, London, in June, 2013. One of the British pop heroes of the Sixties, the former gas-fitter was as well known for his unruly curls and wild onstage gyrations as for his gritty voice. On the road, he shared stages with the Rolling Stones and partied with Rod Stewart and Jimi Hendrix. Cocker admitted that the rockstar life got the better of him, saying 'things began to deteriorate in 1972' after experimenting with drugs. He was pulled back from the brink by his wife Pam, who he met in 1978 and married in 1987. Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr paid tribute to Cocker, who was a close friend of the Beatles . Cocker, pictured in Rome in 1982, was also known for his version of You Are So Beautiful in 1975 and Up Where We Belong in 1983 . Cocker admitted that the rockstar life got the better of him, saying 'things began to deteriorate in 1972' after experimenting with drugs . In an interview last year, he said: 'It was Pam who helped me get myself back together. 'She made me think positively. I was very down on myself. She made me realise people still wanted to hear me sing, and convinced me I could escape the downward spiral. 'So I kept going. In America, I'd become a cartoon character, but my European fans were loyal. Even when I was at my most crazed, throwing my shoes into the crowd at gigs, they stuck with me. That helped me to rediscover my focus.' He calmed down and quit smoking in 1992. In a 2000 interview he said: 'I quit smoking cigarettes about seven or eight years ago. That's been the saving grace. That little ""ooh-ooh"" high-end falsetto was starting to get clogged up, and I was having trouble with my breathing. 'I'll never completely come through all those years of drinking and smoking and stuff. But I know people who prefer my voice today to how I sounded back then.' The tributes continued to pour in as news of Cocker's death spread, with fellow rock singer Bryan Adams tweeting: 'Joe Cocker has died. RIP my good friend, you were one of the best rock singers ever.' Classic rock songwriter and musician Peter Frampton said: 'So sad to hear of Joe Cocker's passing. 'You are so beautiful' is both Joe and Nicky Hopkins piano at their very best. Gonna play it now RIP' Singer-songwriter Frank Turner tweeted: 'Wow. Sad to hear of Joe Cocker's passing. Incredible singer.' Irish pop star Ronan Keating said: 'So sad to hear of Joe Cocker passing. What a brilliant and unique voice. Peace'. Kiss rocker Gene Simmons tweeted: 'Sad to hear Joe Cocker has passed away. Our prayers go out to his family.'

The singer never stopped releasing new material, topping the charts in Germany just last year . Rick Wakeman, keyboard player for progressive rock band Yes, called his hit With a Little Help From My Friends 'sensational' and said: 'He had a voice that was just unique.' He told BBC Radio 2: 'He was a very nice guy, as well as being a very talented guy. 'It is very, very sad for all his family and friends and for all who loved him. The great thing is with someone like Joe is what they leave behind, and that will be with us for years and years.' He added: 'People talk about stage presence, and he really had it.' Aerosmith frontman Steve Tyler said: 'We loved you forever, we will miss you always. RIP Joe Cocker.' Comedian Ricky Gervais also paid tribute, saying: 'RIP the mighty Joe Cocker.' Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe said: 'One of the greats, Joe Cocker R.I.P.' Josh Saviano, who played Paul Joseph Pfeiffer in The Wonder Years, soundtracked by Cocker's version of With a Little Help from My Friends, said: 'We all lent Joe our ear, and he sang us a mighty song RIPJoeCocker' One of the British pop heroes of the Sixties, the former gas-fitter was as well known for his unruly curls and wild onstage gyrations as for his gritty voice . Cocker's agent, who represented the singer for more than 30 years, said he was 'simply unique' Away from music, the rock star enjoyed long walks in the mountains with his dogs, fly fishing, playing snooker with friends, and growing tomatoes in his greenhouse . Edgar Berger, chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment International, who signed Cocker, said: 'Joe Cocker is a legendary artist of rock and blues history and yet he was one of the most humble men I've ever met. 'His iconic voice will forever be etched in our memories and our thoughts go out to Joe's wife Pam and his family at this difficult time. Joe will live on in the hearts of millions of fans around the world.' Mr Marshall, who represented the singer for more than 30 years, told the BBC he was 'simply unique' and 'it will be impossible to fill the space he leaves in our hearts'. Away from music Cocker enjoyed long walks in the mountains with his dogs, fly fishing, playing snooker with friends, and growing tomatoes in his greenhouse. He moved to Crawford, Colorado, a town of fewer than 500 people, in the early 1990s. He and Pam ran a children's educational foundation - the Cocker Kids Foundation - that raised funds for the town and schools, and ran a cafe. He is survived by his wife, his brother Victor, his step-daughter Zoey Schroeder and two grandchildren, Eva and Simon.","Rock and blues singer Joe Cocker dies aged 70 after fighting lung cancer .

"A nature photographer has captured breath-taking photos of frozen trees in a remote part of Western Russia where the temperature drops to a chilling -35C. Set against the red and orange glow of the sky, the trees carve eerie shapes on the frigid landscape as they buckle under the weight of ice and snow. They make for unworldly figures as they stand against a magnificent, wintry backdrop in Perm Krai and Sverdlovsk Oblast. Photographer Sergey Makurin captured the stunning shots while trekking through the Ural mountain range in Western Russia . Clusters of frozen trees that have buckled under the weight of ice and snow appear to have been sliced in half . The trees make for unworldly figures as they stand against a magnificent, wintry backdrop in Perm Krai and Sverdlovsk Oblast . Mr Makurin said 'it's not always easy to get the perfect shot' it sometimes too him hours or even days to get it right . The stunning shots were captured by Russian photographer Sergey Makurin in the Ural Mountains, which extend south from the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Sergey trekked through sub-zero weather to access an area which is extremely isolated with very few human inhabitants for miles around. Some of his images show clusters of bent trees, which make it seem like a single tree has been sliced in half. Sergey Makurin decided to photograph the Ural Mountains at winter to 'share this incredible region with the rest of the world' Photographer Sergey Makurin says the area has so much natural beauty that it can be comforting being miles away from the nearest human . Mr Makurin trekked through sub-zero weather to access an area which is isolated with very few human inhabitants for miles around . Sergey Makurin describes the trees as 'eerie' and says it can be 'a little unnerving' being in such an isolated area . Sergey, 45, said: ‘When I was 12 years old I got to see the Ural Mountains for the first time and I was amazed. ‘I felt I had to share this incredible region with the rest of the world. ‘The trees do look eerie and knowing that you are in a very isolated area can sometimes be a little unnerving.’ Set against the red and orange glow of the sky, the trees carve eerie shapes on the frigid landscape where few people dare to venture .

"A heavily pregnant young woman was killed and had her baby cut from her womb by a jealous teenager who was angry at having aborted her own child. Nathaly Cartas Leon, 20, was eight months pregnant and looking forward to the birth of her child  when she met 17-year-old Guadalupe Salinas Hernandez on Facebook. She made contact with Hernandez while looking for items for the baby's nursery and went to the teenagers home. But Nathaly was attacked as soon as she walked through the door. Nathaly Cartas Leon (pictured), 20, was eight months pregnant and looking forward to the birth of her child when she met 17-year-old Guadalupe Salinas Hernandez on Facebook . Hernandez hit the pregnant woman over the head with a blunt instrument, and then stabbed her several times, before cutting her unborn baby from the womb. The horrific killing, which happened in the city of Reynosa in the north-eastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, has shocked the entire country . Although Nathaly had been reported missing, it was only when Hernandez turned up at hospital claiming that the baby had been stillborn that the crime was discovered. Doctors quickly realized that the teenager was not the mother of the baby as she claimed. Nathaly was hit over the head with a blunt instrument, and then stabbed her several times, before her unborn baby baby was cut from her womb . They also concluded that the baby had not died during a natural birth but that it had suffocated in the womb after the death of its mother. Hernandez later confessed that the baby belonged to a woman she had killed days earlier, and police discovered Nathaly's mutilated body at the teen's home. It was later discovered that Hernandez had been pregnant and had had an abortion, but later regretted the decision and had planned to claim another baby as hers instead.","Nathaly Cartas Leon met  Guadalupe Salinas Hernandez, 17, on Facebook .

"Michael Martin has been known to his high school friends as a star goalie, a gifted swimmer and an avid nature lover, but there was one thing he had been keeping them in the dark about: he was gay. All that changed during a school dance earlier this year when the Musselman High School senior invited another young man to a slow dance. As Taylor Swift's song Love Story came over the speakers, a nervous Martin and the homecoming king held hands and swayed to the melody in front of the whole school. Big moment: Michael Martin (left), 18, a senior at Musselman High School in West Virginia, came out as gay in the fall by dancing with the homecoming king (right) Star athlete: Martin is an all-state goalie on his school soccer team and also plays on the football and tennis teams . Living in the shadows: Martin (center bottom row) wrote in a personal essay that growing up in rural West Virginia, he could never imagine telling anyone he was gay . Last week, the all-state soccer goalie wrote a poignant personal essay about his inspiring coming out story for SB Nation's Outsports website. 'It was something I thought I'd never do -- dance a slow dance with the homecoming king at his high school,' the young athlete wrote. Martin explained that growing up in rural West Virginia, he was afraid to be mocked by his friends and ostracized by his family and neighbors for being openly gay. Yet on the night of the homecoming dance in October, for the first time in his life Martin was dancing with another man. 'It was a weird feeling for me, since I had just barely started coming out,' the 18-year-old confided. 'I was nervous yet excited.' After the party, Martin asked his date - a boy from another school named Jem - to be his boyfriend. 'I posed the question by writing it on the dry erase board on his wall. He quickly said yes,’ Martin revealed in writing. Fateful night: Two weeks after the slow dance with the homecoming king, Martin (bottom left) invited the boy, Jem. as his date to the Musselman High School homecoming dance . Split opinion: Martin, pictured with female cheerleaders, said most people at hs school have accepted him, but there also have been some negative remarks about his coming out, especially from the jocks . Two weeks later, it was homecoming dance at Martin's high school, and the star goalie and member of the Musselman High School football, tennis and swimming teams decided to use the opportunity to reveal his true identity as a gay man to his own classmates. The 18-year-old and his new boyfriend danced the night away in the school cafeteria, and whenever someone would come up to Martin and ask him if he and Jem were together, he would say, 'yes.' But as word about his sexuality spread around the school in the days following the party, Martin discovered that not everyone was ready to accept him for who he was. '""He is a f***** now,"" I was told some people said,' wrote Martin. The senior explained that from a very young age, he knew that he was attracted to boys, but he could not fathom sharing his feelings with his ultra-conservative and devout family, or with anyone else in their isolated mountainous community. Even as a freshman in high school, Martin said on the most part he kept mum about his sexuality for fear of becoming a pariah at school, where some of his teammates have been known to casually throw around gay slurs. Inspiring figure: Martin's essay, published last Tuesday, has since gone viral drawing the courageous teenagers much praise from the LGBT community . Bright future: After graduating high school next spring, Martin is hoping to continue playing soccer on the college level . It wasn't until his junior year that Martin finally mastered the courage to come out to his best friend on the soccer team, but even then he waited until the season was over, just to be on the safe side. To his relief, the teammate reassured Martin that his being gay will not change their friendship. Now feeling more confident about himself, Martin began laying the groundwork for a public reveal, which came on the day of the homecoming dance in Jem's school in a neighboring county, followed by the dance at his own school. Martin wrote in his touching essay that it was the coming out story of Los Angeles Galaxy player Robbie Roberts that ultimately inspired him to cast aside his anxiety and emerge from the shadows. While some people have been critical of the openly gay teen, he has made many new friends . ‘I didn't want to hide how I really was any more,’ he stated. ‘I didn't want to live every day with a secret hanging over my head. I told my team before my own parents.’ When players on Martin's soccer team learned he was gay, some of them could not believe it at first, telling him he 'always acted so straight.' Martin wrote he has made many new friends since coming out, and most of his teammates have accepted him. Looking beyond his high school experience, which will come to an end next spring, Martin says he has been in talks with college soccer coaches about playing for their schools. ‘That will be a whole new level, a whole new school, group of friends, and new teammates,’ he wrote. ‘But I won't be afraid of being myself since I am proud to play as an athlete who happens to be gay.’ Martin's essay, published last Tuesday, has since gone viral, drawing  much praise from the LGBT community, including the source of his inspiration, Robbie Roberts, who even sent him a signed copy of his new autobiography with a personal inscription. 'I would have never have thought that my story would reach so many people... ,’ Martin summed up on his Instragram page.","All-state goalie Michael Martin, 18, grew up in rural West Virginia in a conservative family .

"The Italian government has announced plans to spend £160,000 creating an ‘earthquake-proof’ plinth for Michelangelo’s statue of David. Culture minister Dario Franceschini said funds would be provided to build an anti-seismic platform beneath the 14ft statue in the Accademia Gallery in Florence after hundreds of earth tremors shook the city and the surrounding region in recent days. As many as 250 earthquakes measuring up to 4.1 on the Richter scale have hit Tuscany in recent days, resulting in schools, houses and offices being evacuated. The Italian government has announced plans to spend £160,000 creating an ‘earthquake-proof’ plinth for Michelangelo’s statue of David . No injuries were reported but about 200 people fled their homes in Greve, 20 miles south of Florence. ‘The earthquake in Florence fortunately did not damage the government’s cultural assets,’ Mr Franceschini said as he announced funding to save the statue. ‘But it has made the need to approve this project even more urgent. A masterpiece like David must not be left to any risk.’ Last spring, experts revealed that Michelangelo's marble sculpture, created between 1501 and 1504, was at risk of collapsing due to a set of micro-fractures in its ankles. Angelo Tartuferi, director of the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence which has housed the statue since 1873, said the platform would be ready for use within the year. Last spring, experts revealed that Michelangelo's marble sculpture, created between 1501 and 1504, was at risk of collapsing due to a set of micro-fractures in its ankles . The gallery has already limited then the number of visitors and ordered a special platform to minimize vibrations. Tests by the National Research Council and Florence University have revealed that vibrations from local traffic and the millions of visitors who come to visit the statue each year have contributed to weakening the five-tonne statue. A number of other cultural treasures in Italy have been equipped with anti-seismic bases in a bid to protect them from the frequent earthquakes that hit the country. A special plinth designed by the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development was developed for the 2,500-year-old statues known as the Bronzes of Riace in the southern city of Reggio Calabria. As many as 250 earthquakes measuring up to 4.1 on the Richter scale have hit Tuscany in recent days, resulting in schools, houses and offices being evacuated . The two square marble plinths are lined with spheres that are developed to roll when the statues are placed under stress. In April 2009, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake shook the town L'Aquila, 100 kilometers east-northeast of Rome, killing 309 people. It was the biggest earthquake disaster to hit Italy in recent years, and was preceded by several weeks of minor tremors. The earthquakes come after it was revealed that tourism in Tuscany is back to the record levels of 2011. According to recent statistics, this year 43.4 million tourists visited the Italian region, which is the second highest result ever. The earthquakes come after it was revealed that tourism in Tuscany is back to the record levels of 2011 . ‘Compared with 2013, this year there have been 209,000 more arrivals and 441,000 more overnight visitors,’ explained Mr Alberto Perruzzini, director of the touristic sector of Toscana Promozione. These numbers confirm that Tuscany is still very appealing. ‘More and more foreigners decide to visit this region for holidays – today they represent 53 percent of the total number of tourists.’ Mr Perruzzini added: ‘We think that in 2015 there will be more arrivals from the US, Canada and China, while those from Brazil and Russia will get more stable. ‘There should be a general increase of 2.5 percent in arrivals. For what concerns European tourists, we think that 2015 will be a pretty stable year, with maybe some more visitors from France, Spain and from northern Europe, Great Britain included.’","The Italian government plans to spend £160,000 creating a new platform .

"A planned Christmas strike by airport staff at Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester airports has been called off. Members of the Unite union working for dnata at the three airports had been due to walk out tomorrow, but will be balloted on revised proposals. Unite regional officer Kevin Hall said: 'Unite is pleased to confirm that strike action has been suspended following a revised offer which better reflects the contribution our members make to the company. Unite union had called for peace talks to avoid disruption at airports on December 23 and 24, and thankfully it appears some common ground has been reached . 'All of this could have been avoided if the company hadn't refused requests to negotiate and go to ACAS a number of weeks ago. We will now be putting the details of the revised pay offer to our members over the coming weeks.' A spokesperson for dnata told TravelMole: 'During dnata's recent discussions with Unite and ACAS, the two parties have come to an agreement on the salary award for dnata's Unite members. Unite has accepted dnata's offer of an increase in salary of 2.25 per cent, and a one-time payment of £175 for all employees.' Three of Heathrow's five terminals were going to be affected, as well as Gatwick and Manchester Airports. The strike would have affected check-in desks at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester airports . The Unite union, which was behind the strike, said its members who work for air services provider dnata at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester had voted by more than four to one in favour of the action. Dnata's main customers include Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Cathay Pacific, Turkish Airlines and Qantas Airways. The union said the strike was in protest at an imposed 2.2 per cent pay increase at a time when supervisors were being granted a rise of 4.5 per cent. Unite represents around a quarter of the 1,900 dnata staff who carry out check-in, ground crew and cargo duties at Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester Airports. Turnout among the 460 Unite members eligible to vote was just 45 per cent. Of those who voted, some 83 per cent supported the strike 'if the company continued to refuse to negotiate'. Unite said it was not its intention to wreck Christmas for families, but simply to get the firm around the negotiating table. However it appears, at least for now, anyone travelling away this Christmas may escape added stresses to their holiday. Gatwick had earlier confirmed that as Dnata have only a small operation at the airport, no passengers would be affected if the strike had gone ahead.","Industrial action was scheduled to take place on December 23 and 24 .

"It was a slow night on the red carpet at the opening of the Marrakech film festival for the photographers and everyone was complaining over the lack of celebrities. Then a car pulled up and out stepped Noor Talbi, Morocco's most famous belly dancer. The photographers went wild. Darling of the jet set and a fixture for any society party or hotel opening, Noor's statuesque six feet frame was clothed in a spangled, off-the-shoulder ballgown slit up the side to reveal her long legs. Legs, that as a teenage athlete, won her a gold medal in the 440-meter hurdles at the national level — back when she was a boy who went by the name of Nourreddine. Glamorous: Transgender dancer Noor Talbi, seen at the Marrakech International Film Festival on December 5th. Her ability to seemingly transcend the restrictions of her culture speaks both to her star power and to a kind of tolerance toward sexual minorities in Morocco . Superstar: Noor appears to enjoy nothing but success - she has starred in several movies, headlined weddings for the wealthy, and is a regular on red carpets and big events . In this conservative Muslim country where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by up to three years in jail, a transgender woman like Noor is not only accepted but is a celebrity. Her ability to seemingly transcend the restrictions of her culture speaks both to her star power and to a certain kind of tolerance toward sexual minorities in this North African nation — and even in the wider Middle East. There are references to men affecting the clothes and attitudes of women in the Quran. In countries like Iran and Egypt, while homosexuality is illegal, gender change surgery is allowed, especially for those born hermaphrodites. Cross-dressing is also often found in the entertainment world and in Turkey one of the most famous singers of classical music was also once a man. Casablanca, Noor's hometown, looms large in the history of gender-reassignment operations. From the 1950s to the 1970s it was home to the clinic of George Burou, who revolutionized the science of turning men into women, including British model April Ashley and French cabaret dancer Coccinelle. Noor appears to enjoy nothing but success: She has starred in several movies, headlined weddings for the wealthy, and is a regular on red carpets and big events. But there are limits. She cannot get her identity card changed to reflect her new gender, and Moroccan state television refuses to put her on air. Early talent: Noor grew up in Hay Mohammedi, one of Casablanca's many sprawling slums. As a teenager she was a track and field star, but on the side she was always belly dancing . 'Gender non-conformity is entertaining and confusing as long as it's safely confined to a stage or TV screen, not something you meet on the street,' warned Scott Long, a rights activist with long experience in the Middle East. 'Social prejudice against people who don't conform to gender norms is very strong.' When Noor arrived for her interview with The Associated Press, she glided into the lobby of the Sofitel in Casablanca dressed in a form-fitting black jacket and pants with heeled boots that set her well above everyone else in the room. She sat with the perfect posture of a dancer and in her husky voice spoke in French about the performances she was giving around the world. She's even appeared on American television, with a role on Tyra Banks' America's Next Top Model back in 2011, where she taught the aspiring models to dance with a tea set on their head during an episode filmed in Marrakech. Noor does not want to talk about Nourredine, the boy she used to be, for she is now an 'integrated woman,' she said. She referred only in vague terms to her 'history,' comparing it to the checkered pasts of Hollywood screen sirens Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth. 'They tell me my costumes are too suggestive or my past — what past? We are speaking now of the woman of today, who is an artist and seduces her public,' she said about the TV executives. Noor often uses the word seduce, and one point gently tugs down the zipper of her jacket as she says it. Noor's past is the secret everyone knows but few mention. 'We accept Noor, it is burlesque, a kind of reality and fiction and it plays with the imagination of people,' said Ahmed Najim, director of the news site goud.ma who has followed Noor's career for years. 'She introduced Moroccans to the costumes, music and choreography (of belly dancing) and made it famous.' Limitations: Despite her fame, Noor cannot get her identity card changed to reflect her new gender and Moroccan state television refuses to put her on air . Najim noted that there is a tradition of men dressing up as women in small villages to dance, when it wasn't considered proper for women to do so. While homosexuality is illegal under Morocco's penal code, the measure is only sporadically enforced. In September, 60-year-old British tourist Ray Cole was arrested along with his young Moroccan boyfriend and sentenced to four months in prison, before being released. For the most part, though, there is an atmosphere of 'don't ask, don't tell,' with none of the witch-hunt mentality found in places like Egypt. Noor isn't interested in being cast in some sort of activist role for the gay community. She has hung up the phone in the past when contacted by activists. 'I don't consider myself part of that environment, I am now a woman, quite simply, and integrated.' Born the southern resort town of Agadir, Noor grew up in Hay Mohammedi, one of Casablanca's many sprawling slums. As a teenager she was a track and field star, especially in the hurdles, but on the side she was always dancing. 'I was already dancing at 10 years old and my mother would stay ""stop, this is a family wedding, don't put the scarf on,""' she said, referring to the scarf worn around the waist by belly dancers. She left for Europe at 18, came back years later as Noor and began to dance in earnest. Noor admits that as she breaks taboos, wows audiences and endures obstinate government officials, the struggle is hard and she yearns for that final official acceptance. The topic of her 10-year battle to get her gender change officially recognized on her state ID card still incenses her. 'A little piece of paper that's just 4cm (1.5 inches), is this going to make me a real woman? I am 1.85 meters of woman and my body explodes with femininity,' she said. Even so, her words quickened and her eyes flashed in annoyance as she described her humiliation when bureaucrats — or police officers — comment on the disjuncture between what is written on her ID and her appearance. 'If I wasn't such a strong woman, religious, humanly and social, another might have killed herself,' she said.","As a teenage boy, Noor Talbi was a national champion in the 440m hurdles .

"There’s nothing better than a long walk on the beach to clear your mind knowing that you’ve made an unhinged communist dictator your personal enemy. That is, at least, what actor Seth Rogen may have been thinking Sunday when he headed for the shores of Malibu, California, with his wife, Lauren Miller, and their rescue puppy, Zelda. The couple were photographed strolling barefoot in the surf, with both Rogen and his better half wearing dark sunglasses despite the overcast skies. Scroll down for video . Life's a beach: Actor and funnyman Seth Rogen takes a walk on the shores of Malibu, California, with his wife, Lauren Miller, Sunday as the scandal surrounding his film The Interview continued to unfold . Putting on a brave face: The comedian flashed a faint smile and a thumbs-up sign while strolling on the shore . Man's best friend: Rogen was accompanied by his loyal four-legged companion, Zelda the dog . Staying hydrated: The actor was photographed carrying an orange can of soda . Brief respite: Rogen appeared in good spirits while chatting with his better half . Rogen, 32, found himself at the center of a firestorm after Sony Pictures pulled the plug on the theatrical release of his latest comedy, The Interview, co-written with James Franco, in response to threats made by hackers reportedly linked to North Korea. The actor appeared to keep his emotions in check Sunday while walking on the beach in a pair of dark-blue shorts and a zip-up hooded sweatshirt, a can of soda in his hands. At one point, Rogen even flashed a thumbs-up sign for the paparazzi, the faintest shadow of a smile playing on his lips. Rogen and Miller appeared to be alone on the beach Sunday, with not a bodyguard in sight. By contrast, last week his co-star and co-creator of The Interview James Franco, 36, stepped out of his New York City apartment building accompanied by an imposing security guard. It has been reported that Rogen felt ‘betrayed’ by Sony executives for cancelling the Christmas Day premiere of his film after hackers with the shadowy Guardians of Peace organization threatened to stage ‘9/11-style’ attacks on cinemas that show the comedy about a fake CIA-backed assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. In Late November, Sony had its systems breached by hackers, resulting in the release of a decade’s worth of emails and other private information, including employees’ social security numbers and salary figures. Keeping a low profile: Even though the day was grey and cloudy, both Rogen and his wife kept their dark sunglasses on, and Lauren Miller also donned a straw hat . Mum: Rogen has not spoken publicly about Sony Pictures' controversial decision to pull the plug on his and pal James Franco's film . What lies beneath: The bearded comedian reportedly feels 'betrayed' by the studio's move to cancel the release of The Interview . Far from it all: The actor appeared relaxed and unfazed by the disconcerting news that North Korea has threatened to blow up the White House in the aftermath of The Interview scandal . On their own: Rogen and Miller walked on the beach with no bodyguards in sight Sunday . Rogen's film may yet reach the masses after Sony announced plans to release The interview for free online . Last week, the federal government announced they have evidence that the Kim Jong-Un’s totalitarian regime was behind the Sony breach – a claim Pyongyang has vehemently denied, instead pointing a figure of blame at the Obama administration. The New York Post recently reported that Sony is planning to release Rogen and Franco’s R-rated spy spoof free of charge on its own streaming service, Crackle. During his end-of-the year press conference Friday, President Obama said Sony made a mistake by pulling the plug on rogen's film in response to the hackers' demands. Sony CEO Michale Lynton responded to Obama's criticism by insisting that the studio did not cave in, and that it was committed to making the movie available for public viewing. Out and about: Rogen's co-star Randall Park, who played King Jong-Un in the shelved comedy, stepped out with his young family Saturday without bodyguards . Shelved: In this December 17 photo, a poster for the movie The Interview is carried away by a worker after being pulled from a display case at a Carmike Cinemas movie theater in Atlanta . Under fire: Obama declared Friday that Sony 'made a mistake' in shelving the satirical film, ""The Interview,"" about a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader . 'Dear leader': Kim Jong-Un's regime has threatened to blow up the White House in the wake of the hack on Sony . Just this weekend, North Korea threatened more attacks against the US government and other American institutions in the wake of the hack on Sony which cancelled the release of The Interview. In a ranting post published by the state news agency KCNA, Korean authorities hit back in an escalating war of words in which they say they will 'blow up' the White House - while bizarrely continuing to deny they have anything to do with the cyber attacks on Sony. North Korea called the hack a 'righteous deed' - and reiterated that it 'highly esteems' the attack - but said it had no idea where it came from. Obama also announced from his Hawaii retreat there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism.","Seth Rogen, 32, was spotted strolling on the beach with wife, Lauren Miller, and their rescue dog, Zelda, Sunday .

"Snuggling up with a good book in bed has long been seen as a way to wind down at the end of the day. But scientists have discovered that the millions who read their bedtime stories on an iPad or a Kindle Fire are actually keeping themselves awake. They found that people who regularly read electronic books before lights out sleep for fewer hours. People who read on iPads and Kindles before bed are less sleepy and take longer to fall asleep . This is because the blue glow emitted by the electronic devices can destroy the body’s natural rhythm. All living things have an internal mechanism – known as the circadian rhythm, or body clock – which synchronises bodily functions to the 24-hour pattern of the Earth’s rotation. The clock is regulated by the senses, most importantly, the way the eye perceives light and dark. This mechanism rules our daily rhythms, including sleep and waking patterns and metabolism. It also determines whether we are a ‘morning’ or an ‘evening’ person. But the pressures of modern living mean many of us now increasingly work against our body clocks – with disrupted sleep thought to be partly responsible for increased rates of cancer, dementia and diabetes. During the two-week study, 12 participants read electronic books for four hours before bedtime. The experiment was then repeated with printed books. The researchers found that those reading on screens were less sleepy in the evening and took longer to fall asleep. They had reduced levels of melatonin, a hormone which plays a role in inducing sleepiness. And they took nearly ten minutes longer to fall asleep after reading an e-reader compared to reading a printed book. They also had a lower amount of rapid eye movement sleep – a stage thought to be crucial because it is when memories are consolidated. Regular books are better before bed because screens have an 'extremely powerful effect' on the body’s natural sleep pattern . Lead researcher Dr Anne-Marie Chang said screens can have an ‘extremely powerful effect’ on the body’s natural sleep pattern . The study was carried out by Penn State and Harvard universities in the US and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Lead researcher Dr Anne-Marie Chang said screens can have an ‘extremely powerful effect’ on the body’s natural sleep pattern. She added: ‘Participants reading a light-emitting eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book.’ Dr Charles Czeisler from Harvard University, who contributed to the study, added: ‘In the past 50 years, there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality. ‘Since more people are choosing electronic devices for reading, communication and entertainment – particularly children and adolescents who already experience significant sleep loss – research evaluating the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed.’","Blue light emitted by modern devices can knock out body’s natural rhythm .

It is served at various festivals and occasions . Evidence shows that their extreme eating habits, while very high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates, are quite healthy. Eskimos, including Inuits, seem to have no incidence of breast cancer. This has been attributed to the presence of omega-3 fats in their high intake of oily fish. In China, a popular breakfast is the Century egg - so called because the (duck, chicken or quail) eggs are preserved in a mixture of clay, ash, salt, quicklime, and rice hulls for a long time - up to several months. This causes the yolk to become dark green or grey, with a creamy consistency and a scent of sulphur and ammonia, and the white to take on a dark brown shade and the form of translucent jelly with a subtle salty flavour. The delicacy is said to have been discovered around 600 years ago during the Ming Dynasty, when a homeowner from Huhan province indulged in the duck eggs he found had been sitting in a shallow pool of slaked lime in his garden for two months. For breakfast the Century eggs are often served with pork and rice that has been cooked similarly to risotto.

The tripe soup is cooked in a broth with a red chilli pepper base and accompanied by lime, chopped onions, coriander, crushed oregano and chillies. The soupy concoction takes anywhere between four to seven hours to make and is usually enjoyed on special occasions. Alongside the honeycomb tripe it also contains libro tripe, which has a ruffled appearance and can be chewy in texture, along with beef hooves and tendons. Guinea pigs are a popular protein in South America and have been served as meals in Peru, Bolivia and parts of Columbia for thousands of years. The furry animals contain more protein and less cholesterol than beef, pork or chicken. Roasted guinea pigs are usually marinated before being slow roasted. The meat itself is said to be gamey and similar in taste to rabbit meat.","Weird and wonderful breakfasts from around the world revealed .

"It is billed as the future of transport, a vehicle that can transport without the need to drive. Google today revealed the first fully working prototype of its driverless car. The first version came under fire for looking like a toy car - and a new rooftop sensor means the second now looks like a toy police car. Scroll down for video . The first fully working version of Google's self-driving car has been revealed - and the firm promises it will be on California's road next year. 'Today we’re unwrapping the best holiday gift we could’ve imagined: the first real build of our self-driving vehicle prototype,' the firm said. 'The vehicle we unveiled in May  was an early mockup—it didn’t even have real headlights! 'Since then, we’ve been working on different prototypes-of-prototypes, each designed to test different systems of a self-driving car—for example, the typical “car” parts like steering and braking, as well as the “self-driving” parts like the computer and sensors. 'We’ve now put all those systems together in this fully functional vehicle—our first complete prototype for fully autonomous driving. Google said it will be testing the car on its own tracks over Christmas, and hopes to use them on roads next year. 'We’re going to be spending the holidays zipping around our test track, and we hope to see you on the streets of Northern California in the new year. 'Our safety drivers will continue to oversee the vehicle for a while longer, using temporary manual controls as needed while we continue to test and learn.' Earlier this month Google said it had made the cars more aggressive. After testing its autonomous vehicles over 700,000 miles of public road, Google's engineers have tweaked the software that controls the cars to give them a slightly more aggressive edge. The first version of Google's self driving car, which was revealed in March. Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to  begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. The cars are also expected to be electric, capable of going 100 miles (160 km) before needing to be recharging. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in an attempt to be safer for pedestrians. The prototypes are restricted to speeds of 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. But ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service, using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. This means that Google's cars will inch forward at junctions, particularly those with four-way intersections, to get through ahead of other drivers. The car will also drive closer to the vehicle in front than is recommended in the Highway Code, in an attempt to avoid other motorists from cutting dangerously in front of them. While this distance is recommended to give humans time to react to hazards and time to stop, experts say autonomous vehicles can react immediately and so drive closer together. 'We found that we actually need to be - not aggressive - but assertive,' Nathaniel Fairfield, technical leader of a team that writes software fixes for the vehicles, told the San Jose Mercury. 'If you're always yielding and conservative, basically everybody will just stomp on you all day.' Google has been testing a fleet of retrofitted driverless vehicles on roads around the US with a team of safety drivers who sit behind the wheel ready to take over should anything go wrong. Earlier this year the company also unveiled a new compact version of its car without a steering wheel. Google tested converted hybrid cars (pictured) over 700,000 miles on public roads in California and has tweaked its software to reduce gaps between vehicles to avoid other drivers from cutting in front of the car . It is planning to build around 100 of these prototype vehicles, and will begin testing them on the roads in the US, but they are not expected to be commercially available until at least 2017. The first driverless vehicles are due to begin appearing on British roads in January next year in three trials to be held in busy city centre environments. However, some experts have raised concerns about the safety implications of putting autonomous vehicles on the road with human drivers. A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars. Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly. The findings will raise fears that drivers may adopt other aggressive driving styles if they see Google's driverless vehicles behaving more assertively. However, Google has also been teaching its vehicles how to drive more safely by giving them instructions on 'defensive driving' styles. Brian Torcellini, driving program manager who has been overseeing testing on the Google self-driving car project, said: 'When our car drives more naturally it makes people in the car and those driving around us feel more comfortable and safe. 'One of the things you will notice a good defensive driver does is avoid other people's blind spots, knowing that it is unsafe to be somewhere where another driver cannot see you. 'Our car didn't always used to do this we thought that it would be a good feature to implement into the software to make our car a good defensive driver.' He added that they have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles 'body language' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are. 'We're now trying to teach the car different ways to sort of fit in with society and the way that other people drive,' he said. Most of the tests on Google's cars have been conducted around its headquarters in Mountain View in California in converted Lexus hybrid cars equipped with radar, video cameras and rooftop laser to sense the world around them. Google claims that none of its vehicles have yet to get a traffic ticket or to be involved in an accident, although there was one accident when a human driver took over control.","First version came under fire for looking like a toy car with 'bug' lights .

A bomb disposal unit observes the engine of the van left at the scene in Nantes where dozens were injured . While initial reports claimed the man had shouted 'God is greatest' in Arabic before driving into the stand, local authorities dismissed suggestions it was terrorist-related. Up to 10 people 'went flying' when the car ploughed into the mulled wine stand, a police source said. Local prosecutor Brigitte Lamy said ther was no 'evidence of any religious motive'. The man, who stabbed himself after ploughing into pedestrians, is being treated at University Hospital in Nantes along with those run over.

"An ancient relationship between fins and fingers has been discovered by palaeontologists. The experts claim to have unravelled the evolutionary changes needed for ancient lobe-finned fish to turn underwater pectoral fins into strong, bony structures. Until now, scientists were unsure exactly how this happened, but the latest research shows that certain species of fish have the genes needed to turn fins into wrists, fingers, ankles and toes. By studying the genes of a fish called the spotted gar, scientists have discovered  genetic 'switches' (shown in green) in  transgenic fish fins, meaning it has the potential to evolve into fingers and wrists. This image shows a view of a transgenic zebrafish pectoral fish fin with cell nuclei in blue and gene activity in green . ‘Fossils show that the wrist and digits clearly have an aquatic origin,' said Dr Neil Shubin of the University of Chicago. 'But fins and limbs have different purposes. Scientists wanted to study how the extinct Tiktaalik roseae lead to tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl in water or on land. They began by attempting to compare the shape of fins and limb bones, but these tests proved unsuccessful. They then put the genes of a fish known as the spotted gar into developing mice. These genes, which control how the gar develops its fins, were found to cause patterns of activity that were 'nearly indistinguishable from those driven by the mouse genome'. Put simply, they discovered that the tiny radial bones in bony fish fins, and the fingers or toes of tetrapods are remarkably similar. And it was the presence and evolution of this type of gene that led the fins to turn into fingers. ‘They have evolved in different directions since they diverged. 'We wanted to explore, and better understand, their connections by adding genetic and molecular data to what we already know from the fossil record.’ In particular, the scientists wanted to study how the extinct  Tiktaalik roseae enabled emerging tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl in shallow water or on land. The Tiktaalik rosae was a lobe-finned fish that lived in the late Devonian period, but had features similar to four-legged animals. They began by attempting to compare the shape of fins and limb bones, but these tests proved unsuccessful. A limb is split into three sections - stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod. A stylopod, for example, contains the humerus and femur, the zeugopod is the ulna and radius, and the autopod contains the wrist and fingers. Prehistoric fish, such as the Tiktaalik roseae (fossil pictured), whose fins were strong, bony structures, led to the evolution of emerging emerging tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl in shallow water or on land, but until now, experts have been unsure how this happened . US experts have found that a freshwater fish called the spotted gar (stock image), has the basic genetics to evolve an autopod, comprising wrists and fingers or ankles and toes . The Tiktaalik rosae was a lobe-finned fish that lived in the late Devonian period, but had features similar to four-legged animals. A Tiktaalik roseae fossil was discovered in 2004. It represents the best-known transitional species between fish and land-dwelling tetrapods. A fish with a broad flat head and sharp teeth, Tiktaalik looked like a cross between a fish and a crocodile. It had gills, scales and fins, but also had tetrapod-like features such as a mobile neck, robust ribcage and primitive lungs. In particular, its large forefins had shoulders, elbows and partial wrists, which allowed it to support itself on ground. The autopod differs to most fins because the wrist is composed of a series of small nodular bones, followed by longer thin bones. In contrast, the bones that make up the fins of modern fish look different, with a set of longer bones ending in small circular bones called radials. The primary genes that shape the bones are known as the HoxD and HoxA clusters, and these also differ between limbs and fins, according to the study in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The researchers first tested the ability of genetic switches that control the genes in teleosts - a type of fish - to shape the limbs of developing mice. They found that the fish control switches did not trigger any activity in the autopod, or mouse in general. After deciding that teleost fish were not suitable for the study, they inserted genes from the gar fish into developing mice instead. This time, the researchers discovered that the gar switches caused patterns of activity that were 'nearly indistinguishable from those driven by the mouse genome'. The  autopod-building genetic switches from gar are able to drive gene activity (shown in purple) in the digits of transgenic mice - an activity that was not spotted in any other fish groups studied . In January, the same group of researchers announced that the evolution of hind legs began as enhanced fins. They studied the fossil of the Tiktaalik roseae (illustrated) which is thought was able to 'walk' and support itself on the ground with the aid of extra functional, strong 'fins' In January, researchers found that the evolution of hind legs began as enhanced fins. They discovered a well-preserved pelvis and fin from a 375 million-year-old fossil of the Tiktaalik roseae. The find challenged the theory that large, mobile hind appendages were developed only after vertebrates transitioned to land. Previous theories, based on the best available data, propose that a shift occurred from ""front-wheel drive"" locomotion in fish to more of a ""four-wheel drive"" in tetrapods. But experts now claim this shift actually began to happen in fish, not in limbed animals. For example, the team discovered the Tiktaalik's pelvic girdle was nearly identical in size to its shoulder girdle. It had a prominent ball and socket hip joint, which connected to a highly mobile femur. Crests on the hip for muscle attachment indicated strength and advanced fin function. And although no femur bone was found, pelvic fin material - including long fin rays - indicate the hind fin was at least as long as its forefin. More than 300 million years ago, after fish-like creatures that would become tetrapods split off from other bony fish, a common ancestor of the teleost lineage went through a whole-genome duplication (WGD) - a phenomenon that has occurred multiple times in evolution. By doubling the entire genetic repertoire of teleost fish, this WGD phenomenon provided the creatures with enormous diversification potential. Experts think this helped teleosts to adapt, over time, to a variety of environments across the globe. Graduate student Andrew Gehrke, who led the study, explained: ‘In the process, the genetic switches that control autopod-building genes were able to drift and shuffle, allowing them to change some of their function, as well as making them harder to identify in comparisons to other animals, such as mice. ‘Not all bony fishes went through the whole genome duplication, however,’ he said. ‘The spotted gar, a primitive freshwater fish native to North America, split off from teleost fishes before the WGD.’ When the scientists compared Hox gene switches from the spotted gar with tetrapods, they found ‘an unprecedented level of ‘deep conservation of the vertebrate autopod regulatory apparatus.’ Put simply, they discovered that the tiny radial bones in bony fish fins, and the fingers or toes of tetrapods are remarkably similar. Mr Gehrke said: ‘Overall, our results provide regulatory support for an ancient origin of the ""late"" phase of Hox expression that is responsible for building the autopod.’","Prehistoric fish, such as the Tiktaalik roseae, whose fins were strong, led to  emerging tetrapods - animals with limbs - to crawl onto land .
Until now, scientists have been unsure exactly how this happened .
Research shows certain fish have the genes needed to turn fins into wrists, fingers, ankles and toes .
They tracked how these fish genes changed how mice grew limbs ."
"More than six months after his death, Casey Kasem has finally been laid to rest, reports say. The body of the legendary DJ was buried last Tuesday at Vestre Gravlund in Norway after months of his remains going unburied amid accusations of murder, fraud, and mistreatment of the famed American Top 40 Countdown DJ, TMZ reports. It is unclear whether Jean Kasem, Kasem's wife of more than 30 years, was at the funeral, TMZ reports, but the children were not. In fact, Kasem's children didn't know that he had been buried until Monday. Rest: Six months after his death, the body of Casey Kasem has been buried in a cemetery in Norway . Funeral: Kasem's body was buried at Vestre Gravlund,  the largest cemeteries in Norway . Vestre Gravlund: Photographed is the Vestre Gravlund, some speculate that Jean took Kasem's body to Norway to avoid the LAPD . The ceremony was reportedly a small one, according to Los Angeles Mercury News. Kasem, who voiced the character 'Shaggy' in Scooby-Doo, died in June at the age of 82. When his health deteriorated, especially during the star's final year, the warring between Kasem's wife and his children from his first marriage began. Jean forbid anyone from seeing Kasem, this spawned a series of court proceedings, public jabs, and accusations. Soon, the ordeal became an international spectacle. Recently the slew of Casey Kasem headlines have focused on his widow, Jean. The Los Angeles Police Department is conducting an elder abuse investigation due to claims by Kasem's children that Jean took the elderly man on a joy ride one month before his death, resulting in Kasem getting a fatal infection. Jean: The Los Angeles Police Department is investigation Kasem's wife Jean (left) for elder abuse . Kerri:The battle between Kasem's wife and his family began when Jean did not allow his children, including his daughter Kerri Kasem (photographed) to see him . Forbes reports that Kasem's family hoped to have Kasem buried in California, but some speculate that Jean had her late husband's body taken to Norway in an attempt to avoid returning to California where the investigation is being conducted. For most of a year, Casey Kasem's name has been pinned to feuds and accusations, and with matters of insurance policies and an investigation still at hand, the battle may be far from over. However, at least the beloved star has finally been laid to rest.

Oldest swinger in town: In celebration of today's milestone, Colo was treated to a cake made of peanut butter, applesauce, honey, shredded carrots and Greek yogurt frosting . The party was broadcast live to online viewers from her enclosure. Dozens of visitors watched on as she tucked into her dessert before opening presents of tomatoes and clementines. She was also serenaded by zoo staff. Audra Meinelt, an assistant curator at the park who has helped care for Colo for 18 years, said that the primate is a great fan of birthdays and loves the attention. 'She knows the whole day is about her,' Meinelt told The Columbus Dispatch. Flashback: The mother-of-three was born on December 22 1956 at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio . Global sensation: Her ground-breaking birth made headlines worldwide . The average lifespan for female gorillas in captivity is around 35 years, making Colo the oldest swinger going. Although she is in good health now, she was given three months to live at the age of six when she was hit by tuberculosis. Following treatment, she made a remarkable recovery. She has outlived two of her children, nine of her 16 grandchildren, two of her ten great-grandchildren and one of her three great-great-grandchildren. Commenting on Colo's current condition, Meinelt said: She does not appear to have a single bit of trouble with her eyes or ears. 'Mostly, she has arthritis in her hands and feet.'

"North Korea has suffered one of its worst ever internet outages, just days after Barack Obama warned of a 'proportional response' to the Sony hacking. The US State Department suggested on Monday that America may be behind the virtual attack. Very few people in the country have access to the internet, with connections often failing. However, the continuous problems reportedly being experienced led experts to raise the possibility that it might be under a cyber attack. Scroll down for video . North Korea, led by Kim Jong Un (right), suffered one of its worst ever internet outages just days after U.S. President Barack Obama (left) warned of a 'proportional response' to the Sony hacking . Deputy State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf reminded a reporter on Monday of Obama's threat to take action against North Korea while responding to a general question about the possibility that the country was undergoing a cyber assault . A spokesperson for State lent credence to the theory on Monday when she reminded a reporter of Obama's threat while responding to a general question about the possibility that North Korea was undergoing a cyber assault. 'As the president said, we are considering a range of options in response,' deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said. 'We aren’t going to discuss, publicly, operational details about the possible response options — or comment on those types of reports in any way — except to say that as we implement those responses some will be seen, some may not be seen.' She added, 'So I can’t confirm those reports, but in general, that’s what the president has spoken to.' For nine hours on Monday, the hermit regime went completely offline. 'It's as if North Korea got erased from the global map of the Internet,' Matthew Prince, president of internet security company CloudFlare, told CNN. The outage followed President Obama's public shaming of North Korea on Friday after the U.S. government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at Sony Pictures over the studio's new film, The Interview, which depicts the assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. Doug Madory, director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research, said the internet connectivity problems were discovered in the last 24 hours and had gotten progressively worse to the point that 'North Korea's totally down.' Internet connection was restored after nine hours on Monday. Madory said one benign explanation for the problem might be that a router suffered a software glitch, though a cyber-attack involving North Korea's Internet service was also a possibility. 'I haven't seen such a steady beat of routing instability and outages in KP before,' he told North Korea Tech. 'Usually there are isolated blips, not continuous connectivity problems. I wouldn't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack presently.' The outage comes just days after President Obama's public shaming of North Korea after the U.S. government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at Sony Pictures . Although very few citizens in North Korea have access to the internet, it allows the country's state media to link to the outside world. The communist state's internet access is wired through China, which today, in a foreign ministry statement, said it 'opposes cyber attacks and cyber terrorism in all of its forms,' without referring directly to its ally North Korea. The instability is in North Korea's main link, which runs through the northern Chinese city of Shenyang. Madory said this applied to North Korea's main Internet connection via Chinese company China Unicom, although it was possible the country had limited connection via satellite. 'All I can say is that in the last 24 hours, their communications have been degraded to a point where they are unable to communicate,' he said. 'They have disappeared from the global Internet presently.' Dyn Research monitors Internet performance though live feeds of router tables from about 450 telecommunications providers worldwide. Madory said North Korea's Internet connection has historically been stable, although it has come under attack in the past, including during a period of high tension with South Korea in 2013. He said there were a lot of players - including potentially teenage hackers - who could mount a 'distributed denial-of-service' cyber attack on North Korea, if this were the cause of the outages. 'It doesn't need to be some big nation state,' he added. Another Internet technology service, Arbor Networks, which protects companies against hacker attacks, said its monitoring had detected denial-of-service attacks aimed at North Korea's infrastructure, which started on Saturday and continued into today. Such attacks transmit so much spurious data traffic to Internet equipment that it becomes overwhelmed, until the attacks stop or the spurious traffic can be filtered and discarded to allow normal connections to resume. Washington has accused Pyongyang of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused Sony executives to halt the debut of the comedy action film 'The Interview' It is not immediately clear if the connectivity problems were an act of retribution for the hack that the FBI last week linked to North Korea. Distributed denial-of-service attacks are a relatively unsophisticated type of cyber warfare, in which a targeted computer system is bombarded with traffic, rendering it temporarily useless. Asked about the internet problems, North Korean diplomat Kim Song, said: 'I have no information.' Washington has accused Pyongyang of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused Sony executives to halt the debut of the The Interview. According to the FBI, there is 'significant overlap' between the Sony Pictures attack and other 'malicious cyber-activity' with direct links to Pyongyang, including an attack last year on South Korean banks blamed on the North. The hackers behind the attack on Sony Pictures said they were incensed by the comedy, and the studio pulled the film from distribution after major U.S. cinema chains declined to exhibit it. The film about a fictional CIA plot to kill the country's leader infuriated North Korea, although Pyongyang has repeatedly denied it was behind the cyber assault. Despite calls from Republican critics for a robust response to the alleged hack, Obama told CNN in an interview that aired on Sunday: 'I don't think it was an act of war. I think it was an act of cyber vandalism that was very costly, very expensive. We take it very seriously.' He also promised to 'review' the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and potentially re-add North Korea, but added: 'We've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism. And we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day.' The White House declined to comment today and Harf refused to confirm or deny that North Korea had lost internet access because of a cyber attack. North Korea has threatened to hit back at the White House and other U.S. targets if it was sanctioned over the alleged hacking. Today Harf said of those threats: 'We have no specific credible threat information that leads credence to these reports.' 'Obviously, we take very seriously any threats to U.S. citizens, to U.S. companies, regardless of what that threat looks like.' North Korea's National Defense Commission, in a statement on the official news agency, said the country's army and people 'are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels.' Meanwhile, South's Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co (KHNP) began conducting drills at its four nuclear plant complexes today after a series of online information leaks by a suspected hacker. The hacker, using an account entitled 'president of the anti-nuclear reactor group', published a variety of information on Twitter, including designs and manuals for two reactors as well as personal information on some 10,000 KHNP employees. There did not appear to be any link between the drill and the Sony Pictures hack, and North Korea says it has never attempted or made a cyber attack on South Korea.","Continuous problems could mean North Korea was under cyber attack .

"A 15-year-old girl who suffered horrific injuries after being attacked by a bear only survived because she remembered to 'play dead.' Leah Reeder, 15, sustained deep bites and gouges to her legs, back, neck and face, after the attack on Sunday in Eastpoint, Franklin County, on Florida's panhandle. She was out walking her dog at 6pm when the bear suddenly appeared and tackled her. Leah Reeder, 15, sustained deep bites and gouges to her legs, back, neck and face, after the attack on Sunday in Eastpoint, Franklin County, on Florida's panhandle . 'I was listening to music and I heard my dog start barking. It was like a black blur,' she told Apalach Times from her hospital bed. She said the bear pushed her down, and she rolled on to her front side and started screaming. 'I guess nobody heard me,' she said. 'After I realized nobody was coming, I stopped screaming, and it started dragging me to the ditch. She was out walking her dog at 6pm when the bear suddenly appeared and tackled her. Pictured: Investigators at the scene of the attack . Wildlife officials are now looking for the bear. They have used a dog to track the scent of the bear from the teen's clothes . 'It lost its grip on my jacket and fell in the ditch and got up and ran away.' Leah was able to stagger a block back to where she was staying with her father. He found her in an immense state of distress and called 911 - poor weather conditions hampered a helicopter so she was transported via road. Her mother Sheri Mann told the website: 'It bit her face open, and beside her ear on her scalp.' 'It was very, very bad.' 'Even as I sit here now, I can't believe it happened,' Mann said. Leah has now undergone plastic surgery to help repair the damage caused by the bear . 'The bears are all over the place, and I know how hard I would fight to protect my kids, but a momma bear can do so much more damage than me with just one swipe.' 'She managed to crack a few smiles at me before she went in for surgery,' Mann told WMBB. Wildlife officials are now looking for the bear. They have using a dog to track the scent of the bear from the teen's clothes. It was the third bear attack in the region this year. Stan Kirkland, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said FWC officials put in two live 'culvert' traps in the vicinity last night, and planned to install two more today, in an effort to catch bears and euthanize them. 'It's an assumption that it's an adult animal. That's all we know at this point,' said Kirkland. 'It is likely we will catch more than one bear. 'Public safety is paramount,' he said. 'We will likely euthanize any adult bears that we catch. One of the things we want to do is have the public know we have removed the bear. 'We will in all likelihood be removing numerous animals,' he said. 'We're an agency that is all about fish and wildlife, and we want a robust animal population. But when you have animals like that that can hurt someone, we're going to err on the side (of caution). We want the community to feel safe.'","Leah Reeder, 15, sustained deep bites and gouges to her legs, back, neck and face .

"Amy Archer Gilligan (pictured) died in 1962 . A  writer telling the story of a serial killer who inspired the play and 1944 movie 'Arsenic and Old Lace' is hoping the Connecticut Supreme Court will order records related to her incarceration in a state mental hospital to be opened. Ron Robillard, an East Hartford author writing a book about the killer, Amy Archer Gilligan, is far from certain he'll win the order though. Robillard made his first request for public records in 2010 about her years in a Connecticut psychiatric hospital. She was confined there in 1924 after she poisoned a resident of her nursing home with arsenic and lived there until her death in 1962. After moving through lower courts for the last few years, the state Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing for Jan. 14. 'I'm keeping my fingers crossed,' Robillard said. 'I'm not real optimistic.' He initially filed a complaint with the Freedom of Information Commission, saying the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services violated the state Freedom of Information Act by denying his request for Gilligan's psychiatric and medical records. Scroll down for video . 'You never hear her voice,' said Robillard, a retired newspaper reporter and editor. 'She never testified, she was never interviewed... you never get in her head.' The state Freedom of Information Commission said Gilligan's psychiatric records were confidential under state law, which prohibits communications and records related to a patient's mental condition from being disclosed without consent. Cary Grant and Priscilla Lane pictured in the 1944 film 'Arsenic and Old Lace' However, the commission said Gilligan's privacy rights terminated on her death. 'Because Gilligan was an infamous arsenic murderess,' her medical records were related to legitimate matters of public concern, according to court papers. The Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services appealed and a court rejected its claim that the psychiatrist-patient privilege of state law applies to any record generated at a mental health facility, including Gilligan's. But the judge agreed with the agency that most of Gilligan's medical records were exempt from disclosure. The Freedom of Information Commission appealed, claiming the trial court substituted its judgment for its determination that disclosing Gilligan's medical records would be an invasion of personal privacy. Robillard said he's puzzled by the state's insistence that records dating back more than half a century may not be made public. Gilligan has no surviving family members, he said, citing the 1968 death of her daughter, who did not have children. 'Who's going to be hurt by the release of this?' he asked. The 1944 film starred Oscar-winner Cary Grant and Priscilla Lane.","Writer Ron Robillard is seeking information on killer Amy Archer Gilligan for his book .

"CLICK HERE to read what five things Arsenal need to do to finish in the top four . Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko is emerging as a strong contender to fill Arsenal's defensive midfield role. Arsene Wenger has had his eye on a new holding midfielder since the summer and, despite the fact he usually plays in an advanced role for Newcastle, Sissoko features highly on Arsenal's list of targets. The Gunners have a budget of around £20million to spend next month and are prioritising a new defender when the transfer window reopens. Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko (centre) could be a January target for his 'favourite club' Arsenal . Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has around £20million to spend on defensive reinforcements . But the club's money-men are willing to stretch the budget in order to sign a defensive-minded midfielder too, and could stretch to as much as £16million for Sissoko. Wenger has already admitted he is ready to spend if the right players become available. Sissoko said earlier this month: 'I have ambition. My goal is to play at the best clubs, playing the Champions League, win trophies, but today I am a Magpie and I am very happy. 'Arsenal were my favourite club when I was young and my idol was Patrick Vieira. I have always loved this club and I still love them.' Arsenal are also interested Ipswich's £10million-rated defender Tyrone Mings (right) In addition to Sissoko, the Gunners are targeting a move for Ipswich Town defender Tyrone Mings. But Ipswich's £10million valuation is proving a stumbling block towards a January deal. Wenger, who has already admitted his interest in Mings, views the 21-year-old as a long-term central defender - even though he plays at left-back for Ipswich at the moment. If the Gunners can negotiate a lower fee for Mings, then could afford Sissoko as well next month.","Moussa Sissoko has emerged as a January target for Arsenal .

"Two days after being sacked as England's one-day cricket captain, Alastair Cook put his troubles behind him to return to sporting action – and duly showed his prowess by scoring two superb centuries with ease. The only problem was that he was doing so with a dart not a bat in his hand – and, in a far cry from the pristine surroundings of Lord's, the audience he was playing to was full of drunk punters wearing Christmas jumpers…as well as a couple of reindeer in the stands. The 29-year-old, who is still England's Test captain, took to the Alexandra Palace stage in north London on Monday evening, shortly before the start of  day five of the World Darts Championship, for an entertaining 'challenge' match with England fast bowler James Anderson.

'I scored a 100 up there – and it's the first time I have done that on TV for a while. It was amazing up there but my legs were shaking.'

What the English cricket authorities could not have anticipated was that the match would take place days after the decision to demote Cook from the World Cup squad and strip him of the captaincy because of his poor scoring form. Nonetheless, Cook, who is 30 on Christmas day, still turned up to participate. He did the full walk-on, wearing a T-shirt with 'Alastair 'Bed n Breakfast' Cook' emblazed on his back. Anderson rightly used the moniker 'The Swinger'. Cook admitted to being nervous on the Alexandra Palace stage to the point where his legs were shaking . Anderson and Cook regularly play darts while on a cricket tour with England . In the practice room beforehand, Cook had achieved a 13-dart leg and he brought that form to the oche. Throwing with his right, despite being a left-handed batsman, Cook scored a 100 and 140 – and despite missing seven darts at double 13 he eventually sealed the match with a double 11 attempt. Cook might not be playing at the Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February – but perhaps the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt in the summer would be a viable option instead. The pair shake hands after their contest on Monday night at the World Darts Championships in London .","England cricket team-mates play each other in darts challenge .

"After half an hour, Jonas Gutierrez gave chase to a teenage winger, hunting him down before sliding in the rain and hooking the ball from his young opponent. It drew the biggest cheer of an uplifting afternoon. For while he may have gained a little weight and lost a little pace, his fighting spirit is stronger than ever. It was the same spirit which proved the inspiration in his battle with testicular cancer. Twice Gutierrez has fought the illness. Twice he has won. Jonas Gutierrez has targeted a return to Newcastle's first-team after overcoming testicular cancer .

Gutierrez has now successfully beaten cancer on two occasions after getting the all-clear in early November . Gutierrez was included in Newcastle's Under 21 side to face West Ham on Monday afternoon . Jonas Gutierrez discovered that he had cancer after a challenge with Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna in May this year. He revealed that he was receiving treatment for the disease in September, before announcing that he had been given the all-clear in early November. The 31-year-old ran the Buenos Aries marathon in October to raise money for Argentine cancer charity FUCA (Foundation for Research, Teaching and Cancer Prevention). On Monday, after more than a year away from a football pitch, he returned. Nearly 1,000 well-wishers – including Newcastle skipper Fabricio Coloccini and Sunderland boss Gus Poyet, whose son Diego was playing for West Ham - were at Whitley Park to see the 31-year-old lead out United’s under-21 side. And Gutierrez, who underwent chemotherapy earlier this year, says he is stronger for the experience, targeting a return to Alan Pardew’s senior side. ‘I really enjoyed being back in my first game after all of my treatment,’ he said. ‘It was a hard time but now I’m happy to be back to train with the lads and play for the Under-21s to get fit and play for the first-team if I can. ‘When you have a problem like cancer, other problems are really, really small. ‘The most important thing is that I won that game, that battle, which was really, really hard. I don’t know what is going to happen in the future. I can only think about the present and to try to my best. ‘It has made me stronger. I am proud to be back. I thank all the fans who have helped me through my illness. ‘Since my problem they have been with me all of the time, sending me messages. I have to say thank you for all of that support.’ Gutierrez winks at the camera as he leads out Newcastle's Under 21 side ahead of kick-off at Whitley Park .

Newcastle reserve-team boss Peter Beardsley kept Gutierrez on the field until three minutes from the end, affording him a standing ovation and ensuring he had helped to see home a 4-1 victory. Beardsley admits it was an emotional day. ‘It was an honour to be part of his first game back,’ he said. ‘I made him captain and, it sounds stupid, but he said thank you when I gave him the armband. ‘He's a perfect example to the young lads. He has played in the World Cup and is different class. It's great for him to be here. ‘He's brilliant with the lads, brilliant on and off the pitch and a great personality. The reaction of the crowd was brilliant and they were all here for him. He got a great response from them at the end. ‘It's the manager's call when he plays again (for the first-team), but I would be delighted to have him with us for ever.’ Fellow Argentine Coloccini watched from the touchline with his own family and Gutierrez’s father. And Gutierrez said: ‘Colo is like part of my family. We have had a lot of years in Newcastle together. He always knew about my situation and he gave me a lot of support. It is something really special that I have with Fabricio and our families.’ On Monday, Gutierrez was welcomed back into his footballing family.

"Karl Oyston has apologised for branding a Blackpool fan 'a retard'. Oyston has come in for strong criticism over the last 36 hours after a series of texts he sent to supporter Stephen Smith were published on the Tangerine Knights' website. The Blackpool chairman became embroiled in a furious row with Smith, branding him 'a retard' and telling him to 'enjoy the rest of your special needs day out'. Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign after abusive text messages sent to his paying fans . After being criticised by Blackpool fans and a number of organisations, Oyston responded by issuing an apology on the Blackpool website on Monday afternoon. 'I would like to unreservedly apologise for any offence or distress caused by my text responses reported in the media recently,' Oyston said in a statement. Sportsmail understands that while there is no FA investigation underway, one could follow, even though he sits on the Football League’s board of directors. Supporter Steve Smith was labelled a 'retard' and ‘intellectual cripple’ by Oyston, whose beleaguered side lost 6-1 at home against Bournemouth on Saturday and are bottom of the Championship. Oyston has issued an apology for 'any offence or distress caused by my text responses' Blackpool manager Lee Clark looks on during his side's 6-1 defeat to Bournemouth on Saturday . One rant from Oyston, who had abuse hurled at him as well, read: ‘Stop texting f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. ‘You are banned because I think you are a p****. ‘Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.’ Oyston has also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: ‘I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission’. Smith wants the FA and Football League to take action. ‘The texts are disgusting, politically incorrect and show that Karl needs to be put through the fit and proper person’s test. Let’s not forget he is supposed to be a figurehead in football,’ he said. ‘Karl treats this club like a cash cow and has no interest in what happens on the pitch. I did a radio interview recently and the presenter told me not one person rang in to support Karl. ‘His position is untenable. He’s been untouchable for years and the FA haven’t done anything about his actions.’ Harry Arter shoots and scores for Bournemouth with Blackpool rooted to the bottom of the Championship . Ismail Kaji, who has a learning disability and works for the charity Mencap, said that the ‘disgusting’ language made him ‘sick’. ‘I would feel ashamed however to support any football club that has a chairman who uses such disgusting language to people with a disability,’ he said. ‘This language is just as bad as using racist or homophobic words. There is no difference and it makes me sick.’ The FA say they are ‘aware of the matter’ while the Football League offered no comment. Blackpool were unavailable for comment.

"CIA manuals offering tips to help spies maintain their cover while using false documents as they crossed international borders have been released by Wikleaks. The two documents, dating from 2011 and 2012, are marked classified and 'NOFORN,' which means they were not meant to be shared with allied intelligence agencies, WikiLeaks said. The documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders. CIA manuals offering tips to help spies maintain their cover while using false documents as they crossed international borders have been released by Wikleaks . Some are obvious -  don't buy a one-way ticket with cash the day before flying, although others are less so - don't look scruffy while traveling on a diplomatic passport. The manual states: 'Mental preparation almost certainly helps travelers pass secondary scrutiny.' The guide states that travelers who attract attention and appear suspicious qualify sentence meanings with 'words like “typically,” “normally,” “often,” “maybe,” or “almost” or phrases like “to be honest,” “the truth is,” or “swear to God.' There is a section devoted to baggage and lists reasons for detection including: . • Baggage or contents inconsistent with the passenger's appearance, profession, or ticket class . • An unexplained lack of baggage probably would raise suspicions. • Multiple new items, such as alarm clocks or notebooks, in baggage. • Carelessly packed baggage when passenger is purportedly an experienced business traveler. • Unopened and unmarked maps, guidebooks, or other literature. • Maps of unrelated cities in baggage for a purported tourist traveler. • Camera quality not matching the traveler's profile or camera memory card insufficient for a lengthy tourist trip. The documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders . The guide lists countries which look for certain types of travelers - for example it states Japanese customs officials pay attention to single, Western travelers  'because they may be drug couriers.' Similarly it states that in Tel Aviv, officials are on the look-out for 'military-aged males traveling alone with backpacks... regardless of their nationality or skin color. In one incident during transit of a European airport in the early morning, security officials selected a CIA officer for secondary screening,' one of the documents reads. 'Although the officials gave no reason, overly casual dress inconsistent with being a diplomatic-passport holder may have prompted the referral.' The CIA agent involved went on to have his bag swabbed for explosives and it tested positive. Despite extensive questioning, he stuck to his cover story that he had been involved in counterterrorism training in the United States, and eventually was allowed to continue his journey. 'Consistent, well-rehearsed, and plausible cover is important for avoiding secondary selection and critical for surviving it,' the CIA wrote. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration' In a statement, WikiLeaks said this example 'begs the question: if the training that supposedly explained the explosives was only a cover story, what was a CIA officer really doing passing through (a European Union) airport with traces of explosives on him, and why was he allowed to continue?' One of the CIA documents, called 'Schengen Overview,' reveals that the CIA is very concerned about EU nations introducing biometric security measures for people traveling on US passports and that new systems pose an increased 'identity threat' - in other words, making it harder for agents to travel on false documents. The document focuses on the EU's Schengen area, a chunk of Europe in which travelers between 22 EU countries are no longer required to show passports. The CIA expressed concerns that a new EU security system will potentially make life harder for CIA agents. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration. These manuals show that under the Obama administration the CIA is still intent on infiltrating European Union borders and conducting clandestine operations in EU member states.' Sunday's release is the second in a series of CIA releases from WikiLeaks.","Two documents, dating from 2011 and 2012, are marked classified .

"England and Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley's latest Rugby Football Union disciplinary hearing will take place in London on Tuesday. Northampton look set to mount a robust defence of their captain after he was sent off for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face at Franklin's Gardens two days ago. VIDEO Scroll down to see Dylan Hartley meeting his inspirational childhood coach . England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Garden . Hartley could miss at least the start of England's RBS 6 Nations campaign following the latest episode in a career scarred by repeated disciplinary episodes. In a statement, the RFU said: 'Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints) will have his case heard by an RFU disciplinary judicial officer on Tuesday, December 23. 'Hartley was sent off in the Aviva Premiership match between Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers for striking Matt Smith with his elbow, contrary to Law 10.4(a). 'The case will be heard tomorrow evening in London by Jeremy Summers sitting as a sole judicial officer at a time to be confirmed.' Hartley (right) was adjudged to elbow Leicester's Matt Smith (left) before the pair had to be separated . Hartley cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue . April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps' James Haskell and Jonny O'Connor. March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain. March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test. June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain. December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster's Rory Best. May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing. December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester's Matt Smith. Hartley was handed a 26-week ban for eye-gouging in 2007, and an 11-week suspension for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the 2013 Aviva Premiership final against Leicester. That latter ban led to him missing the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, and the RFU could easily take a dim view of his latest indiscretion. It happened after just 17 minutes of a titanic east midlands derby that Northampton won 23-19. Referee J P Doyle initially seemed happy to award Hartley a yellow card, but television match official Sean Davey urged Doyle to watch further replays, and he responded by sending 61 times-capped Hartley off. 'It was disappointing,' Northampton rugby director Jim Mallinder said, speaking directly after the game. 'Dylan has got to keep his arms down, but he was being held and I don't know there was any malice in it. 'The nature of the game didn't justify a red card. I think Smith went down pretty easily, to be honest, which was disappointing. Vereniki Goneva touches down his second try during the 23-19 defeat at Northampton on Saturday . Ben Foden of Northampton plays the ball out of the ruck as the Saints prevailed 23-19 winners . England international Luther Burrell attempts to avoid the tackle of Owen Williams on Saturday afternoon . 'It is a tough game. That 80 minutes of rugby was hard, physical with some great tackles, but I don't think there was any malice in that. I think JP's initial reaction of the yellow card would have been the correct decision.' England open their Six Nations campaign against Wales in Cardiff on February 6, and given Hartley's poor record - biting and punching offences also appear on his charge-sheet - another lengthy suspension appears likely. 'It's a tough game, and Dylan plays to the edge. You wouldn't change Dylan. He is competitive,' Mallinder added. 'It is a difficult one. I think he should have kept his arms down - we are not saying that what he did was right - but what I am probably saying is that the opposition made it a lot easier, and a yellow card was sufficient.","Northampton captain sent off for elbowing Leicester's Matt Smith .

"Bayern Munich left Roma in ruins  as they handed Manchester City a lifeline in Group E and recorded their biggest-ever away win in the Champions League.

Two minutes later Gervinho could have drawn level. That is, if the ex-Arsenal player did not have Neuer to beat. The 27-year-old forward let the ball roll across his body before his low shot was instinctively palmed away by the German. The first of many. It was Germany hero Mario Gotze who doubled Bayern's lead after exchanging a tidy one-two with 2014 World Cup-winning team-mate Thomas Muller, and placing the ball in the bottom-left corner. Then a cross by defender Juan Bernat found the free head of Robert Lewandowski who, having drifted in behind Roma's Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, made it 3-0 with barely a quarter of the game gone. Five minutes later it was four. Robben unleashed a powerful strike looking to go across De Sanctis, only for the Roma goalkeeper to palm it into  his own net at the near post. It didn't help Roma that referee Jonas Eriksson from Sweden had zero sympathy. The official pointed to the spot after a handball by Kostas Manolas while sliding to intercept David Alaba's cross. Muller stepped up, slotted it to the right, and it was 5-0 at half time. Roma manager Rudi Garcia thought it best to put Cole out of his misery, and replaced the 33-year-old with Jose Holebas. The home faithful were shell-shocked but did not whistle or boo the team that sit second top of Serie A behind Juventus. After the break, Gervinho looked hell-bent on rewarding their support. The former Arsenal man hit the post from close range, before Neuer denied the ex-Lille forward with what can be ticked off as the save of the tournament so far. Miralem Pjanic's lofted ball from the left found Gervinho four yards out but his side-footed volley was smothered by the Bayern goalkeeper. Neuer spun in the process and diverted it away to safety. It was as breathtaking and instinctive a save the Champions League has seen, but Neuer's clean sheet was ruined five minutes later by the persistent Roma forward. A cross by Radja Nainggolan found Gervinho, whose header from point-blank range could not be stopped. In truth, it was the least the Ivory Coast international deserved.

"That’s the thing with Chelsea. They can do it on a mild Monday night in Stoke. Unseasonably warm. That is the bad news for those betting on a white Christmas this year. The good news for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea is that they will wake up on December 25 three points clear at the top of the Premier League table and playing like champions. For Mourinho, this is a very good omen. He has been in pole position at Christmas on seven occasions in his managerial career, and each time he has won the title; twice at Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan, once at Real Madrid. It is a stunning record. Cesc Fabregas slides on his knees to celebrate after his goal secured the win for Chelsea, who will be top on Christmas Day .

Mourinho is different, a front-runner. His campaigns start well, and on Monday night Chelsea looked the team to beat. Stoke were disappointing, but theirs was still a robust challenge, and plenty of good teams will lose here. This place hasn’t changed all that much from the Tony Pulis days, as Eden Hazard’s battered legs will confirm. Stoke present a significant physical challenge and it is easy to see why teams with fainter hearts have a problem here. At Anfield on Sunday, Arsenal couldn’t find a defender who wanted to head away a 96th-minute Liverpool corner; Chelsea often had two men jumping to make the same clearance. There are stronger attacking forces than Stoke, but this was still an impressive rearguard action, seeing off a second-half bombardment. Chelsea scored after two minutes. That is a hell of a long time to defend a 1-0 lead away from home. Stoke rode their luck, could have given away a penalty when Ryan Shawcross fouled Cesc Fabregas, and Chelsea had the best chances of the night. But Mark Hughes’s men were still in there fighting until 12 minutes from the end. Hughes upped the tempo and the ante with substitutions and every half-chance brought a mighty roar. Chelsea sucked it all up, and then swatted Stoke away with a second goal to put the match beyond reach. Fabregas made certain of victory with a goal that had a small degree of good fortune, but it was no more than he and Chelsea deserved. His build-up play with Hazard was typically precise, but he took the finish off the toes of Diego Costa and seemed to scuff his shot, which squirmed in at the far post. Stoke had the odd shot from range but the stadium was mute and half-empty by the end. Chelsea are too smart and too good to lay on a grandstand finish. They more than had the measure of Stoke. The goal that set them on their way came from the first attack of the game. A lovely move saw Fabregas feed Hazard and the ball slipped to Branislav Ivanovic on the overlap, his shot charged down, but winning a corner. Fabregas curled it in and had Geoff Cameron kept his eyes on the delivery, he may have been in a better position to head it away. Instead he had decided to enter Strictly Come Grappling with Terry, in and out of hold, nice top line, Len would have loved it. Terry then spoiled the routine by ignoring his partner and heading the ball past Asmir Begovic in Stoke’s goal. John Terry rises to beat Geoff Cameron to the ball and give Chelsea the lead after just two minutes at the Britannia Stadium . The Chelsea captain is mobbed by his team-mates after giving his side the lead from Cesc Fabregas's corner kick . Terry's goal was his 58th for the club and his 35th goals in the Barclays Premier League . It could have been more were it not for the unlikeliest sight — two sitters missed by the fearsome Costa, one in each half. The first came in the 32nd minute when a full-blooded tackle by the outstanding Nemanja Matic sent the ball into the path of Fabregas. He thought quickly and played it into Costa, who beat the offside trap and sped towards goal. At the start of the season you would have put your house on him scoring, but Costa steered his low finish narrowly wide of the far post.The second was teed up nicely by Andre Schurrle with seven minutes remaining. Costa was spare at the far post, but Begovic smothered. Even factoring in these errors, it was still a mightily impressive win. Chelsea have the stuff of champions right now and in Matic, Fabregas and Hazard three of the most important footballers in the English game. Matic was voted man of the match and understandably so given the battle in the heart of the pitch, but Fabregas is on course to break Thierry Henry’s record of 20 assists in a Premier League season, and Hazard was simply the bravest soul out there. Stoke tried to kick him into submission, and failed. He never stopped taking them on, never stopped probing, teasing, testing them to the limit. By the time his brutal treatment saw him limp down the tunnel, injury-time was being played and the match was won. Yet Hazard deserved better from referee Neil Swarbrick; indeed, the same could be said for good footballers everywhere. Hazard, who was a threat all night on the left wing for Chelsea, takes on Bardsley and Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross . Stoke manager Hughes has a well developed chip on the shoulder about the treatment his team receive from referees, but heaven knows why on this evidence. With 20 minutes gone, right back Phil Bardsley was lucky to still be on the field after two poor tackles on Hazard. The first was a booking, the second arguably a straight red. Bardsley received nothing initially, and then a limp-wristed yellow from the ineffectual Swarbrick. Mourinho was rightly furious. Any bad behaviour that is not stopped is encouraged, so Swarbrick must take his share of the blame for the treatment Hazard received. The Belgian is a candidate for Footballer of the Year, and Bardsley had clearly made it his mission to test his mettle. In the 14th minute, he went in high. That was the moment when Swarbrick should have offered protection. It was a yellow-card challenge, no more, but it would have put Bardsley and Stoke on notice. Yet he let it go with just a free-kick and six minutes later Bardsley could have ended Hazard’s participation in the game, maybe even the season. Some tackles look worse than they are. This one didn’t. It looked exactly what it was: late, high, reckless, hitting Hazard at full pelt and launching him into the air.

Instead, he produced an overdue yellow. Mourinho looked fit to burst, so too Hughes — although he was fortunate to still be managing 11 men. The pair exchanged words and Mourinho appeared to be suggesting — without irony — that Hughes had too much to say. He had a point, though. Hughes is a ball of discontent in the technical area, always unhappy with some perceived injustice or slight, often without cause. He moaned when Costa went down after a challenge by Shawcross, although replays showed the Spain striker had every reason. He appeared agitated when Bardsley was injured making a tackle on Hazard, but the Chelsea man most certainly did nothing wrong. The play up Stoke’s end, Bardsley still floored, Hazard kicked the ball into touch to allow his adversary to receive treatment. A touch of class.

Peter Crouch, who was ineffectual up front for Stoke, trudges down the tunnel after being substituted in the second half . VIDEO Hughes can't fault Stoke performance . So it was a sad indictment of Swarbrick’s officiating that he ultimately allowed the best player to be kicked out of the game. Jonathan Walters’ foul was not as blatant as Bardsley’s assault, but he clumsily trampled on Hazard’s heel late on and, after a literally lame attempt at continuing, the Chelsea man signalled he could not continue. Would Walters have been as wanton had Swarbrick done his job sooner? The fans who accused Hazard of diving may feel pangs of guilt, too. Far from being a faker, he was the most courageous player out there. Anyone can kick. Getting kicked and going back for more: that takes guts.

"The fate of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl now rests with a top US general in North Carolina who will decide if the soldier should be charged with desertion after he left his Afghanistan post in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban. The charge of desertion during wartime carries a maximum penalty of death. But the Army, which referred the case to Gen. Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, N.C., said he has a range of options. Milley could decide not to charge Bergdahl, recommend administrative action, or convene a court martial on more serious offenses, such as desertion or absent without leave (AWOL). The fate of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl now rests with a top U.S. general in North Carolina who will decide if the soldier should be charged with desertion after he left his Afghanistan post in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban . The investigation into Bergdahl's disappearance on June 30, 2009, is complete and senior Pentagon and Army leaders got briefed on the results last week. Details about the report's conclusion have not been released. Bergdahl reportedly walked away from his unit after expressing misgivings about the U.S. military's role — as well as his own — in Afghanistan. He was captured by the Taliban and held by members of the Haqqani network, an insurgent group tied to the Taliban that operates both in Pakistan and Afghanistan. On May 31, Bergdahl was handed over to U.S. special forces in Afghanistan as part of an exchange for five top Taliban commanders who were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After spending about two weeks recuperating at a U.S. military hospital in Germany, Bergdahl was sent to Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston in Texas on June 13. He is now doing administrative duties at the base, awaiting the conclusion of the case. Maj. Gen. Kenneth R. Dahl was tasked to conduct an exhaustive investigation into the matter, and spent months interviewing unit members and commanders, and meeting with Bergdahl and his attorney, Eugene Fidell, a military justice expert who is also a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School. He submitted his report in mid-October, setting off a lengthy legal review on his report and how the Army can proceed legally in the case. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is pictured here in an undated photo provided to reporters by the Army. If Bergdahl is cleared of desertion charges, he'll receive $200,000 in back pay and stands to gain another $150,000 in compensation for his ordeal . Army officials briefed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Friday on the findings of Dahl's investigation. Navy. Rear Adm. John Kirby said Monday that Hagel is 'confident that Army leadership will use the information gleaned from the investigation to make the most appropriate decisions with respect to Sgt. Bergdahl.' While hundreds of service members have gone absent without leave (AWOL) since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, many disappear for only a short time and eventually return. Those cases are usually are settled through non-judicial punishments such as being assigned additional duties, getting their pay docked or other administrative actions. A charge of AWOL suggests that the service member left a post or did not arrive for duty when required, but intended to return. A charge of desertion is when a service member leaves and has no intention of ever returning. Punishment for desertion in peacetime can range from life in prison to a dishonorable discharge. Deserting a post in a warzone during a time of combat is a much more serious offense, and therefore can carry the maximum punishment of death. Impending report: The Pentagon has been briefed on a report into the disappearance of army Sgt Bowe Bergdahl who was freed from captivity in May after Obama traded him for five Taliban commanders . Any final disposition of the case will determine what type of discharge Bergdahl receives -- honorable or something less than honorable -- and also whether he will get as much as $300,000 in back pay and other benefits, including continued health care. An initial U.S. military investigation in 2009 concluded that Bergdahl deliberately walked away, based on evidence available at the time. Since his release, some former soldiers who served with him have labeled him a deserter and said he should be held accountable for leaving his post. Others have suggested that troops were put in danger, and even killed, as they tried to find Bergdahl. But there are also those who contend that even if Bergdahl deliberately walked away, his five years in captivity were more than enough punishment for the soldier.","The charge of desertion during wartime carries a maximum penalty of death .

"Police have released a sketch of a woman whose embalmed head was found by in Pennsylvania woods last week and are now asking the public for help identifying her. The head was found by a resident walking in the woods in Economy in Beaver County on December 12 and the county coroner deduced it had been embalmed - although it is not known how long ago. As the image released on Monday shows, it appeared to belong to a woman, aged 50 or older, with whitish gray hair that appeared to have been styled. Authorities added that her teeth were intact and appeared to be in good condition. She has now been laid to rest. Who is she? The Economy Police have released this sketch of a woman whose embalmed head was found in a wooded area on December 12. They are trying to find out who she is and what happened to her . With her identity unknown, authorities are asking for the public's help in identifying her. 'She is someone’s loved one; sister, mother, grandmother and aunt,' Chief of Police Michael O'Brien said at a press conference on Monday. 'Police, County Detectives and the Coroner’s office are continuing to investigate all aspects of the remains. We all have been working diligently and using all resources available to further this investigation.' Police refrained from releasing a photo of the embalmed head, saying they wanted to be sensitive to the woman's family. O'Brien previously said the head appeared to be in good condition, leading police to believe it hadn't been there more than a week - but because it was embalmed, investigators can't be entirely sure. 'It's so bizarre, nobody has ever heard of anything like this,' O'Brien said. That's one reason police don't suspect the woman was the victim of a homicide - but depending on how and why the head wound up in the woods, a crime still could have been committed. Among other things, it's illegal to abuse a corpse in Pennsylvania. Scene: The 'bizarre' was find was made in the woods of Economy in west Pennsylvania, however cadaver dogs that searched the area only found the head, and not a corpse . 'What's bizarre is not that we've found a head, it's that we've found a head that's embalmed,' O'Brien said. 'That's what's really strange about the whole thing.' Search crews using cadaver-sniffing dogs searched the area, but found no other remains. Police are contacting medical schools to see if the head is from a cadaver, and are entering DNA from the remains into a nationwide FBI database for missing persons. If police can determine the woman's identity, that gives them a starting place to determine who would have had access to her body and when. The Economy Borough Police Department asked for anyone with information to contact them at 724-876-0380 or email at police@economyboropd.com.","Police in Economy have released a sketch of a woman whose embalmed head was found by a resident walking in the woods 10 days ago .

"A former headmaster at one of the most exclusive prep schools in the U.S. has been convicted on 25 counts of dealing in child pornography. Christopher Wheeler, 54, who was stationed at Tower Hill school  in Delaware, was charged with  the offenses last year after his office, campus home and private plane were searched. Wheeler's sentencing is tentatively set for March 27. Each of the charges he faces carries a minimum two-year prison term, totaling a maximum of 50 years. Facing jail time: Former Tower Hill headteacher Christopher Wheeler has been convicted on 25 counts of dealing in child pornography . Wheeler, who presided over Tower Hill's 750 pupils aged three to 18, turned himself into police in November 2013 after police asked for the public's help in finding him. The unmarried teacher went missing the month before when he became the focus of a child sex abuse probe  linked to an incident more 30 years ago. The investigation was prompted by allegations made by Pennsylvania man and his younger brother. Under investigation: Wheeler, who presided over Tower Hill's 750 pupils aged three to 18, turned himself into police in November 2013 after police asked for the public's help in finding him . Police conducted a search of Wheeler's property for evidence of witness tampering or intimidation and instead found child pornography. They allegedly found some 2,000 explicit digital images of men engaged in sexual acts with young boys. In Monday's bench trial Wheeler was not charged with abusing anyone. Wheeler, whose adopted Russian son Nikolai is a professional golfer, was taken on by Tower Hill in 2004. Exclusive: Tower Hill School in Delaware, where tuition costs up to $26,955 a year, hired Wheeler in 2004 . He had previously been assistant head of school and dean of admissions at Lake Forest Academy in Illinois and had held a post at St. Paul's School in Garden City, New York. Tower Hill, whose alumni include TV personality Dr Oz and Senator Chris Coons, said that Wheeler was 'thoroughly vetted' before being hired. The accomplished musician, composer and pilot, was paid more than $300,000 a year at the school, where tuition exceeds $26,000.","Christopher Wheeler, 54, has been convicted on 25 counts of dealing in child pornography .

"The mother of the gunman who murdered two NYPD officers on Saturday has extended her condolences to their families and said she is 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions. Speaking on Monday, Shakuwra Dabre, 54, of Brooklyn said she identified with the families pain because she too had lost a son. 'I am still deeply sorry about what happened at the hands of my son,' she told  the Daily News . 'And please accept my deepest condolences, sincerely. 'As a mother now I hurt for the loss of my son. Just like they're hurting for the loss of their sons.' Shakuwra Dabre, 54, of Brooklyn extended her condolences on Monday to the families of the two murdered officers and said she was 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions . Murdered: NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) were assassinated in cold-blood while they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood on Saturday . Dabre said that her son had struggled with mental illness his entire life and had repeatedly refused attempts by the family to try and help him. 'Unfortunately, this situation happened and it culminated in the end of his life and the tragic loss of two innocent police officers,' she said. Dabre was out running errands on Saturday when she was alerted that her son was in trouble by the estranged mother of his child. She raced home and when she scanned the news on her laptop she saw a photo of a man lying on a stretcher accompanying a story about the shooting. 'I knew he was dead when I looked. I knew. He was gone. I knew he was my son,' Dabre told DNA Info through tears. When Dabre first saw the picture of her son on the stretcher, she didn't know he had shot and killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, she said. Dabre remembered her son as a 'charismatic and likeable' man who had suffered depression and anger management issues throughout his life . 'I was so torn when I saw him on that stretcher,' she said. 'Then I found out too that he did that. And I was horrified. Because I didn't want no loss of nobody's life.' Dabre remembered her son as a social and funny 'free spirit' who loved fashion. 'He was a very charismatic, likeable young man. He was very intelligent. He was witty. If he could channel his energies properly, he could've grown up to be a very good outstanding young man. And I had high hopes for him,' she said. But Brinsley also suffered from depression and had anger management issues throughout his life, Dabre said. He tried to kill himself when he was about 14 years old, was briefly institutionalized and at one point took medications that made him gain weight, she said. 'I wanted him to continue whatever they had him under, but he didn't want to and I couldn't make him,' Dabre said. The pair hadn't spoken since July. Dabre  was alerted that her son was in trouble by the estranged mother of his child and when she scanned the news on her laptop she saw a photo of a man lying on a stretcher accompanying a story about the shooting . Brinsley had a long criminal record, a hatred for police and the government and an apparent history of mental instability that included an attempt to hang himself a year ago, authorities said on Sunday. Moments before opening fire, he approached people on the street and asked them to follow him on Instagram, then told them, 'Watch what I'm going to do,' Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. A portrait of the Brooklyn-born gunman emerged as big-city police departments and union leaders around the country warned officers to change up their routines and insist on extra backup a day after Brinsley carried out what he portrayed online as retaliation for the slayings of black men at the hands of white police. Brinsley was black; the slain officers were Asian and Hispanic. Investigators were trying to determine if Brinsley had taken part in any protests over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, whose names he invoked in his online threat, or simply latched on to the cause for the final act in a violent rampage. They said he traveled frequently between the South and New York, where he fathered a child in Brooklyn, and had been in the city earlier in the week. Threatening post: While he was travelling to New York, Brinsley posted this threat to police on Istangram . Brinsley, 28, had at least 19 arrests in Georgia and Ohio, spent two years in prison for gun possession and had a troubled childhood so violent that his mother was afraid of him, police said. He ranted online about police and the government and expressed 'self-despair and anger at himself and where his life was,' Boyce said. On Saturday afternoon, Brinsley approached a squad car from behind in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section and fired four shots, killing Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. He then ran into a subway station and committed suicide. Hours earlier, Brinsley had shot and wounded his ex-girlfriend at her home outside Baltimore, then made threatening posts online, including a vow to put 'wings on pigs' and references to the Brown and Garner cases. Baltimore-area police warned the New York department that Brinsley was in the city and bent on violence. But New York police were still getting the word out when Brinsley struck. The slayings dramatically escalated tensions that have simmered for months over police killings of blacks.","Shakuwra Dabre, 54, of Brooklyn extended her condolences on Monday to the families of the two murdered officers .

"The daughter of Eric Garner, whose chokehold death at the hands of a cop sparked mass protests against the NYPD, offered her support today for the family of two murdered officers. Emerald Snipes, 22, laid a wreath at the site where a cop-hunting gunman killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Weinjen Liu, and said she knows how it feels to spend the holidays without a father. 'I just had to come out and let their family know that we stand with them, and I’m going to send my prayers and condolences to all the families who are suffering through this tragedy,' Snipes told ABC. Mourning: Eric Garner's 22-year-old daughter Emerald Snipes visited a memorial to two slain NYPD officers Monday, expressing her condolences to their families . Snipes told the New York Post she visited the Ramos family and described being moved by a Facebook post from 13-year-old Jaden Ramos, expressing his grief over the death of his father. 'It hit my heart,' Snipes told the New York Daily News while she laid the wreath. 'I know how it feels in this season to not have your father around.' 'Today I had to say bye to my father,' Jaden wrote in his Facebook post. 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer.' Snipes was joined by Dominique Sharpton, daughter of Rev Al Sharpton, who has been vocal about calling for protests in the wake of Garner's death by chokehold by a plainclothes NYPD officer. 'I was never anti-police,' she added. 'Like I said before, I have family that’s in the NYPD that I’ve grown up around, family reunions and everything so my family you know, we’re not anti-police.' Tensions have escalated after the shooting by 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who wrote 'They take 1 of ours...let’s take 2 of theirs' and referenced the deaths of Garner and Mike Brown on an Instagram post he made while traveling to New York from Baltimore.

"American Apparel's controversial founder Dov Charney claims he is almost broke and reduced to crashing on a friend's couch in New York after being ousted from his company for a second time last week. As CEO of the clothing company, Charney earned an $800,000 annual salary, but on Monday he told Bloomberg that he has only has $100,000 left in the bank. The clothing company announced last Tuesday that it had fired the former CEO 'for cause' from his role as a consultant, a position he'd held since July. Scroll down for video . American Apparel's controversial founder Dov Charney claims he is almost broke and reduced to crashing on a friend's couch after being ousted from his company for a second time last week . In June, Charney had been terminated as chairman after the company compiled a long list of his alleged offenses, including sexual harassment, misuse of company funds, and racist comments. He remains the company's largest shareholder, but doesn't have control of his 43 percent stake because of an agreement with hedge fund Standard General. Charney told Bloomberg on Monday that he felt betrayed by the hedge fund that had given him a loan in July so he could boost his ownership of the company he had founded. Charney turned to the firm for help when he was ousted as CEO by the board of directors. 'I gave them my entire life's work and they agreed to put me back in,' he told Bloomberg. 'But instead they used this investigation to fire me. They betrayed me. I gave them my heart.' Standard General disagrees with Charney's version of events and released the following statement:  'We supported the independent, third-party and very thorough investigation into the allegations against Mr. Charney, and respect the Board of Directors' decision to terminate him based on the results of that investigation.' As CEO of American Apparel, Dov Charney earned an $800,000 annual salary, but on Monday he told Bloomberg that he has only has $100,000 left in the bank . Despite what has happened, Charney has said he plans to keep fighting and is 'suing everyone' with what little funds he has left. 'I gave them my shares so that I could come back and run this company,' he told Bloomberg. 'I bet the farm … They robbed me.' American Apparel, which Charney founded in 1998, manufactures clothes and sells them in 245 of its own retail stores in 20 countries and has about 10,000 employees. In 2013, it reported more than $630million in revenue. It is famous for selling American-made goods and for its risque advertising. On Tuesday the firm named longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider to be its next CEO. The Montreal-born Charney has been the subject of lawsuits that allege he had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees. He has said he had consensual sexual relationships with workers. In 2011, a former employee accused Charney of keeping her as a teenage sex slave, fearing she could lose her job otherwise. She also sued American Apparel and its directors for failing to stop him from acting as a 'sexual predator.' In 2012, Charney once again came under fire when Michael Bumblis, a former store manager in Malibu, California, accused the CEO of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him. Charney also allegedly called the man 'a wannabe Jew' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals. Bumblis was later fired from his job. The company has suffered financially. It has recorded annual losses since 2010 and reported three quarterly losses this year. Its stock has dropped 53 percent in 2014. Schneider, who officially starts as CEO on January 5, has been a senior executive at retail and clothing companies including Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria. She said in a statement that she hopes to 'make American Apparel a better company, while staying true to its core values of quality and creativity and preserving its sweatshop-free, Made in USA manufacturing philosophy.' American Apparel has operated under two interim CEOs since Charney's ouster, most recently Scott Brubaker, who will continue in that role through the end of the year. Moving on: Longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider (left, in 2004), formerly of Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria, has been named as the retailer's next CEO .","Dov Charney claims has only $100,000 left and is reduced to crashing on a friend's couch in New York after being ousted from his own company .

"Louis Armstrong was arrested for being a 'dangerous and suspicious character' when he was nine, according to newly-surfaced documents from the 'Colored Waifs Home' where he was sent. It has long been documented that the jazz great was sent to the home in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1913 and a band instructor there is credited with teaching him the horn. But documents, which were salvaged by the son-in-law of the home's owners and recently released to the Times Picayune, have only just revealed his earlier arrest - and have also led to the discovery of newspaper articles written about him more than a century ago. Nine-year-old Armstrong was nabbed by the police in South Rampart on October 21, 1910 with five other boys 'for being dangerous and suspicious characters', according to a Daily Picayune report the following day. Louis Armstrong is pictured front row center during a 1931 visit to a New Orleans boys' home formerly known as the 'Colored Waifs Home'. He was first sent to the home in 1910 when he was arrested age nine . Former home: He was at the home for two weeks for being a 'suspicious and dangerous character' and was sent back again for firing a gun into the air in 1913 - during this second stay, he learned the horn . He was sent to the Colored Waifs Home, an institution for troubled and orphaned children, and was listed as a new arrival with six other boys on October 21. In total, there were 77 boys at the home. The records shared by the Times Picayune show he was discharged to his aunt on November 8. Interestingly, the boy's charges appear to change in the documents and he is later noted down as facing a 'pilfer' charge with a 'pending trial'. There is no way of knowing why there was a change but the Times Picuyane noted that the 'dangerous and suspicious' charge was often criticized as being an unconstitutional way for police to detain people at will without any evidence of a crime. But the 1910 incident was not the only time Armstrong went to the home. In an event that has been widely documented - including in Armstrong's own autobiography - on New Year's Eve in 1912, he was arrested for shooting a .38-caliber revolver into the air. Newspaper articles at the time note he was sent to the home in January 1913 and he was marked as an 'old offender'. He remained at the home for 18 months, records show. Younger years: Armstrong is pictured in 1921, when he was 20, with his mother and sister Beatrice. After leaving the home, he started playing gigs and eventually moved to Chicago and then New York City . Thankful: He is pictured third left during his visit in 1931 with his former music teacher, Peter Davis (second left), and the owners of the home, Captain Joseph Jones (third right) and his wife Manuela (left) But there was one major difference at the home since his previous arrest: teacher Peter Davis had arrived and had set up a band for the boys. Bruce Raeburn, curator of the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane University, pointed out this important difference to the Times Picuyane. 'The first time Armstrong was in there, there was no band to get involved with,' he said. 'It's almost like he got a second chance.' With the help of Davis, he quickly picked up the bugle then the cornet and joined band members in performing in parades and picnics around the city. In May, four months after he was sent to the home, an article in the Daily Picayune writes about Armstrong leading the band during a parade. 'Marching proudly through the streets with drum and fife, they rendered several selections, patriotic mostly, and were loudly encored from the sidewalks,' the article said. He was released into the custody of his father in June 1914 - but wrote in his autobiography that he was not happy to leave. After his release, he started picking up shows. He left New Orleans for Chicago and then New York, but returned to the city in 1931, where he visited the home - later known as the Milne Boys' Home - and posed for pictures with his former music teacher and the boys. Music great: Armstrong performs on the Kraft Music Hall TV show at NBC Studios in Brooklyn in June 1967, four years before his death. He had long credited the boys' home with helping him get his start in music . He also grinned in photos beside Captain Joseph Jones and his wife Manuela, who ran the home and had taken him under their wings when he was a boy. 'Without Joseph and Manuela (Jones) and Peter Davis, there probably would not have been a Louis Armstrong,' their son-in-law Allen Kimble Jr. told the Times Picayune. He went on to send multiple donations to the home before his death in 1971. The records were shared by Kimble, who married the Joneses' daughter, Sylvia Washington, and learned of the couple's connection to Armstrong. In the 1980s, he came across their records and, thinking of Armstrong, picked out some from 1910 and 1913 and took them with him. After moving several times across Europe and in the U.S., he returned to New Orleans in 2008 and eventually shared the records with the Times Picayune, saying other publications had not been interested in them in previous years.","It is well documented that Armstrong was arrested for firing a gun into the air on New Year's Eve 1912, but new records show it was not his first arrest .

"One of Nasa's most powerful space telescopes has turned its gaze on the Sun for the first time to capture this stunning image. Nasa's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, has produced the most sensitive solar portrait ever taken in high-energy X-rays. The mission is primarily designed to look at black holes and other objects far from our solar system. Scroll down for video . X-rays stream off the sun in this image showing observations from by NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, overlaid on a picture taken by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The NuSTAR data, seen in green and blue, reveal solar high-energy emission (green shows energies between 2 and 3 kiloelectron volts, and blue shows energies between 3 and 5 kiloelectron volts). The NuSTAR data, seen in green and blue, reveal solar high-energy emission (green shows energies between 2 and 3 kiloelectron volts, and blue shows energies between 3 and 5 kiloelectron volts). The high-energy X-rays come from gas heated to above 3 million degrees. The red channel represents ultraviolet light captured by SDO at wavelengths of 171 angstroms, and shows the presence of lower-temperature material in the solar atmosphere at 1 million degrees. This image shows that some of the hotter emission tracked by NuSTAR is coming from different locations in the active regions and the coronal loops than the cooler emission shown in the SDO image. 'NuSTAR will give us a unique look at the sun, from the deepest to the highest parts of its atmosphere,' said David Smith, a solar physicist and member of the NuSTAR team at University of California, Santa Cruz. Solar scientists first thought of using NuSTAR to study the sun about seven years ago, after the space telescope's design and construction was already underway, but before the telescope launched into space in 2012. Smith had contacted the principal investigator, Fiona Harrison of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who mulled it over and became excited by the idea. 'At first I thought the whole idea was crazy,' says Harrison. 'Why would we have the most sensitive high energy X-ray telescope ever built, designed to peer deep into the universe, look at something in our own back yard?' Smith eventually convinced Harrison, explaining that faint X-ray flashes predicted by theorists could only be seen by NuSTAR. While the sun is too bright for other telescopes such as NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, NuSTAR can safely look at it without the risk of damaging its detectors. The sun is not as bright in the higher-energy X-rays detected by NuSTAR, a factor that depends on the temperature of the sun's atmosphere. This first solar image from NuSTAR demonstrates that the telescope can in fact gather data about sun. And it gives insight into questions about the remarkably high temperatures that are found above sunspots -- cool, dark patches on the sun. Future images will provide even better data as the sun winds down in its solar cycle. 'We will come into our own when the sun gets quiet,' said Smith, explaining that the sun's activity will dwindle over the next few years. With NuSTAR's high-energy views, it has the potential to capture hypothesized nanoflares -- smaller versions of the sun's giant flares that erupt with charged particles and high-energy radiation. Nanoflares, should they exist, may explain why the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona, is sizzling hot, a mystery called the 'coronal heating problem.' The corona is, on average, 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit (1 million degrees Celsius), while the surface of the sun is relatively cooler at 10,800 Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). It is like a flame coming out of an ice cube. Nanoflares, in combination with flares, may be sources of the intense heat. The new telescope (right) offers deeper, crisper images of the sky - and will help Nasa hunt down 'hidden' objects such as black holes which could help unravel the mysteries of the universe. The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, NuSTAR X-Ray telescope is 100 times more sensitive than any previous telescope operating in the same energy range . 'We will see the hottest, densest and most energetic objects with a fundamentally new high-energy X-ray telescope that can obtain much deeper and crisper images than before,' said Fiona Harrison, NuSTAR's principal investigator at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who first conceived of the mission 20 years ago. The telescope has more than 10 times the resolution, and more than 100 times the sensitivity, of its predecessors operating in a similar energy range. Studying black holes that are big and small, far and near, NuSTAR will endeavor to answer questions about the formation and physics behind these wonders of the cosmos. The observatory will also investigate how exploding stars forge the elements that make up planets and people, and it will even study our own Sun's atmosphere. If NuSTAR can catch nanoflares in action, it may help solve this decades-old puzzle. 'NuSTAR will be exquisitely sensitive to the faintest X-ray activity happening in the solar atmosphere, and that includes possible nanoflares,' said Smith. What's more, the X-ray observatory can search for hypothesized dark matter particles called axions. Dark matter is five times more abundant than regular matter in the universe. Everyday matter familiar to us, for example in tables and chairs, planets and stars, is only a sliver of what's out there. While dark matter has been indirectly detected through its gravitational pull, its composition remains unknown. It's a long shot, say scientists, but NuSTAR may be able spot axions, one of the leading candidates for dark matter, should they exist. The axions would appear as a spot of X-rays in the center of the sun. Meanwhile, as the sun awaits future NuSTAR observations, the telescope is continuing with its galactic pursuits, probing black holes, supernova remnants and other extreme objects beyond our solar system. This 04 November, 2003 image shows giant sunspot 486 (lower-R) 486 unleashing another powerful solar flare. Ionizing radiation hit Earth's atmosphere soon after the explosion and caused a severe radio blackout, which radio listeners noticed across North America. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. The images comes weeks after warnings that Earth could be hit by a series of damaging solar flares after the largest sunspot to be seen on the star for 24 years aligns with our planet. The sunspot, previously known as Active Region 12192, began facing Earth in October but did not produce any coronal mass ejection (CMEs). CMEs are the most energetic events in our solar system, involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun's surface into space. The region, renamed Active Region 12192, has now rotated around to face Earth again, and is likely to create CMEs, Nasa scientist Holly Gilbert told Space.com during a video interview. 'This time around, it's more likely to have some coronal mass ejections associated with it, even though the solar flares might be smaller,' she said. 'We have a good idea, based on the structure of that magnetic field and the sunspot, that it's very possible that it will create some mid-level flares.' Magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy, but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap, releasing their energy as explosions called flares. According to Dr Gilbert, the sunspot is still large enough for 10 Earths to fit inside it, and is believed to be the 33rd largest of 32,908 active regions recorded since 1874. The Jupiter-sized sunspot produced six eruptions in October and early November, before disappearing for two weeks. Earlier this year, Ashley Dale, who is a member of an international task force, dubbed Solarmax, warned that solar 'super-storms' pose a 'catastrophic' and 'long-lasting' threat to life on Earth. A solar superstorm occurs when a CME of sufficient magnitude tears into the Earth's surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart. Earth could be about to be hit by a series of damaging solar flares as a huge sunspots aligns with the planet . Such an event could induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines, causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components. Mr Dale, carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at Bristol University, said it is only a 'matter of time' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards Earth. He says such a storm would wreak havoc with communication systems and power supplies, crippling vital services such as transport, sanitation and medicine. Without power, people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations, get money from cash dispensers or pay online,' he said. 'Water and sewage systems would be affected too, meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip, with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning.' The largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event, named after the English astronomer Richard Carrington who spotted the preceding solar flare. This massive CME released about 1022 kJ of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the Earth at speeds of up to 3000 km/s. However, its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles (200,000 km) of telegraph lines. Mr Dale says these types of events are not just a threat, but inevitable. Nasa scientists have predicted that the Earth is in the path of a Carrington-level event every 150 years on average. This means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent.","NuSTAR primarily designed to look at black holes and other objects far from our solar system .

He said: ""I don’t know, I thought it was casual,"" and I said: ""well, that is some casual gear that"".'

"A footballer woke from a coma after a horrific car crash thinking he was Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey and speaking fluent French – despite only having a basic grasp from school. Rory Curtis, 25, suffered a serious brain injury and a broken pelvis after his van flipped over on the M42 near Tamworth, Staffordshire, and five vehicles ploughed into it in August 2012. He was placed in an induced coma for six days and when he finally came round he started chatting to nurses in fluent French even though he had not spoken the language in 12 years. The former semi-professional footballer for Stourport Swifts FC also said he did not recognise himself in the mirror as he was convinced he was Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey. Scroll down for video . Rory Curtis, 25, woke from a coma after a horrific car crash thinking he was Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey and speaking fluent French . Doctors found he had suffered a multifocal intracranial brain haemorrhage, which meant his blood vessels had burst and blood was leaking into his brain . 'I cannot remember much but I know in my head I thought I was Matthew McConaughey,' he said. 'When I went to the toilet I went to look in the mirror and I was shocked because I didn't look like him, I didn't know what I was looking at. 'Then slowly over time it eventually clicked and I thought 'he is an actor, what am I on about? 'But at times I was in hospital thinking I can't wait to get out of here and back to filming movies. 'I was convinced I was him and that I had his good looks as well - I know it was hopeful thinking really.' Doctors at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital found he had suffered a multifocal intracranial brain haemorrhage, which meant his blood vessels had burst and blood was leaking into his brain. The former semi-professional footballer said he did not recognise himself in the mirror as he was convinced he was Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey . He suffered a suffered a serious brain injury, a broken pelvis and hurt his arm after his van flipped over  and five vehicles ploughed into it . He left the hospital in November 2012 no longer believing he was McConaughey, but still able to speak in fluent  French – a skill he still retains two years on. 'I didn't even do French at GCSE so haven't studied it since Year 9 - then all of a sudden I'm fluent in it,' he said. 'I can't explain how it happened. It's incredible really. I don't remember coming round but my family said one of the nurses was from Africa and spoke French and I was having conversations with her. 'I was just casually chatting away about how I was feeling in this perfect French accent. 'My mum and dad were stunned when they got to hospital and the nurse asked them what side of the family was French. He was treated with an experimental drug and learned walk again in just two months . 'And then I was sitting there spouting a foreign language from my hospital bed acting all French in their sort of arrogant yet sophisticated way. It wasn't me at all. 'I wasn't really that good at it at school, so I don't how my brain has managed to do what is has. I don't know how I know it - I just do.' The talented footballer also went through several stages of believing he was 12 or 14-years-old and would cry when his parents left the hospital. 'I'd ask Mum if she'd fed our dog but he'd died three or four years before. As soon as she said that I cried, too. Then my memory clicked in and I thought, 'Oh yeah, what was that all about?' 'I remember Mum helping me to the toilet and I couldn't believe who I was looking at when I saw myself in a mirror. I had a scar on my right temple and that side of my hair had been shaved off. 'I didn't realise until then that I'd had a brain injury. I just thought I was there for a broken hip and elbow.' He had to undergo many psychological tests because his brain injury was so complex. 'They'd ask me to do simple things like draw a line from A to B and I'd be thinking, 'Are you serious?' Then I'd find it really difficult,' he explains. 'It was like my brain was playing catch-up with my hand.' He was treated with an experimental drug after his family were approached by the National Institute for Health Research Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre. Mr Curtis from Redditch, Worcestershire, was the second person in Britain to have the treatment - which drew upon the Ministry of Defence's expertise with injured soldiers. His family was warned that everyday activities such as getting dressed would be difficult and that he would struggle with short-term memory. But he learned to walk again in just two months and even got back in the football squad. He now works as a barber and is convinced his recovery is down to the experimental drug. 'I feel it made a difference to me and because I don't remember the crash, it doesn't feel like I've had a brain injury. Apart from obviously being able to now speak French. 'The accident changed my outlook on life. I can't leave the house now without telling everyone I love them and giving them a hug. He had to undergo many psychological tests because his brain injury from the car crash was so complex . His parents Vera, 57, and David, 62, could not believe when he started speaking fluent French in hospital . 'I know with a click of your fingers, it could all be over, because life is fragile. There's no point in wasting any time.' His mother Vera, 57, said: 'He is so lucky to be alive. We thought we would lose him. Then all of a sudden he wakes up and he's speaking French. 'This nurse was from Africa and spoke French - she asked us what side of the family was from France, as his accent was so good. 'Well I told her none of us. She not believe it. The brain really is an incredible thing, nobody has quite been able to explain why it has happened.' Luke Griggs, a spokesperson for brain injury association Headway, said: 'Waking from a coma is not how it's often portrayed in the movies. 'It can be a very gradual process, with the patient suffering bouts of confusion and disorientation as the brain tries to recover some functionality. 'After a coma, during a period known as post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), the patient's behaviour may well be restless, disinhibited and agitated for example, with uncharacteristic behaviour not uncommon. 'While different parts of our brain are responsible for different things, all parts of the brain are interconnected. Damage to one part of the brain can lead to increased activity in other parts of the brain, which can sometimes result in surprising and unexpected effects. 'The reality for most, however, is that the recovery journey from a brain injury can arduous and last a lifetime with patients often faced with having to relearn the most basic of life skills.' He had trials with Manchester United at the age of 14 and played for Stourport Swifts FC until the accident .","Rory Curtis, 25, suffered a serious brain injury after a car crash in 2012 .

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report from the Britannia Stadium . Several years ago after watching a routine Manchester United victory at the Britannia Stadium, Lou Macari was asked just why Sir Alex Ferguson's team seemed to find it easier than others in North Staffordshire. As well as being a United player in the 1970s, Macari was a Stoke City manager in the 1990s, back in the days when the arena of intimidation was the rather more functional Victoria Ground down the A500 'D Road' from here. Macari knows how things work in this part of the world and his answer was immediate. Jose Mourinho got his tactics right as Chelsea defeated Stoke 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium . Chelsea players celebrate after ensuring that they would be top of the table at Christmas . The Chelsea manager speaks to Stoke's tough tackler Phil Bardsley (right) after the game . 'It's simple,' he said. 'Too many teams come here anticipating a physical battle and start messing with their team and tactics. They pick big 'physical' players. 'United, though, always come here and pick footballers and tell them to play better football than Stoke. Usually, it works.' It was tempting to think back to that conversation here on Monday night and conclude that it remains as pertinent now as it did then. Stoke's current manager Mark Hughes has tweaked his team's style a little. They do play slightly differently than they did in the Tony Pulis days, even if his right-back Phil Bardsley did his best to drag us all back to another era altogether with some wretched early tackling on Monday night. Nevertheless, Stoke still present an athletic challenge that some managers try – and often fail – to nullify with a like for like approach. It is a peculiar tactic and one that Jose Mourinho eschewed very sensibly. Bardsley showed that Stoke's reputation as a physical team hasn't completely disappeared . Eden Hazard (left) is left writhing on the ground after the challenge that could have seen Bardsley sent off . Mourinho and Stoke boss Mark Hughes became involved in a touchline spat over the tackle . All Barclays Premier League footballers should be able to look after themselves physically, whoever they are and what ever position they play. If they can't then they arguably shouldn't be playing the game. Just like the great United teams of the past – and indeed Arsene Wenger's really good Arsenal teams – Mourinho's modern Chelsea combine the physical and the technical expertly. They are footballers first and foremost but, equally, you wouldn't mind having them by your side when it gets lively in the pub on a Friday night either. It is this combination that makes them so irresistibly impressive and clear favourites to win the first Premier League title of Mourinho's second spell at Stamford Bridge. Stoke's early approach was robust to say the least. Bardsley should have been booked for a tackle on Eden Hazard by the Chelsea byline and could perhaps have received a straight red for another on the Belgian at the other end soon after. John Terry opens the scoring with a header to help send Chelsea three points clear at the top of the table . Mourinho has built a Chelsea side that combines both physical and technical attributes . Nemanja Matic (right) gave another commanding performance at the heart of Chelsea's midfield . Chelsea didn't like it. Mourinho waved an imaginary card around on the touchline and became involved in a bickering contest with the particularly irritable Hughes. Crucially, though, Chelsea didn't allow the feuding to transfer itself to the field. They ensured it remained a football match and that was key. The league leaders' opening goal came after only a minute or so and was headed in from a corner by John Terry. The match reports will detail a set piece goal but what they probably won't talk about is the lovely piece of intelligent attacking football that led to a shot that led to the corner in the first place. Similarly, Chelsea's other really good chance of the opening 45 minutes came on the back of a passage of terrific football to which Stoke just had no answer. VIDEO Hughes can't fault Stoke performance . Belgium playmaker Hazard (right) played a crucial role in setting up Chelsea's second goal . Cesc Fabregas scored only his second league goal this season to double Chelsea's lead . The Spaniard drops to his knees to celebrate as Chelsea show why they are favourites to win the title . A stunningly well-timed tackle from Nemanja Matic allowed Hazard to feed Cesc Fabregas and when the Premier League's top assist-maker slid the ball through to Diego Costa the Spaniard should have closed out the game instead of rolling his shot a foot wide of the far post. It was an unusual piece of negligence from Costa but the part played in the move by Matic was terrific. The Serbian is a sensational footballer and  his contribution was bettered only by Hazard who played his football gamely and bravely all night. It was fitting he played a part in Chelsea's second goal and his performance typified his team's courage and indomitable spirit. It all comes from their manager, of course. Few people set the tone like Mourinho does. It's never easy here but this was as close to being comfortable as it gets. As Macari once said, the key is to come here not to fight but to play.","Chelsea defeated Stoke 2-0 in their Premier League clash on Monday .

"An experimental vaccine to protect against Ebola is safe, research has revealed. The first trial of filovirus vaccines in Africa revealed the drug generated a similar immune response in healthy Ugandan adults, as those reported in American volunteers earlier this year. It is hoped establishing the safety of the vaccines will help contain the current outbreak in West Africa, which has claimed almost 7,400 lives according to the World Health Organisation. The DNA vaccines, designed to protect against Ebola and the closely related Marburg virus, have provided a basis for the development of more potent drugs, currently being tested in the US, UK, Mali and Uganda. An experimental vaccine to protect against Ebola, pictured under the microscope, is safe, after the first trials of the DNA vaccine showed it was effective in protecting healthy adults in Uganda . The current outbreak in West Africa has killed around 7,400 people according to the WHO . Lead author, Dr Julie Ledgerwood, from the National Institues of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institutes of Health said: 'This is the first study to show comparable safety and immune response of an experimental Ebola vaccine in an African population. 'This is particularly encouraging because those at greatest risk of Ebola live primarily in Africa, and diminished vaccine protection in African populations has been seen for other diseases.' Scientists from the NIAID developed the two DNA vaccines, that code for Ebola virus proteins from the Zaire and Sudan strains of the disease, and the Marburg virus protein. Immune responses against these proteins have shown to be highly protective in non-human primate models. Phase one trials carried out at the Makerere University Walter Reed programme, enlisted 108 healthy adults aged between 18 and 50 from Kampala, Uganda. The trials took place between November 2009 and April 2010. Each volunteer was randomly assigned an injection, receiving either the Ebola vaccine (30 volunteers), the Marburg vaccine (30), both vaccines (30), or the placebo (18) at the start of the study, and again at four and eight weeks later. The vaccines given separately and together were safe and stimulated an immune response in the form of neutralising antibodies, and T-cells against the virus proteins. Four weeks after the third injection, more than half of volunteers (57 per cent of 17 of 30) had an antibody response to the Ebola Zaire protein as did 14 of 30 participants who received both the Ebola and Marburg vaccines. However the antibodies were not long-lasting and returned to undetectable levels within 11 months of vaccination. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa involves the Zaire strain. Trials carried out in Uganda in 2009 and 2010 (file picture posed by model) showed the volunteers showed similar immunse response to the vaccines designed to protect against Ebola and the closely related Marburg virus, to those US volunteers earlier this year. The vaccines have provided the basis for more potent drugs currently being trialled . Lead author, Dr Julie Ledgerwood, said: 'This is the first study to show comparable safety and immune response of an experimental Ebola vaccine in an African population' The Marburg virus is closely related to the Ebola disease and causes internal bleeding . The researchers found both DNA vaccines were well tolerated in Ugandan adults. Only one serious adverse reaction - a low white blood cell count - was reported in a Marburg vaccine only recipient, but was not thought to be vaccine-related. Dr Ledgerwood, said: 'These findings have already formed the basis of a more potent vaccine, delivered using a harmless chimpanzee cold virus, which is undergoing trials in the US, UK, Mali and Uganda in response to the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak.' Dr Saranya Sridhar, from the Jenner Institue at the University of Oxford, said: 'This study deserves to be the focal point around which the broader question of vaccine development, particularly for Africa, must be addressed. 'With the uncharitable benefit of hindsight in view of the evolving 2014 Ebola outbreak, we must ask ourselves whether a filovirus vaccine should have been in more advanced clinical development. 'The international response to the present Ebola outbreak is an exemplar of the speed and purpose with which clinical vaccine development can progress and has set the benchmark against which future vaccine development must be judged. Outbreaks of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections have occurred sporadically since they were first detected in 1976 and 1967 respectively, and have a case fatality rate as high as 90 per cent and 80 per cent respectively. Like the Ebola virus, Marburg is a filovirus that causes internal bleeding at multiple sites with patients usually dying as a result of multiple organ failure. Currently, no effective vaccines against either virus exist.","Study found experimental vaccines were well tolerated by volunteers .

"Jose Mourinho's 'outstanding' recruitment policy is the reason Chelsea are so far ahead of their Premier League rivals, Gary Neville has claimed. The Portuguese manager's side beat restored their three-point lead at the top of the Premier League table on Monday night after beating Stoke City 2-0.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho applauds his players after their 2-0 win against Stoke City . Cesc Fabregas scores Chelsea's second goal of the evening at the Britannia Stadium against Stoke . And Neville believes it is those recent additions to the squad that have elevated Chelsea to a level above their rivals. Speaking to Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football, Neville said: 'The recruitment of Jose Mourinho since he has come into Chelsea has been outstanding. Absolutely outstanding. 'He's identified what a team needs. Matic - straight in. Courtois - they brought him back. (Diego) Costa - a strong centre forward. Fabregas - they needed a little bit of creativity at times last season against teams that played with deep defences. Gary Neville was full of praise for Mourinho's signings on Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football show . Diego Costa has been exceptional since joining Chelsea from Atletico Madrid in the summer . Thibaut Courtois and Nemanja Matic were outstanding as Chelsea restored their three-point lead in the league . 'The blend of what Chelsea have at the moment is why they will be fighting for the league with (Manchester) City, and why those two are streets ahead of everyone else.' While Neville didn't single out any clubs for criticism, he did have a message for managers looking to add to their ranks in January . He said: 'To play in the centre midfield in the Premier League in a 38-game season which is a battle to win it, to not think that you're going to need physicality  - you're not going to do it through just technical ability. You're going to need to dig in there and fight and battle.","Chelsea beat Stoke City 2-0 in their Premier League clash on Monday .

"The Bishop of Shrewsbury referred to John Lennon's poignant song in a Christmas homily . John Lennon’s anthem Imagine is a ‘heart-chilling vision’ that has misled the world about the causes of war, a senior Roman Catholic bishop said yesterday.(Mon) Lennon’s song is just a lazy repetition of the ‘ill-founded belief’ that religion causes wars, the Bishop of Shrewsbury, the Right Reverend Mark Davies, said. But the wars of the 20th century were inspired by secular and anti-Christian ideologies, the Bishop said. He condemned the 1971 Lennon song in a Christmas homily calling for recognition of the Christian nature of the festival at a time when, he said, schools, public officials and state institutions are trying to sweep away any connection between religion and seasonal celebrations. The former Beatle’s immensely popular song calls on its listeners to imagine a world with no religion where everyone lives in peace. Bishop Davies said that the First World War Christmas 1914 truce between British and German soldiers ‘is universally recognised as a brief moment of humanity amidst the death and destruction of the Great War.’ He added: ‘The events of Christmas 1914 give the lie to the lazily repeated assertion that religion is the cause of wars. ‘John Lennon would give voice to this ill-founded belief in the lyrics of his song Imagine. This becomes a heart-chilling vision in which Lennon imagines a world with no hope of heaven and no fear of hell. And, he adds, “no religion too”. ‘Only then, he suggests, will “all the people” be “living life in peace”. ‘Yet the fact is, the wars of the century past, bringing with them atrocities on a scale never seen before, were largely inspired by secularist and, indeed, anti-Christian ideologies. In reality, it is human sin which lies at the root cause of war.’ Bishop Davies, 55, who has led the Shrewsbury diocese since 2010, added: ‘In Britain today we are told that two thirds of schools now substitute a “winter celebration” for the nativity story; civil servants, it is reported, are advised not to use the word Christmas to avoid giving offence; and most civic authorities limit themselves to voicing merely “seasonal greetings”. ‘How much we need to be reminded on this Christmas 2014 that the greatest message for peace and the cohesion of society is being lost amongst us,’ the bishop said. The Right Reverend Mark Davies referred to the song as well as the Christmas Truce in 1914 for the service . The Bishop said the singer (pictured with partner Yoko Ono before his death) repeated the 'ill founded belief' that wars were started by religion . Bishop Davies is regarded as a firm supporter of traditionalist values among the Roman Catholic bishops of England and Wales. In 2012 he said in his Christmas message that same-sex marriage was an attempt to undermine marriage and religion in the name of progress. This he said, was similar to the way that Nazis and communists rejected religion in the name of progress. The Lennon song – once described by its author as ‘virtually the Communist Manifesto’ - remains a revered highlight of pop history, and Rolling Stone magazine has rated it at number three among the 500 greatest songs of all time. John Lennon was shot dead by a fan in December 1980. The record producer who worked on Imagine, Phil Spector, is currently serving a prison sentence of 19 years to life for the murder of an aspiring actress in 2003.","Bishop of Shrewsbury condemned lyrics 'imagine no religion' in homily .

"Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that he would only point at his watch to influence match officials and opponents despite rarely being aware of how many minutes were left in a match for his Manchester United side to find a goal. Ferguson's United became famous for winning points in the closing minutes of matches in a timekeeping tactic which soon became labelled as 'Fergie Time'. Speaking on BT Sport's Clare Balding Meets, Ferguson said: 'Absolutely (other team's were frightened of it). That's why I used to go with my watch.

Ferguson, seen here grabbing former Everton manager David Moyes' watch, has revealed that he would use the 'Fergie Time' tactic to influence the officials . - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer netted three minutes into injury time against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final to win the trophy for United. - A goal by Steve Bruce six minutes into stoppage time against Sheffield Wednesday gave Fergie his first title with United in April 1993. - In 2009 Federico Macheda scored the winner in the 93rd minute for United against Aston Villa in a thrilling 3-2 win in that ultimately clinched yet another league title for United. - Michael Owen bagged a truly memorable Old Trafford winner with his late striker against rivals Manchester City in 2009. City boss Mark Hughes was furious the six minutes of added on time. 'But I never looked at my watch. Honestly. I didn’t know how many minutes but it gets across to the opponents and the referee. It was just a little trick.' One of United's most famous late victories in recent years came in 2009 when Ferguson's side beat their 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City in an unforgettable derby with a Michael Owen goal deep in stoppage time to claim a 4-3 victory. City manager Mark Hughes was left bemused at how the referee had played six minutes of injury time when the fourth official had indicated there would be just four added at the end of the 90. Federico Macheda also announced himself to the Old Trafford crowd with a 93rd minute winner against Aston Villa in 2009. And, in so doing, calmed fears that the Red Devils might let a third consecutive title slip through their fingers. However, the Old Trafford club's most famous late goal came from the boot of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the Norwegian striker secured the 1999 Champions League title and the Treble in a 2-1 win against Bayern Munich. Ferguson's side were 1-0 behind before substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Solskjaer turned the game on its head in a matter of minutes.

"Sir Alex Ferguson has broken his silence over Louis van Gaal’s modern Manchester United by predicting his old team will become a force in the Barclays Premier League in the new year. Ferguson has largely watched from afar as Van Gaal and his injury-hit squad have struggled to keep up with Chelsea and Manchester City at the top of the table. But now Ferguson has backed Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney to propel United’s charge. ‘First of all, Louis van Gaal,’ said the former Old Trafford  boss. ‘I don’t know how he can expect to get the best results with the number of injuries he has had. When he gets the best players back — you watch United. He is a great coach and will do well. Former manager Sir Alex Ferguson has warned rivals to watch out for Manchester United next year .

Louis van Gaal (right) will turn United into a force next year, says the Premier League's most successful boss . Ferguson speaks to Van Gaal during a Champions League match between United and Barcelona in 1998 . ‘Michael Carrick is the best English player in the game. Robin van Persie, the World Cup maybe has taken a little bit out of him, but you watch him in the second half of the season. He’ll be fine. Rooney is flying again and will always get you a goal.’ Sir Alex, who was speaking to Clare Balding for a BT Sport Christmas Day special, also addressed the issue of United’s new players and one of his own best recent signings, keeper David de Gea. ‘I’m not interested in what is happening with the players they have brought in because they need time,’ he said. Former Old Trafford manager Ferguson insists United's progress has been hampered by injuries . Ferguson has hailed United midfielder Michael Carrick as the 'best English player in the game' Robin van Persie (left) and Wayne Rooney (right) can lead United's charge in the new year . Goalkeeper David de Gea has been United's best player with a string of man-of-the-match performances . ‘When I took Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidic in January of the same year they were all over the place. They took five months to get used to playing for Manchester United — the culture, the history of the club — and these new players will be exactly the same. ‘The one that is most pleasing for me of the present lot is David de Gea. When we bought him as a kid, he was frail, but he had ability. He has special talents and he is showing that now. I’m really pleased for that kid.’ City and Chelsea are title favourites and if Ferguson could pick a winner it would be the Londoners, not just because of United’s rivalry with City but due to his friendship with Jose Mourinho. Ferguson labelled Jose Mourinho as good looking because 'he has the George Clooney bits in his hair' Ferguson and Mourinho share a long-standing respect for each other . Ferguson admitted that looking at his watch during games was all part of his mind games . Ferguson added: ‘It is unfair really. He’s good-looking, he has the George Clooney bits in his hair. But he is a great example. He is learning all the time, he has a determination.’ Ferguson perhaps found his match in Mourinho when it came to mind games and the Scot revealed his famous habit of looking at his watch late in games was a con trick. Asked if the ‘Fergie time’ act intimidated rivals, he said: ‘Absolutely. That’s why I used to go with my watch. I never looked at it. Honestly. But it gets across to the opponents and the referee. It was just a little trick.’ Sir Alex Ferguson was speaking to Clare Balding as part of a BT Sport Christmas Day double-bill of ‘Clare Balding Meets’ which features exclusive interviews with Sir Alex and Jose Mourinho.

"Despite the successes of recent Hollywood blockbusters with strong female leads - from The Hunger Games, Twilight and Anna Karenina, to The Iron Lady, Bridesmaids and Snow White And The Huntsmen - speaking roles for women in cinema have hit a five-year low, with men now being given more than 70 per cent of speaking roles in films. And the female roles most likely to be given words to say are those of teenagers showing a lot of skin, according to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Among the 100 highest-grossing films at . the 2012 US box office, only 28.4 per cent of the 4,475 speaking . characters were female - a ratio of 2.51 males to every one female on screen - a figure which has fallen from 32.8 per cent three . years ago. Despite the successes of films with strong female leads, such as The Hunger Games starring Jennifer Lawrence, female speaking parts in Hollywood have hit a five-year low . The report, lead by Communication Professor Stacy L.Smith, declared that 'females are grossly underrepresented on screen in 2012 films', and that only '6 per cent of the top-grossing films in 2012 featured a balanced cast, or females in 45 to 54.9 per cent of all speaking roles'. And when they are on screen, 31 per cent . of women in 2012 were shown with at least some exposed skin, and 31.6 . per cent were depicted wearing sexually-revealing clothing. Professor Smith said: 'The last few years have seen a wealth of great advocacy for more women on screen. Unfortunately, that investment has not yet paid off with an increase in female characters or a decrease in their hypersexualization.' The study also found that the majority of all female roles are written for 21 to 39-year-olds. The study found that the majority of all female roles are for 21 to 39-year-olds, such as 23-year-old Kristen Stewart, pictured here in Twilight . Females in the top-grossing films of 2012 are more likely than males to be shown in 'sexy' clothes - 31.6 per cent compared with seven per cent - or partially naked - 31 per cent compared with 9.4 per cent. And actresses aged 13 to 20 are more likely to be shown in either of these states than those aged 21 to 39 or 40 to 64. The samples also found that the proportion of teenage females in alluring apparel has increased by 22 per cent between 2009 and 2012. Behind the camera things are not much better. A mere 16.7 per cent of the 1,228 directors, writers, and producers are female across the 100 top-grossing films of 2012. Women accounted for 4.1 per cent of directors, 12.2 per cent of writers, and 20 per cent of producers - a ratio of five males to every one female behind the camera. Smith added: The under representation of females on screen is surprising given population and movie attendance patterns.

"Solar wind and other particles from the sun could give us an early warning of space rocks heading for Earth, researchers have found. They say changes in the solar wind, plasma and other types of particle could give away the location of rocks currently missed. They say it could help spot smaller rocks like the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor impact in Russia, which injured 500 people and caused significant property damage. Scroll down for video . Changes in the solar wind, plasma and other types of particle could give away the location of rocks currently missed - such as the meteor that blazed across southern Urals in February. The solar wind is a stream of energized, charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, flowing outward from the Sun, through the solar system at speeds as high as 900 km/s and at a temperature of 1 million degrees (Celsius). It is made of plasma, and the temperature of the corona is so high that the Sun's gravity cannot hold on to it. The findings were presented at the 47th annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. Huge near-Earth objects (NEOs) that circle the sun are often trailed by smaller space rocks and ultrafine dust, and the Earth's gravitational pull can bring the smaller objects directly towards the planet. Even if they are heading straight for Earth, 'you will never see it in a telescope,' study co-author Hairong Lai, a space physicist at University of California, Los Angeles told LiveScience. When meteoroids randomly collide with the medium-size rocky bodies in the dust cloud around an asteroid, fine dust is created. Photons ping the surface of the fine dust particles, knocking off electrons and leaving the dust positively charged, Wei said. As a result, the stream of particles spewing from the sun, called solar wind, interacts with the charged dust and creates a spike in the magnetic field. Several spacecraft in the solar system have onboard magnetometers that can detect these magnetic signatures of collision. By using data from multiple spacecraft on the size and scale of the magnetic field perturbations, along with previously derived data on the speed and characteristics of known interstellar bodies, the team can calculate the size and shape of a trailing debris cloud. A meteor that blazed across southern Urals in February was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century. More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it landed near the city of Chelyabinsk. The fireball measuring 18 meters across, screamed into Earth's atmosphere at 41,600 mph. Much of the meteor landed in a local lake called Chebarkul. Other than the latest find, scientists have already uncovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the February 15 incident. However, only five of them turned out being real meteorites. The team has already found that Asteroid 138175, which circles the sun roughly every 368 days, may have tens of thousands of small but deadly objects in its orbit that may pose a threat to Earth. In contrast, Asteroid 308635, which circles the sun every 455 days, doesn't carry much rocky debris in its wake, Wei said. Astronomers have identified just 1 percent of these space rocks lurking in the solar system; the objects are usually less than tens of meters wide .","Changes in the solar wind and plasma  could give away locations .

"An 18-year-old high school student was killed after letting his classmate punch him in the face to settle an alcohol-fueled argument after a party. Jarom Thomas was leaving a cabin party in Snohomish County, Washington, on Saturday night when he backed his Honda into another car, in which Michael Galen was sat. Returning minutes later, Thomas argued with Galen about the minor collision before allegedly telling his friend to punch him in the face by way of apology, according to court documents read by KOMO News. Scroll down for video . Punched: Jarom Thomas (left) told Michael Galen (right) to punch him after hitting his car, a court heard . The pair, both students at Crossroads High School in Granite Falls, were seen smoking a cigarette together then shaking hands before Galen dealt the fatal blow - a closed fist to the left side of Thomas's face. Thomas blacked out immediately, fell backwards, and his head hit the curb. He was pronounced dead hours later in Everett's Providence Colby Hospital. Galen is being held on a $10,000 bond on suspicion of second-degree manslaughter. A spokesman for the Granite Falls School District said: 'Our sincerest condolences go to Jarom's family and friends. 'Please join us in sending the family support and encouragement during this difficult time.' Shock: Thomas, 18, immediately fell unconscious and never awoke outside a cabin party on Saturday night . Arrested: Galen allegedly admitted to punching Thomas and is being held on suspicion of manslaughter . Galen's father, Mike, tearfully told reporters the pair had been drinking and it 'got out of hand'. He said: 'I'm really sorry for their family... their loss. 'If I could do something I would. Please, I'm sorry for what my son did. 'To the parents of the kid that this happened, please, I'm so sorry, he did this, OK? Please, forgive me, and forgive him.'

"The Boston Marathon bombing suspect set to go on trial in January wants his fans kept away from the courthouse to stop them from spouting conspiracy theories, according to court documents. Defense lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev submitted documents pleading for a federal judge to remove 'self-appointed supporters' from the steps of the Boston courthouse, Yahoo News reports. The 21-year-old's legal team argues demonstrators 'advocate various conspiracy theories concerning the marathon bombing, including that the resulting deaths and injuries have somehow been faked as part of a government plot.' Demonstrations: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is set to go on trial in January, wants 'self-appointed' fans kept away from the courthouse . Stating that the protesters would have a 'deleterious and prejudicial impact' by pushing false-flag conspiracy theories in the faces of those at the courthouse, lawyers for Tsarnaev asked they be moved away from the courthouse by US Marshals. 'Survivors, jurors, witnesses and members of the public must be able to attend court without being assaulted by inflammatory accusations from any source,' documents state. His lawyers argue that demonstrators 'continuing presence in the immediate vicinity of the courthouse entryways ... poses a grave threat' to a fair trial. The defense mentioned survivor Marc Fucarile, who confronted a group of women with signs on his way into the courthouse Thursday, as an example of the effect of demonstrations. Fucarile shook his prosthetic leg in front of one protester who called the case against Tsarnaev 'trickery' before continuing into the courthouse. Tsarnaev's lawyers have also sought to move the trial out of Massachusetts, citing in a pretrial motion Monday that 'greater Boston, was itself, a victim.' Trial: Tsarnaev, depicted in a court sketch at a pretrial hearing, will face the start of his trial for his alleged role in the Boston Marathon in January, though lawyers want the trial moved out of Boston . Removed: Lawyers asked that 'supporters' of Tsarnaev be removed so as not to create a 'deleterious and prejudicial impact' by pushing  conspiracy theories at those coming to the court . Transported: Tsarnaev is put into another vehicle while being taken from a hearing in federal court on Thursday . The defense states finding an impartial jury would be difficult because 'the crimes charged inflicted actual injury on the entire local population,' according to documents. Attorneys also claim that 'adverse pretrial publicity and leaks continue unabated' and that 'media saturation' will increase with the beginning of the trial in January and the April anniversary of the bombing. The request echoed the demands by Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1997 trial was moved to Denver. McVeigh was ultimately given a death sentence and executed for the bombing, which killed 168 people and injured many more. Prosecutors had previously opposed a change-of-venue request on the grounds that previous trials similar to Tsarnaev's were able to assemble impartial juries. Three people were killed and more than 260 injured after two bombs were detonated at the finish line of the marathon in April 2013. Tsarnaev could face the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges brought against him.","Lawyers for Tsarnaev, 21, argue that 'self-appointed supporters' pushing conspiracy theories will prejudice court .

"It has perplexed astronomers since being dug up in 1999. The Nebra Sky Disc is thought to have been made during the Middle Bronze Age in around 1600 BC, and experts believe it could be the first 'sky map' ever created. The bronze disc, about 32cm in diameter, has a gold inlay clearly representing the moon and/or sun and some stars. The Sky Disc was discovered in Germany in 1999 as part of a hoard also containing two bronze swords, two small axes, a chisel and fragments of spiral bracelets. The disk's recent history dates to 1999, when two looters using metal detectors discovered the artifact, along with several bronze weapons and tools, in a wooded area near the German town of Nebra, 100 miles southwest of Berlin. Amateur archaeologists Reinhold Stieber and Hildegard Burri-Bayer tried to hawk the disk for $400 000 - and were seized by police officers in the basement bar of a touristy Swiss hotel. After a short trial, the duo, along with the looters, were found guilty of illegally trafficking in cultural artifacts. Experts believe the Sky Disc was a calculator to help Bronze Age people predict the best times for sowing and harvesting in spring and autumn. It recorded the fact that when the Pleiades, a very obvious group of stars in the night sky which are a familiar sight in the northern hemisphere in winter,  were seen next to a new moon, that signaled the beginning of spring, when seeds should be sown, at the latitude of central Germany. When the star cluster stood next to a full moon, it was a sign that fall had begun and it was harvest time. The Sky Disc was discovered in Germany in 1999 as part of a hoard also containing two bronze swords, two small axes, a chisel and fragments of spiral bracelets. A small piece in wood found in one of the swords allowed scientists to date the hoard to around 1600 BC. The disc  was also used to determine if and when a thirteenth month -- the so-called intercalary month -- should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons. The sophistication of the disk surprised many archaeologists. 'We knew that people back then must have had a certain idea of the seasons and the Moon, as we all have,' Dr. Alfred Reichenberger, a researcher and spokesperson for the State Museum of Prehistory in Halle told Nautilus. 'There are depictions of the cosmos that are older, for example in the chamber tombs of the old pyramids in Egypt. The Sky Disc was a calculator to help Bronze Age people predict the best times for sowing and harvesting in spring and autumn. The small cluster of stars on the disc has been identified as the Pleiades, a very obvious group of stars in the night sky which are a familiar sight in the northern hemisphere in winter. The disk  was developed in four stages: Initially the disk had thirty-two small round gold circles, a large circular plate, and a large crescent-shaped plate attached (left). At some later date, two arcs (constructed from gold of a different origin, as shown by its chemical impurities) were added at opposite edges of the disk (right). To make space for these arcs, one small circle was moved from the left side toward the center of the disk and two of the circles on the right were covered over, so that thirty remain visible (left). The final addition was another arc at the bottom, the 'sun boat', again made of gold from a different origin. They disappear from view around 10 March and appear again around 17 October, close to the equinoxes which were important times for sowing and harvesting crops. At some point two bands were added to the outside edges. It is thought that the two bands relate to the rising and setting of the sun in midsummer and midwinter, allowing the people to pinpoint the solstices. 'But they are schematic…As of today, there has never been something as concrete as the Nebra Sky Disk.' The Nebra Sky Disc features the oldest concrete depiction of the cosmos worldwide. In June 2013 the Nebra sky disk was included in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register calling it 'one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th century.' The disk's recent history dates to 1999, when two looters using metal detectors discovered the artifact, along with several bronze weapons and tools, in a wooded area near the German town of Nebra, 100 miles southwest of Berlin.

"Researchers have issued a fresh warning over using electronic gadgets before bed. A major new study found that the light from the gadgets can disrupt sleep patterns. It is the first to study e-book users and readers of paper books. Tablet readers took longer to fall asleep and spent less time in REM sleep, the study found . Previous research has shown that blue light suppresses melatonin, impacts the circadian clock and increase alertness, but little was known about the effects of this popular technology on sleep. The use of light emitting devices immediately before bedtime is a concern because of the extremely powerful effect that light has on the body's natural sleep/wake pattern, and may thereby play a role in perpetuating sleep deficiency. 'We found the body's natural circadian rhythms were interrupted by the short-wavelength enriched light, otherwise known as blue light, from these electronic devices,' said said Anne-Marie Chang of Brigham and Women's Hospital, who led the study. 'Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book.' The research, published in published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today, found of a light-emitting electronic device (LE-eBook) in the hours before bedtime can adversely impact overall health, alertness, and the circadian clock which synchronizes the daily rhythm of sleep to external environmental time cues. Previous research has shown that blue light suppresses melatonin, impacts the circadian clock and increase alertness, but little was known about the effects of this popular technology on sleep. The use of light emitting devices immediately before bedtime is a concern because of the extremely powerful effect that light has on the body's natural sleep/wake pattern, and may thereby play a role in perpetuating sleep deficiency. During the two-week inpatient study, twelve participants read LE-e-Books on an iPad for four hours before bedtime each night for five consecutive nights. This was repeated with printed books. Although iPads were used in this study, BWH researchers also measured other eReaders, laptops, cell phones, LED monitors, and other electronic devices, all emitting blue light. The order was randomized with some reading the iPad first and others reading the printed book first. Participants reading on the iPad took longer to fall asleep, were less sleepy in the evening, and spent less time in REM sleep. The iPad readers had reduced secretion of melatonin, a hormone which normally rises in the evening and plays a role in inducing sleepiness. Participants who read from the iPad were less sleepy before bedtime, but sleepier and less alert the following morning after eight hours of sleep. Additionally, iPad readers had a delayed circadian rhythm, indicated by melatonin levels, of more than an hour. Participants who read from the iPad were less sleepy before bedtime, but sleepier and less alert the following morning after eight hours of sleep. 'In the past 50 years, there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality,' stated Charles Czeisler, PhD, MD, FRCP, chief, BWH Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders. 'Since more people are choosing electronic devices for reading, communication and entertainment, particularly children and adolescents who already experience significant sleep loss, epidemiological research evaluating the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed.' Researchers emphasize the importance of these findings, given recent evidence linking chronic suppression of melatonin secretion by nocturnal light exposure with the increased risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer and prostate cancer.","Study first to compare e-book users to readers of paper books .

"She's no stranger to running headlong into trouble, and it seems for Sally Bercow that her next venture will be no different. The wife of House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has been pictured falling face first into snow while training for the new series of reality television show, The Jump. The mother-of-three can be seen grimacing and flailing as she careers down the run at a North London ski school, before tumbling over on the slope. Going: Sally Bercow veers to one side as she trains for The Jump at a North London ski school . Going: Still clutching her ski poles, Sally crashes to the ground, trying her best to retain some semblance of dignity . As part of the series, hosted by Davina McCall and Alex Brooker, she will compete alongside 12 other celebrities in a range of winter sports including skeleton racing, bobsledding, speed skating and skiing. Her appearance on the Channel 4 programme, which begins in January, may trouble her MP husband who has been humiliated by her previous gaffes in the media. The 45-year-old faced legal action in 2012 after mistakenly linking Lord McAlpine to allegations of sex offences on Twitter. And following her brief stint on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, the Speaker was left red-faced after Mrs Bercow described their ‘spicy’ sex life. She was the first contestant voted out by the public in Big Brother, but maintained that she stood by her appearance and was ‘very proud’ after raising £100,000 for AaA, the autism charity of which she and her husband are parent patrons. Gone: Face down in the snow, her skis flailing, she ends up in a heap . Anyone fancy a holiday? The mother-of-three takes a break . One of their three children, seven-year-old son Oliver, is autistic. Also set to appear on The Jump, which will be filmed in Innsbruck, Austria, is 36-year-old retired England rugby player, Mike Tindall, husband of Zara Phillips. It is believed the Yorkshire-born centre had to get permission from the Queen to take part. Strictly Come Dancing star Ola Jordan had also been due to take part in the series, but broke her leg during training, meaning she missed the Strictly finale and will be unable to participate in the Channel 4 show.","Mother-of-three flails as she careers down run at North London ski school .

"Twenty million homes have been warned of a hosepipe bans to cope with the worsening drought. But these images taken today show how in . some parts of the country how drought is not just a threat, it is . already a stark reality. Water companies in the South and East of England, where rainfall has been too low for nearly two years, are set announce restrictions affecting one in three homes in the UK. Other areas could soon follow. The move follows months of concern about the arid conditions, which have seen rivers run dry and reservoirs at record low levels. In some areas, this has been the driest winter since records began a century or more ago, and weeks of sustained rainfall would be needed to get levels back to normal. However yesterday was the second hottest day of the year and the Met Office says most of this week will be sunny and dry. It is not forecasting any significant rainfall in drought-affected areas over the next month. Anglian, Southern, Thames, South East and Veolia – which covers part of London and the Home Counties – are set to bring in bans which will start in two to four weeks, according to insiders. The companies have a total of around 20million customers. Portsmouth Water and Sutton and East Surrey Water may also announce restrictions this month. The warm weather is set to continue this week with temperatures hitting 17 degrees - five degrees up on normal and hotter than parts of Greece. Met Office forecaster George Goodfellow said it was set to be sunny and dry with similar temperatures throughout the week. Mr Goodfellow said: 'A band of high pressure coming from the north-west will stay with us this week bringing with it a spell of warm weather. 'Temperatures will get up to 17 degrees across the country which is pretty warm for this time of year. 'The average temperatures are between eight and 12 degrees (46F to 53F). One or two places could get even warmer than that, particularly in the south east.' No need for a bridge: The River Lavant has also totally disappeared at West Dean College, West Sussex . Water, water everywhere: Three years ago the River Lavant at West Dean was a picturesque waterway . He added there could be a chance of . frost as the temperatures cool down overnight but said on the whole the . next few days will remain mild. 'We won't really see anything much in the way of significant rainfall.' Currently 14 counties in the South, the East and the Midlands are officially in drought. Tomorrow’s announcement coincides with an Environment Agency report which will add the rest of the Midlands and Yorkshire to the area at ‘high risk’ of summer drought. The first step companies can take is restricting the use of hosepipes and sprinklers for washing cars and watering gardens. Those who flout a hosepipe ban face a £1,000 fine. Caps on non-essential business use such as watering golf courses, cleaning pavements and car washes could follow. There are fears that the restrictions could affect this summer’s Olympic Games and officials are said to be drawing up contingency plans. An Environment Agency spokesman would not comment on when water restrictions could be introduced but said: ‘Hosepipe bans are very effective at cutting water usage, especially in the summer months, as 50 per cent of water use is domestic.’ Levels of groundwater – which is needed to fill underground aquifers – are low at three-quarters of sites measured by the Environment Agency. Dry as a bone: The River Pang has run dry from Bucklebury to its source seven miles upstream at Compton . Scenic: A verdant stretch of the River Pang before the lack of rain of recent months took its toll . Reservoirs at Ardingley in West Sussex and Bewl in Kent are ‘exceptionally low’ at just 41 per cent of capacity, although some rivers returned to normal levels after rain last week. Helen Vale, national drought co-ordinator at the agency said: ‘Although river flows have increased slightly, the water underground is still exceptionally low for this time of year. Everyone must play their part by using water wisely. ‘Our drought prospects report will provide the outlook for water resources over the summer and what that will mean for abstractors, wildlife and public water supplies.’ The past months have seen fish dying in low rivers, cereal and potato crops affected, and wildlife habitats destroyed.

Last month the South East was also . declared to be in drought. This includes London, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, .

Anglian Water has seen the lowest rainfall, receiving just two-thirds of the long-term average last year. Spokesman Ciaran Nelson said . yesterday: ‘We’re prepared for dry weather here in the east but we could . never have anticipated the incredibly low rainfall that has left rivers . at such low levels, and prevented us filling our reservoirs at the time . of year when we need them to be topped up. To recover from a situation . like this will take months of persistent rain.’ Southern Water said it had had the driest ten months since 1888. A Thames Water spokesman said: ‘We can’t make it rain but we can do our bit to use a little less water. Summer sun: A woman enjoying Brighton beach yesterday morning . Riding out: Rachael Foister enjoys the hot weather and spring daffodils at West Dean College, West Sussex . ‘Switching . off the tap while brushing your teeth saves six litres and a minute . less in a shower saves ten.’ Veolia Water said: ‘The last eighteen . months have been exceptionally dry, so we really are seeing challenging . times.’ While south, . eastern and central areas have seen low rainfall, in the north west, . parts of the west and Scotland it has been plentiful over the past few . months with rivers bursting their banks. Alex . Neil, the Scottish Infrastructure Secretary, wrote to UK ministers last . week offering to provide drought-hit England with water. He . said: ‘With Scotland’s plentiful supply of water and superb industry . expertise, it is only right we offer our assistance in the long term,’ although he conceded there were ‘huge logistical issues’. Fire crews in drought-affected areas have been asked to cancel charity car washes, which raise tens of thousands of pounds. Meanwhile, the weather has claimed a casualty - in the shape of Scotland’s ski season. The . Scottish Children’s Ski Championships have been cancelled due to a lack . of snow - and it is feared there will be no more skiiing this season. Taking the plunge: A couple look set to brave the sea in Old Portsmouth . The . event, which was due to take place this coming weekend at CarinGorm . Mountain, was expected to attract around 200 competitors. Snowsport Scotland said that of about a dozen children’s alpine races planned this winter only one had run. None of Scotland’s five resorts were operating today and are not expected to re-open for snow sports this season. Lack of snow, mild weather and the strong winds have all been blamed for the lack of skiers on the pistes. Last year the season ended in mid-April and in 2010 it finished incredibly at the start of June. This year the last skiing was on February 26. 'It is unlikely there will be any . more skiing this year. Even by Scottish standards it’s an unseasonably . early end to the season. March is a month we have had very good skiing . in previous years,' said CairnGorm Mountain spokesman Colin Kirkwood. 'We have been doing snow dances for weeks but it hasn’t worked. 'Unless there is a sudden drop in temperatures and a big snowstorm - which is not forecast - that is it for this year.' Only . 44,783 skiers and snowboarders had been logged at CairnGorm so far this . season compared to 96,431 at the same time last year. 'It . looks like the season is over,' said a spokesman for Snowsports . Scotland. 'High temperatures and strong winds have just melted and blown . away what snow there was. The .

"The worst airlines for losing passengers' bags has been revealed - and the company formerly called American Eagle Airline took the bottom spot despite a recent attempt to reinvent themselves. It came last in a list compiled by the government which showed that it lost 8.82 bags per 1,000 passengers. It lost a total of 103,000 bags. The result is almost ten times as bad as Virgin America, which is the least likely to mishandle your stuff. Virgin had just 0.97 incidents per 1,000 of lost bags. Biggest loser: American Eagle airlines - which has since rebranded to Envoy Airlines - lost more bags per passenger than any others . Where's mine? Overall, all domestic U.S. airlines lost 3.71 bags for every 1,000 passengers . The airline - which rebranded to call itself Envoy Airlines this January - took the bottom spot for the second year in a row, after losing 25,000 more bags than it did in 2013. The latest figures cover the period from January to September this year, during which 1.6million pieces of luggage were lost or damaged. This was reported by a total of 436million passengers, giving an average rate of loss of 3.71 bags per 1,000, or just under 0.4 per cent. Staples Delta Airlines and JetBlue both scored better than average in the ranking, losing 2.08 and 2.44 bags per thousand respectively. However, the figures may be concealing an even bigger lost baggage problem, as they count all passengers on a plane rather than just those who check in bags. As an increasing proportion of fliers opt to check in no bags at all - which therefore cannot be lost. This means that the real rate of loss will be higher. A spokesman for Envoy told DailyMail.com: 'Envoy is actively working to improve its bag handling performance by adding equipment and employees its hubs. 'The company will also be developing and implementing several, larger company-wide initiatives to ensure fewer bags are mishandled throughout the Envoy system.'

"A landmark court victory against Lloyds Bank over unfair overdraft charges could open the floodgates for a billion-pound payout to customers. A judge at Taunton County Court ruled that the bank was wrong to hit Oliver Foster-Burnell’s bank account with hefty rising fees that drove him ever deeper into debt. Penalties totalling more than £700 made it impossible for the 28-year-old public health sector worker to pay other bills – and triggered a spiral of debt that paralysed his finances. Oliver Foster-Burnell and his wife Rachel won a significant victory against Lloyds Bank over rising fees . Only after the loyal Lloyds customer hired a debt management company did the bank stop imposing charges of up to £20 a day. In his ruling, Deputy District Judge Stockdale said the bank’s terms and conditions caused a ‘significant imbalance … to the detriment’ of Mr Foster-Burnell. He ordered the bank to reimburse £743 in charges plus interest. It was the first known legal victory for a customer on the fairness of charges since banks won a hearing over the legality of the fees in the Supreme Court five years ago. That ruling, on a technicality, dashed the hopes of millions trying to claim fee refunds. In the run-up to the 2009 case, bank customers, led by Money Mail’s Fair Play on Charges campaign, reclaimed millions of pounds. But the Supreme Court decision meant customers could no longer challenge their bank. Outraged at how severely the penalties pushed him into debt, Mr Foster-Burnell learned of a recent European Court of Justice ruling. This says that any charges increased within an agreement must be clearly explained, including an explanation of how they were worked out. With help from solicitor Howlett Clarke, Mr Foster-Burnell showed how individual clauses within Lloyds’ terms and conditions failed to do this. The judge at Taunton County Court in Somerset agreed. But, critically, Judge Stockwell said the judgment applied only to the claimant. Lloyds Bank imposed rising charges of £20 a day on Mr Foster-Burnell  which was later overturned . Mr Foster-Burnell appealed against this part of the ruling. Last week, he went back to court to ask it to rule that the Lloyds clauses relating to account charges are themselves unfair – not just in relation to his case. If the court agrees, it would apply to all bank customers, leaving banks open to huge payouts. Mr Foster-Burnell, 28, from Taunton, said: ‘It is unfair the banking industry is allowed to profit while people suffer financial hardship. By applying these charges, and allowing them to snowball out of control, it skews the imbalance. ‘We want the court to consider that such a system of charges can hit anyone badly – not just those in hardship – and is therefore unfair, and needs to be changed.’ A ruling is not expected until later this year. Until then, the county court ruling is not a legal precedent. However, judges can use it for guidance. Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, hailed the judgment as a boost for consumers. ‘These extortionate charges are hugely unfair and it is absurd that the present law merely says courts must turn a blind eye to this issue,’ he said. ‘It’s about time bank customers got the fair treatment that they are entitled to by law.’ Martin Lewis, founder of the Moneysavingexpert website, called Mr Foster-Burnell a pioneer. ‘It’s up to the court to decide if such a term can be unfair to all – regardless of whether they’re struggling in financial hardship,’ he said. ‘Potentially, we’re talking billions of pound.’ Money Mail first sounded the alarm on charges in 2005 when some banks began to raise fees for unauthorised overdrafts. The Fair Play on Charges campaign created a template letter for customers to help them reclaim the penalty fees. By July 2007, more than £800million had been paid out by banks and the OFT stepped in to try to resolve the situation for all customers. Although it scored early victories, the Supreme Court eventually ruled that the fees were part of a bank’s ‘core costs’ of providing a current account – and, on a technicality, couldn’t be assessed under rules on fairness. A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group said: ‘We do not discuss individual customer cases and any decision will be specific to its facts. However, the legal issues relating to bank charges were dealt with comprehensively and conclusively by the judgment of the Supreme Court.’ s.dunn@dailymail.co.uk .","Oliver Foster-Burnell was charged fees and penalties of more than £700 .

"A former Seventh Day Adventists pastor who set out in January to live a year without God could be set to become a full-time atheist when his eventful experiment comes to an end later this month. Ryan Bell, 43, made headlines in January when just days into his 'intellectual experiment' to explore atheism he was fired from his two teaching jobs at Christian schools near Los Angeles. Bell was left struggling to support his two young daughters, aged 10 and 13, until an atheist blogger set up an online fundraising site and helped raise over $27,000 to help him support his family. Scroll down for video . During his year without God, Ryan Bell has found love with Rebecca Pratt, who is a devoted Christian . For 19 years Bell had been a pastor, most recently the senior pastor at the Hollywood Seventh-day Adventists Church. Then in March 2013 he resigned his position due to differences over his liberal views - including campaigning against the same-sex marriage ban for gay and lesbians - that didn't go down well with the church. With his 17-year marriage also headed for divorce, Bell suffered a crisis of faith and in January 2014, he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the U.S. He decided to write a blog about that experiences called Year Without God - A Former Pastor's Journey Into Atheism. 'For the next 12 months I will live as if there is no God,' he wrote in his first entry. 'I will not pray, read the Bible for inspiration, refer to God as the cause of things or hope that God might intervene and change my own or someone else's circumstances. (I trust that if there really is a God that God will not be too flummoxed by my foolish experiment and allow others to suffer as a result).' With his 17-year marriage also headed for divorce, Bell suffered a crisis of faith and in January 2014, he began a yearlong journey to explore the limits of theism and the atheist landscape in the U.S. The past 12 months has proved many testing times for Bell, but he tells the L.A. Times that his also life has started to feel good again. Bell got a job teaching life skills at PATH, a nonprofit helping the homeless, and has also started dating again. His girlfriend, Rebecca Pratt, is - ironically - a devoted Christian but has been open-minded about his journey to live without religion for a year. As the months have progressed, Bell says he has became more and more comfortable with his new life. He currently describes himself as a 'weak atheist' and says he is comfortable with not having all the answers about the meaning of life and why we are here. Bell was left struggling to support his two young daughters, aged 10 and 13, until an atheist blogger set up an online fundraising site and helped raise over $27,000 to help him support his family . Over Christmas, Bell says he has no plans to attend any church services, although the former pastor he still loves the rituals. Then on January 1, his journey will be over and he is expected to make an announcement on his blog about if he is to remain an atheist or return to God. 'I do think I've now seen both sides of the coin,' he told the L.A. Times. 'Being with the atheists, they can have the same sort of obnoxious certainty that some Christians have, and I don't want to be a part of that. It feels like I'm stuck in the middle. 'I want to be for something good, but I don't want boundaries, and religion just feels like a very bounded thing. 'The question I am asking right now: Why do I need religion to love?'

She said: 'I do, just in full disclosure, want to say that in the last couple of minutes, for the first time today, we've seen protesters come out here and start yelling at groups of police who are mourning their slain police officers.' Ganim continued: 'It's just a few of them, Suzanne, and like I said, just in the last five minutes, and they're quite frankly yelling at a group of police officers who are standing here silently, just looking at the memorial of candles and flowers and posters, and they're yelling similar rhetoric that we've been hearing over the last couple of weeks related to the shooting of — the chokehold death of Eric Garner and the shooting of Michael Brown in Missouri.' Pei Xia Chen, the widow of murdered NYPD officer Wenjian Liu, fought back tears as she expressed her support for the family of Officer Rafael Ramos, the other officer shot and killed on Saturday . Widow Chen was surrounded by weeping family members as she spoke outside their Brooklyn home on Monday evening . She added that most officers she has spoken to have condemned the police union's attacks on Mayor Bill de Blasio, saying now is a time for peace. Ganim also emphasized that until that point she had seen no tension between the NYPD and the community at the memorial. ‘We’ve seen quite actually the opposite,’ she added. ‘We’ve seen community members coming here and shaking hands with police officers, giving them hugs. 'We’ve seen groups of officers, NYPD, showing up all day to pay their respects. They’re lighting candles side-by-side with the community. They’re interacting, they’re showing support to one another.’ Also on Monday, the wife of officer Liu broke her silence  and said her family was thankful for the support it has received following her husband's murder. Pei Xia Chen fought back tears as spoke about the man she had just married in September. 'His dreams were of providing for his current and growing family,' she said. Chen also expressed her support for the family of Officer Rafael Ramos who was on duty with Liu when the officers were shot and killed. 'We would also like to express our condolences to the officer Ramos' family,' said Chen. 'This is a difficult time for both of our families, but we will stand together and get through this together.' Chen was surrounded by weeping family members as she spoke outside their Brooklyn home. Wenjian Liu's family were from Canton, China, and had moved to the U.S. in 1994 when he was a 12-year-old boy. He had joined the NYPD in 2007 after majoring in accounting at The College of Staten Island. The couple had only married in September and were 'looking forward to having [their] own family', according to an earlier statement. 'He was an asset to the police department, using his Chinese language skills whenever and wherever it was needed,' read the statement. Funeral arrangements for Liu have not been announced, but his parents - who have been described as 'distraught' at losing their only son - are receiving help from authorities so that family members can travel from China to attend the service. Fallen: Officers Weinjen Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) were shot Saturday while eating lunch in a patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn . Mayor Bill de Blasio visited both officers' families on Monday and urged New Yorkers to stop anti-police protests in the wake of the officers' assassination during a press conference . Mayor Bill de Blasio visited both officers' families on Monday and urged New Yorkers to stop anti-police protests in the wake of the officers' assassination. He stressed the city's focus should remain on the grieving families. 'This is a time for every New Yorker to think about these families. Focus on these families. Put them first,' de Blasio said during a press conference on Monday afternoon. 'We can do that by respecting their pain, respecting their time of mourning. Until these funerals are past, let's focus just on these families, and what they have lost. I think that's the right way to try and build towards a more unified and decent city.' The mother of the gunman who murdered two NYPD officers on Saturday has also extended her condolences to their families and said she is 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions. Speaking on Monday, Shakuwra Dabre, 54, of Brooklyn said she identified with the families pain because she too had lost a son. 'I am still deeply sorry about what happened at the hands of my son,' she told  the Daily News . 'And please accept my deepest condolences, sincerely. Shakuwra Dabre, 54, of Brooklyn extended her condolences on Monday to the families of the two murdered officers and said she was 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions . Dabre said that her son had struggled with mental illness his entire life and had repeatedly refused attempts by the family to try and help him. 'Unfortunately, this situation happened and it culminated in the end of his life and the tragic loss of two innocent police officers,' she said. Dabre was out running errands on Saturday when she was alerted that her son was in trouble by the estranged mother of his child. She raced home and when she scanned the news on her laptop she saw a photo of a man lying on a stretcher accompanying a story about the shooting. 'I knew he was dead when I looked. I knew. He was gone. I knew he was my son,' Dabre told DNA Info through tears. When Dabre first saw the picture of her son on the stretcher, she didn't know he had shot and killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, she said. 'I was so torn when I saw him on that stretcher,' she said. 'Then I found out too that he did that. And I was horrified. Because I didn't want no loss of nobody's life.' Mourning: Eric Garner's 22-year-old daughter Emerald Snipes visited a memorial to two slain NYPD officers Monday, expressing her condolences to their families . Farewell: NYPD officers saluted while visiting the memorial to officers that had grown at the site of the police slaying . 'As a mother now I hurt for the loss of my son. Just like they're hurting for the loss of their sons.' The daughter of Eric Garner, whose chokehold death at the hands of a cop sparked mass protests against the NYPD, also offered her support for the family of two murdered officers on Monday. Emerald Snipes, 22, laid a wreath at the site where a cop-hunting gunman killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Weinjen Liu, and said she knows how it feels to spend the holidays without a father. 'I just had to come out and let their family know that we stand with them, and I'm going to send my prayers and condolences to all the families who are suffering through this tragedy,' Snipes told ABC. Assassin Ismaaiyl Brinsley used her father's death as justification for gunning down two innocent officers over the weekend. Snipes told the New York Post she visited the Ramos family. She also described being moved by a Facebook post from 13-year-old Jaden Ramos, expressing his grief over the death of his father. 'It hit my heart,' Snipes told the New York Daily News while she laid the wreath. 'I know how it feels in this season to not have your father around.' Prayers: A memorial for Officers Rafael Ramos and Weinjen Liu, who were shot while sitting in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, gathered wreaths and prayer cards from those expressing sorrow for the killing . Memorial: Snipes was joined by Dominique Sharpton, daughter of Rev Al Sharpton, who has been vocal about calling for protests in the wake of Garner's death by chokehold by a plainclothes NYPD officer . 'Today I had to say bye to my father,' Jaden wrote in his Facebook post. 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer.' Snipes was joined by Dominique Sharpton, daughter of Rev Al Sharpton, who has been vocal about calling for protests in the wake of Garner's death by chokehold by a plainclothes NYPD officer. 'I was never anti-police,' she added. 'Like I said before, I have family that's in the NYPD that I've grown up around, family reunions and everything so my family you know, we're not anti-police.' Tensions have escalated after the shooting by 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who wrote 'They take 1 of ours...let's take 2 of theirs' and referenced the deaths of Garner and Mike Brown on an Instagram post he made while traveling to New York from Baltimore. Some of the bitterest rhetoric has come from the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and its president Pat Lynch, who told reporters there was 'blood on many hands' on Saturday. Lynch placed blame on the mayor, Bill de Blasio, and protesters for the killing, his words echoing a memo circulated among officers, reported by the New York Times to be from the PBA, and stating the NYPD would now be a 'wartime police department.' Ramos's funeral is now scheduled for Saturday and the family will have a viewing Friday in Glendale, Queens. Family members of Liu are arriving from China, and his services have not been announced.","Group of 5 shouted about Eric Garner beside the memorial for slain officers .

"The woman who accused Jameis Winston of rape described receiving death threats over the case, but said she pushed forward in hopes women would not trust the FSU quarterback. The Orlando Sentinel reports that transcripts from a hearing over whether Winston violated the university code of conduct filled in details about the alleged assault in December 2012 and resulting fallout of the case. 'I was forced to leave FSU and my friends here,' the accuser said in front of retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding, who was asked to preside over the hearing by the university. Scroll down for video . Hearing: FSU quarterback Jameis Winston leaves a student conduct code hearing in early December, while transcripts revealed he defined consent with the accuser as 'moaning' 'I was subjected to a number of death threats, and my parents' home and work addresses were posted online.' 'I have had my most horrible life experience played out and debated in local and national media that couldn't care a less about me.' Winston also spoke in front of Judge Harding, at first declining and then later agreeing to answer a question posed by the former justice, according to ESPN. 'I would like to know in what manner, verbally or physically, that [the accuser] gave consent,' the former justice asked. 'Both, Your Honor, verbally and physically,' Winston answered. 'And what did she say and what did she do?' Harding questioned. 'Moaning is mostly physically. Well, moaning is physically. And verbally at that time, Your Honor,' Winston responded, before adding that this happened during the sexual encounter. The accuser detailed why she was pursuing the university hearing in the face of harassment and threats, stating that accountability would be 'worth it.' Departing: Winston's accuser said she had to leave FSU and received death threats and harassment as police investigated pursuing criminal charges . Demands: Winston's attorney David Cornwell previously submitted a letter to FSU officials claiming that an attorney for the accuser had tried to extort Winston for $7million . 'Respondent will no doubt go on to be an even bigger celebrity in NFL. But before he leaves here he deserves to have some accountability for his violent behavior,' the accuser said in transcripts. 'Perhaps even being expelled will have minimal deterrent effect on him. But if expulsion discourages even one other woman from trusting him in the future it will have been worth it,' she added. Winston's lawyer, David Cornwell, has accused the alleged victim of trying to extort the quarterback, claiming in a letter to FSU officials obtained by TMZ that the accuser's lawyer demanded $7million to settle sexual assault claims before the case had gone into the media. The New York Times found that the criminal investigation was so poorly conducted that police waited almost a year from the time the alleged victim reported the assault to interview a witness who recorded the act. By then, the digital video the witness, who was Winston's roommate and teammate, had recorded with his phone was gone, along with the phone itself. The hearing concluded with Harding stating the two sides presented conflicting arguments, and that the evidence was 'insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof.' Baine Kerr, one of the accuser's lawyers, was unhappy with how the hearing progressed and said it was just to 'whitewash' previous reports. 'I don't want to impugn the proceeding as corrupt, but I think it was biased and the fix was in, It's all about a football game 10 days from today,' said Kerr. 'It turned out to be just a predetermined whitewash to keep a guy playing football.'","A university hearing  found there was not sufficient evidence to prove whether or not the FSU quarterback was guilty of sexual assault .

"Shivering in the cold before dawn yesterday, more than 30 patients queue in the desperate hope of seeing a doctor. The scene, a bleak picture of a health service in crisis, is one repeated daily in many parts of the country. The patients lined up from 6.30am because it was their only hope of a same-day appointment with their GP at a heavily oversubscribed practice. The Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey is one of the biggest in Britain. Scroll down for video . Bleak: The patients lined up from 6.30am because it was their only hope of a same-day appointment with their GP at a heavily oversubscribed practice. The Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey is one of the biggest in Britain . Originally designed for 6,000 patients, it now serves nearly 19,000. Residents say the extra demand is a result of new housing developments springing up while few improvements have been made to health services. The surgery has 12 GPs, four of them recruited in the past two years to cope with increased demand, and hopes to recruit more. As its roll has increased, so has the NHS money flowing in – surgeries are paid £73.56 per patient, according to GP magazine Pulse. But patients at Sunbury Health Centre say the phone is continuously engaged so it is ‘impossible’ to ring for an appointment. If they do manage to book by phone, they face a wait of up to two weeks to see a doctor. The surgery is open weekdays from 7am until 6pm and like many across the country does not offer appointments in the evenings or at weekends – Labour’s 2004 changes to GP contracts allowed them to opt out of providing care outside office hours. Patients say the only option is to queue in the hope of seeing a doctor on the same day. Those queuing yesterday would otherwise not be seen until well into the new year. Retired nurse Sue Levi, 63, was trying to get an appointment for her five-month-old grandson Ethan. She said: ‘I’m queuing for my grandchild who is ill with bronchiolitis. You can’t bring a sick baby to queue in the cold at 7am. The nearest surgeries other than this are miles away.’ Waiting in line: Wrapped up against the cold, patients queue outside. They say the phone is continuously engaged so it is ‘impossible’ to ring for an appointment at this heavily subscribed health centre . Charlotte Cox, 36, an HR manager, said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s the third time I’ve been down here in the past week. The first time I didn’t manage to get an appointment, the second time I did but I had to stand in the rain and then again today. It’s not right.’ Tina Zander, 50, a secretary, said: ‘What if you are elderly and living on your own? You can’t expect them to come and queue. The surgery can’t take any more. It’s disgusting.’ Chauffeur Mark Carr, 54, tried to book an appointment by phone but was told the earliest date was January 5. He said: ‘I had no choice but to come down here. I’ve been here since 7am queuing. It’s ridiculous.’ The scene is not unique as GP surgeries across the country are being stretched to breaking point. In September the Mail reported NHS figures predicting that this year 58.9million GP appointments will have entailed a wait of a week or more – a rise of almost 50 per cent on 2012. And the queue in Sunbury may continue to grow unless something is done – the surgery expects a further 4,000 patients will sign up in the next three years. The practice has been lobbying for a new premises or money to redevelop the existing surgery. It said in its newsletter that it was trying to recruit more staff and doing its best to deliver ‘excellent primary care’. Kwasi Kwarteng, Tory MP for the Spelthorne constituency which includes Sunbury, said: ‘We have been trying to work this out with NHS England and we have not got as far as I would like. It’s bursting at the seams and it can’t continue much longer.’ A spokesman for Sunbury Health Centre said there had been an increase in patients seeking appointments before the Christmas holidays. It added: ‘We are currently reviewing our system. Although there may be a queue on certain mornings, all patients who require an appointment will be seen or telephoned by a GP the same day.’ Desperate: Patients say the only option is to queue in the hope of seeing a doctor on the same day. The scene pictured above is not unique as GP surgeries across the country are being stretched to breaking point . NHS England said: ‘We are aware of the challenges faced by Sunbury Health Centre and we are working closely with the practice to support them.’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘Every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs in many parts of the country.’ Some patients are bypassing GP surgeries to go to A&E, putting huge pressure on the emergency services. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted taking his children to A&E over a weekend because he didn’t want to wait for a GP appointment. A Conservative health spokesman said: ‘Eighty-five per cent of patients say they can get access to a GP quickly, but we know services are under pressure – that’s why a future Conservative government would guarantee seven-day access for everyone by 2020.’","More than 30 patients queued outside The Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey .

"Isolated: Age UK warned that nearly 400,000 people aged at least 65 were worried about being lonely this Christmas. Above, file image . Beleaguered A&E departments face being overwhelmed at Christmas by lonely, elderly people, Britain’s most senior casualty doctor said last night. The warning from Professor Keith Willett came as Care Minister Norman Lamb urged Britons to care for isolated neighbours to prevent the UK becoming a ‘neglectful society’. Professor Willett, the director for acute care for NHS England, said the impact of loneliness on older people could cause a major spike in admissions to A&E. Studies show sick people left alone over the festive period are more likely to go to casualty with worse problems. He urged any who are ill to call their pharmacist, GP or the NHS 111 helpline for advice, adding: ‘Don’t end up in A&E please.’ A&E departments are in crisis. Fewer than 90 per cent of patients were seen within four hours at casualty in the week up to December 14 – the worst week on record. Last night, the charity Age UK warned that nearly 400,000 people aged at least 65 were worried about being lonely this Christmas. In England, 51 per cent of all people over 75 live alone and 5million older people say the television is their main companion. Recent town hall cuts mean more councils are only sending carers round for 15-minute visits, even though this is often a pensioner’s only contact in a week. Research shows loneliness and social isolation are harmful to physical health. Studies indicate that lack of social connections is as likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Professor Willett cited a recent study in the South West that showed a clear link between social isolation and care needs in those over 75 admitted to A&E. He warned anyone feeling ‘under the weather’ to get treatment early, and urged people to join NHS England’s Winter Friends Campaign, which encourages people to look in on an elderly friend or neighbour over Christmas to make sure they are warm and coping well. He added: ‘Over Christmas we want to keep people out of A&E departments as far as possible. We know there is a correlation between people who are on their own and admission to hospital. ‘We often see a sharp spike in emergency admissions at this time of year and we know that the majority of these are elderly people who have stored up a health problem at home and haven’t sought treatment early hoping it will go away.’ Mr Lamb said too many people knew all about their friends on social media but nothing about those next door. If more people checked on vulnerable neighbours, he said, it would have a positive impact on their mental and physical health and ‘help give them their life back’. His plea came as official statistics showed just 44 per cent of elderly people receiving care services received as much social contact as they would like. The Lib Dem minister said he volunteered once a fortnight to visit a 90-year-old woman called Joyce, to take her books to read and have a chat. He added: ‘Christmas is a time of contrasts. For most it is a time of family, social occasions and warmth. For those who are lonely it couldn’t be more different. ‘For too many people Christmas is a time when loneliness becomes so acute as to be almost unbearable. ‘It’s the loneliness that gnaws away at us, steadily eroding our self-esteem and putting our mental and physical health at risk. ‘Strong communities and a fairer society means doing our bit. It means looking in on neighbours – using some of our spare time for the benefit of others. ‘If you know someone who may be lonely, pick up the phone, visit or volunteer as I have in a small way. You don’t know the difference it will make.’ This Christmas, think about the people who live in the houses you walk past each day - and the neighbours you have never met, urges Minister of State for Care and Support Norman Lamb . Call to action: Care Minister Norman Lamb, above,  urges Britons to get to know their neighbours . Christmas is a time of contrasts. For most it is a time of family, social occasions and warmth. For those who are lonely it couldn’t be more different. For too many people Christmas is a time when loneliness becomes so acute as to be almost unbearable. It’s the loneliness that gnaws away at us, steadily eroding our self-esteem and putting our mental and physical health at risk. It is a grim irony of modern life that we know the most intimate detail of our social media friends’ lives, but often not even our neighbours’ names. It can affect anyone and everyone and it is more complex than people living alone. It’s the husband caring for his wife who has dementia, it is the family recently bereaved or it is the man who has lost touch with work friends since he retired. Strong communities and a fairer society means doing our bit. It means looking in on neighbours. It means using some of our spare time for the benefit of others. We could all do more. We all want to do more. But in our busy lives it can be easy to forget that thousands of people can often go for days without speaking to the people they care about or without having contact with anyone at all. The Silver Line is a free confidential helpline providing friendship and advice to people. It is open 24 hours a day, every day of the year and I have seen for myself that it is a real lifeline for so many. I’ve spoken to some of the wonderful characters who call The Silver Line and it is plain to see that even a weekly call can make a difference. Local and national government play a critical role in the community but society as a whole holds the answers. We are all living longer and our extended families have often been dispersed far and wide and as a result there is more chance of us being alone, socially isolated and lonely. All of us – including me - have to be more creative with how we make our communities better especially to make sure we don’t become a neglectful society. Inclusive: Mr Lamb is encouraging people to be more creative with how they make their communities better to make sure that we don't become a neglectful society. (File image) I am thankful to the thousands of people who already volunteer across the country. I know first-hand the satisfaction I get from volunteering with the Royal Voluntary Society. I visit a woman called Joyce as part of the Books on Wheels service, once a fortnight I drop off books and stay for a chat. For some people who receive books as part of this service, the volunteer is the only person they ever see. I get a lot from the visit and I hope Joyce does too. She is a wonderful 90 year old with amazing fighting spirit. We cannot compel people to volunteer. Our role is to support those projects which help people to volunteer and to create an environment where volunteering activities can take place more easily. This is why we have given funding grants to Silver Line and other organisations. Formal care is also important, which is why we’ve given councils an extra £1.1 billion this year for social care and will go further next year by joining up health and care services through our £5.3 billion Better Care Fund. This integrated approach is already helping to tackle loneliness. For example, in Newquay and in Penwith, Cornwall, there are integrated care pioneer projects which are enabling older people to lead a more independent life and is helping to reduce A&E admissions. Local GPs link volunteers to people living alone. The simple act of friendship and companionship makes such a difference. You help to give that person their life back. And that has a positive impact on mental and physical health. This Christmas, New Year and beyond I want to encourage people to think about the people who live in the houses they walk past each day – the neighbours they don’t know and have never met. If you know someone who may be lonely, pick up the phone or visit. Or volunteer your time as I have done in a small way. You don’t know the difference it will make.","Impact of loneliness on older people could cause spike in A&E admissions .

She was once confronted by an angry mother on the bus, who was upset about having to fold up her own buggy to make space - but Ann doesn't care. She said: 'I told her I had a bad back and I was taking my dog for a day out so she should mind her own business. 'Shih tzus can get tired easily so it is a lot easier to push them around. They can be quite stubborn and won't walk far. 'In the summer it protects them from being burnt by the sun and we can have a nice day out. 'Some women tut at me but I think everybody knows me now and they love Diva and Abba. I don't care what anyone thinks.' Fun at the fair: Ann takes Abba and Diva for days out, like this trip to the fair to enjoy a ride on the tea cups . Day out: Ann, a nurse, does her best to keep seven-year-old Diva and one-year-old Abba entertained . As well as a bursting wardrobe and a bustling social life, the dogs have acquired a very sophisticated palate. The shih tzus are able to distinguish the difference between prime chicken breast and the cheaper alternative and won't dine on anything less than the best. Ann said: 'They eat fresh chicken and ham from M&S. If I get cheap chicken they know and they turn their noses up at it. Their antics are unbelievable at times. 'I take them to McDonalds once a month and they get a Happy Meal and every couple of weeks they get chicken chow mein from the Chinese takeaway. They love noodles and McDonalds fries.' This Christmas the dogs will be treated to a traditional turkey dinner with all the trimmings. And unsurprisingly, Ann plans to splash out on presents and Christmas outfits. She said: 'For Christmas I've bought them a camper van bed each. They already have four poster beds and a pink leather chaise longue but I want to make sure they're comfortable. 'They've also got new clothes and a new outfit for Christmas day and lots of toys but I've still got things to buy.' No more empty nest: Ann said her dogs are part of the family and comforted her daughter moved out . Birthdays are also a special occasion in the McNeilage household, and each dog is thrown a party to celebrate their special day. Ann said: 'They always have a themed party for their birthday. They've had a princess one, a Disney one and a fairy one but I pick a different theme every year. 'Sometimes my friends bring their dogs and they all sit around the table in their little party hats. 'I get them a personalised cake made specially at the bakers and we all sit down and have a slice.' Ann has caused controversy with the amount she has spent on her pets, but she says there is no way she would rather spend her money. She said: 'It's my money and it's my interest. If people worked out what they spent on alcohol it would be a lot more. 'People have said to me that I should donate that money to charity, but do you donate the money you spend on your hobby to charity? I don't think so. They're worth every penny.' The dogs get their own themed birthday parties complete with a specially-made cake . They're worth it: The pets will get their own roast dinner with all the trimmings on Christmas Day . For Ann the dogs are a perfect companion, and have helped to ease her 'empty nest syndrome' since her daughter Amanda, 30, left home. Ann said: 'It's like having two daughters. I call them my girls and they're part of the family. They act like children, it reminds me of when my daughter was younger. 'They fight for attention and try and steal each other's space on the sofa to get closer to me. 'They get very jealous and I have to have one on each side. Their antics are brilliant, they're great dogs. There's toys everywhere, it's like having two kids. 'Getting the dogs was the best thing I've done, it's changed my life. They're my babies and spoiling them makes me happy.'","Ann McNeilage, 50, from Inverclyde, Scotland, says dogs are her babies .

"Stitchers in the tiny Channel Island of Alderney have completed the missing final piece of the famed Bayeux Tapestry. The embroidery, which tells the story of the final days of King Harold's encounter with William the Conqueror, has until now left out the coronation of William. Instead, the final scenes showed the death of the Anglo-Saxon King, Harold Godwinson, following his army’s defeat at Hastings. Stitchers in the tiny Channel Island of Alderney have completed the missing final piece of the famed Bayeux Tapestry. Alderney’s tapestry was masterminded by 72-year-old Kate Russell (left) who dreamt up the project. It will be on display at Bayeux in Normandy from 1 July until 31 August . But a team of embroiderers on Alderney, a small island just off the coast of William’s native Normandy, have spent a year finishing the job. According to a report by Ben Chapple in the BBC, they made an effort to choose the right fabrics, colours and similar types of wool to the medieval original. The new tapestry is the same height as the original and 10ft (3m) long, with four panels showing events following the Battle of Hastings and ending in William’s coronation. The first of four scenes shows William and his half-brothers dining on the battlefield at Hastings. The bodies of the slain lie scattered about where they have fallen. The caption reads 'Here Duke William dines' The original tapestry (pictured) ends with the Anglo-Saxons leaving the battlefield. The new ending features William's coronation in Westminster Abbey . This scene depicts early December in 1066. William has crossed the Thames at Wallingford and has reached Berkhamstead where the nobles submit to his rule. The caption reads, 'Here the nobles of London surrender' The first written record of the Bayeux Tapestry is in 1476. It was described in the cathedral at Bayeux as 'a very long and narrow hanging on which are embroidered figures and inscriptions comprising a representation of the conquest of England.' The Bayeux Tapestry is thought to have been commissioned in the 1070s by Bishop Odo of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror. It is over 230 feet (70 metres) and tells the story of the final days of King Harold's  encounter with William the Conqueror. The tapestry consists of some fifty scenes with captions embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. Since it was 'rediscovered' by scholars in the 18th Century, its final scene - thought to show the coronation of William - has been missing. According to legend, French revolutionary soldiers took it from the cathedral intending to cut it up to use as wagon covers. The Latin text reads: ‘Here Duke William ate. Here the nobles of London gathered. Here William was given the royal crown. And here the Englishmen proclaimed the King.’ An Old English phrase from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 1066 is also included. It translates to: ‘The end will be good, as God wills.’ The final design is now on display next to the original at the Bayeux Tapestry Museum in Normandy. Fran Harvey, one of the Alderney stitchers told the BBC: ‘It becomes like a drug. I’d tell my husband I’m just going to pop to the library for half an hour and return two and a half hours later.’ Experts had previously pointed out that the opening of the tapestry has a figure of King Edward the Confessor enthroned. Around the middle point of the tapestry there is an image of William’s enemy Harold enthroned. ‘It would be a neat symmetry and make perfect sense of the story if the end of the tapestry had showed the victorious William enthroned, which is what the Alderney team have chosen to do,’ said Professor Robert Bartlett from the University of St Andrews. William's worried look as he is crowned may be due to the shout of acclamation, which was thought to be a cry of rebellion. The caption reads: 'Here they gave the crown of the kingdom to William’, and ‘And here the English acclaim the king’ The final panel depicts Christmas Day in 1066 when Duke William of Normandy was acclaimed king of England. The caption, between the turrets of the Tower is in old English and reads: 'The end will be good, as God wills' The stitching was done on Alderney, a small island just off the coast of William's native Normandy . There are some Channel Island references that would indicate that the final panel could never have been part of the original work. This is the inclusion in the upper border of Scene Two depicting Wace, the author of the Roman de Rou, which tells the history of the Normans from the settlement of Normandy through to the reign of Henry II. Wace states that William sailed to England with 696 ships. He says, ‘but I have heard my father say—I remember it well, although I was but a lad- that there were seven hundred ships, less four, when they sailed from St. Valery’. This might just have been possible, but Wace was writing in the 1160s, and the tapestry, it is believed, was created within 20 years of the Battle of Hastings. His inclusion in this work is because he was born in Jersey. Alderney’s tapestry was masterminded by 72-year-old Kate Russell who dreamt up the project. It will be on display at the Bayeux Tapestry Museum in Normandy, France until 31 August. Among the details in the borders are animals representing the Channel Islands such as a donkey for Guernsey .

"A war veteran who turned up in Normandy after he was reported missing from his care home in England has been flooded with cards and gifts for his 90th birthday. Bernard Jordan, whose birthday is today, disappeared from The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex, embarking on a cross-channel trip for the 70th anniversary of D-Day wearing his war medals underneath his grey mac. But the former Royal Navy officer decided his birthday should be more low-key and is celebrating it quietly with friends and his wife Irene, a spokesman for the veteran said. Normandy veteran Bernard Jordan said he was overwhelmed by the number of cards and gifts he had received for his 90th birthday . Bernard Jordan, whose birthday is today, made headline news around the world when he disappeared from The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex . The Candy Girls, who met Mr Jordan on his way to France, will also be singing to him, the spokesman said. The former mayor of Hove said he wanted to thank everyone for their good wishes after being inundated with at least 2,500 birthday cards from around the world following his Normandy adventure. Mr Jordan said: 'I just can't believe it. It's quite overwhelming to be honest. 'I want to thank everyone who sent me a card or a gift. Sadly I can't thank everyone in person so I hope they get this message. 'I'm just one man and I'm nothing special. Anyone would think I'd defeated Hitler on my own. 'There were a lot of other people on the beaches of Normandy that day, this lovely attention is for them really, not me.'

D-Day veteran Bernard Jordan in Ouistream, Normandy, with two of the Memphis Belles, Adele Leatham and Julie Maguire . Mr Jordan also said he welcomed the news that Chancellor George Osborne would be setting aside money allowing D-Day veterans to continue making their annual pilgrimage to Normandy. The money will come from fines levied on banks involved in the Libor scandal, according to the Treasury. The scandal saw banks falsely fixing interest rates while lending money to each other in order to make a profit or to appear more creditworthy. Mr Jordan's disappearance on June 5 sparked a police search and his whereabouts was only uncovered when a younger veteran from Brighton phoned later that night to say he had met the veteran on a coach on the way to France, and that they were safe and well in a hotel in Ouistreham. Following Mr Jordan's return, Mayor of Brighton and Hove Brian Fitch said the war veteran should be honoured with the freedom of his home city - which has previously been given to a select few including First World War hero Henry Allingham, Olympic champion Steve Ovett and Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi. Mr Fitch said he would be writing to the local authority's chief executive Penny Thompson and a special council meeting could be held next month to agree the proposal.","Bernard Jordan celebrated quietly with friends and his wife Irene .

"A flight attendant has revealed the definition of a series of unusual words and phrases used by cabin crew. For most people, hearing the expression ‘bidding’, ‘slam-clicker’ and 'coach-roach' will mean virtually nothing at all. But to the experienced stewards and stewardesses, it is a language they are very familiar with. Scroll down for video . Flight attendant Sarah Steegar has revealed the definition of a series of unusual words and phrases used by cabin crew. 'Pax' is slang for 'passengers' Sarah Steegar, a flight attendant with a major US carrier for the past 15 years, explains the hidden meaning behind many of the words. Writing for the frequent flyer website Flyertalk, Ms Steeger reveals what exactly the crew are talking about when they use their own code in-flight... Bidding . ‘This is the monthly process of telling the airline what you’d like for your next work schedule — a competition based on seniority.’ Deadhead . Everybody loves this one, but few use it correctly. It means flying as a passenger — as a company assignment. Basically, the airline needs you to be somewhere other than where you are, and you cannot or are not needed to work the flight. Best guess is it’s an old theatre term. Slam-click(er): ‘When a crew member goes to the hotel and does not emerge again until it’s time to leave' Coach roach: ‘Used wryly, usually for flight attendants who prefer working in the main/coach cabin' Furlough . When airlines need to shrink, most don’t 'lay off,' they 'furlough.' If the business bounces back within a certain amount of time, the airline has to offer you your job back before they can hire new stews or pilots off the street. Pax . ‘Passengers’. Slam-click(er) When a crew member goes to the hotel and does not emerge again until it’s time to leave. As in: slamming the door and clicking the lock. End of story. Can be used as a noun or a verb. ('I’m so tired I’m just gonna slam-click.' or 'You won’t see her for dinner. She’s a slam-clicker.)’ Coach roach . Used wryly, usually for flight attendants who prefer working in the main/coach cabin. 'Business? No thanks. I’m a coach roach all the way, baby!' Bidding: According to Ms Steegar, the expression refers to 'the monthly process of telling the airline what you’d like for your next work schedule — a competition based on seniority' Blue juice . The blue water in the toilets. Not to be confused with your bonus term, 'crew juice', a special cocktail to be enjoyed on the van ride to a long layover hotel, usually as a sort of sleep-aid after an all-night flight. Recipes vary and may be subject to competitive secrecy. Crotch watch . Nickname for walking through the cabin to do a seatbelt check. Also called a 'groin scan'. Landing lips . To put on 'landing lips' is to refresh one’s make-up at the end of a flight.","Coded language used by cabin crew and pilots on board planes .

"Dead: Victor Brannstrom had just scored for his team when he collapsed on the pitch . A striker for Sweden's fourth-tier football league collapsed and died on the pitch in front of shocked fans just minutes after scoring. In an echo of Bolton Wanderers star Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a mid-match heart attack in March, Victor Brannstrom was jogging back to his team's half of the pitch when he fell to the ground. The 29-year-old had just put his team, Pitea IF, 1-0 up when he collapsed shortly after scoring in the match against Umedalen yesterday. The match was abandoned as medics tried to revive Brannstrom on the pitch as they waited for an ambulance. However, he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital. The cause of death was not immediately clear. Swedish news agency TT says Brannstrom had passed out during a match earlier this year. He took a break from the sport to undergo medical tests but returned after doctors found nothing wrong. Christer Berglund, Pitea IF spokesman, said: 'He was totally unmarked and was jogging back when he just collapsed. 'People ran out to him right away and within 20 seconds I'd called for an ambulance.' Officials say Brannstrom had . collapsed in training earlier this year but a series of tests had failed . to identify any health problems. Bergland . added: 'We can't undo what's been done.

"The smell of a black truffle has been described as earthy, pungent, euphoric and even sexy. These delicacies, which can sell for £860 to £3,000 ($1,345 to $4,700) per kilogram, cause the pigs and dogs that hunt them to fall under a frantic spell. Now researchers in Italy have discovered that a ‘bliss molecule’, similar to the trahydrocannabinol (THC) compound found in cannabis, may be behind black truffle’s potent powers. A black truffle's scent has been described as earthy, euphoric and even sexy. These delicacies, which sell for £860 to £3,000 ($1,345 to $4,700) per kilogram, cause animals that hunt them to fall under a frantic spell . The molecule, named anandamide, behaves like the psychoactive ingredient found in majijuana to release mood-enhancing chemicals in the brain, according to a report by Nic Fleming at the BBC. Mauro Maccarrone, of the Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome, Italy, explained that anandamide is also used in humans to trigger the release of melanin. Scientists have dubbed the compound the ‘bliss molecule’ due to the way it can change mood, memory, appetite and depression. Its creation in black truffles create the plant’s dark colour. These prized culinary ingredients, the researchers found, do not have the required receptors that anandamide binds to, meaning that black no use for the chemical. Black truffles may have evolved this chemical make-up to encourage pigs and dogs to sniff them out . Earlier this year, a separate study by Dr Richard Spilvallo at Goethe University in Frankfurt found that truffles owe their unique smell and flavour to dirt. The research team said that bacteria from the surrounding soil becomes trapped inside the truffles as they grow, creating their distinctive smell. The compounds produced by the bacteria, which contain high levels of sulphur, can also be detected by humans causing their highly desirable flavour. Truffles are the fruiting body of a family of fungi that grow underground in a mutually-beneficial relationship with tree roots. They are notoriously difficult to cultivate and there have been attempts to grow truffles in the UK and other parts of the world but it is thought they need the right mix of minerals, soil, bacteria and trees to be successful. Research from Italy has shown that truffles can only reproduce sexually - which makes them distinct from other fungi that can only self-fertilise and reproduce asexually. Instead, they believe that black truffles may have evolved this chemical make-up to encourage animals such as pigs and dogs to sniff them out, BBC Earth says. It may sound counterintuitive, but the fungus’ tiny spores are spread over a wider area if the anandamide-intoxicated animal eats the truffle, rather than if it is left alone. The team now want to look at whether whether white, burgundy and Bianchetto truffles have also evolved the chemical profile. Earlier this year, a separate study by Dr Richard Spilvallo at Goethe University in Frankfurt found that truffles owe their unique smell and flavour to dirt. The research team said that bacteria from the surrounding soil becomes trapped inside the truffles as they grow, creating their distinctive smell. The compounds produced by the bacteria, which contain high levels of sulphur, can also be detected by humans causing their highly desirable flavour. Researchers also found that high levels of these aroma producing bacteria lead to the truffles having a far shorter shelf life as they break down the fungi. They hope to use their results to find ways of predicting how long a truffle might last on the shelf once dug up.

"The mother of a three-year-old taken to Syria by his father to fight for ISIS has begged the terror group to send her son home, saying she 'never stops thinking about him'. Lidia Herrera issued the tearful plea on an Italian talk show after images of her son Ismail, 3, wearing a black headband and carrying an AK-47 were posted online by accounts linked to ISIS. The boy's father, Ismar Mesinovic, was killed fighting in Aleppo in September, but Miss Herrera had not heard from or seen her son for a year until the picture emerged. Lidia Solana Herrera says this image shared on social media accounts linked to ISIS terrrorists shows her son Ismail, who was taken by his father to Syria last year to fight for the terror group . Ismar Mesinovic (left, with unknown friend) holds son Ismail who he kidnapped and took to Syria to sign up for ISIS, before he was killed in Aleppo, leaving the child abandoned . Miss Herrera (pictured on an Italian talk show) says she thinks about her son every day and hopes he will be returned to her,and has begged ISIS to return him to her . Speaking to TV programme Ano Uno, she said: 'I never stop thinking about him; whether he is cold, whether he’s hungry, if he needs me. He is small. He needs his mother. 'I beg these people to let me speak to him, to see a photo. Without him I don’t know what I am going to do.’ In a separate interview with Il Giornale she added: 'I want him back in my arms. In the name of Allah give me back my son. 'They say they are real believers but what they are doing is wrong. It is not right to tear a child away from its mother. 'I hope that they look into their hearts and think about me a mother who is desperately searching for her son. Even if my husband told them to raise him I am his mother and I love Ismail like every mum in the world.' Miss Herrera says she had no idea her husband was a radical, saying he talked about women and children being killed in Syria, but did not seem angry about it . Miss Herrera (left) was raised as a Catholic in her home country of Cuba, but converted to Islam 'out of love for my husband' (right) Miss Herrera made a tearful appeal for Ismail's (pictured) return on Italian TV, saying she thinks about him all the time 'whether he is cold, whether he’s hungry, if he needs me' The heartbreaking image shows Ismail wearing a black headband inscribed with Arabic writing while walking across a battle-scarred landscape holding the hand of an unknown man. While it is not known when exactly the image was taken, this man is unlikely to be the boy's father as he is believed to have been killed during fighting in September. ISIS sees children as central to its mission to create a Caliphate in the Middle East, and has long actively recruited youngsters. Children are indoctrinated into a life of violence early, often witnessing executions, and are encouraged to stage mock beheadings using toys. Fighters will often post images of their youngest recruits, which they refer to as 'cubs', and Islamic state Twitter feeds promote services offered to children, such as free healthcare and schooling. Miss Herrera lives in the northern Italian town of Belluno, but originally comes from Cuba. She was raised as a Catholic but converted to Islam 'out of love for my husband', who comes from Bosnia and has family in Germany. She said she often visits her family back in Cuba, and added  it was not unusual for her husband to care for the child while she went away. So when she handed her son over last year, she had no idea Ismail would be taken to Syria. She added: I never had the faintest suspicion my husband was a terrorist. ‘I remember he was very upset by the massacres in Syria. He always watched the reports on TV about the war. 'He would talk to me about women and children who were killed but he seemed normal. I could never have imagined that he would go to Aleppo to die. ‘He would go to the mosque but when he came back he was completely normal. 'He never spoke to me about recruiters who came to talk to him. If he had done I would never have let him take the little one away. “When I knew they had left for Syria it was like everything around me fell apart. My little one in Syria...You can only imagine how a mother feels in front of news like that.” Miss Herrera says she had no idea that her estranged husband, who is now believed to have been killed in the fighting, was a terrorist (file image of a fighter holding the ISIS flag) According to La Repubblica anti-terrorism police and secret service officers are now investigating the boy's disappearance. They are believed to be probing a group of Islamists who operate in the northern Veneto region, along with a notorious imam, Bilal Bosnic who is accused of recruiting many of Italy’s jihadis. Miss Herrera added: 'I never had the faintest suspicion my husband was a terrorist. When I knew they had left for Syria it was like everything around me fell apart.

"Children as young as two are being prescribed ‘chemical cosh’ drugs to curb hyperactivity – in defiance of official guidance. More than one in five psychologists are aware of children under five on drugs such as Ritalin to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other behavioural conditions, according to a survey of health professionals. Psychologists warned that overstretched health workers were increasingly going ‘straight to medication’ instead of offering behaviour therapy and parenting support. Scroll down for video . More than one in five psychologists are aware of children under five on drugs such as Ritalin to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other behavioural conditions . And they highlighted a growing ‘intolerance of difference’ which meant that children who struggled to fit in to certain environments were perceived to have ‘something wrong with them’. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which sets national standards for healthcare, states that ‘drug treatment is not recommended for pre-school children with ADHD’. Ritalin – a brand name for methylphenidate – is also not licensed in the UK for use in children under six, since ‘safety and efficacy in this age group has not been established’. Doctors are warned they must take full clinical responsibility if they choose to prescribe it. The survey by the British Psychological Society’s Division of Educational and Child Psychologists covered 136 educational psychologists in 70 local authorities across the UK. Some 22 per cent of respondents reported being aware of pre-school children taking stimulant drugs contrary to NICE guidelines. It also emerged that among school-age children ‘medication was felt to be the predominant form of treatment’ despite further NICE advice that psychological therapies should be tried before drugs. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which sets national standards for healthcare, says ‘drug treatment is not recommended for pre-school children with ADHD’. File photo . Vivian Hill, one of the study’s authors, said: ‘It is almost certainly to do with the fact that the whole of children’s mental health services is incredibly underfunded.’ Miss Hill, director of professional educational psychology training at the University College London Institute of Education, added: ‘I have certainly seen reference to children of two and three who have been prescribed medication.’ These were likely to be ‘severe’ cases, she added. But she warned of potential risks to children’s health. ‘We have no idea about the long-term consequences of exposure to this medication,’ she said. The Department of Health said: ‘Children’s mental health is a key priority, which is why we’ve formed a taskforce to look at how we can provide the best possible care, and have invested £54million in improving access to psychological treatments.’","More than one in five psychologists aware of children under five on drugs .

"It's that time of year when many of us realise just how frail our elderly relatives have become - and, in turn, fear for their safety. Now, a new wristband promises to ease the fears of family members - and gives the wearer more confidence about their wellbeing. Buddi, as it is known, works as a 24/7 monitoring and personal emergency response service. It not only tracks the user's whereabouts using GPS, but alerts their next of kin or carers if the person appears to be in trouble. The Buddi system not only tracks the user's whereabouts using GPS, but alerts their next of kin or carers if the person appears to be in trouble. It comes in three parts - the wristband, the clip (left, which can be attached to a lanyard or keyring) and the dock (centre). While the waterproof wristband goes everywhere with the user, tracing movement and raising an alert if it detects a fall, the clip remains in the charging dock, plugged in at home, and 'talks' to the wristband . Unlike traditional 'around the neck' alert devices, Buddi works outside the house and even abroad . The aim of the device is to give the wearer independence and both them and their family peace of mind. And unlike traditional 'around the neck' alert devices, Buddi works outside the house and even abroad. It comes in three parts - the wristband, the clip (which can also be attached to a lanyard or keyring) and the dock. While the waterproof wristband goes everywhere with the user, and and traces movement and raises an alert if it detects a fall, the clip goes in a pocket or handbag and 'talks' to the wristband. The dock provides accurate indoor location point, charges the devices and communicates wirelessly with them, displaying clip and wristband battery charge levels. There is also an alert button, allowing the wearer to contact and speak to the 24/7 alarm-monitoring centre in case of an emergency, via a portable clip. Safe areas can be created for the wearer which alert carers, friends or family members if broken. And unlike many personal alarms which are taken off at night, by wearing the wristband at night - when many falls happen on the way to the bathroom - users are better protected, knowing that a fall will be alerted. According to research by the Royal Voluntary Service charity, more 20 per cent of people aged over 75 fear falling. And of these, 5 per cent are so fearful that they will not leave their homes unaccompanied, the report found. A third of them had suffered falls in recent years and a fifth of these said they had lost confidence as a result. Many said they were especially worried during winter months. The aim of the device is to give the wearer independence and both them and their family peace of mind. Assigned relatives can log on and see an activity log, for example . The wristband goes everywhere with the user. It traces movement and raises an alert if it detects a fall . Every year in the UK nearly three-quarters of a million people aged over 60 end up in the local A&E department after a fall, and one in three of these will end up staying in hospital because of their injuries. Figures show around a third of adults who are over 65 and living at home will experience at least one fall a year. This rises to half of adults over 80 who are either at home or in residential care. In 2009 in England and Wales, there were more than 3,500 deaths as a result of falls. With the Buddi wristband, an individual’s personal settings can be configured via the buddi website through a secure user login area. If the wearer presses the alert buttons for help, or if the system detects the person has fallen, the 24 hour monitoring service can find information about their location, talk to them through the clip to establish the kind of assistance they require, and notify emergency contacts. If the wearer cannot be reached - perhaps because they are unconscious or because they can't physically reach the clip - the monitoring team will try to alert other registered emergency contacts. Falls are detected  automatically, so even if someone is incapacitated as a result of a fall, the system still works without having to be activated by hand. The wristband also monitors activity levels - and with the option of setting expected activity level, flags up if a person is moving more or less than normal . The graphs - made from a movement log - help you to identify sleep patterns and monitor restless sleep and nighttime activity . A sensor called an accelerometer inside the wristband measures the changes in movement that result from a fall. The wristband also monitors activity levels - and with the option of setting expected activity level, flags up if a person is moving more or less than normal. The graphs - made from a movement log - help you to identify sleep patterns and monitor restless sleep and nighttime activity. 'The idea is that no one need ever be alone,' founder Sara Murray told MailOnline. 'It helps relieve the burden on ordinary families, who are often caught in a balancing act between allowing their parents or grandparents to retain their independence by being on hand, but then losing their own independence in the process.' Ms Murray, a technology entrepreneur, created Buddi in 2005 after the horror she felt when her young daughter temporarily disappeared at a supermarket. She was recently named Most Promising Women Entrepreneur by Fortune Magazine – and Buddi was the only UK-based business on this year’s ten-strong list of companies. Ms Murray added: 'At Buddi, we operate a fully staffed emergency monitoring centre in the UK where trained operators are on hand 24/7, 365 days of the year, to react to emergency alerts and inform registered contacts of emergencies so that they can provide assistance. Just last week, Buddi won a contract to supply an initial 50,000 units to a U.S. company . 'The technology used in the new Buddi can also be used to remotely monitor a person's general welfare, enabling care to be delivered to a much larger number of people at no extra cost to the tax-payer.' Buddi is currently working with over 100 UK local authorities and NHS Trusts to help protect vulnerable people from harm. According to a cost-benefit analysis completed by the economist John Kay, Buddi's technology could save the government £2bn. This is because its technology, on average, delays the need for residential care – which costs about £60,000 a year for each patient – by about nine months. And just last week Buddi won a contract to supply an initial 50,000 units to Intel-GE Care Innovations, a U.S. company which provides technology-based health management solutions for individuals and institutions. The deal will see the distribution of the wristband device across America, which will help senior and vulnerable people remain independent for longer, the company says. Prices are either £249 to purchase the equipment and £5 a week for 24-7 (for fully staffed emergency support for any alert,) or £10 a week to lease the same service.

Paul Gohla, 93, says the wristband (pictured right) has dramatically improved his confidence . Having lost his beloved partner Annie, living in a rural area and with the cold weather kicking in, Mr Gohla had lost his confidence somewhat. His carer, Sarah Boocock, said: 'The Buddi device has definitely made him more comfortable. The moment he put it on his confidence boomed. 'It has given him a bit of extra security and should he be taken poorly, myself and his next of kin can log on and see exactly where he is. It's reassuring for us, as well. 'It's good because it doesn't just work in the home - he can get out and about. 'It works really well for him and he really likes it. Before, he was nervous going out in cold, icy weather as we live in a rural area. 'Now, he's getting on  the bus to Halifax, 20 miles away. It has really opened up his world again and made him more active. 'If I pop round and he's not in, or I can't find him, then I can log in and see where he is.' The device also helped a friend of Mr Gohla's when he was in need. Arriving at her house, he could see she was unwell and so pressed his Buddi. 'After speaking to someone at the call centre, staff there contacted me and I called an ambulance and the friend's daughter. She was very impressed.' Mr Gohla told MailOnline: 'It's a very good thing - I feel much safer now.' Mr Gohla's carer, Sarah Boocock, said the Buddi device was working very well for him. 'Before, he was nervous going out in cold, icy weather as we live in a rural area. Now, he's getting on the bus to Halifax, 20 miles away. It has really opened up his world again and made him more active'","Buddi is a 24/7 monitoring and personal emergency response service .

"YouTube has been warned to remove 20,000 videos by artists, including Pharrell Williams and the Eagles, or face a $1 billion lawsuit, it has been reported. Irving Azoff and his company, Global Music Rights (GMR), are behind the complaint and are said to be representing the interests of around 40 music stars. Mr Azoff has reportedly told the video-sharing site that they do not have the performance rights for thousands of songs they offer on its streaming service. Global Music Rights are representing Pharrell Williams, pictured right, and John Lennon, pictured left, as they battle YouTube for the removal of around 20,000 songs . Many of the songs, by the likes of John Lennon, Smokey Robinson, and  Chris Cornell were previously managed by ASCAP and BMI, the Hollywood Reporter says. Mr Azoff has reportedly claimed that although YouTube may have negotiated deals with the record labels, they have not done the same with the artists. He told the Hollywood Reporter that his clients wanted to pursue YouTube, as apposed to other sharing sites, because they have been 'least cooperative' and are 'the worst offenders.' The website claims that YouTube has said they do have the rights for the public performances of the videos due to prior deals. YouTube has been contacted by the MailOnline, but has not yet responded to the request for a comment. The news re-ignites the debate about the rights of musicians and digital access to their songs. It also comes as Google prepares to launch its own subscription music service.

"A size 30 mother-of-two lost an incredible 9st in 12 months after a festive photo taken last year revealed she was bigger than her Christmas tree. Samantha Feast vowed to shed the pounds after the embarrassing snap showed her with a huge stomach, giant double chin and a round face. The 43-year-old, from Warminster, Wiltshire, ditched her favourite pizzas and garlic bread smothered with cheese after her weight crept up to 21st 7lb. Scroll down for video . Samantha gasped in horror at this photo her husband had taken of her next to their Christmas tree last year . Samantha has managed to drop from 21st 7lb and size 30 (left) to 12st 7lb and a size 14 (right) Her size 28 jeans were bursting at the seams but she refused to buy a size 30. Last Boxing Day, Samantha scrolled through the images on her phone reliving the Christmas she had just enjoyed. But she gasped in horror at a photo her husband David had taken of her - and vowed next Christmas would be different. Now, thanks to that photograph, Samantha is a size 14. She said: 'This will be my first slim Christmas and I can't wait. I used to dread finding a party outfit but now I've had my pick in all the shops. Samantha (left, before she lost weight) got even bigger during her two pregnancies, continuing to live of processed food after her children were born, but now (right) eats a balance diet of fresh foods . 'I was horrified when I saw the picture of me next to the Christmas tree but I'm so glad David took it. It has changed my life. Confidence is the best present I could ask for.' Mother to Anna, 16, and Kate, 12, Samantha says she can't remember a time when she wasn't overweight. 'My whole family were food lovers and I grew up enjoying lovely big meals around the table with the family,' she said. 'I was always urged to clear my plate and happily obliged.' But her waistline suffered and by the time she turned 18 she already weighed 15st and wore a dress size 18. She was a size 20 when she met and married David, 44, an office manager. Samantha used to over-indulge on a diet high in carbohydrates and processed foods . 'My weight didn't bother him at all. He loved me as I was so I didn't worry,' she said. Then while pregnant with their first child, Samantha made the most of 'eating for two'. 'I just gave in to anything I fancied. It was like a free pass to eat however much I wanted without feeling too greedy,' she said. Their daughter Anna was born in 1998, followed by Kate in 2001 and Samantha's frame continued to grow. 'Eating for two had left me with a bigger appetite than before,' she explained. Juggling two children with two jobs, as a hairdresser and a part-time nursery assistant, meant time was short and Samantha relied on convenience food. 'I would come home exhausted and tell myself I didn't have time to cook a big meal from scratch so I'd pop a pizza and some frozen chips in the oven so I could spend time with the kids instead of cooking,' she said. 'I'd always have a second helping too and sides of garlic bread smothered in cheese and would spend as long as possible around the dining table with the family – like I had done as a child. 'Then with the children tucked up in bed Samantha would drink hot chocolate in front of the television. 'I was aware I was big but I told myself drinks didn't count.' A slice of cake and a few biscuits were an evening treat. On weekends she enjoyed carb-heavy breakfasts like crumpets smothered in butter and jam or honey washed down with hot chocolate. Lunches were always carb-heavy too, usually buttered rolls crammed with cheese and ham, followed by a bag of crisp and biscuits afterwards. Her job in the nursery meant children often brought in birthday cake to share with the staff and Samantha found it impossible to resist. But she was getting bigger year after year. She'd always loved fashion but found it hard to find anything other than black leggings and black tent-like tops to fit her growing body. 'I still tried to make an effort with my hair and make-up and I guess to the outside world I was big and bubbly – on the inside I was getting more and more unhappy with my weight,' she said. By December 2013, her weight had crept up to 21st 7lb. Her size 28 jeans were bursting at the seams but she refused to buy a size 30. More worryingly, she had started to experience breathlessness walking, especially climbing stairs. Now a keen swimmer, Samantha has totally transformed her diet and self-confidence and says she is looking forward to her first ever 'thin Christmas' this year (here holding up one of her old skirts) At the work Christmas party in a restaurant a few weeks before Christmas she posed in a hat from a cracker while a pal snapped a picture on her phone. 'I went red when I saw the picture because my face looked so fat and round it might explode. I looked rounder than a Christmas pudding,' she said. But with Christmas to look forward to, Samantha pushed dieting to the back of her mind again. David assured her he loved her regardless of her size but Samantha could see he was concerned about her. When he asked her to pose next to the tree on Christmas Day she recalls feeling awkward and uncomfortable. 'I hated having my photo taken by that stage but it was Christmas Day and I didn't want to make a fuss,' she said. 'Of course I knew I was big but when I saw it the next day I couldn't believe it. I looked bigger than the Christmas tree.' It was the wake-up call she had been waiting for and in January this year Samantha signed up to the Cambridge Diet weight-loss plan. Conventional diets had failed in the past because she couldn't control her portion size so the plan took temptation out of the way altogether. Instead of her usual carb-heavy dinners, she enjoyed shakes, soups or bars. Breakfast: Crumpets smothered with jam or honey and a cup of hot chocolate . Lunch: Sandwich with cheese and ham, bag of crisps, biscuits and tea . Dinner: Pizza, garlic bread, chips . Snacks: Cake, biscuits, hot chocolate . Breakfast: Porridge with skimmed milk or a low-fat cereal bar . Lunch: Low-fat soup . Dinner: Chicken breast with steamed vegetables . Snack: Fruit and nuts . 'At first I missed food terribly and I thought it was going to be impossible, especially at nursery when the children were bringing in cake,' she said. 'But I thought of that picture next to the Christmas tree and stuck to the plan. 'After the first few days I found it easier not to have to think about food because it was out of the equation.' She lost 9lb in the first week and it was the boost she needed to keep going. As the weight continued to fall off, Samantha also started walking and swimming to boost her losses, determined to reach her goal by Christmas. Weekly weigh-ins with her consultant helped to keep her motivated. Losing a steady 3lb per week, by October she reached 13st 12lb and a size 16. She said her daughters brimmed with approval when she picked her Christmas outfit – a sparkly silver top and skinny jeans. 'They said I looked great and seeing them proud of me made it worth it. I love that David no longer has to worry about me because I can run up and down the stairs without losing breath now.' As Christmas approaches she has lost even more weight and now weighs 12st 7lb and is a size 14. She's also fulfilled a fashion wish to buy a trendy North Face coat. 'For the first time ever I like what I see in the mirror and it's all thanks to that photograph,' she said.","Samantha Feast put on weight during her two pregnancies .

"Connected homes and cities have been buzz words this year, but while urban areas are becoming increasingly smart, the countryside is being left behind. A computer scientist is hoping to change this by launching a project that will take the Internet of Things (IOT) to an area of Wales. Proposed ideas include sheep with digital collars, sensors on riverbanks, and rainfall monitors. Computer scientist Professor Gordon Blair was recently awarded funding to investigate how the Internet of Things could work in the countryside. Proposed ideas include sheep with digital collars, (stock image) sensors on riverbanks and rainfall monitors . The project is being led by computer scientist Professor Gordon Blair from Lancaster University. He was recently awarded £171,495 ($267,090) from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to set up a ‘smart’ project in Conwy, Wales. The aim is to investigate how IOT could work in the countryside. In particular, Professor Blair will use the technology to tackle problems from flooding and agricultural pollution, to animal movements and drought. Lancaster University proposes fitting sensors to the riverbanks to monitor river levels and warn of floods. A similar system has already been installed by researchers from MIT to the Aguán River in Honduras. This system uses sensors on the bank, and throughout neighbouring towns to track rising levels, or weather conditions. They use a combination of 900 MHz and 144 MHz radio frequencies for data transmission, which means sensor clusters in the network can be as far apart as 34.2 miles (5km). Some sensor locations are designated as ‘government office nodes' and have an office with a laptop computer where data is collected and stored. An algorithm is then used to predict flood risks before alert notifications are displayed. And if the storm knocks out the local electricity grid, solar-powered backup systems kick in. IOT is the idea that everyday objects can be connected to the web, and ‘enables object-to-object communication over the internet and real time data monitoring.’ One idea is to fit sheep with digital collars. This could be used to track their movements, for example. A recent BBC show fitted digital collars with cameras to cats to follow them, see where they went and how they interacted with their neighbourhood - and a sheep version could help farmers monitor livestock. Alternatively, such digital collars could double up as Wi-Fi hotspots. This could be a solution to typically poor broadband speeds and network coverage in the most rural regions of the UK. At Glastonbury, EE installed Wi-Fi cows to act as similar hotspots. Although these ‘cows’ were, in fact, just masts in the shape of the farmyard animals, the principle could work for livestock in the countryside. Earlier this year, sheep in Yorkshire were fitted with cameras to give a unique view of the Tour De France as it travelled through the county.

"Two Yazidi sisters held captive by ISIS have told of how they tried to kill each other when they realised they were going to be sold as wives to terrorist fighters. Wafa, 27, and her sister, who has not been identified, were captured along with hundreds of other Yazidi women when the town on Sinjar fell into ISIS hands in August. Fearing they would be forced to marry or sold to another captor, they tried to strangle each other late at night and only stopped after other girls they were with woke up and separated them. Scroll down for video . Two Yazidi sisters held captive by ISIS tried to strangle each other after learning they were to be sold as wives, while another hanged herself fearing she would be raped (file image) Wafa said: 'The man who was holding us said that either we marry him and his brother or he would sell us. At night we tried to strangle ourselves. 'Two girls who were held with us woke up and stopped us and then stayed awake to watch over us. 'When they fell asleep at 5am we tried again, and again they woke up and stopped us. I could not speak for several days after that.' The shocking account has been revealed in a new report by Amnesty International that has found Yazidi girls as young as 12 are being raped, sold and forced into marriage by their captors. Many girls will attempt to commit suicide in order to escape the horrendous conditions they are kept in, according to the charity, with terrorists threatening to kill their families if they take their own life. A 20-year-old woman named Luna recalled how another woman named Jilan killed herself after fearing she was about to be forced into a marriage . Luna said: 'We were 21 girls in one room, two of them were very young, 10-12 years old. 'One day we were given clothes that looked like dance costumes and were told to bathe and wear those clothes. Jilan killed herself in the bathroom. 'She cut her wrists and hanged herself. She was very beautiful. I think she knew that she was going to be taken away by a man and that is why she killed herself.' ISIS fighters seized thousands of Yazidi prisoners on August 3 this year after their ancestral home, the town of Sinjar, was overrun. The terrorists then began a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Yazidis, who they believe to be devil-worshippers. Around 7,000 Yazidi women were captured by ISIS in August after their ancestral home of Sinjar was overrun by fighters, and have since been sold into slavery or forced into marriage (file image) According to UN figures around 5,000 men were gathered together and executed, while 7,000 women were taken and sold as slaves, forced into marriage, and raped. Incredibly many escaped captives have given accounts of fighters taking them back to their houses to live with their wives and children. Fawziya, 18, recalled being given to a 30-year-old man from Mosul, in north-west Iraq. She said: 'His family did not agree with what [ISIS] did to the Yazidi girls but did not do anything to stop it. I was put in a room with his wife, she was also from Mosul, was young and very nice to me. 'She has two young children, a boy and a girl, with him. His parents did not interfere, but they said that if I did not convert to Islam he should give me away or sell me, and get a Muslim wife instead.' Another recalled the husband's wife crying in sympathy with her over the way she had been treated, but saying that she was powerless to help. According to research by Amnesty International, girls as young as 12 have been raped, while some as young as 10 have been traded or sold as slaves, while many were beaten unconscious for resisting (file image) Despite living by a strict religious code, Islamic state fighters are allowed to take and have sex with Yazidi women because they view them as little more than property to be used. According to an online question and answer believed to have been posted by Islamic State officials, a man may have sex with a Yazidi virgin 'immediately after taking possession of her', but if she is not a virgin 'her uterus must be purified first' - though it does not explain what this entails. Previous reports have suggested that British jihadis, including women, were among those running brothels in the de-facto ISIS capital of Raqqa which were filled with Yazidi women. Former public schoolgirl  Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, is known to have been in Raqqa helping to organise religious patrols, while Manchester twins Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, are also thought to have been there. Since Sinjar was overrun in August, around 300 Yazidi women have managed to escape captivity. Amnesty spoke with 42 of them, and managed to call four who are still being held by ISIS. Among that group accounts of beatings were common, often after girls tried to resist being handed over to ISIS fighters as slaves or wives. Several anonymous accounts detail women being beaten unconscious by the men, who were mostly Iraqi or Syrian, before being dragged away by their hair. One girl named Arwa, 15, said she was taken along with her 13-year-old cousin to a village near Sinjar, where she was captured, before being given to an Iraqi man. She said: 'We were held in a house with five other girls. There they did to me what they did to many other girls. I was raped. 'My cousin was not molested; they wanted to take her to marry her to a man but in the end they left her with us and then we managed to escape. The others were raped. Previous reports suggested British jihadis were helping run brothels for ISIS filled with Yazidi women in Raqqa, a city where Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood (pictured) is known to have gone . 'The men were all Iraqis. They said that if we killed ourselves they would kill our relatives.' Despite being free from her captors, 61 of Arwa's relatives are still in the hands of ISIS, while it is not known whether many of them are alive or dead. A spokesman for Amnesty said: 'Despite worldwide condemnation, the IS has shown no intention of putting an end to the war crimes and crimes against humanity which its fighters have been committing on a large scale, including against the Iraqi women and girls they have abducted and continue to hold captive. 'Any party, in Iraq or outside, with any influence over the IS should use that influence to secure the release of these captives. 'A small proportion of those abducted have managed to escape IS captivity, many after having been subjected to acts of unspeakable brutality. 'But the survivors interviewed by Amnesty International are not receiving the help and support they desperately need.' Meanwhile, extremists are said to be working to excise women from public life across the ISIS controlled territory. In day-to-day life, the group has also dramatically hemmed in women's lives across the Sunni Muslim heartland that makes up the bulk of Islamic State group territory, activists and residents say. In Mosul, Iraq, the biggest city in the group's self-declared caliphate, 'life for women has taken a 180-degree turn', according to Hanaa Edwer, a prominent Iraqi human rights activist. She added: 'They are forbidding them from learning, forbidding them from moving around freely. The appearance of a woman is being forcefully altered.' At least 10 women in Mosul have been killed for speaking out against the group, Ms Edwer said. In August, ISIS also detained and beheaded a female dentist in Deir el-Zour who had continued to treat patients of both sexes, the U.N. said. Relatives of women considered improperly dressed or found in the company of males who are not relatives are lashed or imprisoned. In the ISIS-controlled town of al-Bab in Syria's northern Aleppo province, an activist described seeing armed militants walking with a stick in hand, gently whacking or jabbing at women deemed inappropriately dressed. Bari Abdelatif, who is now based in Turkey explained: 'Sometimes they follow the woman home and detain her father, or they confiscate her ID and tell her to come back with her father to pick it up.' Enforcement varies from one place to the other, much of it depending on the whims of the Hisba, or vice police enforcing those rules. Despite living to a strict religious code, ISIS fighters are permitted to trade and have sex with Yazidi women as they view them as property to be used . Most of the areas taken over by ISIS were already deeply conservative places where women had a subordinate role in society, but the extremists have sharply exacerbated the restrictions. An ISIS all-female brigade, called al-Khansa, patrols the streets in some areas to enforce clothing restrictions. Meanwhile in the Iraqi city of Fallujah, an elementary school teacher said militants recently dropped by the school to deliver the niqab, robes and gloves for the students to wear. They have also segregated schools and changed the curriculum and in some cases shut schools down as they were not teaching a hard-line version of Sharia law. Hospitalas have also been segregrated, with women only allowed to be seen by female doctors, but there are very few of them left. While early marriage is also on the rise because parents want to find husbands for their daughters quickly for fear they will be forced to marry ISIS fighters. Last month, a United Nations panel said: 'The psychological and physical harm caused by ISIS's treatment of women, the onerous instructions imposed on their dress code, and restrictions on their freedom of movement demonstrate discriminatory treatment on the basis of gender.'","Thousands of Yazidi women captured as ISIS took Sinjar city in August .

"An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane. Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle' Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally. Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene. Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying . Due to its strategic location close to the Syrian border, Suruc is where much of the international media covering the crisis in Kobane has been based over the past few weeks. Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies. In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups. Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.' Islamic State militants have shot and wounded a senior Syrian rebel commander inside Turkey, it has been claimed, raising yet more questions of Ankara's commitment to defeating the terror group. Abu Issa, the leader of a group fighting ISIS in the besieged city of Kobane, and his 20-year-old son Ammar, were ambushed by jihadists in the southeastern Turkish town of Urfa on Friday afternoon. The pair - who had been attending a meeting with Turkish officials - were snatched from their car in an apparent kidnapping attempt, after the driver of their car allegedly simply switched off the engine when confronted by four heavily armed ISIS militants at a roadblock. After being seized they were driven at high speed towards the Syrian border and only managed to escape when one of the third-party smugglers ISIS uses to transport people and weapons into Syria bailed on the plan after spotting Turkish soldiers. Militant: The attempted kidnapping raises serious questions about Turkey's commitment to joining the international effort to destroy the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq . None of the Islamic State attackers wore masks and two of them were known to Abu Issa from fighting in Kobane, his aides in the Thuwar Raqqa rebel group told the Telegraph. Using an alternative acronym for the terror group, spokesman Ahmed Abdul Khader said: 'Isil cars blocked the road ahead of them, and four armed men grabbed them from the vehicle. It was 6.30pm.' A matching account of the kidnapping was reportedly given to the newspaper by another military commander in the group, Abo Ayham. He claimed that Abu Issa's driver - who was also his most trusted advisor - had been in on the plot, driving the rebel leader into a quiet back road where the extremist were waiting, refusing to turn the vehicle around when ordered to do so, and turning off the car's engine rather than trying to escape. The news raises yet more questions about Turkey's commitment to the international fight against ISIS, after Ankara drew a great deal of international criticism for refusing to intervene to help Kurdish fighters battling militants just 200 yards over the border in Kobane.","Journalist Serena Shim killed in car crash in southern Turkey over weekend .

"A young family are living in constant fear and could be driven from their home - because of an invasion of monster venomous spiders which attack humans instead of running away. Liam Forrester, 24, has already been bitten by one of the ultra-aggressive hobo spiders - and has been left with a deep, infected wound that could take three months to heal. His partner, 27-year-old Kirsty Garland, has  trapped and killed around 30 of the beasts, and the couple are frightened that one of their three young children will be their next victim. Scroll down for video . Under siege: Liam Forrester and Kirsty Garland have had their home invaded by giant, venomous hobo spiders, and fear they may have to leave to protect their three young children . The spiders' attack on the couple's Stockwood, Bristol home started when Ms Garland opened the attic door around two weeks ago - and a large family of them scuttled out. Despite Ms Garland's efforts, more and more of the monsters - which have five-inch long hairy legs - keep appearing in their home. The full-time mother, who has a six-year-old son and two-year-old daughter, said: 'They're like normal spiders on steroids - I hate them. Fearsome: The spiders have five-inch long hairy legs and their venom causes the skin around the bite to die . Aggro arachnids: Instead of running away like most spiders, these beasts rear up and attack humans . 'We opened the attic door and a few of them came out so now we are scared to go up there again. 'They are horrible, vile things. I found one in the bath last week, and when I put a pint glass over it, it's long legs just filled up the whole glass. 'They don't seem to be scared to run at us either, they run towards us and seem very aggressive. 'When you corner them they rear up their legs. Their bodies are pretty much normal size but it's the legs - the front legs are the size of your hand.' Ms Garland, whose partner also has a three-year-old son, added: 'If we can't get rid of them I just want to move because we've got three children and I don't want them to be bitten.' Venom victim: Mr Forrester was bitten and doctors have told him that it may take three months to heal . The spider venom causes the skin around the bite to die - a process known as necrosis which can need surgical treatment - while victims have also reported severe headaches, nausea, vision problems and memory loss. 'The bite on my partner's arm is awful. He didn't feel it at first but the venom started to spread and it has left a crater where the skin has died,' Ms Garland said. 'We are all on edge at the moment, it's terrible. 'This is the first year we've ever seen them as big as this, and had so many.' Hobo spiders - or Tegenaria agrestis - look like common house spiders, but are bigger, with thick, hairy legs. National invasion: The warmer weather means this year has been a bumper one for spiders, and with temperatures set to drop in the coming weeks, they could be coming to homes across the country . They are native to Europe but rarely come into contact with humans. They make funnel-shaped webs of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end for their prey. While most spiders scuttle away when approached by humans, these run towards people and have a potent bite. Experts have warned that it could be a bumper year for spiders because of the warm weather, and with the temperature set to fall in the coming weeks, the bigger-than-ever arachnids could be invading homes all over the country. Spider expert Adam Hart, of Gloucestershire University, said there was an increase in bigger spiders this year but urged the public to remain calm. He said: 'The hobo spider is a relative of the common house spider. 'Most bites become nasty because they are not cared for properly and get infected, not because of spider venom. 'If a bite is festering, the wound is going off and you need to seek medical attention.' He added: 'There are a lot of large spiders around this year. 'I have had four or five in my own house in the last few weeks, and we've had a bit of a spider frenzy this week. 'If you're in an area where spiders are moving through, you will see a lot around the house.'","Liam Forrester, 24, and Kirsty Garland, 27, may be forced from their home .

"This is the dramatic moment Tara Palmer-Tomkinson tore out her hair extensions during a temper tantrum as she was arrested by eight armed police at London Heathrow Airport. The socialite swore at officers before she was handcuffed and led away on Saturday afternoon - and has since claimed she became upset when people starting taking pictures of her in the airport. Miss Palmer-Tomkinson said she could hear people talking and laughing about her behind her back, and lost her temper when a man told her: ‘You are not fit to travel, you are crying.’ The 42-year-old, who had a business class ticket, also denied earlier reports that the incident was sparked when she was prevented from entering British Airways’ first-class lounge.

The weary-looking 42-year-old was also pictured on Sunday leaving her £4million flat in Kensington, west London, before checking into another flight to Zurich at Britain's busiest airport. Miss Palmer-Tomkinson, who has a history of drink and drug problems, had been due to fly out to the exclusive ski resort of Klosters in Switzerland to celebrate her birthday before the incident.

'They had no choice but to arrest for her own and everyone else’s safety.’ The dramatic arrest was captured on video with onlookers describing her as ‘ballistic’. In the footage, Miss Palmer-Tomkinson can be seen arguing with a male and female police officer. She then becomes so frustrated that she rips out a chunk of her own hair extensions and flings them at the officers’ feet amid a storm of four-letter abuse.

"Indonesian authorities have vowed to scrap virginity tests for female civil servants following international outrage that the country's police force is continuing to use the 'outdated and degrading' practice. Human Rights Watch (HRW) last month launched a scathing attack on the country's lawmakers after it interviewed multiple women within the police force who were subjected to the examination. While the country's police force is yet to relent on its use of the test, Home Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo has announced aspiring civil servants and public administrators will no longer be required to undergo it. Indonesia's aspiring civil servants will not be required to undergo virginity tests, but the country's police force is refusing to stop its use of the practice. File image used . The minister announced the practice would stop at the Institute of Public Administration - a leading school for civil servants - saying it was a 'pity' that a woman could fail the test despite being competent for the job, The Bangkok Post reported, based on a report by the Kompas Daily. His announcement is a minor victory for those hoping to see the practice outlawed following last month's HRW report on its use by the Indonesian police force. In order to become a policewoman, a candidate must be aged 17.5 to 22 years, follow a religion, be at least 5ft, 5in, not need glasses and be a virgin. However, according to a report by HRW, a number of applicants were only told of the test moments before it was about to take place. 'I felt embarrassed, nervous, but I couldn't refuse, ' an applicant told the HRW according to GlobalPost. 'If I had refused, I couldn't have become a policewoman.' According to another female applicant, the tests have seen the aspiring police officers undress in front of 20 other candidates before being led into a room without a door, in pairs. There, in the company of the other applicants, the women were subjected to internal examinations to determine if they were virgins. 'The Indonesian National Police's use of virginity tests is a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women,' said Nisha Varia, associate women's rights director at HRW. Human Rights Watch said the practice was 'degrading' and 'discriminatory' and called for it to be banned from use. File image used . 'Applicants who failed the test were not necessarily expelled from the force, but women described the test as painful and traumatic.' The practice, which is supposed to determine if the candidate's hymen is intact, has been widely discredited as unscientific and degrading. A spokesman for the national police confirmed virginity tests still happened but that there was no requirement for female candidates to be virgins. 'There is a complete health test for both female and male candidates including checking reproductive organs and the virginity test for women will be a part of that routine. 'But there has never has been a rule that requires policewomen to be virgins, so there is no discrimination.' Authorities claim the virginity test allows them to check candidates are healthy and free of diseases such as cervical cancer.","Indonesia's Home Affairs Minister announces an end to 'degrading' exam .

"Jailed: Gina Matthews, pictured outside court today, admitted to stealing £179,000 from her parents . A 42-year-old woman who stole more than £150,000 from her cancer-stricken mother's bank account has been jailed for 21 months. Gina Matthews, who works in a school, took money from her mother over a period of five years by fraudulently signing cheques and using her debit card to withdraw cash. She also took money from her father, who suffers from MS, that was meant to be used to pay his care home fees. Sentencing Matthews at Chelmsford Crown Court, Judge Christopher Ball said that it was a 'significant breach of trust' against 'vulnerable' family members who were 'very reliant on her'. He said: 'That theft, I have no doubt, went towards funding your own very comfortable lifestyle and towards the end of the five and a half years there appears to have been a disturbing cocaine habit which has arisen from somewhere.' Prosecutor Barry Gilbert said Pauline Chalkley, who was receiving treatment for stomach cancer, opened a savings account with £192,000 in 2007. Her daughter transferred the money to another account, still in Mrs Chalkey's name, that she withdrew money from without her mother's knowledge. Matthews admitted that she had falsely represented to Barclays Bank that 31 cheques drawn on Mrs Chalkley's account, for a total of £58,481, were signed by her mother. She also admitted that she had told the bank that she was authorised to use the debit card when she wasn't. Between October 2007 and April 2013 she withdrew £100,000 from the account. The court also heard that between October 2010 and August 2012, Matthews stole £27,000 from a Post Office account belonging to her father, John Chalkley. The money was intended to be used to pay the fees of the care home where her father lives. Mr Gilbert said: His fees were supposed to be paid by the defendant from that account and she had control over it. She had not been paying the care home. The home manager had sent letters about the outstanding bills to Mrs Chalkley but Matthews concealed those, as well as letters from the bank and even bailiffs, he added. Matthews attempted to take her own life when her mother found out about the money in March last year, the court heard. All of the money in Mrs Chalkley's account had been taken by the time Matthews was arrested. Mitigating, Lorhan Amirthananthar said Matthews helped her mother, who was diagnosed with four types of cancer in five years, and visited her father regularly. She continued : 'At first, what started as sometimes borrowing money with a view to putting it back, it snowballed with one's hands in the goodie bag.' The lawyer said the money was spent on 'quite mundane things' and living expenses. Counsel added that Matthews had worked in a school for six years and had an exemplary record and continued : 'Sometimes good people do very bad things and she really does fall into that category. She's very sorry.' Sentencing Matthews at Chelmsford Crown Court, pictured, Judge Christopher Ball said that it was a 'significant breach of trust' against 'vulnerable' family members who were 'very reliant on her' Matthews pleaded guilty to taking a total of £179,000 on the day of her trial - at which her parents were due to give evidence. The judge accepted that she had given 'valuable and loving care and support to her parents', but said that she had breached their trust. Matthews was jailed for 21 months and the judge imposed an indefinite restraining order - banning her from contacting her parents. Barclays had repaid £180,000 to the Chalkleys because it accepted it 'should have been more vigilant' with its administration, the prosecutor said.","Cancer sufferer Pauline Chalkley opened a savings account in 2007 .

"Republican Sen.Tom Coburn is no fan the president's politics, but when it comes to the man himself, the retiring Oklahoma lawmaker has nothing but praise for his former colleague and friend Barack Obama. 'I think he's a genuinely very smart, nice guy,' Coburn said in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes. 'I just love him as a man. I think he's a neat man. 'You don't have to be the same to be friends. Matter of fact, the interesting friendships are the ones that are divergent,' the Tea Party aligned senator added. Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn is seen here walking to the Senate floor for a series of votes on December. It was to be one of his last votes in Congress, as he is retiring this year due to a battle with prostate cancer . Coburn is pictured here greeting President Barack Obama before his second State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on January 25, 2011. The two men became unlikely friends in 2005 as freshman senators and have stayed close despite their vastly different political views . The two men met in 2005 when they were both green senators, freshly joining the elite ranks of the legislative branch's upper chamber. Obama was a former community organizer turned politician who hailed from Chicago, Illinois, and had just won his first election to federal office. Coburn was a seasoned obstetrician who did a three-term stint as an Oklahoma representative in the House of Representatives before fulfilling a campaign promise to hold himself to a self-imposed term limit. The senators on opposing sides of the aisle acknowledged their friendship in the past and that their unique relationship is considered a rarity among Members of Congress from different political movements. When Coburn was named to Time's 2013 list of the 100 most influential people in the world, Obama wrote his profile. Noting that they entered office at the same time, Obama wrote that their 'wives, Michelle and Carolyn, hit it off at an orientation dinner.' 'Pretty soon, we did too. Since then, we’ve bonded over family and faith. And we’ve harnessed our friendship and mutual respect to find places where we can agree and work together to move this country forward,' he said. Together, Obama said, they worked to increase government transparency and reduce earmarks. 'The people of Oklahoma are lucky to have someone like Tom representing them in Washington — someone who speaks his mind, sticks to his principles and is committed to the people he was elected to serve,' he said. 'Each of us still hopes the other will see the light. But in the meantime, we’ll settle for being friends,' Obama stated. And at a prayer breakfast this year Obama made special mention of Coburn, who had just been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 'Tom is going through some tough times right now. But I love him dearly even though we're from different parties,' Obama said. Coburn is leaving Congress this year due to his advanced affliction. 'Everybody is gonna die from something. And so the deal is how to use each day to move things forward for both you and the people you love and the country you love,' he calmly told CBS News during his interview for 60 Minutes. Bromance: Obama and Coburn shared a hug after their greeting at the 2011 State of the Union address. The two men have said numerous times that they 'love' each other . The Oklahoma senator has long spoke with  fondness of his rapport with Obama. Asked why they have such 'personal chemistry' by Political Capital host Al Hunt in 2011, Coburn said: 'I just think we truly like each other....He’s got a wonderful personality. He’s got a great wife and family. He is a very neat man, and I like him personally.' Coburn attributed their contradictory viewpoints on their dissimilar upbringings and personal experiences. 'That doesn’t make him a bad man,' he said. 'I love the man. I think he’s a neat man. I don’t want him to be president, but I still love him. 'He is our president. He’s my president. And I disagree with him adamantly on 95 percent of the issues, but that doesn’t mean I can’t have a great relationship,' he told the Bloomberg Television host. 'And that’s a model people ought to follow.' The outgoing legislator told 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl during their recent interview that he's 'proud' of Americans for electing Obama. 'I mean, it says something about us nationally,' he told her. 'You know, it's kind of like crowning your checker when you get to the end of your checker board. Here's another thing that says America's special: Barack Obama, president of the United States.' Coburn admitted that Obama hasn't done as good of a job building a working relationship with his other former colleagues - many of whom have often complained that Obama doesn't seem to like or want to get to know them - but insisted that they shouldn't take it personally. 'The president hasn't done a great job of reaching out. It's not his personality style. I mean, you know, he's not well-suited to be a back slapper, sit down and let me tell you this dirty story before we get down to business,' Coburn said. 'I mean, he's not one of those kinds of guys. He's a serious guy.' The conservative lawmaker shared with 60 Minutes that he sometimes calls Obama to boost his spirits when he's being lambasted by his critics. 'I've told him, ""Don't let the S.O.B's get you down,""....I'll call him up and say, ""Hey, I'm pulling for ya,"" you know,' he said. Coming from Coburn, it's quite the act of kindness. The Tea Party congressman has roundly criticized most of his fellow lawmakers as unfit to serve. 'I see 'em make decisions every day that benefit their career, rather than the country. And that's what's so sickening about Washington. To me, it's about our future. It's not about the politicians,' he told Stahl. 'And we've switched things around where now it's about the politicians and not the future of the country.' His solution? Kick them all to the curb. 'If I was king tomorrow, that's what I'd do,' Coburn said, not joking one bit.","The two men met in 2005 when they were both green senators, freshly joining the elite ranks of the legislative branch's upper chamber .

"Dave Fields, 75, was knocked down and killed when he was hit by a reversing car wash worker as he waited to have his car cleaned . A great grandfather was knocked down and killed by a car wash worker - after taking his vehicle in for a clean, a court heard. Retired butcher Dave Fields, 75, had taken his car in for its regular wash at Cwmbran Car Wash when he was hit by one of the employees. The pensioner was watching his car being washed when learner driver Sokol Muja, 27, reversed a people carrier into him. A court heard how Mr Fields was knocked to ground on the car wash forecourt where he hit his head and died. Prosecutor James Wilson said: 'Mr Fields became aware of a Chrysler Voyager reversing in his direction and CCTV footage showed saw him back-pedalling in an attempt to avoid the vehicle. 'He was seen holding out his walking stick to shield himself but the rear of the vehicle hit him and he fell on the back of his head.' Great-grandfather Mr Fields, described as the anchor of his large family, remained conscious but his condition worsened in hospital and he died five days later. Mr Fields' daughter-in-law Kathy told the court in an impact statement: 'He was a very special man who was much loved by his family and the community. 'The family will never get over the tragic way he died. Without him we are all lost. Our whole World has been turned upside down and we have lost the anchor to our family. 'He was a real family man who touched many hearts and will be dearly missed.' Muja, who had been learning to drive at the time of the accident, was quizzed by police after the collision. He claimed he had not seen Mr Fields when he knocked him down at the car wash owned by his brother on the Llantarnam Industrial Estate at Cwmbran, South Wales. Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard that the car wash firm had no insurance policy for employees to drive customer vehicles and Judge Eleri Rees urged the Health and Safety Executive to investigate . Cardiff Crown Court heard that the car wash firm had no insurance policy for employees to drive customer vehicles and Judge Eleri Rees urged the Health and Safety Executive to investigate. She handed Muja, who also admitted driving without insurance and in accordance with the provisional licence he holds, a six month suspended sentence. He was banned from driving for two years. Judge Rees also ordered Muja to undertake 250 hours of community work and told to pay £350 in costs and victim surcharge. She told Muja, from Cwmbran: 'Your action resulted in a tragic and needless loss of life and you will have to bear the burden of guilt throughout your life.'","Dave Fields, 75, was run over on the forecourt of Cwmbran Car Wash .

"George Osborne said anyone caught fiddling markets will now face ‘the full force of the law’ Traders caught rigging foreign exchange markets will face up to seven years behind bars under plans confirmed today by Chancellor George Osborne. The new rules, which come into force in April, come just a month after six banks were fined £2.6billion for rigging foreign exchange for profit. Mr Osborne said anyone caught fiddling markets will now face ‘the full force of the law’. The clampdown come on top of rules introduced last year to tackle the manipulation of the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other – known as Libor. From next year traders will face criminal charges if they are caught fiddling a host of ‘benchmark’ rates, which are traded around the world, including gold, silver and Brent crude oil prices. It comes after the Chancellor set out plans to introduce criminal sanctions to clean up the forex market in his Mansion House speech in June. Mr Osborne said today: ‘The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. ‘Ensuring that the key rates that underpin financial markets here and around the world are robust, and that anyone who seeks to manipulate them is subject to the full force of the law, is an important part of our long-term economic plan. ‘That’s why the Government is determined to deal with abuses, tackle the unacceptable behaviour of the few and ensure that markets are fair for the many who depend on them.’ The Treasury said the changes announced today would extend the criminal offence applied to any person guilty of manipulating a ‘relevant benchmark’, which was originally introduced for Libor. Those who administrate the benchmarks and submit figures used in their calculation will also be subject to proposed new FCA rules with firms facing financial penalties, suspensions or censure for breaking them. Key requirements include identifying potential manipulation, controlling conflicts of interest and implementing robust governance and oversight, the watchdog said. The new rules, which come into force in April, come just a month after six banks were fined £2.6billion for rigging foreign exchange for profit. FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said: ‘I am determined to ensure that markets work well and preserve the UK’s reputation as a centre of excellence for financial services - today’s announcement is a vital step in achieving this. ‘This builds on our work to strengthen Libor, and drive up standards on benchmarks across the board.’","The new rules come  after six banks were fined £2.6bn for rigging markets .

"Disgraced Cambridgeshire Police sergeant Nick Lidstone, 55, was allowed to keep his job despite being arrested for taking photographs of children eight years ago - he went on to groom a girl . A paedophile police officer who groomed his victim for more than a decade had been allowed to keep his job - despite being caught taking photographs of children eight years ago. Disgraced Cambridgeshire Police sergeant Nick Lidstone, 55, of Barrington, Cambridgeshire admitted a series of rapes and child sex attacks relating to one victim at Norwich Crown Court last month. But it emerged today Lidstone was arrested eight years ago for taking 'up-skirt' pictures of children with a spy pen in a branch of Tesco in Royston, Hertfordshire. At the time he was given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to a minor public order offence at North and East Hertfordshire Magistrates' Court in 2005 - but all of his most serious abuse happened after this offence. Because he was not charged with a sexual offence, his name was not placed on the sex offenders' register. He was allowed to keep his job and it was not until he admitted abusing a girl in court last month that he was dismissed from his role at the force's headquarters. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, reported the years of abuse - which culminated in being raped as an adult - earlier this year. A court heard Lidstone's abuse of the girl escalated and all of the most serious attacks happened after his arrest for the photos. Sentencing him to 14 and a half years in prison, Judge Anthony Bate said he had used his victim as a 'sexual toy'. He placed Lidstone on the sex offenders' register for life. He said: 'You have one previous conviction which has two worrying aspects: firstly, the nature of the offence and secondly, the fact you were convicted under public order legislation when quite clearly these were serious sexual offences. 'You had armed yourself with a covert camera and were found taking pictures of children. Why on earth you were not charged under the sexual offences act, I do not know. 'Whoever took that decision, it allowed you to carry on as a police officer.' The judge added that because he was convicted of a public order offence, nobody had looked more closely at Lidstone's relationship with children and a chance to detect his abuse was missed. Lidstone was jailed after admitting a series of rapes and child sex attacks at Norwich Crown Court (pictured) Despite undergoing therapy to address his sexual deviancy, Lidstone carried on abusing his victim, who suffered significant psychological harm. Judge Bate said that Lidstone's apparent cooperation with therapy showed how he was able to 'manipulate experts' into believing he had an ordinary sex life. Prosecutor Andrew Shaw said the pictures taken in 2005 were of 'young children' and there was some doubt over whether the worst of the images were found. Kerry Broome, mitigating, said Lidstone had agreed to undergo counselling in order to keep his job. His role with the police had not involved regular contact with children. Lidstone pleaded guilty to 13 offences - including three counts of rape, three counts of indecency with a child, various sexual assaults and taking an indecent photograph of a child - in November this year. He denied six other counts, which were left to lie on file. Mr Shaw told the court Lidstone started grooming the girl when she was nine. The court heard he would expose himself to her, show her pornography and take indecent photographs. 'This was serious sexual assault,' Mr Shaw said. 'The abuse was more or less continuous and culminated in rape when she was a young adult.' His victim was unable to make a statement to the court, saying she was so distressed that even the thought of it made her physically sick. One witness who knew the victim described how her life had been 'ruined'. 'She has never been able to integrate or make friends,' he said. 'He has shown himself to be lying and manipulative.' Dressed in a black suit, Lidstone broke down in tears in the dock as details of his abuse were read out. Referring to the latest offences, Miss Broome said her client had been 'infatuated'. She said that, with expert help, there was no reason he should pose any further danger to the public. 'He is very well aware of the shame he has brought on the police force and his 30 years of service are over,' Miss Broome said. Cambridgeshire Police have not yet responded to the judge's comments. Speaking after Lidstone was dismissed last month, Deputy Chief Constable Alec Wood said: 'This was an appalling crime where the victim was put through a horrendous ordeal over a prolonged period. 'We want the public and our own employees to feel confident about raising concerns about the conduct of our officers and staff. 'We will always investigate these cases thoroughly and ensure any offenders are brought to justice.' Jon Brown, who heads the NSPCC's programmes for tackling sexual abuse, said: 'It seems quite incredible that this officer wasn't charged first time around with a sexual offence. 'If he had been it's possible these later, more serious crimes could have been stopped sooner or even prevented in the first place. 'The tragedy is that a young girl has suffered terribly at this man's hands when he should not have been allowed the freedom to act in this appalling way. 'This underlines the importance of taking all sex offences extremely seriously and making sure the right course of action is followed through. 'It would only be right for the police authority to take a look at how he came to be charged with a minor offence all those years ago and to ensure it doesn't happen again.'","Nick Lidstone, 55, worked for Cambridgeshire Police for over 30 years .

"Dan Whiston, 20, was killed when a defective dumper truck lurched forwards as he was tipping soil at a farm in Devon in 2009 . A young labourer was crushed to death on his first day in a new job at the home of comedy actress Caroline Quentin. Dan Whiston, 20, was killed when a defective dumper truck lurched forward as he was tipping soil and plunged down a steep slope. He was helping to build a lake at the farm in Uplowman, Devon, where Miss Quentin lives with husband Sam Farmer and their children. Mr Whiston who had not been wearing a seat belt, suffered massive head and neck injuries when the 11-tonne truck landed on top of him as he tried to jump clear. The accident happened in October 2009 and five years on, two directors of the firm that he was working for appeared in court to be sentenced over the incident. William Friend, from Swimbridge, Devon, and Robert Plume, from South Molton, Devon, admitted being an employer breaching a general duty to an employee under the Health and Safety Act by connivance or neglect. Prosecutor Simon Morgan told Exeter Crown Court that Mr Whiston, from Dulverton, Exmoor, was crushed by the truck's roll bars as he carried out the landscaping work at the farm. He said Samuel Farmer and his wife bought the farm in 2007 and in 2009 an extensive work programme was carried out which included lining and extending the lake which was a quarter size of a football pitch and 15 feet deep in a job costing £18,900. He said Dan had not been trained to drive the dumper truck which had defective brakes and 'suddenly jolted forwards' and the young worker tried to grab the roll bar but the back of the truck swung round and landed on top of him. William Friend, left, and Robert Plume, right,  received a 12-month suspended jail sentence at Exeter Crown Court today after admitting breaching a general duty to an employee under the Health and Safety Act . And he had not been wearing the seat belt that may have saved his life, a judge was told. James Bennett, defending the two directors of Wedgewood Buildings Ltd, said Dan's family had bravely shown empathy to the two men. He said: 'There were failings, they make mistakes. They tried their best, but their best was not good enough.' He said the men, married with children, had had the prospect of jail hanging over their heads for the last five years because of the time it had taken for an inquest to be held and the HSE to prosecute them. Judge Phillip Wassall said the five-year process was 'regrettable but understandable' and he said accidents like these were 'such a common problem'. He described Mr Whiston's death as a 'tragic loss' to his family. The inquest jury said Mr Whiston had not received recognised training, no practical experience in driving such a truck, the vehicle had a number of defects including brakes that did not work, and he had not been given any supervision about driving such a truck on uneven land. Mr Whiston was helping to build a lake at the farm in Uplowman, Devon, where actress and presenter Caroline Quentin, pictured, lives with husband Sam Farmer and their children. The judge told Exeter Crown Court that the combination of an earth moving mechanical vehicle on a sloping site equalled danger. He told the victim's family: 'I regard your objectivity and sensitivity in the circumstances as being extraordinary.' Both Friend and Plume, now aged 32, were jailed for 12 months, suspended for two years. They were ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work and pay £25,000 each in costs. The judge did not make any other financial penalty because he said 'you cannot put a value on someone's life'. He told the men:'The risks were foreseeable.' 'You should have enforced the seat belt rule. The roll cage was there for a purpose.' He said both directors had made too many assumptions when there were 'clear and obvious risks'.","Dan Whiston was killed when a defective dumper truck lurched forward as he was tipping soil and fell down a steep slope .

"Pakistan say they will execute around 500 militants in the coming weeks after its government lifted a moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases following last week's school massacre. Six militants have been hanged since Friday amid rising public anger over Tuesday's slaughter in the northwestern city of Peshawar, which left 149 people dead including 133 children. Meanwhile police say they have arrested six men and one woman who 'helped facilitate' the Taliban slaughter - and who were planning another. Pakistani children hold placards calling for the death penalty to be reinstated shortly after last week's school massacre. Since Friday six convicts have been hanged . The devastated grandmother (C) of Muhammad Ali Khan, a student who was killed during an attack by Taliban gunmen on Army Public School, reaches out to Imran Khan . After the deadliest terror attack in Pakistani history, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif reinstated the death penalty for terrorism-related cases. A senior government official told AFP: 'Interior ministry has finalised the cases of 500 convicts who have exhausted all the appeals, their mercy petitions have been turned down by the president and their executions will take place in coming weeks.' Of the six hanged so far, five were involved in a failed attempt to assassinate then military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2003, while one was involved in a 2009 attack on army headquarters. Police, troops and paramilitary rangers have been deployed across the country and airports and prisons put on red alert during the executions and as troops intensify operations against Taliban militants. Prime Minister Minister Nawaz Sharif (L) lifted a six-year moratorium on the death penalty in terror cases. The decision came in response to the school slaughter in Peshawar - masterminded by Khalifa Omar Mansoor (R) Murderers: Khalifa Omar Mansoor (blue robe) poses with the Taliban fighters who stormed the military-run school in Peshawar . Sharif has ordered the attorney general's office to 'actively pursue' capital cases currently in the courts, a government spokesman said. The 'prime minister has also issued directions for appropriate measures for early disposal of pending cases related to terrorism,' the spokesman said, without specifically confirming the plan to execute 500 people. Pakistan has described Tuesday's bloody school rampage, claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as its own 'mini 9/11,' calling it a game-changer in the fight against extremism.

'We are receiving intelligence from across the country that the militants are getting ready for another savage and inhuman counter-attack.' News of the arrests comes a few days after the mastermind behind the school massacre was identified as 36-year-old Umar Mansoor. Female Pakistani police commandos carry out a training session as security forces step up the offensive . As the Peshawar tragedy unfolded, army chief General Raheel Sharif said the attack had renewed the forces' determination to push for the militants' 'final elimination' The female commandos were pictured training in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province . In a direct video message, the mass murderer nicknamed 'slim' and described as 'the most hated – and dangerous' man in Pakistan, said: 'I want to tell the Pakistan government, and the directors, teachers and students of the army's affiliated institutions, that you are the ones strengthening this un-Islamic democratic system. 'It is these institutions that graduate future generals, brigadiers and majors, who then kill Taliban and innocent tribal people. 'If our women and children die as martyrs, your children will not escape. We will fight against you in such a style that you attack us and we will take revenge on innocents.' The offensive against longstanding Taliban and other militant strongholds in North Waziristan and Khyber tribal agencies has been going on since June.

But a series of fresh strikes since the Peshawar attack, in which dozens of alleged militants were killed, suggest the campaign is being stepped up. The decision to reinstate executions was condemned by human rights groups, with the United Nations also calling for Pakistan to reconsider. Human Rights Watch on Saturday said the executions were 'a craven politicised reaction to the Peshawar killings' and demanded no further hangings be carried out.

"After the raid of a violent, multistate dog-fighting ring, 22 people face charges and hundreds of dogs are in shelters, authorities said Monday. A Baltimore grand jury returned indictments against 22 people involved in the ring, 14 of whom were in custody. They all face charges of animal cruelty, dog fighting and conspiracy. The indictments came last week after a year-long investigation. Officials said a year-long investigation has led to the indictment of 22 alleged members of a Baltimore-based dog-fighting ring - here are photographs of the dogs recovered and accompanying weapons . Authorities raided 18 locations in the Baltimore area and a compound in West Virginia. The ring also had links in New York and in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, where several alleged members were linked to a dog-fighting bust in April 2013. In all, authorities recovered 225 dogs, including 50 puppies, and at least 20 weapons. At least one dog died after a fight, officials said. Also seized were breaking sticks, heavy chains, conditioning harnesses, steroids, surgical equipment, weighted collars and breeding stands, which prosecutors say dog-fighters refer to as 'rape stands.' The fate of all the dogs once they were taken to shelters wasn't immediately clear Monday. Eric Kowalczyk, a spokesman for Baltimore police said, 'Each and every dog is assessed individually by a professional and they take every effort to rehabilitate them and place them up for adoption.' In all, authorities recovered 225 dogs, including 50 puppies - at least one dog died after a fight, officials said . In announcing the indictments, authorities emphasized the violence involved in dog-fighting and said eight of those indicted have previous violent-crime convictions, including murder and sex offenses . He said that he couldn't immediately say whether any of the 225 dogs had to be euthanized but that the department is 'focusing on the fact that a lot of the dogs we were able to rescue are able to be rehabilitated.' In announcing the indictments, authorities emphasized the violence involved in dog-fighting and said eight of those indicted have previous violent-crime convictions, including murder and sex offenses. 'To make these dogs more lethal, dogfighters deployed disturbing methods, sometimes forcing their dogs to wear weighted collars in scorching weather and cutting off their ears so opponents have less flesh to seize on with their teeth,' said Thiru Vignarajah, chief of the major investigations unit at the Baltimore State's Attorney's Office. 'These indictments bring into the light a form of brutality that for too long has unfolded in the forgotten basements and backyards of Baltimore and beyond,' Vignarajah said.","22 people face charges of animal cruelty, dog fighting and conspiracy .

"The Cairns house in which eight children were murdered last week, will be demolished and replaced with a permanent memorial. Member of Parliament Gavin King said the fate of the public housing home at 34 Murray Street, Manoora was decided upon by family representatives, locals, pastors and elders from the Torres Strait Island community. 'It's the right thing to do going forward to help with the grieving process,' Mr King said. Scroll down for video . 34 Murray Street, Manoora, where four boys and four girls were murdered, will be demolished and replaced with a permanent memorial . The decision was made by family representatives, locals, pastors and elders from the Torres Strait Island community . 'It certainly won't be the State Government coming in over the top and deciding what that will look like, or indeed the timing,' he added of the future memorial. While the house remains a crimes scene since the bodies of the four boys and four girls, between the ages of two and 14, were found on Friday, mourning friends and family continue to lay their tributes at a fig tree in a nearby park. One of the ideas being circulated for the memorial is for the park to be extended to include the property's land. Police are still unable to set a time frame to when their investigations will finish at the home of Raina Thaiday, 37, who is also known as Mersane Warria, and when the memorial will subsequently be built. 'We are not even a tenth of the way through. There is a lot more work to be done and we will just keep doing it,' Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar told the ABC of the ongoing investigation. Mr Asnicar said that hundreds of witnesses had already submitted statements to police, with more expected in the coming week. Plans are being made for funerals for the children however no date has been set. Mother-of-nine Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, has been formally charged with the stabbing deaths of the eight children in the Cairns home on Friday morning . Suggestions for the permanent memorial at 34 Murray Street, Manoora (pictured), will include extending the park to include the property's land . Thaiday, who has been formally charged with the deaths of four girls, aged 14, 12, 11, and two, and four boys, aged 9, 8, 6, and five -who were found in their Murray Street home by their 20-year-old brother on Friday morning - 'knows what has happened' but it 'hasn't sunk in yet,' her lawyer said today. She is being held in Cairns Base Hospital under police guard, and did not appear in court when the charges against her were mentioned on Monday. 'She's presently on an involuntary treatment order, which means she will be assessed so once she has been assessed then it may go to the mental health court at that stage,' her lawyer, Steve Macfarlane, said outside Cairns courthouse. 'She's coping as best as she can in Cairns Base Hospital where she will be for a while.' Asked by journalists about her state, Mr Macfarlane said: 'I'm not a doctor, but I think she probably knows what happened but doesn't realise it, it hasn't sunk in.' Magistrate Alan Comans adjourned the case until January 30 and dismissed a request for is to be referred to the mental health court. 'Until she's finished her treatment and police have finished their investigation there's not a lot that can be done,' Mr Macfarlane said. While the house remains a crime scene, mourners continue to lay tributes at the base of a fig tree in the park .

A cousin (second from right) is not a victim . A mourner attends a floral tribute near the house in which eight children were stabbed to death . Thaiday's lawyer also confirmed the alleged murderer has had visitors to her bedside. 'I'm aware that she has been visited by some people but how close a family member they are and how many people I am not aware of,' Mr Macfarlane said. Inside court, no family attended the hearing as Mr Macfarlane requested the trial be heard in a mental health court. Mr Comans rejected the request, saying: 'No, there is no need.' As police try and determine what could have driven Thaiday to allegedly murder seven of her nine children, along with a niece,  new details have emerged regarding her troubled past and recent erratic behaviour. Neighbours have told how she reportedly ran through the streets on Thursday night screaming 'Don't let them take them away from us. God bless us. Forgive me for what I'll do'. A local told The Courier Mail that after recently finding God, Thaiday believed mobile phones were 'the work of the devil'.

The father of three children (2nd from right) who were among eight children allegedly murdered by their mother, attends a memorial service in Cairns on Sunday . The Australian reported Thaiday's, whose nine children had five different fathers, struggled to find a stable home after falling pregnant at 14 and was allegedly attacked with a hammer a decade ago. An uncle of the eight children said Thaiday had begun expressing increased religious devotion, attending St Margaret's Anglican Church in Westcourt every Sunday for the month leading up to the alleged mass murder. 'She had this church DVD she was always watching. She'd started preaching to me in the last week or so. Always talking about God,' he said. More neighbours revealed Thaiday was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found. Senior investigators refused to rule out the possibility that drugs were a factor in Thaiday's behaviour. The father of the youngest four children was carried to add flowers to the tribute, collapsing on the floor and beating the ground at the foot of the willow tree . The grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!' Shortly after she gave birth to her first child she moved into cramped public housing in Manoora and was shunted between houses as her family grew, The Australian reported. Anna Jackson, who has known Thaiday for more than 20 years, said she had been abused by a former partner, who allegedly bashed her on the head with a hammer. Less than a week ago, one of the children's fathers moved out of the home  they shared after the children's uncle reported hearing fighting. 'He's been heard shouting at her that if she didn't stop, he was leaving. And then he did, moving into a house with other relatives,' he said. 'The dad wanted to take the kids up to Bamaga. That's what he told me he was doing, he'd been talking about it for six weeks.' Thaiday appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns hospital, where she is being treated for stab wounds to the chest, which were possibly self-inflicted. At the house were heartbreaking scenes as family members made their way up to a willow tree where tributes have been left for the young alleged victims. The maternal grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!'

She was supported by other family members as she wailed, her eyes closed in raw grief as she clutched a small white towel to her face to wipe away her tears. Several men carried one of the fathers to the scene where he sat on a seat - weak and inconsolable. He was frail and unable to hold his own body up as he screamed his children's names into the sky in a hoarse voice. The father of the youngest four children was carried to add flowers to the tribute, collapsing on the floor and beating the ground at the foot of the tree. 'Raiden', 'Rodney', 'Azza' and 'baby girl', the father screamed over and over again in a rasping voice, while sobbing uncontrollably. Detective Inspector Bruno Ansicar told reporters on Sunday the horrific scene was taking its toll on police. 'It's clearly the most tragic event we've had to deal with (in Cairns),' Insp Ansicar told reporters. Vigils and memorials for the slain children, who ranged in age from two to 14, were held throughout Queensland on Sunday. Townsville and the Brisbane suburb of Inala also hosted memorials.","The decision was made by family representatives, locals, pastors and elders from the Torres Strait Island community .

"Geoffrey Lederman, pictured at Blackfriars Crown Court mowed down a woman after mistaking the brake of his classic Mercedes for the accelerator . A retired stockbroker who mowed down a woman after mistaking the brake of his classic Mercedes for the accelerator at 50mph has been jailed for 18 months. Geoffrey Lederman, 83, had careered onto the pavement and ploughed into Desreen Brooks and only narrowly missed her son, as her horrified husband looked on. The 33-year-old mother, from South London, was killed and a young woman suffered brain damage and lost an eye in the crash, a court heard. Witnesses described seeing Lederman's 1982 Mercedes 380SL 'screaming' along West End Lane in upmarket West Hampstead, north London, amid a cloud of smoke before hurtling along the footpath at speed, the court heard. Ms Brooks had been walking with her husband, Ben Brooks-Dutton, a director for PR agency Freuds, who managed to push their son Jackson's pram clear, but was unable to save his wife, who died of her injuries. The family of the Ms Brooks have since been praised for their 'courage'. Blackfriars Crown Court heard following the crash Lederman's doctor had bizarrely recommended he get back on the road as soon as possible. The doctor suggested this would help Lederman, who has had a suicide attempt, recover his 'state of mind.' The collision, which happened on 10 November 2012, also left Amy Werner, a 23-year-old student at the University of Westminster originally from Vermont, seriously injured. Ms Werner fell into a three-week coma and now suffers from chronic cerebral damage, as well as the permanent loss of sight in one of her eyes. Lederman, who was driving at up to 54mph, kept his foot on the accelerator of the 3.8 litre V8 Mercedes for '19 to twenty seconds' before running into a brick wall. He suffered a fractured sternum and had to be cut out of the car, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Lederman, who had impaired eyesight and have previously suffered a stroke, had failed to spot pedestrians on the pavement as he tried to stop his runaway car by smashing into a garden wall. Christopher Donellan QC, in mitigation, said his client was genuinely remorseful for what had happened. 'For each individual, it is so devastating. We fully understand the hurt and pain experienced by Mr Brooks-Dutton. 'What we have is a very elderly man and an episode has taken place during his drive that he was unable to sort out. Desreen Brooks had been walking with her husband, Ben Brooks-Dutton, (both pictured) when Lederman careered onto the pavement . Lederman was driving a classic 1982 Mercedes 380SL when he crashed into Ms Brooks (stock image) 'He doesn't know (that he should not have been driving). We don't have a system in this country which properly assesses people. He was on a three-year licence renewal and his doctor didn't ever suggest he shouldn't drive.' Jailing Lederman, Judge Peter Clarke QC said: 'It is clear to me that you made the cardinal error of mistaking the accelerator for the brake. 'I should make it clear that I am entirely satisfied that you were fatigued after playing several hours of contract bridge, your powerful car slipped out of gear... and in your tiredness you put the car back in gear when the accelerator was deeply depressed.' Judge Clarke noted Lederman's previously flawless record, and noted that he had been driving for 50 years - 32 with the Mercedes. 'I recognise that you have said to doctors that it was you rather than those young women who should have suffered and died, for you have had a long life and theirs has been ended and blighted,' Judge Clarke continued. 'The sentence I am about to pass is not in order to make an example of you, but it must be understood that old age cannot be seen as as any excuse of mitigation for dangerous or even careless driving. Mr Brooks-Dutton was able to push their son Jackson's pram clear, but was unable to save his wife, who died of her injuries . 'An elderly driver who knows or should acknowledge that he or she is losing his or her faculties is no less a danger than a drunken driver who knows the same. 'Your lifetime of blameless driving is of no comfort to the Brooks-Dutton family.' Lederman, who had impaired eyesight and had previously suffered a stroke, was excused from attending the trial. He was unanimously convicted in his absence of causing death by dangerous driving but acquitted of causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Werner. Mr Brooks-Dutton, who attended the entire trial with his grieving parents-in-law, wept and visibly shook as the verdict was announced. The family of the Ms Brooks have since been praised for their 'courage'  by police in the face of Lederman's refusal to plead guilty' The family have been praised for their 'courage' by police in the face of Lederman's refusal to plead guilty.' Detective Sergeant Cheryl Frost, of the Met's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'This case highlights how a momentary mistake resulted in a tragic death of a mother and caused life changing injuries to another young woman. 'It is important for motorists to regularly monitor their driver behaviour and that of their elderly relatives to ensure that the roads are safe for all road users. 'Lederman confused the pedals of the car and instead of braking as he approached a bend too fast he accelerated into a group of pedestrians causing horrific injuries to Desreen Brooks who died at the scene. 'I would like to pay tribute to Desreen's family as well as Amy Werner and her family for the courage they have shown during this time, prolonged by Lederman's refusal to plead guilty and take responsibility for his actions.' The former banker, pictured appearing at Blackfriars Crown Court, was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving . Judge Clarke earlier said Lederman had been 'an in-patient following a suicide attempt' and there were fears about his state of mind. Defence barrister, Christopher Donnellan QC, said in his mitigation that he was 'not in any way trying to minimise the consequences of what happened..' 'In doing so [mitigating] we are acutely conscious that Mr Brooks-Dutton, his son, his family, have sat throughout the the trial and have suffered in the way none of us can properly understand,' Mr Donnellan said. 'In addressing these matters we are making absolutely no excuses.' Mr Donnellan said it was an 'awful thing' that there isn't a system in place in this country that assesses the faculties of elderly people and their ability to drive. Lederman, who was driving at up to 54mph, kept his foot on the accelerator of the 3.8 litre V8 Mercedes for '19 to twenty seconds' before running into a brick wall, pictured above . He said that tragically Lederman was unaware of his own deteriorating faculties. He added that he was left 'aghast' when Lederman's doctor suggested the defendant get out on the road again as soon as possible. The court then heard Lederman was suffering from a pre-dementia condition, and that his health - including a weak heart - is likely to detereorate inside prison. Jurors were shown harrowing CCTV footage of the blue Mercedes travelling at high speed before crossing onto the wrong side of the road, onto the path and into the women, at around 8.30pm. The defence maintained throughout that Lederman had suffered a 'medical aberration'. Dr Dominic Heaney, a consultant neurologist, told the court the pensioner looked 'confused about his accelerator and his environment' before the smash. Jurors were shown harrowing CCTV footage of the blue Mercedes travelling at high speed before crossing onto the wrong side of the road, onto the path and into the women, at around 8.30pm . He said Lederman's apparent amnesia after the crash could have been another symptom of a neurological episode. But, according to the prosecution, the elderly driver 'deliberately steered' his car onto the pavement in a bid to stop it. Lederman, of from Maida Vale, in London, was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving but acquitted of causing grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail. Speaking after Lederman's conviction, Mr Dutton-Brooks said: 'The inability of an 83-year-old driver to distinguish the accelerator from the brake of a car that he had been driving for over 30 years is the reason why my son will grow up without his mother. 'Perhaps it is time for us to question how fit certain individuals are to be on the road. 'I appeal to anyone who might be concerned that it is time for their elderly or infirm friends or relatives to stop driving not to delay. Do something before it's too late.' Mr Brooks-Dutton added he could not forgive the legal manoeuvres by Lederman's lawyers - attempts 'to avoid this case being heard in a timely fashion' or have it thrown out entirely. 'What happened was a tragedy for all parties and no result could ever have remedied the pain felt by its many victims. We have all suffered. 'At no time have my family and I been shown any true signs of remorse or consideration through the defendant's approach to this trial.'","Geoffrey Lederman had crashed his powerful Mercedes into two women .

"The wife of the Sydney siege gunman has arrived in court as authorities push for her to be placed behind bars over alleged murder charges. Wearing a tan trench-coat and white beanie, Amirah Droudis, 35, refused to condemn her husband's crimes when given the opportunity by the media outside Downing Centre Local Court. 'Leave us alone!' her brother John Aspros said. Droudis was granted bail by a local court after she was charged with the murder of gunman Man Haron Monis's estranged wife Noleen Hayson Pal in 2013. Pal was found dead in a western Sydney stairwell, having been stabbed eighteen times and set alight. Scroll down for video . Amirah Droudis, 35, arrived at Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Monday morning . After it was revealed Monis was on bail when he took 18 people hostage at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place last Monday, NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard demanded a review into Droudis bail decision. The matter will be heard by the Chief Magistrate, Judge Graeme Henson. Hostages Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, and the gunman died when police stormed the cafe more than 16 hours after the siege began. An autopsy of Monis's body has now been completed and a burial order will be made on Monday, which means the body will be released to next of kin to organise burial. Monis was on bail charged with being an accessory to Ms Pal's murder. The wife of the Sydney siege gunman is in court as authorities push for her to be placed behind bars over alleged murder charges . Wearing a tan trench-coat and white beanie, Droudis,  refused to condemn her husband's crimes . A court was told earlier this year that Droudis and Monis vigorously denied the murder allegations and would plead not guilty. 'The charges laid against Amirah Droudis are extremely serious and her alleged actions involve a murder,' Mr Hazzard said in a statement last week. 'This week I asked the DPP to review any cases where bail had been granted where there may have been any similarity to the circumstances of Man Haron Monis. 'In this case the allegation is that he and she had involvement in the murder of Monis' ex-wife. Amirah Droudis, pictured here with friends, was known by her traditional Greek name Anastasia before she converted to Islam after meeting Man Haron Monis . In her youth Anastasia Droudis worked as a hairdresser in the Kings Cross nightclub district . 'On behalf of our community I want to know whether every aspect of her being on bail has been examined in all possible detail.' NSW Premier Mike Baird said he shared everyone’s rage that Monis was out on bail. 'The public need to know: We have already taken action and strengthened the bail laws. The new, tougher laws come into effect next month. I am advised that these laws would have succeeded where our old laws have failed us,' he said in a statement. 'The advice I have from NSW Police is that the hostage taker did not have a gun licence. Questions remain around how he was in possession of a weapon. We will get to the bottom of it. 'I am determined that we will learn from these events. I’ve announced, along with the Prime Minister, that we will be having a full review of the events leading up to the siege. 'I assure you: If we have to do anything more, we will.' Before Droudis married self-styled Sheikh Monis she was known by a different first name - Anastasia, a nod to her Greek heritage. Born to Greek Orthodox migrants who live in Belmore, south-west Sydney, Droudis worked as a hairdresser in Sydney's Kings Cross during her late teenage years. As a young adult, she would often visit bars, drink and party with friends, a source previously close to her told Daily Mail Australia. But after she met the Iranian fanatic in the mid-2000s,  Droudis dropped her birth name in favour of Amirah, an Arabic name, and converted to Islam. 'She's been Anastasia for 30 years,' the source said. 'You can't just turn around and say, 'I'm whatever now''. The source said she became 'influenced' by Monis after the two struck up a relationship following the collapse of her former relationship with her previous partner of eight years. Amirah's brother, John Aspros, told Daily Mail Australia this week that Monis often spent time at the home of Amirah's parents, which was raided by NSW Police officers following the bloody end to the Lindt cafe siege on Tuesday. Droudis declined to comment outside her home this week and later reported to Campsie Police Station where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. Sydney lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis and Droudis in court, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that Droudis was a pleasant client to work with. 'She's always extremely courteous, pleasant,' he said. 'But… it's also fair to observe that she would defer to Monis.' Attorney General Brad Hazzard has expressed concern to the Director of Public Prosecution over Droudis' bail after two people died when her husband took 18 people hostage in the Lindt cafe on Monday . Amirah Droudis remains free despite being charged with serious crimes, including murder . Man Haron Monis, pictured, was the gunman who took 18 hostages and terrified Sydney in a sixteen-hour siege . Droudis declined to comment outside her home last week. She was pictured attending Campsie Police Station last week, where is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. Four years before the alleged murder, a woman believed to be Droudis, posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will. The videos bear the address of Monis' website. 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman, 'Amirah', in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab. In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Bali bombings as 'acts of God.' Bailed: Droudis was pictured at Campsie Police Station last Tuesday, hours after her family's home in Belmore was raided by authorities following her husband's siege. Reporting to police is part of the condition of her bail on charges of murdering Noleen Hayson Pal, Monis' ex-wife . 'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.' The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. At around the same time both Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan. Relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted and sentenced to community service. In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involving seven women that allegedly took place while he posed as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case. Mother: Amirah Droudis is pictured here around a decade ago .

"A Maine man has been charged with killing his girlfriend and her two children, whose bodies were discovered inside the mobile home they shared. Keith Coleman, of Garland, faces three counts of murder in the deaths of 36-year-old Christina Sargent, her 10-year-old son, Duwayne Coke, and her 8-year-old daughter, Destiny Sargent. The three were found dead inside the family's trailer just before 10pm Saturday by Penobscot County sheriff's deputies, who had been alerted by worried relatives. Murder suspect: Keith Coleman (left), 27, has been charged with killing his girlfriend, 36-year-old Christina Sargent (right) and her two children . So young: Duwayne Coke (right), 10, and his 8-year-old sister, Destiny Sargent (left), were discovered slain inside their family's trailer home in Maine . Acting on a tip, deputies searching for Coleman found him Sunday afternoon at an apartment building in Bucksport where he was visiting friends. The minivan that Coleman had been driving and that police had sought was found parked outside the apartment. Coleman, 27, was transported to the state police barracks in Bangor for questioning, then sent to the Penobscot County Jail. His first court appearance will be Monday or Tuesday, state police said. Autopsies on the mother and her children are scheduled for Monday. Authorities have not said how they think the family were killed. The mobile home is under police guard. Detectives planned to return Monday. The Bangor Daily News reported two of the bodies were discovered inside the home at 12 Paul Road in rural Maine by a relative performing a welfare check on the family. Crime scene: Sheriff's deputies were called to Sargent's mobile home in a Bangor suburb by concerned relatives . Shocking find: A family member arrived at the trailer on rural Paul Road first and came upon two of the victims' bodies . When sheriff's deputies arrived on the scene at 9.50pm, they came upon the third body. The sheriff's office launched a search Saturday night for Keith Coleman in connection to the deaths after naming him a person of interest. The 27-year-old was taken into custody at around 3pm Sunday as he was leaving a friend's apartment in Bucksport. Coleman's ex-girlfriend Amanda Ellis told the paper that the man and Christina Sargent, who was her cousin, had been together since January 2012. Couple: Coleman (left) and Sargent (pictured right with her daughter) had been together for nearly three years . History of violence: Coleman's ex-girlfriend - and Sargent's cousin - said the man had tried to stranle her several times and threatened her with a knife before they broke up . Ellis, who has a 3-year-old with Coleman, said the suspect has a history of domestic violence, including several instances in which the 27-year-old had tried to strangle her and pulled a knife on her. Coleman's criminal record includes two arrests in 2011 and 2013 on outstanding warrants, and a conviction in October 2011 for growing marijuana .","Keith Coleman, 27, charged with three counts of murder in deaths of Christina Sargent, 36, Duwayne Coke, 10, and  Destiny Sargent, 8 .

"Bankruptcy behind it, Detroit's atmosphere swirls with the promise of better days. Charles Floyd Jones can only hope that the city's good fortune trickles down to him and the 10 other residents of a tent city that's sprouted in the shadow of a resurgent downtown where rental occupancy is close to full and restaurants and shops are doing brisk business. Jones and others in this makeshift community of seven tents — believed to be the only tent city in Detroit — say they have nowhere else to go. 'By us being out of bankruptcy, they can see that you got people out here that's struggling,' said Jones, 51. The tent city residents must also face the possibility of frigid weather and harsh conditions: this week Detroit is forecast to see temperatures in the 40s, plus rain and flurries, according to the Weather Channel. Makeshift: Charles Floyd Jones picks up trash at the tent city on the eastern edge of downtown Detroit. Jones can only hope that the city's good fortune trickles down to him and the 10 other residents of the tent city . Resident:  Josh Reslow, 23, and his girlfriend Brittney Hines, 25, are seen outside the tent city erected outside the eastern edge of downtown Detroit . The city's homeless numbers swelled over the past decade as manufacturing and other jobs disappeared and homes were lost during the national foreclosure crisis. All told, about 16,200 of Detroit's 680,000 residents — almost 2.4 percent — are believed to be living on the streets or in temporary shelters — and that doesn't account for other types of homelessness, such as teens going from friend to friend and families living in motels. By comparison, only about 1 percent of San Francisco's more than 800,000 residents are homeless. But San Francisco is on much firmer financial ground than Detroit, which shed $7 billion in debt during bankruptcy. Its restructuring plan aims to raise revenue and improve city services with $1.7 billion in funding, but it also calls for austerity in budgeting. 'I love Detroit. I'd hope things would get better,' said 29-year-old Josh Reslow, who shares a tent in the encampment with girlfriend Brittney Hines, 25. 'I'm a carpenter and with no work going on, I guess, that's part of the reason I'm on the street.' The city has 'tried to provide' for homeless programs throughout Detroit's financial crisis and bankruptcy, according to the Rev. Faith Fowler, executive director of the nonprofit Cass Community Social Services. Her nonprofit is one of three that will operate warming centers through the end of March on behalf of the city. 'They want to make sure that people are safe and that their needs are met throughout the winter,' she said. Like others sheltered only by layers of warm clothing beneath canvas tents, Jones 'hustles' because he can't find a steady job. He accepts handouts and makes a few bucks directing fans into downtown parking lots before sporting events. He said he helped start the tent city about two months ago, with others joining later. Camped out: Charles Floyd Jones, pictured, Jones and others in this makeshift community of seven tents say they have nowhere else to go . 'It's quiet and you really don't get bothered by too many people,' said Jones, who also lives with his girlfriend and has been homeless for four years. He isn't a fan of the rescue mission: 'The last time I was there, I got bedbugs. Hopefully, I can find a shelter somewhere that's presentable and me and my girl can go and make a stay for the winter.' Lewis Hickson, operations manager of the Neighborhood Service Organization's Tumaini Center, said his group has dropped off coats at the tent city that can be used as sleeping bags. 'You try to encourage them to come in out of the cold,' Hickson said. 'They really don't like shelter life because of the rules.' One strategy to get the chronically homeless off the street is to make them eligible for state and federal rental assistance programs, according to Dr. Robert Okin, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco Medical School. Similar programs are found in Detroit and elsewhere in Michigan. 'That can then be used to help the city pay for low-cost housing. It will cover a lot of the rent,' said Okin, who wrote about homeless Americans in his book 'Silent Voices.' Nationally, about 85 percent of the chronically homeless stay in permanent housing once they have access, but Okin warned that it should be supportive housing, with 'staff that can help people when they get into trouble.' Detroit officials have received no complaints about the tent city and have no plans to move them from the park, said Sgt. Michael Woody, a police department spokesman. 'They're not breaking any laws that are violent in nature or effecting quality of life issues,' Woody said. 'If they did want to leave, we would help them with what resources we could muster, but discussions may need to be had soon in finding them something a little more permanent.'","A tent city which includes 11 residents and seven tents has sprouted in the in the shadow of a resurgent downtown Detroit .

"A father is locked in a tug-of-love battle after his ex-girlfriend took their young son to live in Turkey without telling him following a holiday romance with a waiter. Nabeel Arshad did not know the whereabouts of his eight-year-old son Logan until he saw on Facebook that his ex Laura Semple had taken him to the Middle Eastern country. It then emerged that the 23-year-old mother had started a relationship with a Turkish waiter and decided to move to the country - 2,000 miles away from Mr Arshad's home in Scotland. Distraught: Nabeel Arshad has not seen his son Logan, pictured on a tablet computer, since last year . The worried father, 27, has contacted the police in a bid to force his former partner to return their son, but was told they could do nothing because he gave permission for Logan to leave Britain in the first place. He has not seen his son for nearly 18 months, and fears he is not being brought up properly so far from his family. Mr Arshad's ordeal began last year, when Ms Semple took Logan on holiday to the Mediterranean resort of Marmaris with her parents. The boy's father, who lives in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, consented to the trip, and even gave his son spending money for his holiday. However, during the trip Ms Semple started a romance with a local waiter, and after briefly returning to the UK she decided to settle in Turkey for good. Mr Arshad said: 'I only found out through Facebook when my brother told me.' Family: Mr Arshad allowed Logan to go on holiday with his mother, but they never returned to Britain . He contacted Police Scotland and the Foreign Office - but they were unable to help him locate his son. 'The police, Scottish Government and social workers won't help, so I'm having to take the law into my own hands and go over there to get him,' the MOT examiner said. 'Nothing is working at the moment. It is like a cruel joke.' In a letter to Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Arshad wrote: 'I'm devastated and have no one else to turn to. 'Logan is not getting an education over there. I have not spoken to him in 18 months. I'm at my wits' end. 'He's only eight years old. Please help me, please.' The father was arrested for harassment after trying to contact Ms Semple's parents, but two months ago the charge was found to be 'not proven' at Glasgow Sheriff Court. New home: Logan is apparently living in the Turkish resort of Marmaris, on the Mediterranean Sea . The problem of parents abducting their own children is a growing one, with the Foreign Office dealing with 10 alleged cases every week. A spokesman for Reunite, the national charity which deals with the issue, said: 'Largely, abductions are down to the fact that air travel is now so easy but are most often caused by relationship breakdown with the majority carried out by mothers. 'These cases can be devastating for parents left behind.' British authorities can often be powerless to intervene once a child has been taken overseas, because they fall under the legal system of a different country. A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Officers in Turkey have spoken to the child's mother and they established both were safe and well. 'Police Scotland confirmed that the child's mother is entitled to take her son abroad. 'Police officers provided advice and guidance, in addition to speaking to the Foreign a Office to ensure the child's well-being.' A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of a case involving a British national in Turkey and are providing consular assistance.'","Nabeel Arshad allowed his ex Laura Semple to take son Logan to Turkey .

"A rare first-hand account of the Battle of Rorke's Drift - where 150 soldiers successfully fought off 4,000 Zulu warriors, has gone on display for the first time. Written by one of the British heroes on a tiny scrap of paper, it is thought to be the earliest account of the battle which was immortalised in the 1964 film Zulu, starring Michael Caine and Stanley Baker. Assistant Commissary Officer (ACO) Walter Dunne's letter to his friend Captain W.J. Warneford at Cape Colony, describes how he and a vastly outnumbered group of soldiers successfully defended their missionary outpost at Rorke's Drift in South Africa. Scroll down for video . The Battle of Rorke's Drift was famously immortalised in the 1964 film Zulu, starring Michael Caine and Stanley Baker (pictured) The unique relic was dated January 24, 1879 - two days after the British Army suffered one of their worst defeats in history when 1,350 were slaughtered by the Zulu army at the Battle of Isandlwana. ACO Dunne was later recommended for the Victoria Cross for his role in the heroic stand. He wrote that, within just two hours of receiving word that 4,000 Zulu warriors were heading towards them, the soldiers had managed fortified their tiny stronghold with grain biscuit boxes. Soon the Zulus were attacking 'determinedly on all sides.' Assistant Commissary Officer Walter Dunne's letter to his friend Captain W.J. Warneford at Cape Colony is on display at The Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh . In it he describes how he and a vastly outnumbered group of soldiers successfully defended their missionary outpost at Rourke's Drift in South Africa . The invading army drove the troops out of the hospital, killed its patients and set it alight. ACO Dunne goes onto say they then made several attempts to storm the outpost, but the 80-strong group of men kept fighting and by morning, the Zulus had retreated leaving 351 dead bodies. The letter, which was bought by The Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh, was hand written from Rorke's Drift less than 24 hours after the battle on a chit for bags of mealie. He also describes how, after the Zulus killed 1,500 British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot at Isandlwana, they headed to the outpost at Rorke's Drift, quickly surrounding the troops. Those famous scenes were recreated in Zulu, starring Stanley Baker as senior officer Lieutenant John Chard, who assumes command of the small British detachment, and Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. Rorke's Drift/ 24 Jan.r '79/ . My dear Warneford, . Sad news about the 1/24th. (1st Battalion, 24th Foot) 5Cd commanded by Col. Pulleine were cut to pieces and the camp sacked. 20 Officers are missing. About 1000 of the Kafirs came in here and attacked us on the same day (22nd). We had got about 2 hours notice and fortified the place with trap of grain biscuit boxes &c. They came on most determinedly on all sides. They drove our fellows out of the Hospital, killed the patients and burned the place. They made several attempts to storm us but the soldiers (B Co of 24th under Bromhead) kept up such a steady killing fire that they were driven back each time. We had only 80 men, the contingent having bolted before a shot was fired. The fight was kept up all night & in the morning the Kafirs retreated leaving 351 dead bodies. Dalton was wounded in the shoulder and temp clerk Byrne killed & 12 of the men... W A Dunne (over) Some of the missing are Pulleine, Col. Dunford, Capt. Russell, Hodson (killed), Anstey, Daly, Mostyn, Dyer, Griffith, Pope, Austin, Pulleine (2 Mr.) Shepherd (S... major) Wardell (killed), Younghusband, Degacher, Porteous, Carage Dyson, Atkinson - Coghill is believed to have escaped & also Melvill. Set in the aftermath of the bloody Battle of Isandlwana, the band of men fight through day and night, defending wave after wave of the attackers from their small missionary post. In the final assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a small redoubt constructed out of mealie bags where they manage to inflict heavy casualties. It buys the British soldiers a three-hour reprieve but when the Zulus re-form once more, they are resigned to their defeat. Instead the warriors sing a song to honour their bravery and withdraw. The Rorke's Drift letter was discovered in an album of letters, paintings and other items collected by Captain WJ Warneford's wife Winifred. The sale at auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire, also saw letters from Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, who commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 24th Foot, fetch £1,200 when they went under the hammer. They were bought by a collector who specialises in the Zulu wars. Lt Bromhead was awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the battle. Letters from Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Durnford, who was killed at nearby Isandlwana, were also part of the sale. Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine) battles a Zulu warrior in the film of the famous battle . Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described Dunne's letter as a 'unique piece of history'. 'Material from Rorke's Drift is like hen's teeth - you just do not come across it.' ACO Dunne, who was in charge of the stores at Rorke's Drift, praises Lt Bromhead in the letter, who was played by Caine in the famous film. The defence of Rorke's Drift was recognised with the awarding of no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses. ACO Dunne, from County Cork, was turned down for a VC but was mentioned in dispatches. After 35 years of service, he retired to Gibraltar in 1908 but died the same year at a nursing home. Mr Aldridge described the album as a 'fascinating chronicle of a colonial family in the early part of the 19th century - a tumultuous period of history'. Curator of the The Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh (Brecon) Richard Davies where the  letter is now on display said it gave a 'unique insight' into the famous battle . 'It's a very important part of the collection and very relevant to the displays we have here. 'We think it is the earliest written account of the battle, which would have been written while they were still recovering from the attack.' De Neuville's Painting of the Battle of Rorke's Drift, based on eye witness accounts  it depicts several events of the battle occurring at once. It was on January 22 1879, on the Natal border with Zululand, in South Africa, that the tiny British garrison of 140 men - many of them sick and wounded - fought for at least 12 hours to repel repeated attacks by up to 4,000 Zulu warriors. The defence was rewarded by Queen Victoria's government with no fewer than 11 Victoria Crosses. The name of Rorke's Drift led to the much-loved film starring Stanley Baker and Michael Caine. The movie, which is still celebrated more than 50 years after it was made, saw Baker play Lieutenant John Chard, while Caine played his right-hand man, Lieutenant Goville Bromhead. After fighting day and night the Zulus eventually retreated after 351 of the men died and 500 were wounded. It was part of the wider Anglo - Zulu war took place during 1879. The conflict began because the Zulu kingdom presented an obstacle to British imperial ambitions in southern Africa. The British invasion of Zululand began on January 11 1879, with the British objective being an eventual federation in Africa. The battle of Isandlwana erupted on the 22nd of January 1879, 11 days after the British started their invasion. 20,000 Zulu warriors attacked 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and 400 civilians. The Zulus, who had more numbers, overwhelmed the British, killing over 1,300 troops, while around 1,000 Zulu soldiers were killed. The battle of Rorke's Drift started almost immediately after, ending on the 23rd. The Battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July 1879 effectively ended the Zulu-Anglo war, with the defeat of the Zulu forces by the British when over 5,200 British and African soldiers razed the capital of Zululand after defeating the main Zulu army. The war ultimately ended with a British victory, and Zulu independence.","Officer Walter Dunne's letter is thought to be the earliest account of battle .

"A grim gun-toting Santa has been spotted advertising assault rifles on a billboard in California. Steve Dyke, the co-owner of Down Range Indoor Training Center in the city of Chico, commissioned the billboard to catch the attention of drivers travelling along Highway 99 - but some people are not happy about it. The tooled-up Father Christmas has no jolly smile, is wearing sunglasses, and wields the AR-15 firearm next to the slogan: 'We build AR's for Santa.' You BETTER be good, for goodness sake: This billboard on the outskirts of the city of Chico, California, shows a scary-looking Santa with an assault rifle. It was put up by a gun store owner . 'You know, 'tis the season, so we thought it would be a good idea,'  Mr Dyke told CBS. 'We actually got a kick out of it - thought it would be good and other people would think it was funny.' Customer Bob Marshall supports the billboard: 'That's a  second amendment right and I believe in it fully.' However, teacher Sara Welday told the TV station she thinks the ad is 'kinda scary'. Santa Claus is gunning you down: Jolly old Saint Nick is clutching an AR-15 assault rifle, a popular and controversial weapon in the U.S. Festive firearm: The tooled-up Father Christmas has no jolly smile, is wearing sunglasses, and wields the firearm next to the slogan: 'We build AR's for Santa' She said: 'As a teacher, I would not want my students to see that. I don't think you need to put out that as Santa has a gun.' But Mr Dyke has no plans to take the ad down and says he has received support from customers. He said: 'Well, you know, some people get toys and stuff like that for Christmas. Other people, when I was growing up, I got guns from Santa Claus. 'I mean, it's just a matter of where you're from.' The AR-15 was the gun used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who killed 20 first grade children and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. A gun store that featured a picture of comedy superstar Will Ferrell alongside a controversial assault rifle was ordered to take down the advert by Hollywood executives . It was also the firearm used by James Holmes when he killed 12 cinemagoers at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises last July in Aurora, Colorado. A proposal by President Barack Obama to stop civilians being able to buy rifles such as the AR-15 fell apart even before reaching Congress. An estimated five million AR-15s are now in civilian hands. In November it was reported that a gun store that featured an advert with comedy superstar Will Ferrell alongside a controversial assault rifle was ordered to take it down  by Hollywood executives. Family Firearms, in Valrico, Florida, featured an image from the hit 2003 Christmas film, which made more than $220million worldwide, on a flyer for a 'Build-n-AR' event in December, where customers are taught to build and then take home an AR-15 rifle for $895. But the company which produced Elf was not happy and sent the gun store a cease-and-desist order, reports TMZ.","Billboard features a stern Santa clutching the fully-automatic weapon .

"Carl Mason, 32, has been jailed for a fifth time after stealing a charity collection box. Pictured, his mugshot this year . A serial charity box thief has been jailed for the fifth time after raiding a collection tin for Great Ormond Hospital. Carl Mason, 32, has racked up more than 100 offences - and after stealing cash from so many charity boxes, he admitted the petty thefts had become 'second nature' to him. The unemployed father-of-three, from Burnley in Lancashire, has stolen from well-known causes including the Poppy Appeal, Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) and the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. Police described Mason - who would snatch collection tins while loitering in shops, banks and pubs and then spend the money on his heroin habit - as 'callous, despicable and beneath contempt'. They added he had 'taken advantage of the goodwill of his local communities.' Mason even stole Poppy Appeal tins on the day the country prepared to hold a two minute silence for Armistice Day. His latest thefts occurred just days after he was freed early from one of his custodial sentences. It involved him using special cutters to saw through the straps holding the tins down in shops and a doctors' surgery. He was jailed for a year in 2011 and was handed a six-month sentence in 2012. On Friday, Mason was given another 28 days in jail by Pennine magistrates after stealing cash boxes raising money for patients at a hospice, as well as the Poppy Appeal again. He admitted three charges of theft and asked for two offences to be considered. Four of the charity boxes were collecting money for Pendleside Hospice in Reedley, Burnley, and one, snatched from a medical practice, was said to contain a ' substantial amount of money.' Tracy Yates, prosecuting, said in November, Mason took a Poppy Appeal box from Winckleys Sandwich and Coffee Bar in Preston. Police identified him from CCTV footage. A week later, Mason pinched a collection tin from the reception of a doctors' surgery on Yorkshire Street in Burnley. Mason has more than 100 offences to his named and was jailed for a year in 2011, left, and for six months in 2012, right . Police watched the CCTV footage and saw Mason moving his arms in a sawing motion before leaving with something hidden inside his jacket. Ms Yates said on November 23, Mason struck at Pratts News on Padiham Road, Burnley, cutting through the straps attaching the box to the counter. And on December 1, Mason took a box from Bailey and Garrett chemist on Rosegrove Lane, Burnley. The prosecutor said: 'CCTV footage again showed the defendant cutting the straps attaching the box to the counter.' Three days later, Mason was seen on CCTV at Todd Pharmacy, Burnley Road, Padiham, producing some cutters from his pocket before using them on the strings attached to the box. He then hid the tin and left. CCTV footage showed Mason, left, in woolly hat at a Santander bank branch in Blackburn, Lancashire where he stole the Poppy appeal tin . The court heard Mason even stole Poppy Appeal tins on the day the country prepared to hold a two -minute silence for Armistice Day . Ms Yates added Mason was interviewed about the offences and told police his heroin habit had 'rocketed.' 'He said he was ashamed of his actions and didn't want to hurt anyone.' She added the defendant said he couldn't recall the thefts at the two chemist shops, but said it was 'his nature' to commit that type of offence. 'He was shown the footage from Todd Pharmacy and at that point he became quite emotional and couldn't watch it any longer. He said he had got himself in a mess and couldn't get himself out of it.' Mason had 113 previous offences on his record, including a year long jail term in 2011. He was jailed again in April for stealing charity boxes - three months after receiving a suspended sentence for a similar theft. In August, while serving the term, he appeared from custody via video link at Preston Magistrates Court and was given a 12 month conditional discharge after owning up to stealing charity boxes for Marie Curie and Dogs for the Disabled. Mason had 113 previous offences on his record, including a year-long jail term in 2011 and a six-month sentence the following year . His latest thefts occurred just days after he was freed early from one of his custodial sentences . In October, he received his fifth prison term when he was given 12 weeks for taking a collecting tin for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital from the Queen Victoria Pub in Burnley, on September 28. Graeme Parkinson, defending, said when Mason was released from prison in August, he had nowhere to go, got back in with his old associates and started using illicit substances again. He was then returned to custody. After he was freed on November 7, Mr Parkinson said accommodation found for him was unsuitable, he had problems sorting out his benefits and again had difficulties staying clear of drugs. He added: 'He tells me that he has finally managed to have his benefits sorted out and he has managed to find more suitable accommodation. 'He has taken advantage of the services which are offered by Inspire (the drugs and alcohol service) and he is now being prescribed methadone. 'He says that in recent times, he has managed to stabilise his life.' Mr Parkinson said Mason recollected some of the offences, but didn't remember others.","Carl Mason, 32, from Burnley, has racked up more than 100 offences .

A further series of  internal documents were also made public, ranging from plans for the upcoming James Bond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures. Pascal has been especially embarrassed by the leaks, recently having emails released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges. She also believed Idris Elba should be cast as the next James Bond.

French customs said the 14 adults and two children had been discovered moments before the lorry was due to board a ferry to Newhaven, East Sussex, on Friday. Scroll down for video . A group of illegal migrants were caught trying to sneak across the Channel into Britain hidden among a shipment of Christmas trees. File photo . All were sent to a refugee detention centre, while two drivers of the Polish-registered lorry were arrested. There are currently an estimated 2,000 migrants camped out in the port town of Calais hoping to board ferries to Britain. The authorities have warned that many are now taking increasingly dangerous risks to cross the Channel. Earlier this year, two migrants had to be rescued from the sea after they tried to climb aboard a moving ferry as it left Calais. The desperate refugees swam almost half a mile from the shore to reach the 600ft boat as it headed to Dover. Other migrants have risked their lives by hiding inside refrigerated lorries, clinging to the axles of heavy goods vehicles and even stowing away among a cargo of coffins. In October this year, these illegal migrants were pictured trying to board a truck in the northeastern French port of Calais .","Found concealed on a lorry carrying pine trees at Dieppe, northern France .

"While this eerie landscape may look more akin to a distant planet or star, these pictures of a volcano spewing blue lava were captured in Indonesia courtesy of one of Earth's most spectacular natural phenomenons. While the lava is usually an orange-red colour, the blue glow comes from flames produced when escaping sulphuric gases burn up inside the volcano in searing 600C heat. The volcano, known as the Ijen Crater, is located in East Java and is used by miners who rely on the sulphur, which gives off toxic fumes, for their livelihoods. The eerie blue glow atop an Indonesian volcano may look like something from a sci-fi film, but it is actually caused by sulphuric gases . Photographer Keow Wee Loong (pictured) snuck inside the volcano's grounds to take these otherworldly pictures of the Ijen Crater, on East Java . While the lava is usually an orange-red colour, the blue glow comes from flames produced when escaping sulphuric gases burn up inside the volcano in searing 600C heat . Miners, who work on Ijen despite the toxic fumes, rely on the spooky volcano for their livelihood, allowing the sulphur to cool before chipping it off . The incredible images were taken by brave photographer Keow Wee Loong, who snuck into the volcano's grounds under the cover of darkness earlier this month. Miners have run ceramic pipes from vents in the side of the mountain to collection points inside a large crater where the molten chemical is left to cool before being broken up and carried away. They work in treacherous conditions at the bottom of the crater, wearing nothing other than t-shirts and trousers as they collect the yellow material. They must also avoid the deadly turquoise-blue lake which takes up most of the crater floor as it is made up of almost pure sulphuric acid and would instantly kill anyone unlucky enough to fall in. Mr Loong, 26, stood just four feet away from the lava as it spewed from the crater, wearing a gas mask to deal with the toxic fumes. 'I was told by locals I wasn't allowed to go up to the crater because the toxic fumes are hazardous,' he said.

"The teenager who was subjected to a horrific gang rape outside her homecoming dance by up to 20 different men took the stand yesterday to testify against two of her accused attackers. It is the first time the victim, now 20, has made a public appearance since she was found by police in October 2009 naked, bleeding, beaten and urinated on underneath a picnic table. Identified only as Jane Doe, she told jurors in Contra Costa County Superior Court that she did not remember drinking that night, nor being sexually assaulted, but said she still bears severe scars from the incident. Jose Montano, 22, and Marcelles Peter, . 20, each face life in prison if convicted of assaulting the girl in . Richmond, California, after she left her high school homecoming dance. 'Vile': Jose Montano, 22, (left) and Marcelles Peter, 20, (right) laughed about participating in a gang-rape on a 16-year-old girl after her homecoming dance in October 2009, a witness testified . Trial: In court drawings made yesterday, 'Jane Doe' is seen testifying against her alleged attackers Jose Montano, far right, and Marcelles Peter, third from left . Horrific: Earlier in the trial, the jury was shown pictures of the injuries 'Jane Doe' sustained from the attack, which included cigarettes burned into her back . Face off: Nearly four years after she was gang raped, the victim of the brutal attack took the witness stand for the first time to recount her memories before she awoke the next day in 'excruciating pain' The two men showed no emotion as the . victim testified that the last thing she remembers is leaving the dance . because the loud music had given her a migraine and she was too hot. She told the court she has a hazy memory of the attack but remembers getting kicked in the stomach and falling over, the San Francisco Gate reports. 'I remember not seeing anything because my eyes were closed and I was holding onto my necklace and getting kicked in the stomach,' she said. She was repeatedly asked if she . remembered drinking alcohol and said no, though the defense said this . contradicted what she told police and medical staff after the attack. Nor does she have any recollection of the sexual assault or consenting . to any advances. 'Jane Doe' was 16 when she was plied with alcohol, beaten, raped, stripped and urinated on after the October 24, 2009, dance. She testified yesterday that she woke up in hospital the next day surrounded by medical staff with a neck brace and catheter. 'My head hurt, and I saw five of . everybody staring at me. My body hurt from head to toe with excruciating . pain every time I moved.' Her legs 'felt like somebody had ripped them out of place' and she felt . nauseated, 'as if someone had took out my insides, stabbed them and put . them back in', she said. Graphic pictures of her swollen face . and bruised body were shown to jurors as she told them that to this day . she still has scars on her back - the result of cigarettes being . extinguished on her skin. She said she did not recall seeing . Marcelles Peter that night and 'barely' recognized Jose Montano and only . then because of his long hair. In chains: Earlier this week, suspects (from right) Elvis Torrentes, John Crane Jr. and Jose Montano walk to a preliminary hearing in Martinez. As many as 20 men are believed to have attacked the girl . On trial: Montano's attorney said while he witnessed the grisly attack, he had no part in it . In court: Peter initially said he was not at the crime scene, but later told them he only had a 'small role' The woman received $4 million from the West Contra Costa County Unified School District though a civil claim in the case. The victim testified at the beginning of the third week of the trial. Last week a witness told the court the men were laughing and joking about the attack the next day. The former high school student and friend of the men said: 'I was uncomfortable talking about the . situation because it made me feel like that type of thing should never . happen at any schoolhouse.' The witness, who is not being named . due to his fears for his safety, testified that Montano said he had sex . with her and Peter said he violated her with his fingers. The third man, . Ari Morales, said he urinated on her. The . witness, who was a freshman at the time, said he was at home when the . attack unfolded, but attorneys pointed out this contradicted previous . claims he had seen the assault and tried to help her. But . in court on Thursday, the man, who is now 19, said officers put words . into his mouth. He added that he had originally avoided speaking to . authorities as he didn't want to testify. He explained that he was 'sort of afraid of what might happen' if he did. The testimony came after other witnesses described the horrifying attack in 2009. Contra Costa County Deputy District Attorney John Cope described earlier in the trial how police found the girl propped up by a . metal beam under a picnic table half-naked and bloodied. He explained how the girl, feeling bored and . hot, had left the school dance and went outside to phone her father when . she encountered a male classmate who asked her if she wanted to come and . 'party' with them. After drinking brandy with the boys, things took a turn for the worst, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Witnesses will testify that the . victim was punched, kicked and dragged around the area. She was . assaulted with a walkie-talkie and someone urinated on her. Others . watching were invited to join in. Scene: In a photo taken October 27, 2009, police cars sit parked outside Richmond High School in Richmond, California, where a 16-year-old girl was plied with alcohol, robbed, beaten and gang-raped . As many as 20 men are thought to have . participated in the attack, Cope told the jury, with one even answering . the girl's cell phone and telling her father how good his daughter was . at sexual acts. Prosecutors also said how two condoms, a can of energy drink and a Four Loko were found at the scene. Peter's . attorney Gordon Brown told the jury in his opening statement that DNA . evidence found in a condom at the scene was unreliable and that the . crime scene had been compromised. He . said that wind from the helicopter could have compromised evidence at . the scene and carried Peter's DNA from a beer can to a broken used . condom found in the courtyard. 'I don't think we will ever know all that happened,' Brown told the jury. She was . 'incoherent and barely conscious' and covered in alcohol, urine and . dirt. Cope said Peter took part in the more than two-hour assault on the girl after she was plied with alcohol. Jailed: Ari Morales, left, who told the witness that he had urinated on the girl during the attack, and Manuel Ortega, right, and agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years respectively . 'Participants': John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned . himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces . charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison . for 26 years . She had a blood alcohol level of .35 - four times the legal limit - and has no memory of the attack. On Tuesday, the father of the girl also revealed the . horrifying moment he received a vulgar call from his daughter's cell . phone from one of her attackers boasting how good she was at sex. Richmond police officer Todd Kaiser added on Thursday that he told the victim's father, who raced to the campus and searched for his daughter for about an hour, that he believed she had been raped. The father started screaming and shaking a nearby fence as he struggled to deal with the news. Kaiser said the owner of the fence told the devastated man: 'Hey, if you need to rip that fence out of the ground, you do what you have to do.' His . daughter passed by the man on a gurney and he saw her horribly beaten face and . the vomit that was in her hair, the Mercury News said. Richmond High School: Students walk past a sign during gym class before a rally and vigil concerning the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl outside of Richmond High School's homecoming dance in 2009 . 'I told her that we loved her very much and to hold on,' he said. 'I could see she was not conscious enough to respond back.' Peter is charged with three criminal . counts of forcible rape, rape by foreign object and forced oral . copulation. Each count alleges that he acted in concert with others and . inflicted great bodily injuries on the victim. Montano faces similar charges. Manuel Ortega and Ari Morales agreed . to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years, respectively. They are . expected to testify against Peter and Montano. 'I wasn't the only one, there was hell of people,' one officer recounted Ortega saying in custody.

"The murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez is expected to take six to 10 weeks encompassing dozens of witnesses and exhibits, prosecutors said Monday. Hernandez appeared in Bristol County Superior Court with a smile on his face for one of his final hearings before his January trial in the 2013 killing of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough home. Dressed in a dark blazer, Hernandez sat silently during the hearing. He answered 'yes' to a series of questions regarding jury selection and other trial procedures posed by Judge E. Susan Garsh. Flashing those pearly whites: Ex-New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, left, smiles during a pretrial hearing in Fall River, Massachusetts, Monday . Procedure: Jury selection begins January 9 and will likely take more than a week. The prosecution is expected to call 45 witnesses . Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to Lloyd's murder. He has also pleaded not guilty to the fatal shootings of two men in 2012 after an encounter at a Boston nightclub. Hernandez's final pre-trial hearing in the Lloyd slaying has been scheduled for January 6 in Bristol County Superior Court. Jury selection begins January 9. Lloyd's family was in attendance Monday. Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, who had a hearing in the courtroom earlier, also briefly observed the proceeding. She has pleaded not guilty to lying before a grand jury that ultimately indicted Hernandez. Prosecutors said they expect jury selection to take until about January 20. They said they would call about 45 witnesses during the trial. High-profile case: The murder trial is expected to take six to 10 weeks early next year . Not pleased: Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, who had a hearing in the same courtroom earlier Monday, also briefly observed the proceeding . Her role: Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to lying before a grand jury that ultimately indicted Hernandez . Patriots coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft were among those named on a list of roughly 300 potential witnesses submitted by prosecutors Monday. Hernandez attorney Michael Fee, saying he was concerned possible jurors may be familiar with Hernandez's other alleged crimes, sought asked to question potential jurors individually during the selection process in court, as well as the right to reject up to 30 jurors without necessarily stating a reason. The judge denied both requests. Heading into jury selection, the prosecution and defense have submitted some 70 questions that they want asked of potential jurors. On Monday, Garsh struck some of those questions, which have not been made public, and questioned lawyers about others in an extended private conference. The judge ruled earlier this month that prosecutors cannot talk about the Boston killings, which prosecutors suggest may have been part of Hernandez's motivation for killing Lloyd. In addition, she has ruled that prosecutors cannot introduce the shooting of Alexander Bradley, a former Hernandez associate who has filed a lawsuit claiming the ex-player shot him in the face after an argument in Florida in 2013. Watching closely: Ursula Ward, center, mother of slain semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, attends a pretrial hearing for Hernandez Monday . Also Monday, Garsh allowed for the return of one of Hernandez's vehicles — a Hummer — which had been seized as evidence during the investigation. State police still have in their possession a rented Nissan Altima that prosecutors allege was used by Hernandez and two other men in Lloyd's killing. That car tops a list of 32 exhibits, ranging from prison phone records to ballistic reports and surveillance video, that prosecutors filed with the court Monday.","Prosecution says murder trial will take 6-10 weeks following jury selection scheduled for next month .

A judge in Stafford Township fined Fine $500 and ordered her to pay $560 in restitution to the zoo, where the bobcat has been since it last escaped in October. The pet bobcat (pictured)  escaped multiple times since April and will now live in a zoo . 'This should be an end to the tortured history of this case,' Municipal Judge Damian Murray said. 'Some things are not meant to be. Rocky living in your household is one of them.' Fine pleaded guilty to letting the bobcat run loose in October after she left it under her son's care while she was in Japan. A month earlier, she told the judge an enclosure would keep the 38-pound bobcat on her property. Animal control officers had to trap it in a nearby wooded area. Fine has said Rocky is a hybrid of a bobcat and a Maine coon cat. But DNA tests were inconclusive. She would have needed a special permit if Rocky were a purebred. Fine's attorney, Curtis Dowell, told the judge Fine has tried to prevent another escape and Rocky hasn't harmed anyone.

"This is the hilarious moment teachers surprised schoolchildren by bursting into a choreographed version of Let It Go from Frozen at a church service. Groups of teachers popped up from seats around the church to join in with the flashmob-style performance to the delight of the school's 750 children. Headteacher Paul Howieson kicked things off by dramatically reading the first verse aloud at the festivities for Baden-Powell and St Peter's Church of England Junior School in Poole, Dorset. Wearing Santa hats and other festive accessories, around 60 teachers took part and even the rector, Reverend Michael Camp, had a starring role in the performance. Scroll down for video . Teachers surprised schoolchildren by bursting into a choreographed version of Let It Go from Frozen at a church service .

They had been working on the musical treat for three weeks and held several secret rehearsals at the school. 'We have been working on the performance for the last three weeks and did two or three rehearsals in the church and several at school. 'We had to close the curtains and pretend nothing was going on but it worked. I don't think anybody had any idea what we were up to. 'I read the first verse and the kids started to stir by the third word and by the time I got to the line 'looks like I'm the queen' they were laughing. Their reaction was extraordinary.

It's a really positive association with the church for the kids. 'We're a big school so getting everyone together for a rehearsal was not very easy but we did it and we managed to keep it a secret. 'All the parents said how great they thought it was.' The school surprises the children with a performance each year, but this was the first time they had performed live and Mr Howieson said it was their best yet. Let It Go is one of the most popular songs from Disney's 2013 hit Frozen, which is the most successful animated film ever made. It is also the fifth highest-grossing film in box office history after taking £723million.

"Labour is making a concerted effort to ‘decapitate’ Nick Clegg in next year’s election in order to scupper the chances of a second Liberal-Conservative coalition. The party thinks it can take the Deputy Prime Minister’s Sheffield Hallam seat after a recent poll gave him only a slim three point lead. Tom Watson, Ed Miliband’s former election co-ordinator, said: ‘This seat is winnable for Labour. Labour is making a concerted effort to ‘decapitate’ Nick Clegg in next year’s election in order to scupper the chances of a second Liberal-Conservative coalition . ‘I have never encountered such animosity on the doorstep against an incumbent MP – particularly one as high-profile. ‘There are two issues that come up time and again: his position on tuition fees and Sheffield Forgemasters, which has not been forgotten.’ Mr Clegg was criticised for failing to intervene to stop the cancellation of a Whitehall loan for the heavy engineering company in 2011. With Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, under pressure in Inverness, Labour hopes the two Lib Dems most closely aligned in government with the Conservatives could lose their seats. However, a spokesman for Mr Clegg said he was confident of holding the seat, which he took with a commanding 53 per cent of the vote in 2010. David Cameron is said to believe Labour is trying to remove the Deputy PM to make it more difficult for the Tories to form another coalition with the Lib Dems after the election . ‘Obviously it’s going to be a more defensive campaign than it was last time, but Nick is spending at least two days a week there and will continue to do so,’ he said. Lib Dem strategists point out that the party held on to council seats in Mr Clegg’s constituency in May’s local elections. David Cameron is said to believe Labour is trying to remove the Deputy PM to make it more difficult for the Tories to form another coalition with the Lib Dems after the election, a Downing Street source told the Times. The SNP is on course to take a leading role in the Government of the whole of the UK after a poll showed a record number of Scottish voters plan to back the party. Forty-eight per cent of all voters north of the border now say they will support the Scottish Nationalists at the general election, according to a Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper. It prompted speculation that Scotland’s former first minister Alex Salmond, who is to stand for a Westminster seat in May, could become deputy prime minister in a coalition administration. The poll found Labour is on course to get only 24 per cent of the vote, the Conservatives 16 per cent, the Liberal Democrats 5 per cent and Ukip 4 per cent. The SNP would win as many as 54 of the 59 Scottish constituencies, which would mean it holding the balance of power at Westminster. Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate in Sheffield Hallam, Oliver Coppard, has built a strong network of volunteers, according to Mr Watson. The party is also campaigning hard over the public sector pay freeze and fears about the NHS, claiming Conservative plans to privatise some services risk damaging it as a whole. The South Yorkshire constituency is said to be dominated by professionals working in the health service and education and last week Mr Clegg said he wanted to ensure the NHS was protected from competition by American health providers. Mr Clegg has also revealed on his phone-in radio show that he is not planning a new career after the election in May. But the Deputy Prime Minister said that when he did quit politics he would avoid appearances on reality television shows such as I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here and Strictly Come Dancing. He also vowed to refuse to enter an unreformed House of Lords as a peer. Answering questions from youngsters at Sheffield Children’s Hospital for a Christmas phone-in on LBC radio, the Lib Dem leader admitted going to weekly boxing classes after his wife Miriam gave him a pair of gloves last Christmas. Mr Clegg joked: ‘What I lack in skill I make up for in exertion and enthusiasm.’ He also denied being ‘mates’ with David Cameron, saying: ‘We don’t work together as mates. We’re there to do a job.’","Clegg is confident of holding the seat which he won with 53% in 2010 .

"Oklahoma's lethal injection protocols have been ruled constitutional and the state can proceed with the scheduled executions of four death row inmates early next year, a federal judge ruled on Monday. U.S. District Judge Stephen Friot denied a request for a preliminary injunction that was requested by a group of 21 Oklahoma death row inmates who argued that the use of the sedative midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug combination risked subjecting them to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. The inmates sued after the April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett, who writhed on the gurney, mumbled and lifted his head during his 43-minute execution that the state tried to halt before it was over. A group of 21 Oklahoma death row inmates had sued after the April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett, left, whose execution had to be halted after he wasn't given enough of the sedative midazolam . Lockett's execution was the first in Oklahoma using midazolam, which also has been used in problematic executions in Ohio and Arizona. Attorneys for the state maintained the problems with Lockett's execution were the result of an improperly set single intravenous line that wasn't properly monitored during his execution, causing the lethal drugs to be administered locally instead of directly into his blood. The protocols the state adopted after Lockett's execution call for a five-fold increase in the amount of midazolam used, which is the same amount of the drug used in 11 successful Florida executions. The director of Oklahoma's prison system, Robert Patton, was one of several witnesses who testified during a three-day hearing last week and said he believes Florida's protocol is 'humane.' An arm restraint on the gurney in the the execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma: The state's lethal injection protocols have been ruled constitutional and the state can proceed with the scheduled executions of four death row inmates early next year, a federal judge ruled on Monday . But medical experts called by attorneys for the death row inmates testified that midazolam won't properly anesthetize a person and render them unconscious for the second drug, which causes them to suffocate, and a third which would cause a burning pain before stopping the heart. The state has purchased new medical equipment, adopted new execution protocols and ordered more training, and prison officials say they're ready for the execution of Charles Frederick Warner on January 15. Three other lethal injections have been scheduled through March 5.","Federal judge has ruled the state's lethal injection protocols to be constitutional .

"Unlicensed: Pennsylvania authorities seized 2,447 bottles from the home of attorneys Arthur Goldman, 50, that they are planning to destroy . Pennsylvania state police were tied up for months in a sting operation that ended with a 20-hour raid in early January. As law professor Baylen Linnekin writes in Reason, the target wasn't illegal narcotics but a cellar full of rare and expensive bottles of wine. 2,447 bottles, to be exact. They are worth more than $160,000. Officers seized the bottles from the Malvern home of attorneys Arthur Goldman and Melissa Kurtzman, and state they are now planning to destroy the collection. The state's strict liquor laws led law enforcement to Goldman, who insists he was not looking to sell off his collection and that the bottles were only for his private consumption. The case began with an 'anonymous complaint' in March 2013 to Pennsylvania's Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement that Goldman was selling wine without a license. The agency dispatched an undercover officer to 'infiltrate' a mailing list, which offered access to exclusive California wineries that Goldman had cultivated relationships with. The email list allowed friends and colleagues to pool orders for wine, which Goldman would place and receive at his residence, then in New Jersey, before distributing them. According to court filings, Goldman never charged any fees or profited from the email list, and all costs for wine, taxes and shipping were shared by any buyers. Bloomberg reports that Goldman emailed the agent a 97-page list of bottles available for purchase, which offered wines from elite, small-batch wineries, most of which were not available to buy in Pennsylvania. The undercover officer made a 'buy' in one of these exclusive wine pools, then was later joined by two other officers posing as his stepdaughter and her fiance. Goldman and Kurtzman moved to Pennsylvania later in 2013, taking their wine cellar with them, and were soon called on by the undercover officers. The man gave the agents a tour of his wine cellar and poured out glasses of wine for them to taste. The undercover family told a story of looking to buy wine as a wedding gift. Goldman then sold four or five bottles, allegedly at cost, to the agents. Infiltration: An undercover officer got on a mailing list that offered exclusive access to wineries in California that Goldman started while living in New Jersey, before seizing Goldman's collection in Pennsylvania . A raid followed in January, in which the agency seized Goldman's collection, valued at $160,000, which the couple is fighting to recover before the state destroys it. Lawyers for Goldman and Kurtzman argue that the collection was not part of a liquor-selling operation but rather a 'personal wine collection.' Goldman entered a first-offender program for the charges of buying alcohol outside the state system and selling liquor without a license, and now must complete two years probation and 300 hours of community service. Linnekin notes Pennsylvania's harsh liquor laws require wine aficionados shopping on the internet to have their purchases 'shipped to the Wine & Spirits Store of their choice' instead of to their homes. The laws also bar buyers from purchasing any bottles online that could be bought at the state-run package stores. Additional restrictions are placed on those traveling liquor through the state.","Arthur Goldman, 50, had a 2,447-bottle collection seized in Malvern, PA .

"A trippy new yoga class is encouraging students to smoke marijuana before starting their practice. Dee Dussault, 34, began teaching weekly Ganja Yoga group classes at San Francisco's Merchants of Reality studio in October. Each class is 75 minutes long and costs $15. 'A lot of students are consuming it before yoga anyway,' she told ABC News. 'So a big benefit that I am hearing is the community aspect. The first thing they want to do after consuming cannabis is lay down and stretch. And, depending upon the dosage and strain, it really encourages people to relax.' Pot yoga: At Dee Dessault's Hatha class in San Francisco (not pictured in this stock photo) students are encouraged to smoke marijuana before the begin their poses . Students are asked to smoke cannabis on their own prior to arrival - but those with a medical marijuana card can get high with their fellow yogis during a 15-minute pre-class session at which attendees introduce themselves while sitting in a circle. Ms Dussault, who has practiced yoga for 20 years and previously taught the ganja variety in Toronto starting in 2009, says that the idea of pairing pot with yoga has ancient roots. 'Historically, cannabis has been linked to really early use with yoga in ancient Shiva cults. Back then, they weren't smoking it, but drinking it in a milk beverage and burning it as an incense,' she said. Her class, which is usually attended by 16 students on Wednesday evenings, has proved so popular that she's looking into adding additional times. 'I get as many people who are hard-core yoga practitioners but new to cannabis as I do cannabis consumers who are new to yoga,' she told MailOnline. 'I also get a number of people who regularly use both, but not necessarily together. And some are regular practitioners of cannabis-enhanced yoga and are glad to have a place to go. So, it's a variety of previous experience levels and motivations.' High times: Students are asked to smoke cannabis on their own prior to arrival - but those with a medical marijuana card can get stoned with their fellow yogis during a 15-minute pre-class session (stock photo) While the class attracts equal numbers of male and female practitioners, Ms Dussault notes that 'far more men' attend Ganja Yoga than her other yoga classes. However, experts warn that it might be dangerous to engage in athletic activity while high on a controlled substance - according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana raises your heart rate by 20-100per cent and the effect can last up to three hours. But Ms Dussault insists that her moves are slow and gentle. 'We do not do any postures that are not suited to altered states of conscious - it's very sweet and very, very safe,' she writes on her website, adding that singles, couples and groups of friends frequently book her for private sessions. Ms Dussault also offers private instruction in Clothing-Free Yoga and Sexual Awakening Yoga. 'Cannabis, if the strain and dose are correct for the individual, promotes relaxation. Yoga obviously cultivates relaxation. So, the two together are greater than the sum of the parts,' she said. 'Cannabis can help to decrease brain activity that is required for production and consumption - which of course we are conditioned to constantly be doing. It takes people to a place in which they are more open to relaxing tensions in the body and mind. It makes them want to chill out, have a good time, enjoy life.' Ms Dussault isn't the first to bring pot yoga to the West Coast; yogi Liz McDonald has been teaching 4:20 Yoga at Los Angeles studio Atwater Yoga since 2010.",Students at Dee Dussault's weekly Ganja Yoga class in San Francisco smoke cannabis before class .
"Motorists are to get a record £6billion boost to help remove the ‘menace’ of 18 million potholes from local roads over the next six years, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today. The £1billion a year share-out to town halls will help English local authorities tackle potholes and improve local roads between 2015 and 2021 while giving them time to plan ahead. But as an ‘incentive’ to boost pre-emptive repairs and end the last-minute ‘patch and mend culture’, an increasing proportion of the available cash will have to be won by councils bidding with the most innovative and cost-efficient longer-term schemes to keep their roads in good condition. As a result, the amount available to councils ‘without strings’ in the general repair pot will diminish over the six years. Scroll down for video . The £1billion a year share-out to town halls will help English local authorities tackle potholes and improve local roads between 2015 and 2021. File photo . By contrast, the ‘incentive’ element – which has to be bid for and can be won only by showing improvements and value for money -will increase year to year. Local government leaders said even the £6billion total will leave a hole because the current backlog of repairs alone would take more than a decade and cost £12billion twice as much - to put right. A succession of severe winters and the devastating floods earlier this year have left councils playing catch-up with road maintenance. The size of the £6billion pot-hole and repairs pot was announced originally in the Government’s Spending review of June 2013 but how it will be divided up between competing local authorities in England was announced today (Tuesday). Mr McLoughlin said the investment amounts to £976million a year - enough to fix around 18 million potholes across the country over six years – or 3 million a year. He said it is the first time councils have been given ‘locked-in’ funding over this length of time, which will help them plan ahead and save money for the taxpayer. Of the total £6billion package, just over £4.7billion will be shared between 115 English councils. But councils will also be able to bid for a further £575million in total available for the repair and maintenance of local highway infrastructure such as junctions, bridges and street lighting. But as an ‘incentive’ to end the last-minute ‘patch and mend culture’, an increasing proportion of the available cash will have to be won by councils bidding with the most innovative and cost-efficient longer-term schemes . However, Mr McLoughlin also announced that £578million had been set aside for an innovative incentive fund scheme starting in 2016 to reward councils who demonstrate they are delivering ‘value for money’ in carrying out cost-effective improvements can bid for specific extra cash. But the cash in the general pot will reduce from £901million in 2016 to £725million a year from 210/19 to 2021 inclusive as the incentive element is ratcheted up. Ministers argue that those who move away from the ‘patch and mend’ mentality plan ahead pre-emptively with more certainty to improve road surfaces well before the cracks, will get more ‘incentive’ cash. The aim is ‘to reward councils who demonstrate they are delivering high value for money to the taxpayer in carrying out cost effective planned improvements’ and ‘making the available money go even further.’ Mr McLoughlin said: ‘Roads play a significant part in everyday life. Poorly-maintained local roads, blighted by potholes, are a menace to all road users, particularly during the festive period as people travel to see family and friends. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured, announced the £6billion boost to help remove the ‘menace’ of 18 million potholes from Britain's roads . ‘It is vital we have good quality roads. This Government has already taken strong action by spending £1 billion more on local roads maintenance than was spent in the previous parliament.’ He added: ‘This £6billion funding will put an end to short-term fixes and will mean we have committed £10billion between 2010 and 2021. This huge investment is part of our long-term economic plan to ensure we have a transport network fit for the 21st century.’ A Transport Department source said: ‘Potholes are a menace for all road users. He said: ‘Today we are setting out exactly what each local authority will get and announcing that the funding is being allocated over six years. This is the first time local authorities have been provided with certain funding over this length of time, allowing them to plan and allocate resources. Normally it is an annual allocation.’ Matthew Lugg, director of public services for Mouchel Infrastructure Services and advocate for the Highways Agency Efficiency Programme, explained: ‘Councils who think about long term planning and how they work together to share their resources, achieve greater economies of scale and keep the road surface in good repair, ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. Today’s announcement by the Government will help to deliver this.’ Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘This money has to be measured against the scale of the problem. It only amounts to about half of the £12billion or so road maintenance backlog in England estimated by councils themselves. There are also question marks over the bidding element of the funding. Would it not be better to simply allocate it all on the basis of need?’ The Professor added: ‘Tackling the poor state of local roads routinely tops the list of transport priorities for voters and drivers. No wonder, when at least 45,000 compensation claims were made in the last financial year against councils for damage caused to vehicles by pot holes. As many as one in six (16 per cent) of drivers have been left with damage to their vehicle in the past 12 months, according to a recent survey from LV Road Rescue.","Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced £1billion a year share-out to help English local authorities tackle potholes .

"Expelled: Rozanne Duncan, pictured, was dropped with immediate effect for associating with an organisation which ‘brings the party into disrepute’ Ukip have expelled a prominent local councillor who is understood to have links with a far-Right group, it emerged last night. Rozanne Duncan was dropped with immediate effect for associating with an organisation which ‘clearly brings the party into disrepute’ while serving on Thanet District Council in Kent. Her allegiance with the group came to light after comments she made in an unbroadcast television interview, which have been described as ‘jaw-dropping’. The news is a personal blow for leader Nigel Farage as Thanet South is the constituency where he is standing at next year’s General Election and already faces a tough battle. Miss Duncan, the secretary of the local party, was the spokesman who announced that Mr Farage that was running for the tightly contested seat in August, jubilantly telling journalists: ‘It’s the worst-kept secret in town.’ Last night the party confirmed that Miss Duncan, 68, was expelled on Saturday for breaking a rule in their constitution which prohibits ‘association with or membership of an organisation…incompatible with membership of the Party’. She has 28 days to appeal. Ukip membership is not permitted for current or former members of five groups – the British National Party (BNP), English Defence League (EDL), Britain First – a BNP splinter group – the British Freedom Party or UK First. The new row comes days after Kerry Smith, a Ukip candidate in Basildon South, resigned over a series of slurs describing a Chinese woman as ‘Chinky’ and gay people as ‘disgusting’. Ukip was also forced to row back after Mark Reckless, the party’s MP in Rochester and Strood, suggested that Ukip would like migrants who have been settled in the UK for years to be repatriated. Row: Miss Duncan's expulsion comes days after Kerry Smith, a Ukip candidate in Basildon South, (pictured) resigned over a series of slurs describing a Chinese woman as ‘Chinky’ and gay people as ‘disgusting’ Councillor Duncan was a Conservative councillor in Thanet for several years. She won the seat under a Ukip banner in May 2013, and is one of three Ukip representatives. A source told her local newspaper that the remarks in the interview – thought to be for a new BBC programme – were ‘jaw-dropping’. Backtrack: Ukip was also forced to row back after MP Mark Reckless, pictured, suggested that Ukip would like migrants who have been settled in the UK for years to be repatriated . Party sources said they had ‘no hesitation’ in expelling her when the matter came to light. Miss Duncan, who describes her profession as ‘landlord’, replaced Councillor Sandy Ezekiel who was jailed for misconduct in a public office. The Conservatives are said to have refused to select her so she ran for his seat under the Ukip banner. At the time of her election, she said that one of her concerns was that people had difficulty making GP appointments because of the number of immigrants in the area. Martin Wise, a Tory councillor in the same ward of Cliftonville East, told the Mail: ‘I’m not surprised she has got herself into trouble as she has a long history of it. She was a member of the Tory group going back 20 years or more, and had to resign a few years ago under very dubious circumstances, in relation to a planning issue. ‘Sticking her foot in her mouth, as it sounds as though she’s done, is quite like her.’ Simon Moores, another Conservative councillor, said: ‘Everyone is waiting with bated breath to see what this is about, but if it is sufficiently offensive that she is ejected from Ukip it must be pretty bad. ‘If someone was going to commit a political indiscretion of major proportions, I’m not surprised it was Rozanne Duncan. She is not someone who would ever be selected for the modern Conservative party’. Ukip would not comment on which organisation she had been associated with, saying it was ‘internal party matter’. A Ukip spokesman said: ‘Ukip is expelling Rozanne Duncan for bringing the party into disrepute. She has 28 days to appeal.’ Last night Miss Duncan was unavailable for comment.","Rozanne Duncan was expelled for 'associating with a far-Right group'

"The rise of Internet pornography could be contributing to lower marriage rates, a study has found. Men use online porn for ‘low cost sexual gratification’ because they don’t have to deal with the emotional complexities of a relationship. The researchers said it was ‘disrupting traditional family arrangements’ and backed Britain’s porn filter - because it may increase marriage rates. The rise of Internet pornography could be lowering marriage rates, a study has found (stock image) In their paper the researchers write: ‘If one of the important reasons to get married has a low cost alternative, then it is natural to wonder about the extent to which one can replace the other. ‘The results in this paper suggest that such an association exists, and that it is potentially quite large.’ The team looked at American data on how 1,500 men aged 18-35 years old used the Internet between 2000 and 2004, when Internet porn was nowhere near as prevalent as it is now. In particular they looked at how much time the men spent on the Internet, and how much porn they looked at in the past 30 days. The general trend was that higher Internet use was linked to lower marriage rates. However, more than anything else, the use of porn was associated with men who were not married. By contrast, those who regularly used religious websites were more likely to be married. The researchers found that the increasing ease in which pornography could be accessed was an 'important factor underlying the decline in marriage formation and stability'. In their paper the researchers write: ‘If one of the important reasons to get married has a low cost alternative, then it is natural to wonder about the extent to which one can replace the other' Under changes brought in by British Prime Minister David Cameron, users can now choose to ‘opt in’ to Internet porn rather than having search results come up automatically. The change is a victory for the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign. Pornography depicting rape has also been banned under the plans to get rid of ‘poisonous’ content. The research was published by the The Institute for the Study of Labour in Germany and was led by Dr Michael Malcolm of the University of West Chester, Pennsylvania. It states: ‘While it is probably impossible to eliminate online access to pornography at this point, policies like those in the UK can at least increase the cost associated with accessing it. ‘If the results in this paper are correct, policies along these lines have the potential to reduce pornography usage and increase marital entry, with its attendant welfare improvements’. Under changes brought in by British Prime Minister David Cameron, internet users can now choose to ‘opt in’ to Internet porn rather than having search results come up automatically; researchers said policies like Cameron's 'can at least increase the cost associated' with accessing pornography, which could led to a reduction in the amount of X-Rated material being viewed . Statistics released earlier this year showed that married people are now in a minority in England and Wales for the first time. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 51 per cent of people are 'not married', up from 47 per cent in a decade. It marks a dramatic shift from the 1930s when nine in 20 people had married by the time they turned 40. At the same time Internet use has rocketed and last year 36 million adults, or 73 per cent of the grown up population, accessed the Internet every day. That is 20 million more than in 2006 when comparable records began. Some seven in ten people now own a smartphone with research showing we are so addicted to our devices we get withdrawal symptoms after just a few hours if we don’t hold them.","Pornography is an 'important factor' in the decline in marriage formation .

"She wasn’t exactly famed for her small-talk, but Lady Thatcher nonetheless came up with a splendidly disarming icebreaker when she was first introduced to Mandy Rice-Davies. It was the late-Eighties, and our then Prime Minister had agreed to accompany her husband Denis to an intimate dinner with a business acquaintance of his, called Ken Foreman, and his new wife. Worryingly, for all concerned, that new wife just happened to be Rice-Davies — the former model and nightclub dancer who, as a key player in the Profumo scandal, had come within a whisker of bringing down a Conservative government. Scroll down for video . Following her death last week, it emerged former model Mandy Rice-Davies (right) enjoyed a long friendship with Lady Thatcher (left) during which the unlikely duo spent time together on holiday . Rice-Davies was a figure of notoriety: a brash and outspoken former good-time girl who rubbed shoulders with gangsters, seduced Tory grandees, and had, for a quarter of a century, given raucous newspaper interviews about her colourful love life. Thrice-married, she had, just a few years earlier, at the age of 38, starred in an X-rated erotic film called Nana, based on Emile Zola’s book of the same name. Yet if Margaret Thatcher was in any way put off by this femme fatale’s track record, she didn’t show it. Instead, shortly after shaking hands, the Prime Minister turned to Rice-Davies and asked a question. ‘Tell me,’ she asked, ‘how do you manage to keep your lipstick on?’ This was, Rice-Davis later told friends, a serious question. ‘Mandy always used to wear very full lipstick, and it would never rub off,’ says the journalist Tom Mangold, a longstanding acquaintance. ‘I think Mrs Thatcher genuinely wanted to know how she managed that.’ It would also prove a superbly-effective way of the PM setting her nervous guest at ease. For the ensuing chat marked the start of a fond personal friendship between these outwardly very different women. Throughout the friendship, Rice-Davies and her husband, Ken Foreman, (pictured) spent time abroad with the former prime minister and her husband . Following Rice-Davies’s death from cancer last week at the age of 70, it has emerged that this unlikely duo would eventually become so well-acquainted as to spend time on holiday together in the Nineties. Though she never spoke publicly about their relationship, and succeeded in keeping it from being reported by the Press during Thatcher’s lifetime, it appears that Rice-Davies counted photographs of those trips among her most valued possessions. She kept two of them — one in a tartan frame — at the flat in Lowdnes Square, Knightsbridge, where she and Foreman stayed when they weren’t at their home in Virginia Water, Surrey, or their holiday homes in the Bahamas and Florida. ‘There was one picture of Mandy and Margaret together, and one of them and their two husbands, I think standing on some sort of balcony,’ says the author Peter Stanford, who visited the flat in 1996. ‘I think she kept one on her desk, and one on the sitting room wall. What I found interesting was that Mandy would always be very forthcoming when you asked her a question — very open and honest. But when I asked, she would hardly talk about the pictures at all. It was almost as if the friendship was one of the few things in her life she wanted to keep secret.’ Stanford, who visited the flat while researching a biography of Bronwen Astor, matriarch of Cliveden, the stately home where the Profumo scandal played out, wasn’t the only writer to get a tantalising insight into the two couples’ secret relationship. The historian Richard Davenport-Hines, who recently published a book on Profumo, told in an obituary of Rice-Davies published at the weekend, how Denis Thatcher, who sat alongside Ken Foreman on the board of a U.S. waste disposal firm called Attwoods, also became a regular visitor to their home. ‘During the Downing Street years, Denis would pop over for cheery drinking sessions in the Foremans’ Knightsbridge home when he felt bored or neglected,’ he wrote. During that first dinner at which the two women met, Thatcher was less talkative than usual, Davenport-Hines believes. ‘She fixed her eyes on Mandy, gazed intently at her, trying to pierce the secrets of her very different brand of femininity, both intrigued and guarded in the company of a Sixties icon.’ Yet for all their outward differences, Rice-Davies and Thatcher were in many important ways cut from the same cloth. ‘Mandy loved human comedy — and appreciated it more saucily than Margaret Thatcher,’ added Davenport-Hines. ‘But the two women had many splendid similarities. ‘They faced the hostility that is often meted out to game-changing innovators. They refused to take the world on men’s terms — and in their very different spheres they left it a very different place.’ Both women came from humble backgrounds and were raised by small businessmen in provincial England. Lady Thatcher is pictured with her husband, Denis . It is thought Denis Thatcher would visit the Foremans at their home for drinking sessions while his wife was Prime Minister . Both came from humble backgrounds, and were raised by small businessmen in provincial England. Rice-Davies grew up in suburban Solihull, the daughter of a former policeman who set up a tyre-sales business. Thatcher’s father was a shopkeeper in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Both also demonstrated an uncanny knack of (and perhaps passion for) upsetting the Establishment. Rice-Davies was 16 years old when she decided, in 1960, to move to London in search of adventure. After getting a job as a nightclub hostess, she met the notorious slum landlord Peter Rachman, who was 41, overweight and very rich, and installed her as his mistress. Following Rachman’s death two years later, she and a striking 19-year-old friend, Christine Keeler, moved into a London flat owned by Stephen Ward, a society osteopath. Within weeks, they were at the centre of a scandal that threatened to bring down the government after it emerged that Keeler had slept with both John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attache. Though never directly implicated in the Profumo affair, Rice-Davies was called to give evidence at a court case in which Ward was accused of living off the ‘immoral earnings’ of his two tenants — a charge that implied, wrongly, that they were prostitutes. In the witness box at the Old Bailey, she then made the sensational claim that one of her lovers had been Viscount ‘Bill’ Astor, Bronwen’s husband and the owner of Cliveden. When it was put to her that Astor denied this, she retorted: ‘Well he would, wouldn’t he?’ The response was remarkable for its impertinence in an era when working-class girls were not supposed to traduce the reputations of wealthy men. It has since entered the Oxford Dictionary Of Quotations, and is said to have hastened the upending of traditional class hierarchies in the Swinging Sixties. In a different sphere and era, Mrs Thatcher was similarly unsettling to the old order. The first woman prime minister, her decision to contest the Tory leadership in 1975 upset a raft of Establishment figures on her own front bench. Both women were, of course, known for their free-thinking. Lady Thatcher, pictured aged 25 (left) when she stood as the Conservative candidate for Dartford, and Mandy Rice-Davies (right) who left home for London aged 16 . In office, Thatcher spent much of her reign challenging political orthodoxies. Rice-Davies devoted much of her life to challenging social ones. In numerous interviews, for example, she would highlight the inherent unfairness in the fact that men were admired for having sexual experiences, while women were scorned for it. Were it not for their independent spirits, they would perhaps never have met. For a less free-thinking Prime Minister than Thatcher might have shied away from any association with Rice-Davies, for fear of the negative publicity it might attract. That, however, is not how the Iron Lady operated. ‘Mrs T was very open-minded,’ is how her former Private Secretary Robin Harris puts it. ‘She wouldn’t have refused to go along somewhere or to meet someone because of their reputation. She took people as she found them.’ So it proved with Mandy Rice-Davies. And while few Conservative grandees would like the two ladies to be mentioned in the same breath (‘I’m not sure if opening your legs is the same thing as reforming the economy,’ comments one long-time Thatcher confidant), there was plenty that these two splendidly unlikely friends had in common.","Mandy Rice-Davies died from cancer last week at the age of 70 .

"Tesco faces a wider-reaching probe into its finances amid suspicions a black hole in its accounts is far bigger than originally stated. Britain’s biggest supermarket is already under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over claims it inflated profits by £263million in the first six months of this financial year. But now the Financial Reporting Council, the professional body for accountants, wants to formally investigate accounts filed in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Scroll down for video . An accounting authority has announced an investigation into a £263million 'black hole' in Tesco's finances . It says the wider inquiry is needed to discover whether the suspect practices went on for many years – and whether the amount of money involved was much higher. The investigation is extremely serious, for companies have a legal duty to give accurate information to shareholders and the City so they can decide whether to invest their savings and pensions in them. The inquiry will not only look at Tesco’s accounts but also the role of the firm’s auditors, PwC, who signed off the figures as a true and accurate account record. The accounting scandal was revealed by Tesco’s new chief executive, Dave Lewis, who was parachuted in to the business in September to help turn around a fall in sales and profits. One of his first jobs was to order the suspension of a number of firm’s most senior executives, some of whom have since left the business. The problem is understood to relate to a series of complex payments between Tesco and its suppliers. It involved a tactic of first agreeing a price with suppliers, but then demanding rebate payments from these same firms to stock their products and ensure they were displayed on prominent shelves. The timing of these payments may have been manipulated to make the firm’s financial performance appear stronger than it was. Mr Lewis has now scrapped this regime in favour of a more transparent system. Tesco recently issued a new profit warning suggesting the figure for the current financial year will be down by around 60 per cent on 2013 to no more than £1.4billion. Tesco first announced in September that it had discovered an accounting problem relating to expected results for the first half of the current financial year. A subsequent probe by Deloitte into the affair, which involved rebates from suppliers being moved to different periods on the company's balance sheet, found it had been going on at least as far back as the 2012/13 period. The FRC has already said it was 'giving careful consideration' as to whether it should take regulatory action. Today the body said it had launched a probe 'in relation to the preparation, approval and audit' of Tesco's financial statements in the financial years ending in 2012, 2013 and 2014. It will also cover 'conduct in relation to the matters reported in the company's interim results' for the first half of the current financial year - when the Deloitte probe was published. It is the latest in a series of probes that have rocked the supermarket chain and seen executives suspended . The investigation will cover members of professional accountancy bodies, from either Tesco or its auditors, who were involved with the accounts, as well as the member firm, PwC, which was and remains Tesco's auditor. PwC said in a statement: 'We take our responsibilities very seriously and remain committed to delivering work to the highest professional standards. We will cooperate fully with the FRC in its inquiries.' PwC said it would have been responsible for the external audit element of the statements. The preparation and approval were done by Tesco. The latest investigation opens up Tesco's books to scrutiny going back a year further than the previous investigation by Deloitte. Results of that probe published alongside half-year figures this year showed a £118 million hit for the latest period, plus £70 million for 2013/14 and £75 million for 2012/13. But the FRC investigation goes back to the year ended 2012. The FRC has powers to issue unlimited fines to individuals or firms or to suspend them from professional accounting bodies. A Tesco spokesman said: 'We note the Financial Reporting Council is launching an investigation into individuals and a member firm in relation to the preparation, approval and audit of our accounts for the last three years. We will provide support to the FRC's investigation.' UK managing director Chris Bush (left) was among those suspended in the wake of the  scandal. Dave Lewis (right) has taken temporary charge of the supermarket's UK operations . It is the latest challenge facing the supermarket coming a couple of weeks after it issued a £500 million profits warning - its fourth this year. Tesco said earnings would be hit by investments in price and availability of its products as well as a shake-up of the way it handles its supply chain in the wake of the accounting scandal. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mike Dennis said profits warning implied its UK profits for the second half would be virtually wiped out. Chief executive Dave Lewis, appointed in September, has temporarily taken charge of the supermarket's UK operations during its key Christmas trading period. Sales have been squeezed amid a price war spurred by the threat of discounters Aldi and Lidl. Eight executives including UK managing director Chris Bush were suspended in the wake of the accounting scandal. Mr Bush and three others have now left, one has returned to his job and three remain suspended. Mr Lewis has said the suspensions do not indicate guilt. Tesco shares have plunged more than 40 per cent over the last year and after a mini-rally when they rose 5 per cent on Friday were in the red again today. February 28, 2011: Sir Terry Leahy steps down as chief executive on his 55th birthday after 14 years in charge, overseeing a leap in pre-tax profits from £750 million in 1997 to £3.4 billion in April 2010. He is replaced by Philip Clarke. January 12, 2012: Less than a year into Mr Clarke's tenure, Tesco shocks the market with its first profit warning in almost 20 years. Shares plunge by as much as 15 per cent, or more than £4 billion. April 18, 2012: Tesco unveils a £1billion UK revival plan, which includes upgrading stores, the recruitment of more staff and better prices and value. Initiative follows complaints its 2,800 stores are cold and industrial with bad service. April 17, 2013: Tesco reports its first fall in annual profits in 19 years, tumbling almost 96 per cent to £120 million from a year earlier. The firm is hit by a £1.2 billion charge as it confirms it will leave the U.S. and also suffers a £804million write-down in the UK on land bought at the height of the property boom. Philip Clarke (left) stepped down as chief executive in October this year. Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent (right) announced his departure the same month .

April 16, 2014: Mr Clarke brushes off speculation about his future despite little sign that his £1 billion plan to turn around Tesco is bearing fruit. Profits fall 6.9 per cent to £3.05 billion for the year to February 22. June 3, 2014: Till-roll figures from Kantar Worldpanel show a decline in Tesco's market share to 29 per cent in the 12 weeks to May 25, compared with 30.5 per cent a year earlier. A day later, the chain reports a 3.7 per cent fall in like-for-like sales for the first quarter of its financial year. July 21, 2014: Tesco announces that Mr Clarke will step down from the board on October 1 to be replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis. Sales and trading profit in the first half of the year are 'somewhat below' expectations, the company adds. August 29, 2014: Tesco issues profit warning to tell the markets that it expects its first-half profits will be £400million less than expected. It slashes dividend payments by 75 per cent and £1billion is wiped off the company's market value. An investment bank has claimed the black hole could be even bigger than first thought . September 22, 2014: Company launches an investigation after admitting that its previously warned of fall in takings actually over-estimated profits by as much as £250million. Four executives are suspended and shares dive to their lowest level in 11 years as the revelation triggers its third profits warning in as many months.

"A federal judge on Monday appeared deeply skeptical of an Arizona sheriff's lawsuit seeking to halt President Barack Obama's plan to spare nearly 5 million people from deportation until after the end of his administration. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, herself nominated to the federal bench by Obama in 2010, questioned whether Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had legal standing to challenge the immigration program the president announced last month. She suggested the topic is better left for Congress and the Obama administration to sort out. But Arpaio's lawyer, Larry Klayman, told reporters outside the courtroom that 'we have serious issues of constitutionality involved.' In the first courtroom battle over Obama's plan, Klayman said the president violated the U.S. Constitution by doing an end-run around Congress. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio, seen in 2013, is an outspoken opponent of Obama's immigration policy; his county is near the U.S.-Mexico border . President Obama, whose landmark immigration policy decree is under fire, arrived Friday in Hawaii for an extended family holiday vacation . He argued that the program would let more illegal immigrants enter the country and commit crimes, burdening law enforcement – Arpaio's area of concern. 'It's not policy, he's creating law and he cannot do that under the U.S. Constitution,' Klayman said of Obama. Arpaio has often clashed with the federal government over the enforcement of immigration laws and he has filed suit to stop new policies announced by Obama. He claims that more than 35 percent of immigrants living in Maricopa County illegally who wound up in his jails this year were repeat offenders, buttressing his view that federal officials have done a poor job of deporting criminals. But Justice Department lawyer Kathleen Hartnett said Arpaio's lawsuit seemed to be raising a 'political dispute' rather than a legal claim the court could address. The Obama administration has called the case 'speculative and unsubstantiated' and has urged the court to dismiss it. Howell at times seemed exasperated with Klayman, a longtime conservative activist who has filed hundreds of lawsuits against the federal government, including challenges to Obama's U.S. citizenship. When Klayman said his client has been threatened because of his tough views on Obama's immigration policy, Howell responded: 'That just doesn't cut it for me.' Howell also said it did not appear that Arpaio could show a 'concrete' injury he has suffered from the new policy, especially since it will take months before the bulk of it actually goes into effect. 'If Congress doesn't like it, doesn't Congress have the power to step in?' she asked. Howell said she would issue a ruling in the case soon. Obama's plan, derided by conservatives as an 'amnesty' for millions of lawbreakers, marks the most sweeping change to the nation's immigration policies in nearly three decades and set off a fierce fight on Capitol Hill. The changes include work permits and three-year deportation stays for more than 4 million immigrants here illegally. It mostly applies to those who have been in the country more than five years and have children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Judge Beryl A. Howell, nominated by Barack Obama, is hearing a case focused on claims that the president has violated the Constitution by doing an end run around Congress and that drastic changes in immigration programs should be stopped . Under the program, the Department of Homeland Security would prioritize the removal of immigrants who present threats to national security, public safety or border security. DHS officials could deport someone if an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director determined that removing the person would serve an important federal interest. The White House has insisted that Obama is acting under proper legal authority to enforce the nation's immigration laws. Arpaio has suffered a series of stinging political defeats in his quest to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his Arizona county. Just last week he agreed to give up a major part of his efforts that won him popularity among voters but gradually were dismantled by the Obama administration and the courts. Arpaio's office said Dec. 17 that it would disband a controversial squad that has raided businesses to arrest more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen IDs to get jobs. Larry Klayman of the conservative nonprofit Freedom Watch is representing the Maricopa County, Arizona sheriff's office in the lawsuit, and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Obama from granting legal status to approximately 4.7 illegal aliens in the United States . After complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups that charged he was engaging in racial profiling – most illegal immigrants in Arizona are Hispanic – his office was found to have done so at least in some traffic stops. As a result the federal government had stripped him of special federal immigration powers and investigated him for alleged civil rights violations. Arpaio, however, remains popular in Arizona, where voters have elected him six times. He is best known for operating a series of outdoor 'tent city' jails where male inmates are limited to wearing pink underwear, those over age 18 are required to registered for the Selective Service military draft. In 2007 he launched an in-house jail radio station that broadcasts patriotic songs, Frank Sinatra tunes, educational shows and classical music 20 hours each week.","America's 'toughest sheriff' wants to force Washington to stop the flow of illegal-immigrants criminals into his southern Arizona county .

"Craggy-faced and ornery, Edgar Ray Killen bears the signs of his 89 years. His hands are still scarred and rough from decades in the east Mississippi sawmills. He has a muscular build even as he maneuvers in his wheelchair. Time has not softened his views and he remains an ardent segregationist. And he steadfastly refuses to discuss the 'Freedom Summer' slayings of three civil-rights workers, which sparked national outrage, helped spur passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and landed him behind bars. Killen was interviewed by The Associated Press inside the Mississippi State Penitentiary, where he is serving a 60-year sentence; it was his first interview since his conviction on state charges of manslaughter in 2005, 41 years to the day after James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were killed and buried in a red clay dam. An earlier trial in 1967, on federal charges, resulted in a mistrial. Convicted: Edgar Ray Killen, seen in June 2005,  was convicted of organizing the infamous 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers . Scene: This June 1964 file photograph shows the burned station wagon driven by James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Mickey Schwerner, which was found shortly after their disappearance . Victims: The bodies of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner (seen from left to right) were found buried in a dam in 1964 -- 44 days after they went missing . Inspiration: Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe played two FBI agents investigating the murders in the 1988 Hollywood movie 'Mississippi Burning' Killen wouldn't say much about the 1964 killings. He said he remains a segregationist who does not believe in race equality but contends he bears no ill will toward blacks. The three civil-rights workers — black Mississippian Chaney and white New Yorkers Schwerner and Goodman — were investigating the burning of a black church outside Philadelphia when they were stopped on an accusation of speeding and held for hours in the Neshoba County jail. Witnesses testified that Killen rounded up carloads of Klansmen to intercept the three men upon their release and helped arrange for a bulldozer to hide the bodies. The bodies were found 44 days later, buried miles away in a red-clay dam. In his four-hour interview with the AP, Killen is talkative but his mind wanders, a problem he attributes to brain damage from a logging accident a few months before his trial. He says he has never and will never talk about the events that became immortalized in the film 'Mississippi Burning.' Killen first contacted an AP reporter 18 months ago. In his first letter on March 3, 2013, he made clear that no conversation with a reporter would result in a confession. 'T'hat is not where I am coming from after 50 years of silence,' Killen wrote. 'I have never discussed the 1964 case with anyone — an attorney, the FBI, local law nor friend — and those who say so are lying.' Since then, both he and the AP filed repeated requests to have a reporter added to his visitation list. The Mississippi Department of Corrections, citing a policy of not allowing media to see inmates, denied at least a dozen requests. The agency abruptly agreed this month. Visitors are not allowed to bring pens, pencils or paper into the prison. Killen often leans in because he has trouble hearing and cups a hand to his left ear in the direction of guests sitting farther away. He speaks of associations with hundreds of people during his life — from political figures to friends and neighbors. Killen is talkative about corruption in the Mississippi prison system, his good times and close relationship with the late Sen. James O. Eastland and his preaching at a tiny Baptist church in east Mississippi from which he got the nickname 'Preacher.' But his wife said no friends visit or write her husband. 'They don't come; they don't ask about him,' Betty Jo said as she left the visitors' center at the prison. Killen said people at Parchman were well aware of his identity before he arrived. 'Oh yes. They knew who I was,' he said. Killen said he had some run-ins with black prisoners and had received threats but nothing ever came from them. He won't talk about his well-known association with the Ku Klux Klan as an organizer. He does say he knew some people in the KKK. A question about what he thought of the testimony of friends at his trial drew his anger. 'Friends? What friends? You talking about Winstead?' Mike Winstead testified that he was 10 years old and sitting on his grandfather's porch one Sunday in 1967 listening to Killen and his grandfather talk. 'My grandfather asked him, did he have anything to do with those boys being killed,' said Winstead, who was serving a 30-year sentence for rape. 'He told my grandfather yes, and he was proud of it.' National attention: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is seen with a photo of the victims in December 1964 during a press conference after it emerged that 20 men were arrested in connection to the slayings . Big screen adaptation: Killen says he has never and will never talk about the events that became immortalized in 'Mississippi Burning' Slayings: This 1964 photo released by the FBI shows the uncovered bodies of the victims from an earthen dam southwest of Philadelphia, Mississippi . Tight-lipped: In his recent interview, Killen wouldn't say much about the 1964 killings. He said he remains a segregationist who does not believe in race equality but contends he bears no ill will toward blacks . Killen said he didn't know Winstead, and never visited the house. 'I think I would remember if I did that,' Killen said. Chaney's sister, the Rev. Julia Chaney Moss of Willingboro, New Jersey, said she was not surprised Killen wouldn't talk about the slayings. 'I can only wish Mr. Killen peace at this juncture in his life. ... If he can achieve a modicum of peace, I wish that for him,' Chaney said. Killen's first trial on federal conspiracy charges was held in 1967, but the all-white jury could not reach a verdict. One juror said she could not convict a preacher. Of the seven who were convicted, none served more than six years. Because many of those who testified in 1967 were no longer available, prosecutors got permission to have others read transcripts of the earlier testimony into the new court record. A convergence of factors led to a new trial in 2005. There was a new district attorney and Mississippi attorney general, persistent media coverage and advocacy groups urging a closer look. In the 2005 trial, Attorney General Jim Hood acknowledged that Killen did not shoot the men himself, but said Killen's role as organizer made him just as guilty as those who fired the guns. Testimony read in court showed Killen ordered fellow Klansmen to attack Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman and then went to a funeral home to create an alibi for himself. James Jordan, a Klansman who has since died, testified for the prosecution in 1967 that Killen showed the killers where the men were jailed and where to wait to hunt them down once they were released. As carloads of Klansmen drove off to intercept the three doomed men, Jordan said, they let Killen off at a funeral home. 'He said he had to go there because if anything happened, he would be the first one questioned,' Jordan said. Killen's only response today to any of that was his often repeated contention that he is not a criminal convict but a political prisoner. One thing of which he is certain: 'I could have beat that thing if I'd had the mental ability,' Killen said, tapping his bald head.

"The three young children of Sydney siege victim Katrina Dawson have each picked a heartbreaking song to be played at their mother’s memorial service on Tuesday. Ms Dawson's youngest daughter Sasha, who is four-years-old, has chosen Santa Claus Is Coming To Town for a moving farewell just two days before Christmas. Six-year-old Oliver picked Somewhere Over The Rainbow and eight-year-old-Chloe has dedicated The Gambler, by Kenny Rogers, a song she reportedly enjoyed with her mother, the Daily Telegraph reports.The well-regarded barrister's life will be celebrated in The Great Hall at her alma mater, the University of Sydney, where she studied arts and law. Ms Dawson died alongside Lindt café manager Tori Johnson in Martin Place, central Sydney, in the early hours of December 16 after being taken hostage by gunman Man Haron Monis for more than 16-hours. Scroll down for video . Katrina Dawson (left) will be farewelled by her three children, who left a touching 'I love you mum' note (right) in Martin Place last week, at a memorial service at The University of Sydney . Her husband Paul Smith will give a eulogy at the service and her parents and brothers will also pay tribute. The family have asked attendees to wear a splash of aqua, Ms Dawson's favourite colour, to honour her life. Organisers have also asked for donations to be made to the Katrina Dawson Foundation instead of flowers. The charity was set up last week for women's education opportunities. Ms Dawson's brother, Sandy Dawson, said that her tragic passing during the Martin Place siege would not prevent her legacy from living on. Flowers have been placed by thousands of mourners near the scene of the siege in Martin Place . Friends and strangers of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson have left touching tributes . 'As the city's poignant and continuing tribute to her and Tori Johnson shows, even people who did not know her do not wish the end of her life to be the end of her good work,' Mr Dawson, a well-known Sydney barrister, said today. The Foundation was established to 'preserve and honour the memory of Katrina Dawson and all she achieved'. Former Governor-General Dame Quentin Bryce has been reported to be the founding member of the charity, with the move coming on the heels of a memorial fund for Mr Johnson. 'The foundation's focus is particularly appropriate because education, and particularly women's education, was something incredibly important to Katrina and in which she achieved true excellence,' said Mr Dawson. The 38-year-old was buried privately on Monday. Meanwhile, grieving family and friends of Mr Johnson will pay their final respects to the brave 34-year-old at a private memorial service at St Stephen's Uniting Church on Tuesday morning. The church in Sydney's CBD is only a few hundred metres from where he died. In the wake of the pair's tragic deaths, thousands of Sydneysiders have visited Martin Place where the public outpouring of grief has manifested in a sea of floral tributes.

"Stranded in a field 20 miles from the sea, he was hardly likely to make a quick escape. Yet the emergency services were taking no chances when they launched operation Seal Rescue yesterday. Wearing helmets and armed with brooms, firemen tried to corner the bewildered grey seal that had been spotted flopping around the field by a dog walker. Scroll down for video . A team of firefighters and policemen together with local men try to get the mammal under control using brooms and metal fencing in the field in rural Newton-le-Willows . Experts have been so far unable to explain how the mammal found itself some 20miles from the coast . Local people were baffled by the seal's appearance and say it is not being 'friendly' to those trying to secure its safe return to a natural habitat . Then the police turned up to help, dressed in protective knee and elbow pads. But they could only man some fencing panels and offer advice on how to go about the tricky task. Judging by the seal’s frightened expression, maybe a few more of them should have stayed behind at the station. In total around ten police officers, six firefighters and four wildlife rescue volunteers worked together to herd the lost seal on to a trailer in the field near Newton-le-Willows in Merseyside. Wildlife experts are baffled at how he managed to get himself lost in the middle of a field. He is thought to belong to an established colony on Hilbre island in the Dee estuary, from where he swam to the Mersey and through a series of brooks to Newton Brook. There he may have become disoriented before making his way into the muddy field. ‘It is absolutely incredible that a seal has managed to get this far inland,’ one resident said. ‘He just must have kept following each water course he came across.’ The mammal was flailing across the muddy field when local people discovered it this morning . A local man jabs the mammal with a wooden brush as firefighters and police look on in a bid to keep it under control . Fire crews have been caught to winch the creature, which is expected to be sedated by a vet later today . The animal was discovered by a dog walker in the rural setting early this morning, before police were called . Locals have described the seal as 'not very friendly' and police are warning people to stay away . Nearby residents think the seal may have swam up a local brook, which runs into the River Mersey . Local people and emergency services were left baffled by the discovery of the seal some 20miles from the River Mersey and Irish Sea . Nicola Watkinson, who works at the nearby Red Bank Farm shop, said the seal was ‘quite large and not very friendly’. Volunteers transported the seal to the RSPCA wildlife centre at Stapeley Grange, in Nantwich, Cheshire, where it underwent medical checks. The RSPCA is working on a plan to escort him back to his colony. Police were the first called to the scene, but say their role is mainly one of 'crowd management' Members of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, who usually deal with beached animals, are at the scene . The nearest sea to the animal's location is the estuary of the River Mersey in Liverpool - seven miles away .","The seal was discovered some 20miles from the coast in a Merseyside field .

"Christmas is a time for indulgence – but a coffee with 600 calories, 19 teaspoons of sugar and 27 grams of fat might be taking things a bit far. Still, Costa’s sticky toffee latte has certainly proved popular, with the coffee chain selling 100,000 a week during the festive season.

"Damaging: Intelligence chiefs have lost track of some of Britain’s most dangerous criminals after US Edward Snowden (above) revealed their tactics . Intelligence chiefs have lost track of some of Britain’s most dangerous criminals because US fugitive Edward Snowden exposed security service operations, it has been claimed. The UK’s eavesdropping service, GCHQ, has had to stop monitoring drug gangs, paedophiles, human traffickers and money launderers as a result of the ‘significant’ damage inflicted by the leaks reported in the Guardian newspaper, sources said. The Left-wing paper published a series of articles giving details of the activities of US and UK spy agencies, based on the top-secret files stolen by Snowden. The reports helped to blow a massive hole in Britain’s intelligence-gathering capability by exposing sensitive methods to terrorists. Security chiefs said that extremists were ‘lapping up’ the articles and using them to evade detection. Now, intelligence sources have warned that more than a quarter of the activities of some of the UK’s most prolific crime bosses are going undetected because they have changed their communications following the revelations. In other cases, GCHQ has toned down or abandoned surveillance amid fears that the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to ‘go dark’ and fall off the radar completely. One senior security official told The Daily Telegraph: ‘Snowden has been very damaging to our work. We have specific evidence of where key targets have changed their communication behaviour as a direct result of what they have read. They have moved to more secure forms of communication and we have been unable to assist the National Crime Agency.’ While spy bosses had already told how terrorists changed their tactics after the leaks last year, the latest revelations show that harm was also done to GCHQ’s other remit – combating serious and organised crime. Among the gangs left able to operate unhindered, the source said, was a drug-smuggling ring which had continued to bring Class A narcotics into Britain. Snowden, 31, became one of the world’s most wanted men in June last year – less than a month after Lee Rigby’s murder – when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified files from the US National Security Agency. He leaked information about attempts by spy agencies – including GCHQ and the NSA – to view citizens’ private data such as internet history, emails, texts, calls and passwords. Giving evidence at Parliament last year, Sir Iain Lobban, then head of GCHQ, said the ‘fragile mosaic’ of capabilities that allowed intelligence agents to discover, investigate and take action against terrorists, paedophiles and other serious criminals had become ‘far, far weaker’ because of the revelations. Baroness Stowell, the Leader of the House of Lords, said the leaks had had a ‘serious effect on intelligence-gathering – that is unquestionable.’ And in June Theresa May, the Home Secretary, said that the government’s ability to tackle organised crime was being hampered by a decline in the ability of police and intelligence services to access communications data used by alleged terrorists and criminals. Impact: GCHQ, the Government’s communications surveillance service, has stopped monitoring dangerous criminals after its ability to keep tabs on them was damaged by the leaks. Above, GCHQ headquarters . Consequently, Mrs May has announced expanded powers that will allow the police and intelligence services to spy on the internet. The proposed legislation would require internet companies to keep records of every website their customers visited. Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into giving him passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history. The defence contractor claims he had to act because the US government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location. Organised crime is thought to involve up to 5,500 gangs and costs the UK £24billion a year.","Whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed tactics of intelligence chiefs .

"Builder Lee Goddard opened the sluice gates outside his home allowing tens of thousands of litres of water to pass through . A builder who broke open sluice gates to protect his own property at the height of last winter’s floods sent 45,000 cubic metres of water rushing towards a local village. The water surged into an adjacent field, into an irrigation channel and into the village of Thorney on the Somerset levels. Yesterday, builder Lee Goddard was fined just £1,000 after becoming the first person in Britain to be convicted of opening a sluice gate. The Slabgate Sluice, in Hambridge, is used to control the flow of water from the River Isle to West Moor, next to Thorney, and is opened in the summer to send water to the moor for cattle grazing. Though prosecutors said it could not be confirmed whether Goddard’s actions had directly caused damage to properties in Thorney, he was accused of exacerbating the plight of villagers. A court heard Goddard, 40, used a crowbar to open the gates and smashed a padlock before using screws to hold the gates open. The father-of-two had previously admitted contravening land drainage laws by ‘interfering’ with the sluice. Yesterday he was handed a £1,000 fine, ordered to pay £415 compensation, £1,000 legal fees and a £100 surcharge. Prosecuting, Simon Cooper told the court that meetings were held between the drainage board and locals during the flooding and it was decided the gates could not be opened. He said: ‘The effect of opening the gates was that water levels in West Moor rose. The sluice gate at Hambridge had been padlocked shut in a bid to prevent further flooding to the Levels . ‘Properties in Thorney were already at risk. Because the defendant opened the gate there was an increase of water levels. ‘It transpired that Mr Goddard was boasting at a New Year’s Eve party that he had opened the gates.’ Mr Cooper told the court that it was unclear how much of the blame for flooding in Thorney could be placed with Goddard. He added: ‘The area was flooded anyway. The gates exacerbated the problem.’ Goddard used a crowbar to wedge them open in an effort to stop his own home from being flooded last year . The 40-year-old said if the gates remained shut his home (pictured) would have been swamped with water and waste . But residents say opening the sluice gate led to devastating consequences. Julian Temperley believes his 99-year-old father Neville’s house was flooded as a result of the gate being lifted. ‘I believe my father is not in his house today because of the actions of this man in Hambridge,’ he said earlier this year. Neville Temperley, is unlikely to return to his home until April. Another flooded resident, Rita Dobben, added: ‘It could have been a matter of centimetres that saved us. ‘If we hadn’t have had that extra water that the sluice gate being opened caused into the floodwater that was already there, we may well have just got away with it, but we didn’t.’ Taunton magistrates’ court heard Goddard opened the 4.4ft square gates used to control the flow of water between December 20 and 23 last year. Dozens of homes were entirely destroyed by the floods on the Somerset Levels last winter (pictured) Huge swathes of the area were left underwater with residents forced to remain in their own homes for weeks . He was brought before the courts in a private prosecution by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board. He pleaded guilty to the offence in August. Sentencing him, District Judge David Taylor said his actions were selfish. The judge added: ‘This sluice gate you opened was part of a historic system for controlling the flow of water. ‘It is clear to me you would have known last year was the wettest for many, many years.’ At the height of the floods, hundreds of people across Somerset were forced to flee their houses. More than 600 homes and 17,000 acres of farmland were inundated and villages were cut off. Goddard said he had lived in his current property for 28 years and opening the gates had never been a problem before. He said: ‘If they [the sluice gates] were open for two hours, we wouldn’t flood. It goes into the field, then into the canal and into the river. The rivers are not being maintained.’ Villages became entirely cut off for weeks with emergency supplies transported to residents in boats .

"House prices are falling all over Britain as the property market ends the year with a whimper. The value of the average home fell in nearly a third of UK postcodes in the three months to November, according to property website Hometrack. This compares with declines in less than one in five areas last spring, and is further evidence to suggest the housing market is now cooling. The slowdown has even hit London, which for much of the past year has been in the grip of a house price boom. A quarter of London post codes areas are now experiencing falling prices — up from about 5 per cent in May . Prices fell in a quarter of the capital’s postcodes in the three months to November – compared with just 5 per cent in the three months to May. Among the worst hit areas of the UK are Aberdeen in Scotland, Lakenheath near Cambridge, Redland in Bristol and Caversham in Reading, where prices were rising strongly earlier in the year. In London, the worst-affected markets include previously booming Wandsworth, Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham – as well as Knightsbridge, home to the rich and famous. The softening of the market follows a clampdown on risky mortgage lending by the Bank of England, and worries that some areas have become overpriced. ‘Everything is coming off the boil very quickly,’ said Hometrack’s Richard Donnell. ‘We have had a huge surge of pent-up demand coming into the market from January 2013 onwards, but we are now running out of people who want to move or can afford to move.’ Despite the recent slowdown, house prices are still up on this time last year, with Office for National Statistics figures last week showing the average home is now worth £271,000 – up 10.4 per cent year on year. The increase was fuelled by runaway prices in London – up 17.2 per cent increase in just 12 months – while the North East as a whole saw prices rise just 3.9 per cent. But the Hometrack report shows the proportion of postcodes where growth is accelerating has fallen from around 65 per cent in the spring to just over 20 per cent now. Stanwell — just south of Heathrow airport — is one of the booming towns unaffected by the house price slowdown faced by many other areas of the country . The area with the strongest house price growth in the country is Milton Keynes, according to Hometrack. Aldershot, Stanwell — just south of Heathrow airport — and Roydon, near Harlow in Essex are also booming. But former boom towns like Aberdeen, Lakenheath near Cambridge, Redland in Bristol and Caversham in Reading have all been hit by a slowdown. In London, the proportion of areas where price growth is still accelerating has dropped from 70 per cent in May to 5 per cent. Separate figures from online estate agent eMoov.co.uk show demand among buyers has fallen 8 per cent since February. Former boom towns like Aberdeen, in north west Scotland (pictured) have been hit by a slowdown in house prices . In London the fall is 28 per cent, according to the report, with the biggest slumps coming in Westminster, Lambeth and Islington. But as rising prices in the capital have pushed more homeowners out, surrounding areas remain popular. The report shows demand among buyers in the UK is highest in the London borough of Bexley, where 71 per cent of homes up for sale have been sold. The next strongest is Reading at 67 per cent followed by Sutton, in south London, at 65 per cent, Watford at 64 per cent and Guildford, Surrey, at 63 per cent. ‘The property market in London has cooled right down,’ said Mr Quirk. He warned the capital will ‘continue to stagnate and possibly even drop’, but added: ‘A staggering number of northern locations are enjoying a rise in demand.’ The new figures come after forecasters said house price growth would slow next year as tighter mortgage rules and stagnant wages continue to bite in much of the country. Despite falling house prices in a quarter of post codes, the cost of buying a home continues to rise on average across the country . The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors forecast that house prices would rise by 3 percent next year on average, with increases of as much as 5 percent in much of northern and central England but stagnant prices in London. ‘The recently announced and long overdue reform of stamp duty is likely to provide a tonic for the market across many parts of the country, particularly for first-time buyers,’ Simon Rubinsohn, the RICS chief economist, said. ‘That said, the bigger affordability issue is not going to go away, highlighting just how important it is to speed up the supply pipeline of new homes over the coming years.’ Excluding London and the wider South East, house prices increased by 6.7 per cent in the rest of the UK last year, the Office for National Statistics said. Prices grew 10.8 per cent in England, 5.7 per cent in Wales, 4.9 per cent in Scotland and 4.9 per cent in Northern Ireland. In England, prices grew fastest in the South East and East Anglia – up 11.9 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively. The booming property market is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get on their foot on the housing ladder. In October, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12 per cent higher on average than at the same time the year before. For existing owners prices increased by 9.7 per cent. By last month, first time buyers had to pay £208,000 to get on the ladder – while the average price paid by owner-occupiers was £312,000. The average UK house price in October was £271,000 – with properties in England the most expensive at £283,000. Homes in Wales cost £172,000 on average, £194,000 in Scotland and £137,000 in Northern Ireland. In London meanwhile the average house costs £504,000 – almost three and a half times more than in the North East which has the lowest average house prices at £152,000.","A third of postcodes saw property prices fall in three months to November .

"Thieves have tunnelled their way into a toy shop and stolen thousands of dollars worth of cash and remote control cars, helicopters and trains. The robbers tried to cover their tracks by throwing around corrosive bleach, which ruined even more toys just days before Christmas. A hole was cut in the wall of the Toyworld store in Moonah, north of Hobart, on Friday night or early Saturday and thieves took off with $7,000 worth of expensive electrical toys and a safe with $1,000 in it. Owner Samm Harrington, who now won't be able to open his shop ahead of Christmas, suspects the shop was scoped by thieves for weeks before the robbery, the ABC reports. A hole was cut in the wall of the Toyworld store in Moonah, north of Hobart, on Friday night or early Saturday and thieves took off with $7,000 worth of expensive electrical toys . 'They'd tunnelled their way through, they jumped the fence, they ripped the wooden palings off the outside of the shop and smashed their way through,' Mr Harrington said. 'We're probably going to be losing up to about $12,000 to $15,000 in trading dollars and we know we've lost at least $7,000 in stock.'

"Newlywed: Pc Neil Doyle, above, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was set upon in the early hours of Friday  in what his boss described as an unprovoked attack . Two men have been charged with the murder of an of a newlywed police officer who was attacked while on his Christmas night out in Liverpool. Pc Neil Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was set upon in the early hours of Friday morning in what his boss described as an unprovoked and vicious attack. Andrew Taylor, 28, from Huyton, Liverpool, and Christopher Spendlove, 30, of Stockbridge Village, Liverpool, will appear at Liverpool Crown Court tomorrow. Both defendants have also each been charged with two counts of Section 18 assault, said Merseyside Police. Police said previously that it appeared that the attackers knew that their victims were off-duty police officers. Mr Doyle married only five months ago and he and wife Sarah, 37, had booked a belated honeymoon for the new year. Mrs Doyle said in a statement: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all. 'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.' The couple were married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month. Speaking last week, Sir Jon Murphy, Merseyside's Chief Constable, said: 'Constable Doyle was enjoying a Christmas night out with his work colleagues. 'They were subjected to an apparently unprovoked and vicious attack by a group of males. There is no indication whatsoever that they were involved in any kind of argument or altercation earlier in the evening. 'The officer I have spoken to has indicated that the individuals who approached them referred to them as police officers. Investigation: The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am following the officers' Christmas party at a pub. Above, officers at the scene on Friday . 'They then assaulted the officers, leaving two with nasty head injuries and resulting in the tragic death of Neil.' The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am following the officers' Christmas party at a pub. Dedicated: Sir Jon Murphy, Merseyside's Chief Constable, pictured, said Pc Doyle was a patrol officer who had served with the force for ten years . The attackers vanished when it became clear that Mr Doyle was seriously hurt. Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived. A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. Sir Jon said the constable was a patrol officer who had served with the force for ten years. He had won a commendation for arresting three violent robbers. The Chief Constable said it was a 'sad day' for Merseyside police and sent his 'heartfelt condolences' to Mrs Doyle and the officer's family. Speaking after his death, one neighbour, Margaret Murphy, 61, said: 'It's such a shock. Neil was a lovely lad, very quiet and unassuming. I can't get over it. I saw his wife and brother this morning, they were very upset. 'They told me Neil had passed away after an incident in town. It's so terrible, especially so close to Christmas.' Another neighbour, Theresa Doyle, who is no relation, added: 'Neil was a lovely neighbour, very polite. 'He wasn't the type to get into trouble – if anything I would guess he had stepped in and tried to solve a problem. He was a really good character. They kept their lives very private. To be honest you would never have known he was a police officer. 'I just feel for Sarah now, and how she copes without him. It is such a shame. It is such sad news.'

"Life-saving equipment more commonly used for humans has been used to rescue a cat from peril. Firefighters from Fort Worth Fire Department in Texas placed a tiny oxygen mask on a feline name Stubby after he got caught in a blazing house fire on Friday. The feline, who was suffering from smoke inhalation, was revived via CPR and taken to vets for further evaluation. Saved from peril: This December 19, 2014 photo provided by the Fort Worth Texas Fire Department shows a firefighter providing oxygen to Stubby the cat, who was rescued from a house fire in Fort Worth, Texas . No humans were hurt in the burnout, which occurred around 11:40am. Lieutenant Kyle Falkner says firefighters found Stubby while trying to bring flames under control. It took about half-an-hour to extinguish the fire completely. Stubby was extricated but had breathed in harmful gases, so firefighters administered oxygen via a mask. It's becoming more common for fire departments to have pet oxygen masks, so animal victims can receive on-the-spot treatment along with their owners. Damages to the Fort Worth home and its contents were estimated at $100,000. Authorities are trying to determine what sparked the fire.

"A Queensland father has recounted the incredible tale of survival of his young family after being stranded in bushland for nearly two weeks when their car became bogged in mud. Stephen Van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, survived off mouldy bread and rainwater for ten days, before being found in their four-wheel drive at Expedition National Park  by local property owner Tom Wagner at about 3:30pm on Sunday. ‘We didn’t know for so long if anyone knew we were here or if was even looking,' said Mr Van Lonkhuyzen. Scroll down for video . Stephen Van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, were found in their four-wheel drive at Expedition National Park . 'The boys understood the situation, and that there was nothing they could do about it,' he told Nine News. Mr Van Lonkhuyzen, from Lota, in central Queensland, said that the family made the best of the situation, rationing their supplies and catching rain water in a plastic bowl. 'We managed our water well and talked each other through it,' he said. Mr Van Lonkhuyzen tried to get his sons into a 'routine', said South West District Acting Superintendent Mick Bianci. 'He actually set out some hi-viz towels, spread them out on the ground around vehicle so it could much more visible in case an air search took place,' Superintendent Bianci told The Courier Mail. 'He lit a fire to put up some smoke to attract anyone who was out there and saw the smoke and he sent out SOSs on the horn of his vehicle, but of course it’s remote and isolated. There was no one to hear it,' he said. A national alert went out after Mr Van Lonkhuyzen and his boys vanished after starting out on the 1700km Christmas holiday road trip from Brisbane to Cairns on December 11. They were expected to arrive in Cairns on December 15, but after Mr Van Lonkhuyzon failed to make contact with family or friends in over a week, his wife contacted police, who sent out a nationwide alert. Mr Van Lonkhuyzon's wife Karen called the extensive search for her family 'a nightmare'. Tom Wagner, a local farmer, heard about the missing family through a radio link with the Outback Church, and decided to pack up his quad bike and set out in search of them. The farmer said said that the family was incredibly relieved to see him, and started waving their arms around to get his attention . The family was in good cheer despite not eating for over a week, and were overjoyed when Mr Wagner returned with the police, who he had called from the nearest rangers hut . 'I got on my quad and took some sandwiches and biscuits and a bit of food and water for them and headed out,' said Mr Wagner. Mr Wagner, a grazier at the mouth of Expedition National Park, said he knew the area 'like the back of his hand,' and calculated the possibly locations of the Lonkhuyzen family  based on how much petrol he was told they set out with. 'I talked to a national park fella and found out they’d been seen in Haughton on that first Friday, 10 days ago or whatever it was and no one had seen them since,' Mr Wagner told News Corp. The trio had last been seen at a petrol station at Miles, northwest of Toowoomba. 'With that I worked out how far they could get, that national park is 100,000 acres, it’s huge and terribly rough country, that’s pretty inaccessible,' he told News Corp. After discovering fading tracks in the mud, Mr Wagner head further into the national park, and discovered the family after searching for four hours in 'the wildest bit of country in the whole area'. The CCTV camera footage showing the last place Mr Van Lonkhuyzen and his sons were spotted . Stephen van Lonkhuyzen, 37, (left) and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, (right) have been found alive and well by a remote property owner after being missing for almost 10 days . The farmer said said that the family was incredibly relieved to see him, and started waving their arms around to get his attention. 'You suddenly hear a noise and you go, that’s the noise you’ve been waiting for,' Mr Van Lonkhuyzon said. 'We were never worried- I know from the outside it was probably a far more distressing situation, not knowing anything, but we knew we were safe,' he said . After producing the food he had brought along, the boys 'woofed' into the biscuits and sandwiches, asking for eggs and complaining about only having water to drink. 'They were very close to running out of food when they were found and they had nine litres of water with them in the car that were used up,' Superintendent Bianci told The Courier Mail. Mr Wagner, who has been labelled a hero, said that the boys looked a bit 'thin in the face' but appeared to be in good cheer. The farmer jumped on his bike again to find reception for his satellite phone, a move the young boys were none too happy about, believing he was going to leave them there. 'When we did get the police vehicle in we had to winch it through a bit, it was a bit of a hassle getting in through there,' he said. Detective Acting Superintendent Owen Elloy said Mr Van Lonkhuyzen said that police  arrived at the scene just after 5pm. 'It is a piece of land that is normally visited by cattle from what I can understand of it. It is black soil country, it's very soft,' Detective Elloy said. Despite a few technical glitches, Mr Lonkhuyzen, Ethan, and Timothy were rescued from their bogged four-wheel-drive, and taken to Taroom Hospital. They were found at Expedition National Park (pictured) in central Queensland where their car had become 'severely bogged' Detective Acting Superintendent Owen Elloy noted that the area in which the trio were found was well known for its rugged terrain and deep gorges, saying that even the property owner that found them 'went in there with a huge air of concern – he had his satellite phone with him, thank god' Detective Elloy also added: 'They had the common sense to stay with their vehicle which is a huge point in any survival technique. They've stayed with their car and it's a lot easier to find a car than somebody walking.' He noted that the area was well known for its rugged terrain and deep gorges, saying, 'even the property owner went in there with a huge air of concern – he had his satellite phone with him, thank god.' Mr Van Lonkhuyzen's brother, Derrick, said that the family was excited to have them home for Christmas. 'They will be certainly looking forward to coming home and we are certainly looking forward to having them home,' he said.","Stephen Van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, were discovered in their four-wheel-drive after becoming bogged in mud .

"China's most prolific underwear thief terrorised his neighbours in a one-man crime wave that was anything but brief ... it lasted more than a decade. But the bra bandit of Yulin city, southeast China, has finally been snared after the ceiling of his apartment collapsed under the weight of his stash. The bra bandit, named only as Tan, had hidden more than 2,000 pairs of pilfered pants and brassieres in the cavity above his bedroom in  the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's second-largest metropolis.

"Christmas is seen by most families as a time to celebrate together – but for some it seems that only holds true until there is a better offer. The majority of workers would choose a small cash bonus over a couple of extra days off with their loved ones during the festive period, according to research. Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers asked 2,400 adults what they would value most at Christmas. The most popular option was a £250 cash bonus, with 57 per cent of the vote. Scroll down for video . The majority of workers would choose a small cash bonus over a couple of extra days off with their loved ones during the festive period, according to research . Just one in ten people opted for two extra days of annual leave. The same proportion chose a £250 voucher from their favourite shop. Only 4 per cent would take the offer of a £10,000 bar tab for their closest ten colleagues, 5 per cent would prefer a tablet computer and 4 per cent opted for a Christmas hamper worth £250. Despite Christmas traditionally being a time of giving, only 2 per cent picked the generous option of donating £250 to charity. A further 2 per cent chose a free dinner and drinks for them and three others. Experts offered a charitable explanation for the findings. They argued that the results show many people are struggling financially this Christmas – rather than wanting to escape their in-laws. John Harding, employment partner at PwC, said: ‘Despite the recent signs of a pick-up in wage growth, many people are still feeling the squeeze so it isn’t surprising that people are hoping for an extra cash bonus in their stocking this year.’ He added: ‘Our research highlights that cash is still king this Christmas as employees overwhelmingly place a higher value on a small amount of extra pay above all benefits – even extra time off with their families at Christmas.’ Workers have endured an unprecedented squeeze on finances triggered by the economic crisis, as wage rises failed to keep pace with inflation. But there are signs this could be coming to an end. Official figures released last week show regular pay grew 1.6 per cent in the year to October, while inflation fell to 1 per cent – its lowest level for 12 years. Senior City workers can afford to splash out this Christmas as they look forward to average bonuses of £124,680. Their windfalls are predicted to rise by more than a fifth on last year’s average of £102,940, despite pressure from regulators. It means the typical bonus will be more than four times the average UK salary, according to recruitment firm Astbury Marsden.","2,400 workers surveyed on what they would value most at Christmas .

"A Columbia University student accused of raping a classmate - who has been carrying around her mattress in protest ever since - has insisted he is a feminist. Speaking to the New York Times in his first ever interview, Paul Nungesser called the rallies against him 'bullying' - and slammed the university for failing to prevent them. He was accused by fellow senior Emma Sulkowicz of violently raping her in her dorm room more than two years ago, but the university cleared him in the case and in two others. After learning about the decision, Sulkowicz started lugging around her 50-pound mattress to symbolize the burden she was carrying - and vowed to continue until he left the school. Scroll down for video . 'Victim': Emma Sulkowicz, pictured, has been carrying around her mattress ever since Columbia University failed to discipline the student she says raped her. He has now spoken out to protest his innocence . The protest is also the subject of her senior thesis for the visual arts department - entitled 'Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)' - and has encouraged other students to rally with her. Nungesser, who insisted the sex was consensual, told the Times he has finally decided to speak out because graduation is just months away. He insisted that he was innocent. 'My mother raised me as a feminist,' he said. 'And I'm someone who would like to think of myself as being supportive of equal rights for women.' But when Sulkowicz accused him earlier this year of hitting her, pinning her down and raping her in August 2012, two other female students also made complaints against him. One student claimed he'd groped her during a party while another who said he forced her into non-consensual sex during their relationship. He was also cleared in these cases. The campus newspaper, the Columbia Spectator, chose to name Nungesser, saying that his name was available to the public in police reports. Afterwards, he saw his name plastered across campus bathrooms and in online news articles, he told the New York Times. His friends started avoiding him, he said. He said some people suggested there had been a misunderstanding between him and Sulkowicz. 'But the matter of the fact is it's not a misunderstanding,' he said. 'What was alleged was the most violent rape, and that did not happen.' No stopping: She carries her mattress to symbolize both where the attack took place and also to represent the burden she is carrying around. School officials said there was not enough evidence in her case . Protest: Sulkowicz's accuser claimed in a New York Times article that he is a feminist . After Sulkowicz's allegations, students have held rallies on campus and in October, students at more than 100 colleges were inspired to carry mattresses to highlight campus sexual assault. At Columbia, some students hauled their mattresses to one of Nungesser's classes and took photos of him as he entered the room. Nungesser called the protests bullying and said the university has not prevented them, even though he has been cleared of wrongdoing. 'There is a member of the faculty that is supervising this,' he said, referring to Sulkowicz's thesis. 'This is part of her graduation requirement.' Columbia said in a statement that academic freedom allows students to express themselves on issues of public debate. He said he was only accused by the three women after they heard similar stories from each other. In the first case, he was given 'disciplinary probation' but he appealed - and by then, the accuser had graduated and did not participate in the process and the decision was thrown out. The university also dropped the second case after she stopped answering emails about it over the summer vacation, saying she was exhausted by the questioning. Rally: Her protest has encouraged other students to speak out about how campuses deal with sexual assault accusations. Other students are pictured at a rally earlier this year . In Sulkowicz's case, the university found there was not enough evidence and when she asked for an appeal, it was denied. She previously explained that she went to police a year and a half after the incident happened because she was afraid and ashamed of what had happened. 'When it first happened, I didn't want to talk to anyone,' she explained. 'I didn't even tell my parents. ... I didn't even want to talk to my best friend.' Sulkowicz stands by her story and as the New York Times published its article on Monday, she shared the piece on her Facebook page, writing: 'My rapist calls himself a feminist.' Following the case, the university changed the way it handles sexual assault allegations. Both sides are now allowed to bring a lawyer and if they do not have one, Columbia will provide one for them. Nungesser said he is looking forward to leaving the school. He will graduate the same day as Sulkowicz - who said she might bring her mattress on stage. Nungesser said he has spoken to a lawyer but is not pursuing any legal action.","Paul Nungesser was accused of raping Emma Sulkowicz in her dorm room in August 2012 - but the university dismissed the case .

"Three boy racers have been jailed for causing a head-on collision while driving in a high-speed convoy of around 30 cars. They were part of a gang that was seen racing around roundabouts before speeding into oncoming traffic on a busy stretch of the A40 in Pembrokeshire. Their 'lunatic' driving was slammed by a judge, who said: 'Cars are not toys for little boys they are dangerous objects', adding that their actions put a 'large number' of road users in danger. Jailed: Ian Lloyd (left), Scott Beavis (centre) and Jack Murdoch (right) were handed prison sentences at Swansea Crown Court today.

Above, his car on the road after the crash in August last year . Dangerous: Beavis, who was driving the car pictured, was air-lifted to hospital after the crash. Mother Andrea Gainfort, who was driving the car he hit, was hospitalised for 13 days after the incident . One 21-year-old driver, Scott Beavis, crashed head-on into a car at 80mph after losing control of his vehicle. He was jailed for six months and banned from driving for two years. Another driver, Ian Lloyd, 22, received a six-month jail sentence and a two-year driving ban. And Jack Murdoch, 18, was jailed for 16 weeks and banned from driving for 12 months. Four other drivers, who were also part of the convey, narrowly escaped jail at Swansea Crown Court today, according to Wales Online. Judge Paul Thomas criticised their actions, describing them as 'childish, immature and astonishingly bad'. The seven defendants met at a garage in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, in August 2013, before  driving in a convoy of around 30 cars towards Swansea on the A40. Judge Thomas said that the time of year meant that the road would have been heavily congested, adding that a 'large number' of others, including children, were put in danger.

Jack Murdoch, 18, of Waterson, Pembrokeshire, was jailed for 16 weeks and banned from driving for 12 months. Stephen Rees, representing Lloyd, said 30 cars left a car park in Haverfordwest as a 'cruise' but not a race. Admission: James Adams, 23, left, received a 12-week suspended jail sentence and was banned from driving for a year while 19-year-old Edward Adams, right, was ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work .

"For several years, a £500,000 painting by an acclaimed artist had pride of place in the home of one of Britain’s richest residents. Aline Foriel-Destezet, 73, wife of the billionaire founder of Adecco, the world’s largest recruitment business, displayed the oil on canvas La Ciotat, 1907 in the hall of her London home. After all, it was purportedly signed by French painter Emile-Othon Friesz and was purchased from a company run by respected fine art dealer, Simon Dickinson. So you can imagine Mme Foriel-Destezet’s shock when one of Mr Dickinson’s staff contacted her to say the picture she bought in good faith for 670,000 euros in 2007 - £525,000 at current rates - was the work of one of the world’s most notorious art forgers, German Wolfgang Beltracchi. Fake: La Ciotat, 1907 contained pigment patented 1938, 31 years after it was purportedly painted . The French-born philanthropist was outraged when Mr Dickinson’s aide then informed her that the case fell outside the statute of limitations and therefore his company had ‘no liability’ towards her, though they had a desire to ‘act honourably and look to reach an equitable conclusion’. No such settlement has been agreed, with Mme Foriel-Destezet - a keen supporter of the Royal Opera House - ‘very distressed’ that she has not been offered a full refund. She has instructed top City law firm Withers to represent her in her legal battle with Jermyn Street dealer Mr Dickinson. The saga started in March 2007 when Mme Foriel-Destezet, a collector of mainly 19th century art, bought ‘La Ciotat, 1907’ purportedly by Emile-Othon Friesz, and signed and dated ‘Othon Friesz 1907’. The painting was acquired for a purchase price of €670,000 at the world famous Maastricht art fair from the US trading arm of Simon C Dickinson Limited, known as Dickinson Roundell. In May 2013, Simon C Dickinson Limited, through their German office in Berlin, wrote to Mme Foriel-Destezet saying that the painting would have to be shipped to Germany to be checked by a laboratory which had carried out chemical tests on other paintings thought to be the work of master forger Beltracchi. The crook was jailed for six years in 2011 after being found guilty of counterfeiting 14 pictures as part of an elaborate and skilful scam that netted him and his gang £14million. In 2012, he sensationally admitted he may have placed as many as 2,000 bogus pictures by 50 different artists on the market. One such picture, was ‘La Ciotat, 1907’ - the one purchased by Mme Foriel-Destezet. In September 2013, Mr Dickinson’s German office suggested in an email to her that – following chemical analysis of the painting - she had bought a fake. Wolfgang Beltracchi was jailed for six years in 2011 after being found guilty of a £14million scam . The email went on to say: ‘The findings indicate that titanium white was used in a number of instances, making it impossible for the painting to have been painted before 1938 (the titanium white used in the painting was sourced from rutile, a method that was patented by W.J. Kroll in 1938; before that date titanium white in its pure form was only available from 1910 onwards, so either way, the presence of titanium white is a sign that the painting cannot pre-date 1910). This strongly suggested that the painting we have analysed is indeed a forgery and most probably comes from the workshop of Mr Beltracchi’. The following month Emma Ward, managing director of Simon C Dickinson Limited, wrote to her to say that as the case fell outside the statute of limitations, Dickinson Roundell Inc. had ‘no liability’ though they had a desire to ‘act honourably and look to reach an equitable conclusion’. According to lawyers representing Mme Foriel-Destezet, Mr Dickinson’s firm have made it clear that they do not agree to her request for full reimbursement plus her legal costs. A friend said: ‘Aline was very distressed and shocked to find out it was a fake and she expected that Simon Dickinson would reimburse her in full, as the painting is not what he purported to sell her – it is in fact a forgery. Aline feels it is morally incorrect for him not to return the money in full. ‘He is a well-known dealer with a long career who surely should have done his due-diligence considerably better than he has as the painting has proven to be a forgery.’ Added the friend: ‘Mme Foriel-Destezet has been put in the extraordinary position of effectively being asked to ‘bid’ against herself. Dickinson have refused to say what they would be willing to offer her and instead have asked her to put forward a figure herself - but less than the reimbursement of the purchase price plus her costs.’ A spokesman for Dickinson Roundell said: ‘The context to this matter is that the main international auction houses and many other leading dealers were duped by this wide-reaching and sophisticated forgery ring. ‘At the outset Dickinson Roundell in New York obtained confirmation from the worldwide Friesz expert, Odile Aittouares (the author of the catalogue raisonné of the artist), that the painting was genuine. Upon suspecting that this painting might possibly not be genuine, they approached Mme Foriel-Destezet suggesting they investigate the matter on her behalf. ‘Once it was confirmed by scientific analysis that the painting was a forgery, in a desire to act honourably despite the matter being outside the statute of limitations, they suggested over 14 months ago that they should meet to discuss how the position might be ameliorated, but were rebuffed. The matter has since been the subject of correspondence between the lawyers of the two parties.’ Four years ago the Mail revealed that Old Masters expert Dickinson was at the centre of a legal wrangle concerning the commission on a £4.2 million Leonardo da Vinci sketch. The case was finally resolved after a flurry of writs and years of litigation.","Aline Foriel-Destezet, 73, paid £525,000 for oil canvas La Ciotat, 1907 .

"A nine-year-old girl who was shot in the head after her father opened fire on her and her siblings 10 weeks ago is now walking and communicating in hospital. Lauren Mohney has no memory of the incident but has asked about her brother and sister, who were both killed in the attack, lawyer Zachary Stoumbos told the Daytona Beach News-Journal. She was the only survivor after her father, David Mohney, opened fire at their Port Orange, Florida home on October 17 as he went through a divorce with their mother. He killed Lauren's 14-year-old sister, Savanna, and 11-year-old brother, David Jr., before turning the gun on himself. Investigators have  credited Savanna with saving Lauren's life, saying the teenager shielded her younger sister from their father's gunfire. Survivor: Lauren Mohney, left, is pictured with her mother, Cynthia Mohney, outside Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando. She is now walking and talking after she was shot by her father in October . To answer Lauren's questions about her siblings, Stoumbos said that the family had been speaking to her about heaven. 'It's tough,' he said. 'We are easing into it. It's very delicate.' Her mother, Cynthia Mohney, was not injured in the attack and has been at her daughter's bedside at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando ever since. They plan to spend Christmas together in the hospital, Stoumbos said. Lauren, who was placed in a medically-induced coma after being shot in the left side of her brain, woke up in mid-November and is now breathing on her own, walking, eating and talking, he said. Photographs shared on Facebook show Lauren smiling in hospital and alongside her mother. She is now facing months of speech and physical therapy, and friends of the family have raised more than $13,000 for her treatment on a gofundme page. Murdered: Lauren, left, survived after her older sister Savanna, second left, shielded her little sister with her body, lawyers believe. Savanna and their brother, David Jr., both died in the rampage . Killer: They were shot dead in their home by their father, David Mohney, who then took his own life . Deputies received a call at 5:11am on October 17 and the arriving deputies found the two girls in an upstairs bedroom and their brother in a bedroom on the first floor. Their father was in the kitchen with a handgun next to him and a self-inflicted gun wound. Stoumbus said he believes Savanna, who was found 'draped' over her sister, had acted as a blockade against her father's gunfire. 'We believe Savanna was coming down the stairs because she suspected something bad had happened (to her brother),' he previously told the Journal Online. 'But then changed her mind and went to her younger sister's bedroom to protect her. 'We believe that because she protected her little sister, Lauren's injuries were not as bad.' On the morning of the murders, Mr Mohney, a retired Army sergeant, told his wife: 'If you don't come back to me and stop the divorce, I will kill our children,' Stoumbus said. Strength-to-strength: Lauren, left with her mother, was shot on the left side of her brain and was put into a medically-induced coma. But she is now breathing, walking, talking and eating on her own . Improving: The young survivor will now need months of speech therapy and physical therapy . He then reportedly punched her in the mouth and added: 'If you're going to take my kids away, you will not have them and you will go through the rest of your life without children.' After showing her he had a gun, 'he continued to tell her, ""You will be back with me,"" and, ""This divorce was going to stop"",' Stoumbos told WFTV. Cynthia ran to get help and, while she was at a neighbor's home, she heard shots fired. She ran back to the house and was found lying between her two daughter when authorities arrived. 'His hate took over his love for his children,' Stoumbos said. 'I can't imagine that level of evil, that level of hate.' When he filed for divorce, David Mohney said little about problems with his wife, but indicated that he wanted to move back to Rapid City, South Dakota, while she did not. They had moved to Florida in 2010 so he could study at Palmer College of Chiropractic's campus in Port Orange. He made more specific accusations when he asked a Volusia County court for a protective injunction on June 3. Victims: David Jr. and Savanna were killed as their parents went through a divorce and on the morning of the killings, he reportedly told his wife: 'If you take my kids away, you will not have them' Scene: After his threats, Cynthia ran next door for help but heard gunshots inside their Port Orange home . He claimed that she had been drinking heavily and had slapped him and their children on their chests, backs and arms. Florida's child welfare agency said Cynthia had been treated for substance abuse. However, he dismissed the request for protection two weeks after filing it. Authorities have said that they are not looking into Mrs Mohney's conduct and that an investigation is still underway, including toxicology tests on David Mohney. His divorce lawyer Doug Kneller previously said his client was seeing a 'mental health professional', while Stoumbos said that he had been taking anti-depressants.","Lauren Mohney was the only survivor of her father's murder spree at their home in Florida on October 17 .

"Dotted with insects and oozing with worms, at first glance this meal looks like it is ready for the bin. But the creepy-crawly festive feast is the creation of Peter Bickerton, who will be tucking into his insect-filled meal on Christmas Day. For the main course there is nut-roast filled with crickets served with Brussels sprouts and locusts, and covered in mealworm vegetable gravy. Scroll down for video . Clockwise from left to right: Locust mince pies, mealworm gravy, cricket nut roast, locust Brussels sprouts and mealworm Christmas pudding. Peter Bickerton believes his insect-inspired meal is a much more sustainable alternative to conventional Christmas dinner . Crunchy lunch: The main course is a nut roast filled with crickets and served with roasted potatoes . Dessert will be a choice of mealworm Christmas pudding or locust mince pies. Mr Bickerton believes his insect-inspired menu is a much more sustainable, protein-rich and healthy alternative to the conventional Christmas dinner. The 25-year-old from from Blackburn, Lancashire, said: 'I'm definitely going to be eating bugs this Christmas. 'I've never liked turkey - it's dry, bland and boring. 'A cricket nut roast is a far more delectable and exciting alternative for your holiday lunch. 'People waste a lot of food at Christmas but insects are very low waste. 'The amount of water, grain and resources that you need to rear livestock is ridiculous. The traditional Christmas pudding gets a insect makeover and is studded with mealworms . Swimming in worms: Mealworms also make an appearance in the mixed vegetable gravy . Genius combination: Locusts  on the Brussels sprouts provide a crunch to the otherwise soggy offering . 'If people ate less cow, sheep, pig and chicken and ate more bugs instead, everything would balance.' Peter - who works as an Education & Public Engagement Officer at Norwich University - claims that the tiny critters are delicious in a Christmas lunch. He explains: 'Once people get over the initial yuck factor of creepy-crawlies, they'll be pleasantly surprised by the taste. Crickets are naturally quite a nutty flavour so taste perfect in a roast. 'Locusts are low fat but still very juicy so that goes wonderfully with Brussels sprouts. It's a very similar pairing to bacon and cabbage - it's a genius combination. 'A Christmas pudding can be overly sweet sometimes but the mealworms add a crunch and texture to it. Homemade mince pies stuffed with locusts and decorated with crickets .

Mr Bickerton - who recently completed his PhD in Plant Studies - first ate insects on a field-trip to Ecuador in 2009. 'A native tribe brought some three-inch-long, barbecued beetle larvae for us to try. 'It was just like an incredible explosion of taste in my mouth, I had never eaten anything like it.' But it was only in 2011 that he started doing more research into insect eating - or entomophagy. 'I discovered that insects have twice as much protein than beef and far more omega-3 fatty acids than in fish. 'In fact, research has shown that 100g of locusts for example has more nutrients than any other meat,' he said. These findings led Mr Bickerton to start incorporating bugs regularly into his diet. He orders his creepy-crawlies from a live breeder in Somerset. He has now replaced all the meat dishes he ate with insect protein instead and is even hoping to get insects on his workplace canteen menu. 'I talked to the chef at my Norwich University about putting bugs on the menu and he seemed really interested. 'Far more chefs are using insects in their cooking and there are bug kitchens opening up across Europe. It's only a matter of time before everyone is eating them! 'If anyone wants to put insects on their plate this Christmas, the first thing to do is search entomophagy on Twitter and you'll find several companies that sell edible bugs.'","Peter Bickerton's seasonal menu features locust mince pies for dessert .

"The 37-year-old mother accused of stabbing her seven children and a niece to death may never have to stand criminal trial if she is deemed mentally ill. Raina Thaiday, who is also known as Mersane Warria, is currently under police guard in hospital after being charged with the murder of eight children at a home in Manoora, a suburb of Cairns, north Queensland. Her lawyer Steve McFarlane said she 'knows what has happened' but it 'hasn't sunk in yet’. He has requested her case be heard in the Mental Health Court, which has the power to decide if an alleged offender is permanently unfit to stand trial,The Australian reports. Thaiday did not appear in court when the charges against her were mentioned on Monday. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-nine Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, has been formally charged with the murder of eight children at a Cairns home on Friday morning . Malili (standing left) and Daniel (standing right), along with (sitting, from left) Rayden, Petronella, Rodney and (far right) Azariah were allegedly killed by their mother. A cousin (second from right) is not a victim . She has been formally charged with the deaths of four girls, aged 14, 12, 11, and two, and four boys, aged 9, 8, 6, and five - who were found in their Murray Street home by their 20-year-old brother on Friday morning. 'She's presently on an involuntary treatment order, which means she will be assessed so once she has been assessed then it may go to the mental health court at that stage,' Mr Macfarlane, said outside Cairns courthouse. 'She's coping as best as she can in Cairns Base Hospital where she will be for a while.' Asked by journalists about her state, Mr Macfarlane said: 'I'm not a doctor, but I think she probably knows what happened but doesn't realise it, it hasn't sunk in.' 34 Murray Street, Manoora, where four boys and four girls were murdered, will be demolished and replaced with a permanent memorial . The decision was made by family representatives, locals, pastors and elders from the Torres Strait Island community . Thaiday's lawyer Steve Macfarlane says she is still in Cairns Base Hospital under police guard . Magistrate Alan Comans adjourned the case until January 30 and dismissed the request for it to be referred to the Mental Health Court, saying: 'No, there is no need.' 'Until she's finished her treatment and police have finished their investigation there's not a lot that can be done,' Mr Macfarlane said. Thaiday's lawyer also confirmed the alleged murderer has had visitors to her bedside. 'I'm aware that she has been visited by some people but how close a family member they are and how many people I am not aware of,' Mr Macfarlane said. As police try and determine what could have driven Thaiday to allegedly murder the children new details have emerged regarding her troubled past and recent erratic behaviour. Neighbours have told how she reportedly ran through the streets on Thursday night screaming 'Don't let them take them away from us. God bless us. Forgive me for what I'll do'. A local told The Courier Mail that after recently finding God, Thaiday believed mobile phones were 'the work of the devil'. A mourner attends a floral tribute near the house in which eight children were stabbed to death . While the house remains a crime scene, mourners continue to lay tributes at the base of a fig tree in the park . The Australian reported Thaiday's, whose nine children had five different fathers, struggled to find a stable home after falling pregnant at 14 and was allegedly attacked with a hammer a decade ago. An uncle of the eight children said Thaiday had begun expressing increased religious devotion, attending St Margaret's Anglican Church in Westcourt every Sunday for the month leading up to the alleged mass murder. 'She had this church DVD she was always watching. She'd started preaching to me in the last week or so. Always talking about God,' he said. More neighbours revealed Thaiday was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found. Senior investigators refused to rule out the possibility that drugs were a factor in Thaiday's behaviour. Shortly after she gave birth to her first child she moved into cramped public housing in Manoora and was shunted between houses as her family grew, The Australian reported. Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday is pictured being taken away by paramedics from her Cairns home on Friday . Suggestions for the permanent memorial at 34 Murray Street, Manoora (pictured), will include extending the park to include the property's land . Police continue to collect evidence at the Murray Street home in Manoora - 4km away from Cairns . Anna Jackson, who has known Thaiday for more than 20 years, said she had been abused by a former partner, who allegedly bashed her on the head with a hammer. Less than a week ago, one of the children's fathers moved out of the home they shared after the children's uncle reported hearing fighting. 'He's been heard shouting at her that if she didn't stop, he was leaving. And then he did, moving into a house with other relatives,' he said. 'The dad wanted to take the kids up to Bamaga. That's what he told me he was doing, he'd been talking about it for six weeks.' On Monday, it was also revealed the Cairns house in which eight children were murdered last week, will be demolished and replaced with a permanent memorial. Member of Parliament Gavin King said the fate of the public housing home at 34 Murray Street, Manoora was decided upon by family representatives, locals, pastors and elders from the Torres Strait Island community.

Children sit next to a tribute adjacent to the house . 'It's the right thing to do going forward to help with the grieving process,' Mr King said. 'It certainly won't be the State Government coming in over the top and deciding what that will look like, or indeed the timing,' he added of the future memorial. While the house remains a crimes scene since the bodies were found on Friday, mourning friends and family continue to lay their tributes at a fig tree in a nearby park. One of the ideas being circulated for the memorial is for the park to be extended to include the property's land. Police are still unable to set a time frame to when their investigations will finish and when the memorial will subsequently be built. 'We are not even a tenth of the way through. There is a lot more work to be done and we will just keep doing it,' Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar told the ABC of the ongoing investigation. Mr Asnicar said that hundreds of witnesses had already submitted statements to police, with more expected in the coming week. A child leaves a touching card to those killed saying 'life is waiting ahead' A banner on the floor by a makeshift memorial says 'gone too soon RIP' Plans are being made for funerals for the children however no date has been set. At the house there were heartbreaking scenes as family members made their way up to a willow tree where tributes have been left for the young alleged victims. The maternal grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!' She was supported by other family members as she wailed, her eyes closed in raw grief as she clutched a small white towel to her face to wipe away her tears. Several men carried one of the fathers to the scene where he sat on a seat - weak and inconsolable. He was frail and unable to hold his own body up as he screamed his children's names into the sky in a hoarse voice. The father of the youngest four children was carried to add flowers to the tribute, collapsing on the floor and beating the ground at the foot of the tree. 'Raiden', 'Rodney', 'Azza' and 'baby girl', the father screamed over and over again in a rasping voice, while sobbing uncontrollably. Detective Inspector Bruno Ansicar told reporters on Sunday the horrific scene was taking its toll on police. 'It's clearly the most tragic event we've had to deal with (in Cairns),' Insp Ansicar told reporters. Vigils and memorials for the slain children, who ranged in age from two to 14, were held throughout Queensland on Sunday. Townsville and the Brisbane suburb of Inala also hosted memorials.

"Terrified of water and screaming at the sound of rain, they were just some of the thousands of children whose lives were devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami. Crammed into tents, many were mute and in shock after losing their entire families and seeing their villages flattened and flooded. For Nizma Scoffield there was only one option, to set up an orphanage to give as many children as possible, marooned by the tsunami and without any relatives, a home. Nizma Scoffield (right) has helped raise 100 orphans who lost all their families after the Boxing Day tsunami in Indonesia 10 years ago, including Nina (left) who was just 10 when she lost her mother to the devastation . Mrs Scoffield (top left) has helped dozens of children at the orphanage in Paroy village in Lhoong . Ten years on the British charity worker is celebrating helping raise more than 100 children through the orphanage, who have gone on from the crisis to work, study at university and get married. 'There were too many orphans when the tsunami happened, too many children with no parents - that's why we decided to set up the orphanage,' said Mrs Scoffield. Mrs Scoffield, who was born in Indonesia and has two children, came to London 34 years ago and married an Englishman. But after she saw what had happened on Boxing Day in Indonesia she decided to fly there to help. She was able to get a flight three weeks after the disaster and set up Chariots for Children to help orphans, with the help of British donations. The orphanage she set up, located in Paroy village, Lhoong on the Aceh coast of Indonesia, initially housed 50 children who lost their families in the catastrophe and has gone on to give a home to more in the 10 years since the crisis. The British charity worker flew out to Indonesia three weeks after the tsunami to help the orphaned children . The tsunami flattened homes and communities in Indonesia and left 30,000 children completely orphaned . When she arrived in Indonesia Mrs Scoffield was greeted by dead bodies piled next to rubble and others hanging from the trees - making it impossible to navigate roads by motorbike. The charity worker visited tents packed with orphans severely traumatised by the tsunami and with nobody to look after them. 'It was devastating - I could not even cry the first time I got there, the destruction and the damage was massive,' she said. 'We tried to entertain them by singing together, drawing and giving them presents and books - when I heard them laugh it nearly broke my heart. Nina, who lost her mother, is pictured by the water in 2011 and is now at university studying psychology . The orphanage initially gave homes to 50 children orphaned by the crisis and has taken more in the 10 years . Dozens of children like these boys were given a stable home at the orphanage after losing all their relatives . 'We went to find girls and boys, they were all mixed up and some of them wouldn't speak. 'We chose those that didn't have family left, that really needed our help, we heard some of them scream at night.' Mrs Scoffield moved 30 boys and 20 girls into a rented house while she searched for land to build them a home. 'The children were scared by water and the sound of rain and had nightmares when they slept,' she added. The orphanage is nestled between two hills and only accessible by motorbike. It cost around £3,000 to buy 8,000 square meters of land in the hills above the coast and another £85,000 to build the orphanage that stands there today. The funds were mostly raised from communities in England who donated after they saw the devastation left in the wake of the tsunami. Nizma, pictured second from left during a visit in 2011, admits it is hard to keep in touch with all the children . Mrs Scoffield set up Chariots 4 Children in the wake of the Boxing Day tsunami and it still operates today . The charity worker hopes to continue her work and run the orphanage as a campus where children can study . Mrs Scoffield added: 'We went to Lhoong because it was cut off, we tried by motorbike but there was dead bodies hanging from trees so we went by boat. 'I would travel back from Asia to talk about Indonesia and the children there and to raise more money to build the children a home, and to keep them clothed and fed.' Ten years later the orphans have grown up to lead successful lives. The men have become teachers and businessmen and the girls have got married and are studying at college. Mrs Scoffield has lost contact with many of the children she has helped over the years, but has managed to keep in touch with a few. The oprhanage is located in Paroy Village in Lhoong and initially had 30 boys and 20 girls staying there . It cost around £3,000 to buy the land needed for the orphanage and about £85,000 to develop the building . Much of the funds raised for the orphanage building to give children a home came from British donations . The view from the village in Paray in Indonesia was a lot calmer in 2011 than after the tsunami in 2004 . One of these children is Nina. She was was just ten years old when, clinging to a coconut tree, she watched as her mother was swept away by the tsunami. Rescued and taken in by the Chariots for Children team, Nina spent her teenage years at the orphanage and is now studying at university. Nina now lives in the regional capital of Aceh - but is still terrified by earthquakes and the mention of death. Mrs Scoffield said: 'When I saw her again I just stared at her with amazement, she looks so grown up and tall, I just wanted to hug and kiss her. Mrs Scoffield has spoken of her pride in raising more than 100 children in the Indonesian orphanage . 'Nina loves maths, physics and chemistry, as well as economics and religious studies. 'She tells me she wants to become a psychologist, to better help her people in the future.' Mrs Scoffield, from Bromley in London is now raising funds for a new generation of homeless children in Indonesia who she visits every six months. The home runs off donations of around £600 a month - which provides food, shelter and tuition for the Indonesian orphans. The children, most of whom were victims of recent conflict in the country - are taught the national curriculum, play football and practice martial arts. She said: 'Over the past ten years everything has changed, the US aid came and re-built the road, the houses that were destroyed have been rebuilt and people have started working and trading again. 'Some of the orphanages are empty now, the funding has decreased so much that charities can't afford to run them. 'We would love to invite more children to study there and give them a good future - we would like to be a campus for young people to come and study.'","Nizma Scoffield flew out to Indonesia after learning of Boxing Day tsunami .

"These shocking pictures reveal the filthy conditions at an 'exclusive' wedding venue which has been ordered to pay more than £60,000 for breaching food hygiene and safety laws. Davenport Green Hall in Altrincham, Manchester, charges £14,500 for a couple's big day and has even been featured on Celebrity Four Weddings for glamour model Michelle Marsh's reception. But bosses have been fined £39,000 plus £21,500 in costs after investigators found the kitchen in a 'shocking' state and said routine cleaning had been 'inadequate'. Prohibition notices were also served for serious health and safety breaches concerning the gas, electricity and the slippery kitchen floor. Davenport Green Hall  has been ordered to pay more than £60,000 for breaching food hygiene and safety laws . Investigators found the kitchen in a 'shocking' state and said routine cleaning had been 'inadequate' A wedding guest tipped-off environmental health officers after a reception at the venue. And when officers arrived unannounced in August last year, they found the marquee kitchen and tented areas at the hall were in a very poor structural condition. They also noted that staff were not trained properly, there was no hand washing facilities, the drains were blocked and rubbish was not being thrown away quickly enough. Owner Mohammed Isaq has now been banned from running any food business until further notice. Davenport Green Hall Ltd pleaded guilty to ten food hygiene and two health and safety offences at Trafford Magistrates' Court. The company agreed to voluntarily close the marquee after environmental officers first visited in August 2013 and said it would not re-open until improvements had been made. The hotel in Altrincham, Manchester, charges £14,500 for a couple's big day and has even been featured on Celebrity Four Weddings for glamour model Michelle Marsh's reception . Prohibition notices were served for serious health and safety breaches concerning the gas, electricity and the slippery kitchen floor . These included supplying hot and cold water to the sinks, fitting a hand basin and cleaning and disinfecting the kitchens. But even after these initial improvements, follow-up visits revealed that hygiene standards had deteriorated once again. Officers then served six hygiene improvement notices for the lack of training, lack of food safety management systems, poor refuse storage and lack of pest control. Bosses describe the privately owned Grade II listed historical estate as Cheshire's 'Jewell in the Crown' on their Facebook page. 'Be prepared to be shocked from the moment you enter this magnificent venue and the dream commences,' it said on their website. Their Ultimate Bespoke Diamond Wedding Package costs £14,500 for 80 guests in 2016. Bosses describe the privately owned Grade II listed historical estate as Cheshire's 'Jewell in the Crown' on their Facebook page . Owner Mohammed Isaq has now been banned from running any food business until further notice . Trafford council's executive member for environment and operations, Councillor John Reilly, said: 'A wedding is one of the most important days in people's lives and couples will often spend a large amount of money to ensure that they have the perfect day. 'When people eat out they will expect, as a minimum, that their food is prepared in hygienic, well-managed kitchens. The fact that these poor standards of hygiene and safety were found at a wedding venue is particularly shocking. 'We expect all food businesses to take food hygiene and health and safety very seriously, to do everything they can to protect their customers from food poisoning and to ensure the safety of their staff and visitors. 'We will work with businesses to help them improve and maintain standards, but we will not hesitate in taking formal action against those who put the public or their employees at risk.' Davenport Green Hall was not available for a comment.","Davenport Green Hall has been fined £40k for hygiene and safety breaches .

"Phebe Hilliage avoided having her foot amputated because she was wearing Doc Martens after a car ran over her foot at a zebra crossing in Birmingham . A 12-year-old girl who was knocked over on a zebra crossing by a hit and run driver has avoided having her foot amputated because she was wearing Doc Martens - rather than her school shoes which had a hole in - when she was hit. Phebe Hilliage was left with a broken right ankle and shattered foot after a car ploughed into her in Birmingham, West Midlands as she walked to school. But the girl escaped having to have her foot amputated because she was wearing her  sturdy Doc Martens when the driver drove right over her foot. The driver of the red car, who sped off leaving the child lying in the road, has still not been identified. Lucy Hilliage, Phebe's mother, said: 'We're so lucky that Phebe wasn't in her normal school shoes as the car went right over her foot. 'The doctors said the injuries would have been so bad they would have had to amputate the foot. 'It's completely changed her outlook on life, she's not the free spirit she was before the accident. 'What makes it worse is the driver didn't even stop. 'They just left her lying in the middle of the road - it's sickening. 'They could have kids themselves and imagine if that had happened to them. 'They need to come forward and give Phebe some respite.' The 12-year-old has been told she will be in a cast for months and will not be able to go to go to Swanhurst School for more than a month because of her injuries. She has already had surgery on her foot but her mother said they will not know until the New Year whether it has been successful. 'The doctors can't be sure whether the initial surgery has been a success,' added Ms Hillage. 'She'll definitely need extensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation and the injuries have changed her life no matter what. Scroll down for video . 'The damage to the nerves could have affected her balance for life.' West Midlands Police decided to release footage of the hit and run in the hope that someone might recognise the car so they could trace the driver of the car. The footage was captured by an on-board camera on a bus, which had been overtaken by the red car shortly before the girl was hit at about 7.30am on November 21 in Vicarage Road in Kings Heath, Birmingham. The 12 year-old girl can be seen in the footage walking across the road at the zebra crossing before she is hit . A red car is clearly shown overtaking at speed, but the vehicle and driver have never been traced. Phebe said: 'I was halfway across when this car overtook the bus and two cars which had stopped and ran over my foot. 'I dropped to the floor and felt like I was in a dream - I was confused and didn't know what was happening. 'The driver has ruined Christmas for me. 'I'd planned to go out and see friends but now I'm stuck in the house because of this accident. The 12-year-old has been left with her leg in plaster and unable to go to school for the next month . Lucy Hilliage (left) said medics told her the shoes Phebe (right) was wearing saved her foot from amputation . 'If I could say anything to them I'd say 'you're an idiot, a stupid person who needs to learn to drive safely'.' She was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where doctors had to remove shattered bones from her foot and put her right ankle in a cast. PC Laura Loy, from the West Midlands Police Road Traffic Investigation Unit, said: 'Despite the collision being captured by the camera, we have been unable to identify what the unknown car is. 'The collision took place at a busy time in the morning and there were lots of people around who may have seen what happened or be able to tell us what the car is.'","Phebe Hilliage, 12, was knocked down on a zebra crossing in Birmingham .

"The drug addict parents of a toddler who was punched, kicked or stamped causing massive internal injuries that led to his death have been jailed. Levi-Blu Cassin was found unconscious at his home in Chelmsey Wood in Birmingham in February last year. His mother Danielle Cassin, 27, and father Mark Piper, 31, were today both given nine-year-prison terms for allowing his death. The pair had both blamed each other for the youngster's injuries. The parents of Levi-Blu Cassin, Danielle Cassin (left) and Mark Piper (right) have been jailed for nine years each for causing or allowing the 22-month-old's death after he died following massive internal injuries . Both were cleared of murder and manslaughter following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, but were found guilty of causing or allowing his death and jailed for nine years each. After the case his grandmother branded the sentence 'disgusting' for a child's life. Mr Justice Goss said it was most likely that Levi Blu suffered his injuries as he lay against a hard surface and his organs were 'compressed'. This would have been caused by punches, kicks, or stamps  with 'very significant force required.' He branded the couple 'selfish, neglectful and manipulative'. The trial previously heard that his small intestine had been split in two. During the trial the court heard that Cassin had been in touch with social workers before the birth of her son and a child protection agreement was put in place to keep Levi-Blu safe. This meant Piper, of no fixed address, was banned from staying at the flat they shared in Chelmsey Wood. Levi-Blu suffered injuries  likely to have been caused by him being kicked, punched or stamped on . However the pair flouted the rules, with Piper hiding behind a mattress when social workers carried out inspections. A serious case review will be carried out by Solihull Local Safeguarding Children Board to discover if there were failings leading to Levi-Blu's death. The court also heard that Cassin, of  Chelmsley Wood, smoked Class A drugs in her son's presence and would take him to crack dens for hours at a time. Mr Justice Goss said she had put drugs above her son and concealed violence in her relationship and 'chose to permit Levi to be exposed to all the attendant risks.' Piper, of no fixed address, faced allegations he beat two of his other sons and regularly battered Cassin at the flat they shared in Smiths Wood, Solihull. Timothy Raggatt QC, prosecuting, read a victim impact statement from Levi's grandmother Angela Cassin. She said the child was 'utterly defenceless' in the hands of those she thought would care for him. Mr Raggatt added: 'There is a great and continuing sense of loss for the little boy.' Cassin, who wept in the dock, had no previous convictions. Piper had convictions related to drugs and robbery in 2001. He had also previously been convicted for possessing cocaine and cannabis as well as a bladed article. Danielle Cassin, pictured with her son, would take him to crack dens and smoke class A drugs around him . Mark Piper, 31, was accused during the trial in Birmingham of battering two of his other sons and Cassin . In 1999 he was convicted of possessing a bladed article. Christopher Millington QC, defending Cassin, said she had written a letter to the judge speaking of a 'lifetime of regret.' Piper was also said to have written a letter. The judge said Piper would rather play on his Playstation than care for his son. Speaking outside court Levi's grandmother, Angela Cassin, told the BBC: 'Nine years for a baby's life - that's absolutely disgusting. 'It's not justice - we don't even know what happened to him.'","Toddler Levi Blu-Cassin died after being stamped on, kicked or punched .

"Vile: Douglas Slade was warned he faced 40 years in jail over child abuse but boasted that he would pay to get case dropped . A notorious British paedophile has built a house in the Philippines overlooking an elementary school and allegedly lures pupils as young as eight into his home where he abuses them for the price of a pair of flip-flops. Wealthy Douglas Slade, 73 – a founder of the vilified Paedophile Information Exchange which campaigned for child sex in the 1970s – has been repeatedly arrested for taking nude photos and molesting underage boys in the Philippines. But despite being on bail for cases involving pupils from the Amsic Elementary School in Angeles City, he continues to take pupils into his home, paying them the equivalent of two pounds a time for sex acts and photos, neighbours told the Mail Online. Widower Slade, who grew rich from a food business he set up after moving to the Philippines in 1985, donates money to the school which claims it has received no complaints about him from parents – even though its pupils are among his alleged victims. He has repeatedly had child sex charges against him dropped and was caught on camera in an ITV documentary in 1995 boasting that he could bribe prosecutors and the families of victims to avoid being convicted. Since then, Slade – originally from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire – has built a new home overlooking a school for eight-to-12-year-olds where he is accused of committing multiple assaults on boys from the poor neighbourhood teeming with young children behind his house. Boys as young as eight line up outside his house to be invited in by Slade who takes nude photos of them and gets them to perform sex acts on him for 150 pesos, say neighbours – the price of a pair of the ubiquitous flip-flops worn by nearly every boy in the Philippines. 'The boys sit on his doorstep after school,' said 17-year-old Angelica Alcantara, who lives near Slade's home, and says he has resumed inviting boys in since his arrest. 'He comes out and picks the ones he wants to come in and they go inside. 'He pays them to pose naked for pictures and to do other things for him. Afterwards he gives them 150 pesos (£2) and sends them home. He only picks boys. He never invites girls inside, even though they ask sometimes because they want the money.' Danger: Douglas Slade has built a house directly opposite a primary school in Angeles City, pictured above. MailOnline has been told that he is preying on children at the school and paying £2 for 'sex acts' Predator: Paedophile Douglas Slade was confronted by MailOnline about his interest in the primary school opposite but claimed he was being set up and claimed 'someone wants me out of the country' Peeping Tom: Douglas Slade has built a house with a view directly into the primary school opposite and is said to be paying children £2 for 'sex acts' Hiding: The 73-year-old spends time on his balcony gazing into the primary school opposite, where he also donates money despite facing repeated accusations of molesting children . Randy Antedo, 38, said he moved his family from the neighbourhood to a new home around mile away when he discovered his eight-year-old son Christian had been going into Slade's house with a friend, also aged eight, last year. 'I am angry – a lot of people here are angry because of what he has been doing' said father-of-five Mr Antedo, who said he felt powerless to do anything because of Slade's wealth. 'A lot of kids have been going into his house and he gives them money to buy flip-flops after. We don't know what went on inside with our son, but we are very concerned and we moved away because we wanted to protect our children.' Slade made headlines in the 1970s when he was a founder of the Paedophile Information Exchange and ran another underground group called Paedophile Action Liberation which campaigned to legalise child sex. He fled Britain after being exposed as a paedophilia advocate in 1975 and being caught by a national newspaper telling fellow deviants: 'If you want sex with children don't bottle it up – do it.' Bribe: Douglas Slade has been faced with charges before but boasted that he would pay to have them dropped. He is currently on bail for child abuse and under investigation for possessing child porn, police say . Exposed: As far back as 1975 Douglas Slade was revealed to be a supporter of sex with children but fled Britain after he was caught on tape boasting that people should just have sex with minors if they wanted . No shame: When confronted by MailOnline Douglas Slade said 'There have been five cases (against me) in four years. They've all been dismissed. Somebody is trying to f***ing get rid of me' In 1995, he was warned he faced up to 40 years jail after being arrested at his previous home in Angeles City for allegedly molesting three boys aged 12 and 13. He denied the charges, claiming he had only given the boys 'grandfatherly kisses'. The charges were dropped after Slade boasted on camera how he could pay off the prosecutor or pay the children's families to drop the charges in return for money. He said his lawyer would discuss terms with the families 'like Michael Jackson discussed terms'. He was arrested again in 2006 when he was allegedly caught with naked boys in the swimming pool of his previous home. Charges were also dropped. In March 2013, Slade – who claims to have once been a chef on the Royal Yacht Britannia and now runs a food business called Home Base – was arrested over similar accusations by two 14-year-old boys but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence. In his submission to the court, Slade claimed he suffered from diabetes, took insulin injections three times a day and had not had sex for almost a decade. He said he was physically incapable of the sex acts he was alleged to have indulged in with the boys. Then in July this year, Slade was arrested when he sent his laptop for repairs and a technician found images of naked children on it believed to be from the school opposite his home and reported him to the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation. He was charged with having child pornography and three boys aged 14 and 15 then came forward to report him for abuse. Slade is currently on bail for child abuse and under investigation for possessing child porn, police say. Shouting from his balcony overlooking the school, Slade refused to meet with a Mail Online reporter but claimed the charges against him were concocted and said one of them had been dismissed – apparently referring to child pornography case. Standing guard: The entrance to Douglas Slade's imposing house in Angeles City is watched by a domestic staff member but the 73-year-old invites young boys in and offers them money . Offered money: Angelica Alcantara, centre, who is not a victim of abuse but whose parents gave permission for her to talk to MailOnline and be pictured, said: 'The boys sit on his doorstep after school. He comes out and picks the ones he wants to come in and they go inside'. These children live in the neighbourhood in Angeles City, the Philippines, and their parents were happy for them to be photographed to highlight the dangers posed by Mr Slade but they are not victims . Slade obtained a court ruling that the evidence taken from his computer was stolen and inadmissible but that ruling is being challenged by prosecutors, Mail Online has been told. 'There have been five cases (against me) in four years,' Slade shouted. 'They've all been dismissed. Somebody is trying to f***ing get rid of me.' Asked why, Slade replied: 'If I knew that I'd be as smart as you are.' He refused to discuss the cases saying: 'It's over now. The more I say the worse it gets … Nothing good ever comes of talking to journalists. I've been bothered by a*******s like you for 35 years.' When Mail Online took his photograph, he got up off his chair and bolted inside, bellowing furiously: 'I don't want my picture in the papers. I'm 73 years old. You're an evil b*****d.' The following morning, the deputy principal at Amsic Elementary School, who asked not to be named, confirmed to Mail Online that Slade was a benefactor but declined to say how much money he had donated. 'Mr Slade is one of our stakeholders and is helping our school. He has been living opposite us for about 10 years now and one of the things he has done is donate some materials for our computer room,' she said. Asked if she was aware of the accusations against him, she said she was aware of the reports of his arrest but said: 'In our school we have no received any complaints (about him).' 'We thought the case was already closed because he was released by the police and he is back at his house.' Mail Online has passed on the information it gathered from neighbours and the school to police in the Philippines. · The criminal case against Douglas Slade is being monitored by two-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Father Shay Cullen who runs a charity in the Philippines called the Preda Foundation, helping victims of child sex abuse and trafficking.

"Republican Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio's row over the resuscitation of relations with Cuba has continued to escalate, with the Florida lawmaker now calling Paul the 'chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy' and the Kentucky legislator accusing his colleague of funding the Muslim Brotherhood. Paul's latest attack on Rubio, a possible opponent in the GOP's 2016 presidential primary, relates to ongoing monetary aid to Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood once held sway over the government but was banned from participating in politics earlier this year due to its terrorist ties. In a tweet trolling Rubio, the libertarian lawmaker said he 'forgot to mention his support for Obama's funding of Musl. Brotherhood, arming Islamic rebels, and Hillary's war in Libya.' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are feuding over President Barack Obama's announcement last week that the U.S. had resumed high-level diplomatic relations with Cuba. The two potential 2016 rivals have been taking public digs at each other for days now - but they swear its not related to the presidential election . After Rubio called Paul the 'chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy,' the Kentucky Sen. directed this tweet at him, accusing him of indirectly funding the Muslim Brotherhood by supporting ongoing aid to Egypt . Freshman Sen. Paul notably opposed legislation this fall to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIS in a ground war. The war-weary lawmaker was also a vocal opponent of the Obama administration's use of airstrikes - without the approval of Congress - during a 2011 military intervention in Libya. Rubio voted in favor of a resolution backed by the Obama administration to fund the Syrian opposition movement and urged Congress in 2011 to give Obama the authority to bomb former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and his regime. Paul's hard-hitting tweet to Rubio was the latest jab thrown in a feud between the frenemies that began last week after President Barack Obama suddenly announced that the U.S. and Cuba were back on speaking terms after a 53-year embargo on the country. The Kentucky senator said that lifting the unilateral embargo was 'probably a good idea' because it 'doesn’t seem to be working.' 'Probably, it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship,' he contended. Rubio, whose parents immigrated from communist Cuba,then asserted that Paul 'has no idea what he’s talking about.' Since the president made public his administration's secret talks with Cuba, which took place throughout the fall, Rubio has become the face of the GOP opposition to normalization of diplomatic relations with the country and its president, Raul Castro. 'I would expect that people would understand that if they just took a moment to analyze that, they would realize that the embargo is not what's hurting the Cuban people,' he said last week on Fox in response to Paul's support for the move. 'It's the lack of freedom and the lack of competent leaders.' In the pages of the Wall Street Journal, Rubio called the declaration 'a victory for oppressive governments the world over' and a policy shift that is based on a 'lie.' 'Cuba already enjoys access to commerce, money and goods from other nations, and yet the Cuban people are still not free,' he argued. 'They are not free because the regime—just as it does with every aspect of life—manipulates and controls to its own advantage all currency that flows into the island. More economic engagement with the U.S. means that the regime’s grip on power will be strengthened for decades to come—dashing the Cuban people’s hopes for freedom and democracy.' Smackdown: Paul trolled Rubio with the above tweet in response to his claim that his colleague 'has no idea what he’s talking about' when it comes to Cuba . Laying out his own views on the issue in Time, Paul made clear on Friday in an op-ed that his family 'despised, not only communism, but collectivism, socialism and any “ism” that deprived the individual of his or her natural rights.' 'I ran for office to fight for the individual and against statism of any kind anywhere and yet… I think a policy of isolationism toward Cuba is misplaced and hasn’t worked,' he said. Paul explained that he supports engagement with 'many countries with less than stellar human rights records, because I believe that once enslaved people taste freedom and see the products of capitalism they will become hungry for freedom themselves.' Furthermore, 'it is an inconsistent and incoherent position to support trade with other communist countries, but not communist Cuba,' he wrote, pointing out that the U.S. does not prohibit trade with China nor has it cut off relations with Russia over the past 70 years. 'Let’s hope cooler heads will ultimately prevail and we unleash a trade tsunami that washes the Castros once and for all into the sea,' he concluded. But in a tweet that afternoon Paul accused Rubio of 'acting like an isolationist who wants to retreat to our borders and perhaps build a moat.' 'I reject this isolationism,' he added. And in a TV appearance  that evening Paul again ripped into Rubio and derided his retaliatory comments as 'a little bit rude and intemperate.' Defending himself, Paul told Fox News host Shannon Bream that he's not responsible for beginning the dispute, however. Rubio is to blame for that, he said. 'I never start a fight, but I'm happy to finish a fight,' he stated. Paul also denied that the squabble was related to either man's political aspirations. 'I think it's about the issues, I don't think that there's any certainty that either one of us will run at this point,' he said. He added, 'It's also about a fellow Republican who chose to, I think, use rude and inappropriate language with regard to a fellow Republican, and I think that...I won't stand for it, frankly. 'And if someone's gonna cast aspersions on me, and not talk about policy, then there will be an altercation. And I won't shy away from a battle, and I think that I've shown that.' Rubio, whose parents immigrated from communist Cuba, has become the face of the GOP opposition to normalization of diplomatic relations with the country and its president, Raul Castro. He is pictured here last Wednesday at a press conference in Miami, where he spoke out against the policy shift . Not one to walk away from a fight himself, Rubio said Sunday that if Paul 'wants to become the chief cheerleader of Obama's foreign policy, he certainly has a right to do that. 'I'm going to continue to oppose the...Obama-Paul foreign policy on Cuba because I know it won't lead to freedom and liberty for the Cuban people, which is my sole interest here,' he argued. He later stated, in response to a question about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's candidacy for president, that his own decision in 2016 won't be based on 'anyone else who would decide to run.' 'If someone makes the decision that the best place for them to serve their country, the best place for them to achieve, in my case, an agenda to restore the American dream, if I make the decision that the best place for me to do that is the presidency, then I'm going to run for president,' he said. The Florida senator followed up his remarks with, 'I haven't made that decision yet.' A staffer for Paul responded to Rubio's attacks on his boss by bringing attention to Rubio's views on arming Syrian rebels, striking Libya and giving aid to Egypt. 'With all due respect, Senator Marco Rubio was captain of the GOP cheerleading team for Obama’s arming of Syrian rebels, bombing Libya resulting in a jihadist wonderland, and illegally giving foreign aid to Egypt’s military government,' Paul aide Doug Stafford said in a statement. 'The Rubio-Obama foreign policy has made the Middle East and North Africa less safe,' he said, echoing Paul's comments on twitter.","Feud began after Rubio hit Paul for supporting President Barack Obama's decision to resume diplomatic relations with Cuba .

"A spurned receptionist knocked an Indian doctor unconscious because he 'lied when he promised to marry her'. Vasundhara Sharma, 27, slapped and punched the doctor repeatedly in his surgery, ripping off his clothes and leaving him apparently unconscious - before she was eventually dragged off by security. And even his own employees did not save him from a 30-minute ordeal, where she slapped him more than 70 times, because they believed it to be a private matter. Scroll down for video . Vasundhara Sharma, 27, slapped and punched the doctor, named as Dr Arpit Chopra, in his surgery . CCTV footage shows her ripping off his clothes and leaving him apparently unconscious - before she was eventually dragged off by security . They eventually called police to the clinic in Indore, in Madhya Pradesh, India. The incident occurred at the end of October - but the doctor, named as Dr Arpit Chopra, reported it two weeks later. He insisted the delay had been as a result of his injuries and not because he was trying to avoid a scandal. A preliminary investigation the woman had worked for Dr Chopra, who specialised in homoeopathic medicine. She alleged that she had started a relationship with him after working at the clinic for three months in 2012. Even his own employees did not save him from a 30-minute ordeal, where she slapped him more than 70 times, because they believed it to be a private matter . The receptionist alleges she began a relationship with Dr Chopra and he reneged on a promise to marry her . And her father has said she should be acquitted because the doctor had lied to his daughter and reneged on a promise to marry her. In India, it is, in some cases, regarded as a criminal offence to promise to marry a woman in order to start a relationship and then to break it. Because the woman's consent to a sexual relationship was based on the promise of marriage, if the promise was a lie it means consent was never really given. Therefore it has, in the past, sometimes been classified as rape. But Dr Chopra claims the woman was delusional and although he had employed her for three months, he dismissed her when she tried to form a relationship with him. A police spokesman said: 'A woman has lodged a sexual harassment case against a doctor and he in turn has lodged an assault case. 'We will investigate the matter thoroughly and take appropriate action whosoever is found guilty.' Eventually, the doctor's staff called the police who dragged the woman away from the apparently unconscious doctor .","Vasundhara Sharma, 27, slapped and punched the doctor in Indore, India .

"It's been a whirlwind year for White Dee who shot to stardom after sharing her financial woes on the Channel 4 documentary series Benefits Street. And following a string of celebrity appearances and television interviews, it seems the 42-year-old is sharing the good fortune afforded to her sudden celebrity. Dee, whose real name is Deidre Kelly, was seen splurging on some last-minute Christmas gifts in her native Birmingham today. Scroll down for video . White Dee was spotted doing some last minute shopping in Birmingham where she picked up a Christmas tree, WiiFit and some shoes from designer Jimmy Choo . The mother-of-two was laden down with items as she shopped in a comfortable, festive outfit in Birmingham . Laden down with expensive goods such as a WiiFit, the mother-of-two sported a Santa hat for the occasion and was seen chatting with local shopkeepers. It comes after the star accused producers of the controversial Channel 4 documentary series of lying to participants before it was aired. Describing the situation as 'a catch-22', Dee told her local newspaper, the Birmingham Mail: 'I am still adamant I can never forgive the makers of Benefits Street, but it is a Catch 22 situation.

Fair Oak Academy is hoping it will go viral and help raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust in memory of Stephen Sutton, who died in May this year. Mr Sutton's story attracted worldwide attention when the 19-year-old from Burntwood, Staffordshire, became a sensation for his upbeat attitude and refusal to give up after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Rachael Sandham, director of design at the school and producer of the video, said: 'For the past few years we have done one of these Christmas videos and they are so much fun for parents and pupils, as well as staff. Teacher Phil Yeomans as Miley Cyrus for the 'Wrecking Ball' clip, which sees him swinging from gym ropes . The video parodies this year's biggest  videos - including the Monty the Penguin advert from John Lewis . 'For the previous videos we did struggle to get all the staff together but when we decided to do it in memory of Stephen they all rallied around and gave up their own time after school to help. 'A lady in our finance office has a daughter who was at the same school in the same year as Stephen so we had that connection to him. 'The video has given everyone such a morale boost. 'It has taken about three weeks to put together. By the time I finished filming we had about seven hours of footage to condense down to about seven minutes. 'I just really hope it raises awareness and money so we can give something back. 'My favourite bit is probably the wrecking ball clip. The teacher, Phil Yeomans, is such a character, and it took someone like him to pull off that outrageous scene. 'Principal Mr Powell is leaving after this term and he was such a good sport, he got very involved and it was a lot of fun. The video was only uploaded on Friday evening and has already received 2,500 views on YouTube . The video starts with school principal David Powell watching Christmas videos  while indulging in mulled wine . 'We plan to do it every year, and give one student a chance to appear in the video with the teachers. 'This time we had Cole Parker get involved as a reward for his exceptional performance this year. He stars as the little boy in our version of the John Lewis advert with the penguin.' The video starts by showing school principal David Powell sitting in his office watching Christmas videos on the TV while helping himself to several glasses of mulled wine. As he changes channel, different scenes are re-created  as parodies of this year's most popular songs. The first is a re-make of this year's John Lewis Christmas advert, with a human-sized penguin co-starring with 11-year-old pupil, Cole. Then after a channel switch Mr Yeomans, performs an exuberant interpretation of Miley Cyrus's 'Wrecking Ball' video. Next, several teachers mime into a microphone to parody the Band Aid music video from the 1980s, while  'Do They Know It's Christmas?' plays in the background. After that, a rendition of 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams is filmed around the school campus. Then finally, staff dress up in ballet costumes and gangster gear to poke fun at the Taylor Swift music video for 'Shake It Off'. The footage ends with a cleaner coming into Mr Powell's office, where he has fallen asleep having finished off his bottle of mulled wine. A teacher mimes into a microphone to 1980s Band Aid hit  'Do They Know It's Christmas?' for the video . Staff dress up in ballet costumes to poke fun of the Taylor Swift music video for Shake It Off . Miss Sandham added: 'The staff were so supportive and the Sutton family have given it their blessing. 'We were so happy to do it in memory of Stephen because his is such an amazing story, it is hard to imagine what he went through and yet he never gave up. 'We did it so we are able to show the pupils the importance of never giving up and what they are able to do when they put their minds to something.' Fair Oak Academy is a senior school which caters for 832 boys and girls from the age of 11 to 18, and received a rating of 'Good' at its last Ofsted inspection in 2013. Mr Powell, who retired on Friday after two years in charge at the academy said: 'It was brilliant and it was for a good cause. 'It's not normal for a principal to dress up in a tutu but I thought I might as well since I was retiring. 'I didn't enjoy the costumes at all but it was all for the greater good. 'I think I sacrificed most of my integrity but it was for a good cause.'

"Hafsa Mohamed, 20, fled to Syria with a friend earlier this month after  a series of internet posts in which she declared that she longed to be in Syria . A Sydney woman, who recently fled to join the Islamic State, wrote of how she yearned to become a jihadi bride and travel to Syria in a series of social media comments posted before she disappeared. Hafsa Mohamed slipped out of the country this month, alongside her 18-year-old friend Hodan Abby,  after the pair told their parents they were going on a holiday, the Daily Telegraph reports. She last contacted her family about one week ago, to tell them she had crossed the Turkish border into Syria. The 20-year-old childcare worker took to the internet to look for a husband that was heading to the Middle East before she disappeared, adding that she longed to be a martyr 'for the sake of Allah'. 'If any mature guy wanting to go to Syria or Palestine would propose I would accept without a thought though he should be on his dean and must have a beard,' Hafsa wrote, according to News Corp. 'Pray that my dream of going to Syria is fulfilled. I want to bring it up with my mum but I'm afraid to do so … Australia is nice but I would rather be in Syria. '… How great to be martyred for the sake of Allah and going into a transaction with him by giving him your life and he will repay you with Jannah.' Scroll down for video . 'How great to be martyred for the sake of Allah and going into a transaction with him by giving him your life and he will repay you with Jannah,' Hafsa wrote. Pictured: An Islamic State of Iraq fighter in the city of Mosul . Hafsa's family last heard from her about one week ago, when she texted them to say she had crossed the Turkish border into Syria. Pictured: Islamic State fighters marching in Raqqa, Syria . She and her friend could face up to 10 years in jail if they try to return to Australia. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop admitted earlier in the month,  that the reports of young Australians travelling overseas to join the Islamic State is a 'deeply disturbing phenomenon', the Sunday Telegraph wrote. 'We are now seeing examples of young women being radicalised and travelling to Syria and Iraq to take part in fighting for listed terrorists organisations,' she said. It came just a day after the father of  Australian jihadist Amira Karroum, who was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in  Syria, said he planned to sue the Australian government for his 'angel's' death. Amira Karroum (pictured) was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in Syria . Educated at an Anglican private school in Queensland, Amira Karroum became a devout Muslim, donning the hijab, after moving to Sydney with her sister in 2011 . During an explosive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, Mohamed Karroum said he blames Australian authorities for his daughter's death because they allowed radical Islamic recruiters into the country and they 'allowed her to leave'. In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum told journalist Lisa Goddard: 'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.' 'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair. 'I want to take the federal government to court; they are responsible for the death of my daughter.' In an interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, a grieving Mohamed Karroum says the Australian government has his daughter's blood on its hands . Amira, 22, described by her father as a 'beautiful girl' who loved barbecues and dancing with her friends, was in war-torn Syria with her new  husband Tyler Perry, also known as Yusef Ali. The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia. Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death. 'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter. Mohamed Karroum says Yusef Ali, a known extremist, 'poisoned' his daughter's mind . One of the posts from Amira's Facebook page, where she said she worked as a 'Slave of Allah' Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities. 'I believe she was sacrificed because they were trying to take somebody to court, and they knew she would lead them to him,' he said. 'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO are not doing their job, this is the fact.' He is now looking for a lawyer to help him take the federal government to court. 'I want an apology, that's number one, for killing my daughter.'","Hafsa Mohamed's family last heard from the 20-year-old a week ago, when she messaged them that she had crossed the Turkish border into Syria .

"A toddler is recovering after having his genitals chopped off as part of a 'sorcery ritual' in India . Shoaib Bali, 3, had been playing in a sugar field in the small village of Peeran Kaliyar in India's northern Uttarakhand state when he was seized by five men who pinned him to the ground and severed his genitals with a rusty razor blade. They then ran off leaving the bleeding youngster to make his way home. His mother Gulshan, 25, who was at home at the time, said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw him coming from the fields.

'There was no sign of them but I found the old shaving razor in a pool of blood. 'We know someone took his vital parts for sorcery. 'They sought out a male child to carry out their heinous act. We are sure of this because his parts are missing.' The boy was rushed to hospital where doctors operated to stem the flow of blood. Paediatric surgeon Madhukar Maletha at the Shri Mahant Indresh Hospital in the nearby town of Patel Nagar said: 'There is no chance of reconstructing the genitals as the degree of injury was too severe. 'We carried out a skin graft to cover the wound and we will now make a urine passage with leftover nerves.' Police say five men have now been arrested. A police spokesman said: 'The men were seen in the vicinity both before and after the incident. 'Two off them are known as self-styled religious healers. 'We are now carrying out investigations and are looking at the theory that this was done for sorcery reasons.'

"Christians and Satanists have erected competing nativity displays on the State House grounds in Lansing, Michigan, for Christmas week. The Detroit chapter of the Satanic Temple set up its 'Snaketivity Scene' featuring a snake offering a book called Revolt Of The Angels as a gift on Sunday. The snake is wrapped around the Satanic cross on the 3-feet-by-3-feet display. Capitol rules require that displays have to be taken down each night. The 'Snaketivity' scene, which features a snake offering a book called Revolt Of The Angels as a gift, is on display on the grounds of the state house grounds in Lansing, Michigan, on Sunday . Satanic Temple spokeswoman Jex Blackmore said her group doesn't worship Satan but does promote individuality, compassion and views that differ from Christian and conservative beliefs. Blackmore told the  Lansing State Journal that the 'holiday season is a time of year that is celebrated in many different ways.' 'Having our government endorse one singular viewpoint or method of celebrating the season is problematic when we have a diverse community of people in Michigan,' she said. Word of the Satanic Temple's plans led state Senator Rick Jones, a Grand Ledge Republican, to erect a Nativity scene on Friday featuring baby Jesus, Joseph and Mary. He put it back up on Sunday morning. A nativity scene is displayed on the State House grounds in Lansing, Michigan: The display was celebrated by speakers at a brief ceremony on Friday as not only a symbol of the season but of a symbol of the right to celebrate that season . Jones said he was happy to 'represent the light and not the darkness.' 'They could have put theirs up in July or April or sometime. They didn't need to put it up in the Christmas season,' Jones said. 'That's OK. We're going to ignore them. I'm not afraid of the snake people. I'm sure that Jesus Christ is not afraid.' Blackmore told MLive.com her group is 'really pleased to be part of what is perhaps a new holiday tradition at the Capitol.' Martin Diller, a 28-year-old who served two tours in Iraq with the Michigan National Guard and one in Afghanistan, visited the Capitol grounds after attending Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in East Lansing. He said he wanted to see how the constitutional rights issue played itself out. 'A few of my friends in the military, we like to see the First Amendment in use,' Diller said. 'We all went overseas, we fought for it, it's kind of interesting to see it in action.","Christians and Satanists have erected competing nativity displays on the State House grounds in Lansing, Michigan, for Christmas .

Khan's brother, Atique Anwar Khan, 34, who controlled and coordinated the distribution of cash into third party bank accounts, was given a six month suspended prison sentence. Another associate, Ajib Khan, 34, who was previously convicted of supplying class A drugs, also admitted laundering money into property. He was given a two year suspended sentence. The NCA said almost £100,000 of cash contaminated with drugs was seized from Ajib's home. NCA branch commander David Norris said Khan had 'presented himself' as a successful and wealthy businessman, when in reality he was the head of a 'large-scale, sophisticated money laundering operation'. Mr Morris said criminal groups relied on people like Khan. He said: 'Organised criminals need people who can launder their cash to make it look legitimate and this group provided that service on an industrial scale.'","Bradford businessman Aqeel Khan's network had £10k of properties .

"The story of two British soldiers gunned down by German snipers on December 25, 1914 during the famous Christmas Day truce has been revealed for the first time since the exchange 100 years ago. While gestures of goodwill spread along the Western Front, the festivities stopped half-a-mile short of where Private Percy Huggins and Sergeant Tom Gregory were on duty in  Rue De Bois, France. The historic ceasefire, which saw men from both sides exchange seasonal greetings and play games of football during the First World War, was shattered by the sound of a sniper's rifle. Private Percy Huggins, left, and Sergeant Tom Gregory, right, were both killed on Christmas Day by German snipers - the same day the famous 'Christmas truce' was declared along the Western Front . Pte Huggins, 23, from the Hertfordshire regiment's D Company, was on sentry duty at a forward listening post just 20 yards from the enemy when he was killed with a single bullet to the head. The shooting enraged his platoon Sergeant Gregory, who demanded he take his place and immediately set about scanning the frost-covered ground before taking the sniper out with a shot. Then as the experienced soldier continued scouring enemy lines he spotted another sniper - but the German marksmen had seen Sgt Gregory, 36, first and in a split-section action shot him dead. The two British men were among the 149 Commonwealth servicemen who lost their lives on December 25, 1914, although many of those died of previously-inflicted wounds. Their story has remained untold, overshadowed by tales of the peaceful Christmas morning shared from both sides of the trenches which has now been retold in a Christmas advert by Sainsburys this year. But their plight has now come to light after the family of Pte Huggins released his letters from the trenches to the Herts at War project, an exhibition to mark the centenary of the outbreak of war. This is the last letter Private Percy Huggins sent to his mother Agnes from the trenches in December 1914 . It was after his family released the letters as part of the centenary that the pair's story has been widely told . The letters prompted researcher Dan Hill to look into the military records and regimental diaries, revealing the full tragic tale. He said: 'There is no doubt that a truce of sorts took place in multiple points along the line of trenches forming in France and Belgium. 'These men did shake hands and exchange gifts and wished each other a Merry Christmas. 'Less than a mile to the north of the Rue De Bois, we know the men of the 1st North Staffordshire Regiment took part in a truce and one also seems to have taken place to the south as well. 'Many men used the pause in fighting as a time to collect and bury the dead that lay about in No Man's land. Gravestones for Private Huggins (left) and Sergeant Gregory (right) which stand in Le Touret, France . Le Touret cemetery in France where Huggins an Gregory are buried, after they were shot by German snipers . This is the original grave of Private Percy Huggins in France. He was stationed just miles from where the famous Christmas truce was being held on the Western Front . This map shows the area where the two soldiers were shot by snipers (circled). They were two of the 149 Commonwealth soldiers to die on Christmas Day . 'The truce probably bypassed the Hertfordshire Regiment because they were with the Guards Brigade who were incredibly professional and were highly unlikely to have fraternised. 'The story of Percy and Tom's tragic demise on that day serves to highlight that December 25, 1914, was just another day on the Western Front for some. 'To think that Mrs Huggins, Mrs Gregory and the mother of one German soldier enjoyed their Christmas at home unaware at that time of what had befallen their sons.' Sgt Gregory, from Watford and a father-of-seven, was a veteran of the Boer War and became a postman before he re-joined the army in 1914. Pte Huggins worked in his family's upholstery business before he joined the army (he is pictured outside) Pte Huggins pictured with his mother Agnes as a baby. His mother did not hear about his death until January . His wife had just given birth to their seventh child when he was killed and she named their daughter Lille after the place where he died. Pte Huggins, from Ware in Hertfordshire, worked in his family's upholstery business before he joined the Hertfordshire Regiment, one of the first Territorial Army units to be called up to the regular army in the First World War. In November 1914 the men joined up with the illustrious Guards Brigade and sailed to France and were soon in action at the first Battle of Ypres. They then left frontline duties for a month's rest before returning to the trenches on the evening of Christmas Eve. Soon afterwards Pte Huggins wrote his last, poignant letter home to his mother, Agnes, a widow bringing up seven children by herself back in England. He thanked her for sending him a Christmas pudding which he explained he would have to eat cold but was still very much looking forward to it. A newspaper reported the shocking news that the pair had been killed on Christmas Day, also nodding towards the 'Christmas Truce' of 1914 . Private Percy Huggin's obituary in a local newspaper notes that he had gone to France in November and was killed in action near Festubert on Christmas Day after being shot through the head by a sniper . Clearly missing his family, he wrote: 'I know you all must miss me and no doubt can to some extent realise what my feelings are for I cannot express them. 'I long for the day when this terrible conflict will be ended. You consider war a terrible thing but imagination cannot reach far enough for the horrors of warfare that can be seen on the battlefield are indescribable and I pray this may be the last war that will ever be.' He explained he was proud to serve his King and country, adding: 'I can only hope by the grace of God to acquit myself honourably and be permitted to return to all the dear ones in safety. An image of the Hertfordshire Battalion, which has been colourised for the HertsAtWar exhibition . Soldiers from the 1st Battalion Hertfordshire Regiment, taken around August 1914, upon the outbreak of war . Pte Huggins and Sgt Gregory are not pictured but these soldiers were part of their battalion during the war . 'I have already asked, dear mum, that you will spend as happy a Xmas as possible and I will do the same.' Shortly before dawn on Christmas Day, Corporal Clifford Lane, of H Company Hertfordshire regiment, recalled how the Germans hoisted their lanterns above the trenches and called out to the British as a overture for a temporary truce. The British responded by shooting at the lights, putting an end to any prospect of a Christmas Day ceasefire - one that could have spared the lives of Pte Huggins and Sgt Gregory. But as the regiment ate a Christmas breakfast of bread and jam, cheese and a piece of cold bacon, Pte Huggins and Sgt Gregory had already been killed. It is thought the families of both soldiers received news of their deaths some time in early January and the two men were buried side by side at Le Touret Military Cemetery in Bethune, France. The Christmas truce, which became famous during the First World War, was a series of unofficial ceasefires spread along the Western Front. Known as Weihnachtsfrieden in German and Trêve de Noël in French, it lasted more than just Christmas Day itself, with soldiers from both sides crossing trenches to exchange greetings. In some parts, men ventured into No Man's Land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to swap food and souvenirs they had received from home. There were also joint burial ceremonies while some men played games of football and other meetings ended with carol-singing. But the truce wasn't completely widespread with fighting continuing in some sectors and 149 soldiers from the Commonwealth were killed on Christmas Day alone. After festivities were over troops returned to fighting and in subsequent years, truces were not nearly as common - by 1916 they were no longer permitted at all.","Ceasefire stopped short of where soldiers from Hertfordshire were on duty .
