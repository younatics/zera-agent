A 66-year-old woman was crushed to death by a homemade elevator as she tried to visit her disabled friend. Margaret Harrison's body was found trapped under the device by her long-term partner Frank Jorr, who had gone to search for her after she failed to show up at Jean Blair's home on Tuesday morning. Mrs Blair's husband, Robert, had built the elevator out of an old forklift truck 17 years ago to make it easier for his wife, who uses a motorized scooter, to get around their Weeki Wachee, Florida home. Frank Jorr, 64, holds a photograph of his girlfriend Margaret Harrison, 66, who died after she was crushed by a homemade elevator while visiting her friend . Homemade: The elevator can be seen to the right of the Florida home of Jean and Robert Blair . Ordinarily he would be the one to operate the elevator, which has since been condemned, but he was having an operation on Tuesday morning, according to 10 News. His wife, who had arranged for Mrs Harrison to keep her company while her husband and son were at the hospital, had sent the elevator to the ground floor, not realizing her friend was in its path. Mrs Blair, now 81, is mostly stationary due to heart problems and failing limbs and relies on a power wheelchair. She called Mrs Harrison her 'very best friend.' 'My heart is just broken,' she said. Those who knew her Mrs Harrison said she was a kind, generous woman who put others before herself. The lift had been on the side of the three-storey home for 17 years and when police examined it 'they couldn't find anything wrong with it' said Mr Blair . Mrs Harrison's body was discovered by Mr Jorr who Mrs Blair had called after she became concerned when her friend had not arrived. After finding Mrs Harrison's car in the driveway he headed towards the elevator, where he could see something poking out from under it. He activated the elevator to raise it, which is when he discovered his partner trapped underneath. 'I knew as soon as I saw her,' Mr Jorr told the Tampa Bay Times. 'She was blue already.' Mrs Harrison, a widow and mother of two grown children, had met him in 2002. Mrs Blair had offered to meet her friend on the ground floor so they could ride up in it together, but Mrs Harrison had told her she knew how the elevator worked and would make her own way to the second floor. Mr Blair has suggested that perhaps Mrs Harrison had a seizure, which is why she was unable to get out of the way. Accidental death: Margaret Harrison was crushed by the device, at the end of the house, when she came to visit . Condemned: The elevator, built by Robert Blair for his wife 17 years ago, has been shut down by officials . He built the lift on the side of his three-storey home 17 years ago, and said when police examined it 'they couldn't find anything wrong with it'. The elevator, made from a forklift, steel and wood, has since been condemned by the Building Department, which said it was illegal because it had been built without permits, and was also unsafe. Under Florida law, lifts and other conveyances in private homes do not require certificates of operation or inspections. There . was no electrical permit issued, as required, for the Blairs' device, . said county Building Department operations manager Jodi Singer. The elevator also lacked the required safety switches, county building official Frank Curlee said. Officials shut down the device, but no citations were issued. The couple told police that the elevator, which could work even in a power cut, was serviced every month, according to ABC Action News. Mrs Harrison's death has been ruled as accidental after a post-mortem examination.","Margaret Harrison's body discovered after homeowner raised the alarm .

The husband of a well-respected doctor and mother who died from cyanide poisoning has been charged with lacing his wife's drink with the deadly substance. Husband Dr. Robert Ferrante, 64, allegedly . killed his wife by mixing cyanide with an energy drink called creatine, which he told her would help them to conceive . another child.

Arrested: Dr Robert Ferrante, right, allegedly killed his wife Dr Autumn Marie Klein by lacing a creatine energy drink he told her would help them conceive another child . Ferrante told authorities and his wife's family that she had suffered a stroke, but investigators found her body had more than 30 times the lethal level of cyanide in her system. His attorney says his client wasn't fleeing police when he left Florida - he was simply driving back to Pennsylvania to surrender. Instead, West Virginia State Police stopped 64-year-old Dr. Robert Ferrante on Thursday night. He's being held in that state until he can be extradited to Pennsylvania to face a charge of criminal homicide in the death of his wife. The extradition process is expected to take a few days. It was previously revealed that Ferrante, who is a medical expert at the University of Pittsburgh, used his work credit card to purchase cyanide just two days before his wife's death. Ferrante's attorney Bill Difenderfer told KDKA that his client uses cyanide as part of his job as a professor at the university. Sources close to the investigation said Dr. Ferrante . appeared to be devastated by his loss and maintains his innocence, . however he was unwilling to speak to KDKA when they approached him. The couple have a six-year-old daughter called Cianna. As well as heading the women's neurology department at UPMC, Klein was a mother to six-year-old Cianna . Dr. Ferrante called 911 and reported that his wife had a heart attack on April 20th. Sources say 'extremely high levels of . cyanide' were found in Dr. Klein’s blood. The type of levels that would . have 'knocked her to the floor' in 30 seconds sources say. Colleagues were in shock at the loss of the . young and valued colleague who had quickly become an . acknowledged leader in treating pregnant women suffering . neurological diseases. 'This is an irreplaceable loss,' said . Robert Friedlander, chairman of neurological surgery at UPMC, who . recruited Dr. Klein in 2011. Lawrence .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 13:27 EST, 24 January 2012 . The Tories' popularity surged to a 22-month high today as they opened up a five-point opinion poll lead over the Labour Party. David Cameron shrugged off battles over welfare reform as figures put the Tories on 40 per cent for the first time since March 2010 - with Labour down to 35 per cent, according to the Guardian. The Lib Dems are trailing on 16 per cent. And in a fresh blow to Ed Miliband, a separate survey in The Times revealed almost two thirds of Labour's own supporters cannot see him ever becoming Prime Minister. Poll lead: David Cameron, pictured left in Leeds yesterday, now has a . five-point lead over Ed Miliband's Labour Party, according to a new . survey today . The polls show that Mr Miliband's recent . attempt to reposition itself to appeal to middle class voters has . failed with the party slipping back in recent weeks. If a fresh election was held tomorrow, the latest figures suggest Mr Cameron would be on the cusp of winning an overall majority. The last time the Conservatives held such a large lead was in June 2010 when they were eight percentage points ahead of Labour. In the new monthly Guardian/ICM poll, the Tories are up three percentage points on a month ago while Labour are down one. The Lib Dems are also up one. The grim news comes after Ed Miliband has endured a miserable month with Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, openly questioning his leadership. The state of the parties: The Tories now have a five-point poll lead over Labour, according to an ICM survey published today. The Conservatives are up 3% on a month ago . In an outspoken attack, Mr McCluskey also suggested that financial . support for the party could be withdrawn after Shadow Chancellor Ed . Balls backed public sector pay freezes. Mr Miliband has suffered a series of public relations disasters in recent weeks, including a blistering attack by Lord Glasman - one of his advisers - who accused him of having ‘no strategy, no narrative and little energy’. Public: I find it difficult to imagine Ed Miliband running the country as Prime Minister . Labour voters: . The Populus poll in The Times today revealed . support for Mr Miliband's party was falling - although Labour held a slight . lead with 38 per cent of voters saying they would back them in a general election compared to 37 per cent . opting who said they would go with the Tories. But the Populus poll revealed the public cannot see him as Prime Minister. The number of voters who 'find it . difficult to imagine Ed Miliband running the country as Prime Minister' was growing - up from 63 per cent in September to 68 per cent in the latest survey. Of those who said they could not see him . in Number 10, 38 per cent said it was because he was not up to the job, . 33 per cent because they did not know enough about him and nine per . cent because Labour are unlikely to win the next election. Among the party's own supporters, 59 per cent said they could not see Ed Miliband as Prime Minister. Today's figures will provide a huge . boost to David Cameron after the government's welfare reform proposals . were defeated in the House of Lords last night. The average person can only bear listening to Ed Miliband for 28 seconds, new research revealed today. Men and women were put in a test room to listen to Mr Miliband speak until they got 'bored' or 'irritated'. One person managed just four seconds. The survey found only Amy Childs from the Only Way Is Essex left the room sooner. In contrast, Brits typically enjoyed sitting in a room with three houseplants - a Croton, a Stephanosis and an Orchid - for 4 minutes 48 seconds. The study by the Flower Council of Holland found footage of wildlife expert David Attenborough captivated people for longest, clocking up an average of 9minutes and 26seconds. Five least stimulating celebrities (average time): Amy Childs (19 seconds), Ed Miliband (28 seconds), Christine Bleakley (59 seconds), Gavin Henson (1 minute 12 seconds) and Natalie Cassidy (1 minute 36 seconds). Labour . joined forces with Church of England bishops and Lib Dem rebels to try . to wreck flagship plans for a £26,000 annual limit on welfare handouts. The ICM poll in the Guardian also revealed the wealthiest are most likely to vote Conservative. Although the Tories enjoy a 12-point lead in the south, Labour are five points ahead in the north. Among people in socio-economic groups A and B, the Conservatives had a 45 per cent of the vote and Labour 29 per cent. Labour had a big lead among the lower groups - suggesting that the party are depending heavily on the poorest for their support. Among the middle classes and in the Midlands - both key electoral battlegrounds - figures suggest Mr Cameron enjoys a healthy lead. Over the weekend, a YouGov poll also found that a staggering 63 per cent of Labour voters want him to stand down before the next General election and 61 per cent do not believe he is the best leader for the party. The results will alarm Labour MPs, who are increasingly dismayed by their leader’s declining popularity. They also threaten to overshadow Mr Miliband’s recent attempts to relaunch his leadership with a series of policy shifts in a bid to broaden his appeal to middle class voters. Privately, most of his backbenchers believe the party should be between 10 and 20 points ahead of the Conservatives in the polls because of the coalition’s austerity measures.","Tories on 40%, Labour on 35% and Lib Dems on 15% .

"By . David Mccormack . PUBLISHED: . 12:29 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:35 EST, 25 July 2013 . The former teen whom Roman Polanski was convicted of raping in 1977 - leading to one of Hollywood's most notorious scandals and the director's flight from the U.S. - has chosen a photograph taken by him as the cover of her soon to be released memoir. After nearly 35 years, Samantha Geimer, 48, is finally telling her story in ‘The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski’ due out in September. The controversial cover image – a haunting close-up shot of Geimer, then aged 13 and known by her maiden name Gailey – was taken by Polanski on Feb. 20, 1977. Samantha Geimer, now 48, has said that using the photo and writing the book are part of her desire to reclaim her identity . Less than three weeks later he drugged and raped her at Jack Nicholson's Mulholland Drive home during a modeling shoot when he also gave her alcohol and a quaalude. Polanski took the cover shot during their first photo session together at her home, during which he persuaded her to pose topless, reports Hollywood Reporter. According to Geimer, using the photo and writing the book are part of her desire to reclaim her identity. 'I am more than “Sex Victim Girl,” a tag the media pinned on me,' said Geimer, who long ago identified herself as Polanski's victim. 'I offer my story now without rage, but with purpose - to share a tale that in its detail will reclaim my identity.' Publisher Atria Books promises that the book, on sale Sept 17, ‘will give readers insight into many dimensions of the story that have never been previously revealed.’ Samantha Geimer, right, now 48, has said her book, 'The Girl: Emerging from the Shadow of Roman Polanski', is part of her desire to reclaim her identity from the 79-year-old film director, left . Geimer sued Polanski in a civil suit . in 1988, alleging sexual assault, intentional infliction of emotional . distress and seduction. In 1993, he agreed to pay her $500,000 to settle the lawsuit, although years later it was unclear if he actually paid. As . part of the civil suit, her attorney Lawrence Silver, who also . contributes to the book, demanded Polanski turn over all the pictures he . took. But Silver always believed others existed and years later they . were discovered – including the cover image . ‘In . executing the search warrant, the police didn’t recognize the importance . of a receipt/claim check from Sav-On Drugs’ photograph department,’ writes Silver in the book. ‘Years . later, I was told that Polanski gave his lawyer the receipt, and they . secured the printed roll of film and negatives from the drug store. 'During the civil suit, his lawyer had to turn those photos over to me. These photographs, important both legally and historically, would likely . have never been discovered if not for the civil suit.’ Haunted: Polanski drugged and raped Geimer at Jack Nicholson's Mulholland Drive home during a modeling shoot when he also gave her alcohol and a quaalude . Polanski . was initially indicted on six felony counts, including rape by use of . drugs, child molesting and sodomy, but pleaded guilty to one count of . unlawful sexual intercourse. In exchange, a Los Angeles judge agreed . to drop the remaining charges and sentence him to prison for a 90-day . psychiatric evaluation. He was released after 42 days by an . evaluator who deemed him mentally sound and unlikely to offend again, . but the judge threatened further sanctions and Polanski fled the United . States. The 79-year-old Polanski, whose films include 'Chinatown' and . 'Rosemary's Baby,' is restricted by an Interpol warrant in effect in . 188 countries, but he moves freely between Switzerland and France. He was freed from Swiss house arrest in 2010 after the government refused to deport him to the United States. Geimer has said that she forgives him and has joined his bid for dismissal.","Samantha Geimer was just 13 when Polanski raped her in 1977 .

It's not unusual for visitors to Las Vegas to end up in an embarrassing situation - but the plight of one British tourist became much worse after his drunken antics were uploaded to YouTube. The young Liverpudlian was found by police wandering around the Strip wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and in need of a helping hand to find his hotel room. Unfortunately for the man, who gave his name only as 'Steven', the officers were being filmed for an American reality show named Vegas Strip, which airs on cable network TruTV. Scroll down to watch the video . Busted: Police have been filmed apprehending a drunk Liverpudlian tourist on the Las Vegas Strip . Confused: The man, named Steven, was evidently having difficulty getting back to his hotel room . In the clip, which has had around 75,000 hits since being uploaded to YouTube, the over-excited tourist is shown being approached by two local cops as he tries to get back to his hotel. He is shirtless, wearing only a pale blue pair of shorts with sunglasses and trainers. The friendly officers ask him, 'How you doing?', and he shocks them by replying: 'Have you got some beef?' Much of what he says is subtitled for the U.S. audience, due to his thick Scouse accent and slurred words. Helping hand: The Scouser was subtitled in footage which appeared on cable network TruTV . Escorted: The tourist was helped back to his hotel room but would not reveal who he was holidaying with . Steven tells the police his name, saying he is 'from a place called the UK', and adding that he has been walking through a lot of car parks. One smiling officers asks him: 'Let me guess, you’ve been drinking?' He replies: 'I'm sorry, I'm drunk, I am drunk. I've got no excuse. I'm trying to go home to bed.' As he digs out his hotel room key for the police to help him home, one officer jokes: 'How long did it take you to get that Weekend at Bernie's walk down pat?' Steven asks if the police have been following him, and when they say they have he replies: 'Nah, I was undercover, you couldn’t have spotted me. I thought I was camouflaged.' Arrest me! The man asked to be handcuffed because he said he 'doesn't like surprises' Friendly: The police assured Steven he had done nothing wrong and shook his hand as they departed . When a hotel employee emerges to help take him back to his room, the officers ask who he is on holiday with so they can look up his room number. However, he responds: 'I'm sorry sir, I'm not willing to give that name. Out of respect for my friends, I can't give them in.' They assure him that 'no one's in trouble', but the confused tourist says: 'I've seen documentaries and these jails scare me, Las Vegas jails scare me.' When the hotel confirms his room number, the police try to send him on his way - but he refuses to believe that they will not arrest him. He holds out his arms to be handcuffed, saying: 'I'd rather give you my hands than you pounce on me. I don't like surprises.' Instead, the officers shake hands with him and insist that he go back to his room to sleep it off.

The case highlights the confusion around the use of the word 'natural' in in the industry. The Food and Drug Administration doesn't currently have a definition for what constitutes a natural product. But it says that it doesn't object to the term's use if the food doesn't have 'added color, artificial flavors or synthetic substances.' Notably, the FDA says it's difficult to define a food product that is natural, since it has likely been processed and is no longer a 'product of the earth'. Michele Simon, a public health lawyer and critic of food industry marketing practices, noted that there are numerous cases making their way through the legal system because of food companies' use of the word natural. She said the PepsiCo case was notable because the company was in essence addressing the murkiness of the word with the settlement. 'This company is basically surrendering the use of the offensive, deceptive marketing term,' Simon said. The lawsuit against PepsiCo noted that the company cultivates a 'healthy and socially conscious image' to boost sales of the drinks, which typically cost around $4 a bottle. Head office: The Pepsico and American flags fly in front of the Pepsico world headquarters in Purchase, NY . It noted that PepsiCo knew its target market would be willing to pay more for natural drinks that are 100 per cent juice and free of genetically modified organisms. The lawsuit also claimed that PepsiCo used genetically modified organisms in its Naked juices. In its statement, the company denied that claim and said its drinks will continue to be labeled 'non-GMO.' It said it plans to enlist a third-party to confirm the non-GMO status of the juices. PepsiCo did not say when it planned to make the labeling changes in line with the settlement, reached earlier this month. On Friday, the website for Naked Juices still showed bottles with the words 'all natural' on them.","The FDA doesn't currently have a definition for what constitutes a 'natural' product .

A study has found that there is more than just chilli lurking in hot sauce - high amounts of poisonous lead are also contained in a range of spicy relishes. A variety of piquant sauces were tested, and discovered to exceed 0.1 ppm lead - the U.S Food and Drug Administration standard for unsafe levels of the chemical. Out of 25 bottles of imported hot sauces, four - all from Mexico and made by different manufacturers - were found to have a high amount of the metal. Lead exposure can damage a child's developing brain and lead to a lower IQ. Overall, lead poisoning in the U.S. has declined significantly since it was removed from paints and gasoline formulas. University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) researchers Jennifer Berger Ritchie and Professor Shawn Gerstenbergera subjected the variety of sauces to the tests as hot relishes have long been suspected of containing lead. Their study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Health, explained how the products were shaken for a minute and then analyzed for lead concentrations and pH levels, the UNLV website reported. They also tested the lead content of the packaging, as that has a history of seeping into products and contaminating them. It was then that they found that 16 per cent of the Mexican and South American products contained the high levels - but did not specify which ones they had tested. University of Nevada, Las Vegas researchers Jennifer Berger Ritchie and Professor Shawn Gerstenbergera subjected the variety of sauces to the tests (posed) They warned that if hot sauce is a . regular feature of someone's diet - particularly a child where spicy . food is part of their culture - they could be at risk. Following the shocking find, researchers have demanded a more demanding testing process. Prof Gerstenberger told the UNLV: 'The results indicate the need for more rigorous screening protocols for products imported in Mexico, including an applicable standard for hot sauce. 'Without enforceable standards for hot sauces and condiments, manufacturers will not be encouraged to improve quality control measures designed to reduce the amounts of lead and other toxic elements before exporting.' Lead had long been considered a threat to a child. In January, research found that cities where . lead pollution was reduced experienced falling levels of robbery and . violent crime around 20 years later. Similarly, an increase in lead pollution prompted an increase in violence two decades later, scientists found. Researchers . believe that exposure to toxic lead in the environment damages . children’s brains and could make them more likely to commit violent . crime when they grow up. Professor Howard Mielke, of Tulane University in New Orleans, who has studied the effect of lead on children, said there was a ‘strong association’ between criminal activity and lead. Dr Alastair Hay, professor of . environmental toxicology at Leeds University, said: ‘We know that lead . exposure in children and infants, when the brain is developing, damages . the brain, and we know that children who are exposed to lead have a . lower IQ. ‘These children tend to be more . impulsive and find it more difficult to concentrate. What these studies . are saying is that following exposure in infancy the effect on the body . seems to predispose, or is certainly strongly linked, with violent . behaviour in adulthood.’","Out of 25 tested bottles, four were found to exceed 0.1ppm lead .

A teenager who allegedly kidnapped a woman and held her as a sex slave for more than two weeks called an FBI agent daily to tell him he was involved in sex trafficking, it has emerged. Brandon Todd, 19, called Special Agent Barry Crouch numerous times while holding his victim captive, telling the man that he had recently 'recruited' a woman, the affidavit states. It is not clear what action - if any - . the FBI took after receiving the phone calls. Calls to the FBI from . MailOnline were not returned and the agency declined to comment to ABC . beyond the affidavit. The woman, who had been kidnapped from California and forced to travel to Todd's home in Naples, New York, only escaped when she faked an asthma attack and went to hospital. After her escape, she traveled to . Florida with her boyfriend and Todd called the FBI agent again, . identifying the woman and saying he wanted help in tracking her down as . he had feelings for her. The bizarre scenario was outlined in an affidavit filed in a federal court on July 9 by Agent Crouch. Todd . was arrested on July 10 and charged with kidnapping across state lines, . which has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The involvement of . two states could go some way to explain how agents did not know the . woman was missing. Todd met the woman on a bus from Florida to San Diego, where she was traveling to see her mother and look for a job. Todd sat next to her and would not leave her alone, the documents state. 'Plot': He met her on a bus to California before forcing her to go with him to New York by saying he was in a gang and would kill her family. At his home, he allegedly raped her several times a day . He suggested they get a hotel together . in San Diego and the victim said that, although she did not want to, . she agreed and planned to call someone for a ride when they got there. But . as they neared the hotel, Todd said he was part of a gang and they . would track her down if they fled. He drove her to a Wal-Mart, where he . bought a machete, knife and a change of clothes for her. Once back in the hotel, he raped her with the machete on the bed beside them, she said. Two days later, they boarded for another bus for Rochester, New York, with Todd saying he would kill her parents if she did not go with him, she told the FBI. Calls: FBI Agent Barry Crouch received the calls but it is not known what action - if any - he took . A man who was identified to her as Todd's grandfather collected them from the bus station and took them to Todd's grandparents' home, where he lived. Throughout the journey, the older man would not look the victim in the eye, did not engage her 'and did not seem to care that she was there', according to the affidavit. When the woman failed to appear in San Diego, her mother filed a missing person's report. For more than two weeks, the woman was allegedly held captive in Todd's room and raped several times a day. He also allegedly beat her with his belt and stomped on her wearing heavy boots. When she went to the bathroom, he would watch her before taking her back to his room, and he only allowed her to sleep for four hours a day with just a towel for a cover. Throughout the ordeal, he told her that he was working with the FBI and that she was too, and that if she spoke to anyone else, they would arrest her. Special Agent Couch said in . late April or early May he received a phone call from Todd, who said he . wanted to pass on information about a human sex trafficking ring. 'Todd stated that the reason he was . calling the FBI was that he had recruited a certain woman, started to . have personal feelings for her, and decided he did not want her involved . with the trafficking,' Crouch wrote. Scene: The teen took the woman to his grandparents' home, pictured, and they did not ask questions . He called back daily for two weeks, speaking to Crouch and two other agents. He also said he had information about a missing person, but did not name her. At one point, he took the woman to the Naples library for a drug deal and she realized where she was, and contacted her boyfriend on one of the computers to alert him. They plotted for her to fake an asthma attack days later and on May 12, Todd drove her to the hospital, where she was able to contact her boyfriend to collect her. According to hospital records, at one . point the woman begged: 'Please don’t make me leave; he is dangerous and . I have been trapped in his house for the last three weeks.' Escape: She pretended to have an asthma attack so Todd took her from the home, pictured, to hospital . He took her back to Florida. She was initially unwilling to tell state troopers or hospital staff about her ordeal as she believed Todd's story that she would be arrested if she said anything, she told Crouch. After she escaped, Todd called Crouch again 'hoping the FBI would assist him in locating the woman,' Crouch said in the affidavit. He named her and was also connected to her disappearance through witness testimony at the bus stations, the affidavit said. He was arrested and faces a charge of interstate kidnapping. His next court appearance falls on August 6 in Rochester, New York.","FBI has declined to say what action they took to find Brandon Todd, 19 .

Scientists have discovered that Martian meteorites found on Earth could be four billion years younger than previously thought, meaning that Mars could still be geologically active. A team of researchers has shown that a meteorite from the Mars collection at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada started as a 200 million-year-old lava flow on Mars. In a paper published today in the journal Nature, a new technique using isotopic and micro-structural analysis is described to determine the age of rocks. Following recent analysis, scientists claim that martian rocks found on earth left Mars 20 million years ago. Previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old . Scientists from the University of Portsmouth, the Royal Ontario Museum, the University of Wyoming and the University of California, claim that the rocks left Mars 20 million years ago. Previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old. ‘There has been a long debate about the actual age of precious Martian rocks that have been found on Earth,’ said James Darling, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth. ‘Some scientists suggested they were formed as part of the ancient Martian crust and are therefore around 4,000 million years old - almost as old as the solar system itself. And others believed they were much younger.’ Nearly 100 meteorites found on Earth are thought to be from Mars. This pictures shows Ceraunius Tholus and Uranius Tholus, ancient inactive shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of Mars . The meteorites found on Earth have been ejected from Mars, probably after being dislodged by a large meteorite impact, and have eventually been hoovered up by Earth. This process can cause extensive damage to the samples, including deformation and melting of the crystals that make up the rock. ‘The real challenge has been interpreting whether the measured age of the rock is the time at which it was formed or the time at which it was ejected from the Martian surface’, said Darling. The team used a number of high resolution techniques to analyse the Martian crystals, examining samples much smaller than a human hair. The researchers combined isotopic . analysis with micro-structural analysis, which means they looked at both . the structure of the crystals and the chemistry to determine the growth . history of the crystals. James Darling, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth, said the study is exciting not only because it provides a much better understanding of the geological activity on Mars, but the new technique can be used to analyse meteorites from the Moon and other asteroids . Darling said: ‘This is a really exciting study, not only because it gives us a much better understanding of the geological activity on Mars, but also because we can apply this new technique to meteorites from the Moon and other asteroids, which means we can start to analyse hundreds of rocks from the solar system.’ Nearly 100 meteorites found on Earth are thought to be from Mars. They are kept in collections all over . the world and are hugely valuable scientifically as they provide . researchers with unique insights into the history of the red planet. The scientists analysed a shergottite meteorite found in north Africa, which is kept at the Royal Ontario Museum. VIDEO: This research team directed energy beams at tiny crystals found in a Martian meteorite . Snow on ancient Mars is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there, according to American scientists. Researchers at Brown University have shown that some Martian valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes. Scientists studied four different locations on Mars that they suspected had water-carved valleys, caused by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges. The new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient Mars and could shed new light on the planet's early climate and atmosphere.","Scientists combined isotopic and micro-structural analysis to map the structure of Martian meteorites .

He's seen his daughter transformed from an outgoing movie star into a troubled young woman feared to be suffering from a severe mental illness. And the concern was etched on the face of Amanda Bynes' father Rick as he stood outside a Los Angeles court house on Friday. His anxious appearance came as papers filed at the court revealed shocking new details of the extent of his daughter's apparent mental illness. Amongst . the examples given of Amanda's disturbed state include the fact that she . hailed a taxi cab in New York in order to visit LA - a . journey of some 2,778 miles. Anxious: Concern shows on the face of Rick Bynes ahead of his court appearance to talk about the future of his daughter Amanda in LA on Thursday morning . The . details come from papers filed in support of Amanda's mother Lynn's . application for conservatorship of her daughter's affairs - both . personal and financial. The . cab journey is just one case of financial extravagance from the starlet - . who is said to have burned through $1.4m of her $4m fortune in just a . few months. The papers state that Amanda withdrew $100,000 on June 4, then the same . amount on July 2. She has also written checks for a total of $63,000 during the same period. Her parents state . they believe a substantial amount was spent on illegal drugs. 'We have received large doctor bills for purported services to Amanda from doctors that we do not know for unspecified services,' they say in the filing, reports the New York Daily News. 'We are informed and believe that a substantial amount of this money is being used to pay for marijuana.' Concerned: The Bynes family head to court to discuss the future of their troubled daughter . The papers also state that  Amanda has become 'extremely paranoid about being watched,' and covers smoke alarms with towels and tapes windows shut to prevent herself being photographed. Her parents also claim that she has 'profound issues with her body image' and is 'obsessed with the fact that she (and others) are ugly,' according to TMZ. While her parents case may seem compelling, the judge decided there was no need to rush the application, as . Amanda is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment in a medical centre . under involuntary hold. Judge Glen Reiser said: 'This is not a case where there's an emergency right now, and because conservatorships of the person and estate involve liberty and property interests, there are a lot of t's we need to cross and i's we need to dot.' Before ruling on the application Judge Reiser set a number of requirements which must be met at a full hearing on August 9. Among other things he wants to speak to Amanda and to the doctors treating her. High profile lawyer: The Bynes family are represented by Tamar Arminak who is pictured arriving at Ventura Juvenile Court on Friday morning . He also wishes to see the police file on the recent incident in which she started a fire on a stranger's driveway, and for her court-appointed lawyer to offer a recommendation. However . the judge said if Bynes is released before the end of her current two-week . hold, either side could ask for an emergency hearing. Meanwhile Amanda herself is expected to attend a hearing at her treatment facility in a bid to have her enforced treatment ended after it was extended from 72-hours to two weeks on Thursday. While Bynes had her own lawyer argued the extension should be denied, doctors insisted they needed two weeks to properly diagnose her condition. They felt that releasing her could pose a danger to herself and others. Seeking control: Bynes parents met the judge in a private hearing at the Juvenile Courthouse in Ventura . It had earlier been claimed doctors had made an initial assessment that the actress is suffering from . 'schizophrenic tendencies.' Bynes, 27, was admitted to the psychiatric centre following an incident where she allegedly started a fire in an elderly woman's driveway - an incident referred to in the request for conservatorship. According to reports, Bynes can act normally for up to ten hours at a time, but then becomes irrational and incoherent. Hoping to gain conservatorship: Amanda's mother Lynn leaves her daughter's treatment centre after visiting her on Wednesday . Despite her strange behaviour Bynes has reportedly tested negative for all illegal drugs except marijuana. With the former Hairspray star receiving treatment, friends have started to come forward to offer more details about her recent troubles. These include the allegation by her close friend Ana Rivera that Amanda's last dog died due to her neglect.

A new report claims that shocking video of two Western men abusing a Korean woman at a nightclub in Seoul was staged - and that the villains in the footage were actually paid actors. When the video was posted online in June, it caused fury in Korea and in the West. Many Koreans said that it only proved their suspicions about Western expatriates living in Korea. Westerners were horrified about how it portrayed ex-pats. Now, the Washington Post reports that the men are speaking out, anonymously, and claiming they were paid $90 to play roles and that the entire horrifying scene was 'all in good fun.' A Korean man who claims to be the 'director' of the film showed the Post two alternate takes from the same video - which seems to support the story about the footage being from a planned film shoot. Disturbing: This image grab from a video uploaded to YouTube shows a Western man grabbing a young Korean woman by the face as she tries to push him away . Abuse: But despite the woman's protestations, the man continues to force her face towards the camera . The . original 78-second clip shows a young Western club-goer with an . American accent grabbing the woman around her face before repeatedly . poking her in her mouth and nose while a third person films it. After . poking the woman in nose, the man then can be heard shouting: 'I see a . booger' while his friend eggs him on, saying: 'Dude, make her eat it.' The two men can then be heard laughing as he pushes his finger in to her mouth at the unnamed nightclub in South Korea. They then continue to abuse the girl by telling her she is disgusting and tells her she needs plastic surgery 'like every other little Korean'. The woman, who appears to be worse-for-wear, apparently tells the man to leave her alone and tries to push him away. But he continue to harass her by grabbing at her face and body until she eventually manages to get free and leaves. Cruelty: The Western man then continues to poke her in the face while telling the person filming: 'I can see a booger' who then replies: 'Dude, make her eat it' Shame: The Korean woman tries to push the man away as he tells her she is 'disgusting' and should have plastic surgery 'just like every other little Korean' Since the release of the video the men have reached out to numerous ex-pat and Western news sources in Korea proclaiming their innocence. However, their evidence that the video was actually staged as a movie is shaky at best. They said they were paid in cash by the Korean man who recruited them and could not provide a name of the film company he worked with or the movie he was working on. The video was shot on an iPhone and they have no pay stubs to prove they were hired as actors. The only proof is a screen shot of a Facebook chat between one of the actors an the supposed director. The video quickly went viral after it was uploaded to YouTube and embedded on the Korean Web portal Jagei.com on June 8 and has been covered by the South Korean press. The publicity has sparked a widespread debate over the way Western tourists treat women while visiting South Korea.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 13:14 EST, 26 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:26 EST, 26 July 2013 . Attorney General Eric Holder has told the Russian government that the U.S. will not seek the death penalty for former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden. In a letter dated July 23, the attorney general said the criminal charges Snowden faces do not carry the death penalty and that the U.S. will not seek the death penalty even if Snowden were charged with crimes that are eligible for such punishments. Before the news of the letter broke, Edward’s father Lonnie Snowden showed his undying support for his son, saying: ‘I believe when my son takes his final breath, whether it’s today or 100 years from now, he will be comfortable with what he did.’ The elder Snowden told The Today Show that he shares his son’s outrage about the government surveillance program, the funding for which was just renewed in spite of the leaked material. ‘I am extremely disappointed and angry. I'm an angry American citizen,’ he told Matt Lauer Friday morning. Speaking out: Edward¿s father Lonnie Snowden showed his undying support for his son during a Today Show interview Friday . ‘I’ve watched closely the balance of the 36 members on the two intelligence committees within Congress, particularly, and the American people don’t know the whole truth, but the truth is coming.’ This is the leaker’s father’s second interview with NBC and he said that while he still has not had direct contact with his son, he has changed his tune when it comes to Wikileaks. In limbo: Snowden is still thought to be in the transit terminal at Moscow's airport . Late last month, Lonnie expressed concern that Edward was being manipulated, but they seem to have helped ease those concerns. ‘I'm thankful for anybody at this point who is providing him with assistance, to keep him safe and secure, and so if Wikileaks is doing that, I'm thankful for that,’ he said. Holder's letter is part of an ongoing campaign by the U.S. government to get Snowden back. Holder says his letter follows news reports that Snowden, who leaked information on largely secret electronic surveillance programs, has filed papers seeking temporary asylum in Russia on grounds that if he were returned to the United States, he would be tortured and would face the death penalty. The attorney general's letter was sent to Alexander Vladimirovich Konovalov, the Russian minister of justice. The attorney general's letter may allay reported Russian concerns about how Snowden might be treated if he is deported to America. Some Russian politicians, including parliament speaker Sergei Naryshkin, have said Snowden should be granted asylum to protect him from the death penalty. If Snowden were to go to a country that opposes the death penalty, providing assurances that the U.S. won't seek that punishment may remove at least one obstacle to his return. 'I can report that the United States is prepared to provide to the Russian government the following assurances regarding the treatment Mr. Snowden would face upon return to the United States,' Holder wrote. Trying: Attorney General Eric Holder wrote a letter to the Russian government saying that they will not seek the death penalty and they hope that will encourage them to send Snowden back . 'First, the United States would not seek the death penalty for Mr. Snowden should he return to the United States.' 'Mr. Snowden will not be tortured. Torture is unlawful in the United States,' Holder's letter said. The attorney general said that if Snowden returned to the U.S. he would promptly be brought before a civilian court and would receive 'all the protections that United States law provides.' Holder also said that 'we understand from press reports and prior conversations between our governments that Mr. Snowden believes that he is unable to travel out of Russia and must therefore take steps to legalize his status. That is not accurate; he is able to travel.' Careful: Snowden was accompanied by his lawyer during the interview . Despite the revocation of Snowden's passport on June 22, Snowden remains a U.S. citizen and is eligible for a limited validity passport good for direct return to the United States, said the attorney general. A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia has not budged from its refusal to extradite Snowden. Snowden, who is believed to have been staying at the Moscow airport transit zone since June 23, applied for temporary asylum in Russia last week. The United States wants him sent home to face prosecution for espionage. Asked by a reporter whether the government's position had changed, Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that 'Russia has never extradited anyone and never will.' There is no U.S.-Russia extradition treaty. Peskov also said that Putin is not involved in reviewing Snowden's application or discussions of the ex-NSA contractor's future with the U.S., though the Russian Security Service, the FSB, had been in touch with the FBI.","Attorney General sent letter in hopes of getting Edward Snowden extradited to the U.S.

Qatar Airways has pulled one of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners out of service following a 'minor' technical issue, as pressure mounted on Boeing over possible new electrical problems with the advanced jet. It is the latest in a spate of mishaps for the 787,  including a fire on an . Ethiopian Airlines-owned 787 earlier this month which caused Heathrow airport to be shut down for an hour and a half while firefighters battled the blaze. The entire fleet of 787s was grounded earlier this year thanks to repeated faults in the lithium-ion batteries which sometimes led to plane fires. Today, it was revealed that an oven overheated and caused smoke in an Air India Dreamliner this week. India's aviation regulator is investigating the incident, which did not interrupt services.

December 2012: A Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing in New Orleans . January 7 2013: An unoccupied Dreamliner flight bursts into flames at Boston airport . January 15 2013: A flight made an emergency landing in Japan after a smoke alarm went off. The string of incidents led to regulators ordering a global grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet, which lasted for four months . June 2 2013: Battery-related problems were reported on a Japan Airlines aircraft forcing the airline to use an alternative plane . June 12 2013: A flight in Japan was cancelled after one of the engines failed to start . June 18 2013: A United Airlines flight was diverted to Seattle due to an oil-filter problem .

July 18 2013: Japan Airlines plane bound for Tokyo had to return to Boston's Logan airport after take-off because of a possible issue with the fuel pumps . Qatar Airways and Boeing declined to give further details about the affected plane. Industry sources said it had been grounded for days after smoke was seen near an electrical panel. According to tracking service Flightaware, the aircraft, registered as A7-BCB, has not flown since Sunday - an unusually long time for a long-haul jet designed to save on fuel bills. Qatar Airways confirmed an aircraft had been taken out of service, but said no flights had been cancelled as a result. ""This is a minor issue for us, and not an incident, so we are not commenting,"" an airline spokesman said. Two people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified, told Reuters that smoke had been reported near an electrical compartment while the jet was on the ground in Doha. A failure in a similar bay caused a fire during a test flight in 2010, and three of the jets, including one owned by Qatar Airways, had electrical problems last December. A fire-brigade supervisor in Doha said it did not have any record of an incident with an airport-related call last week. Japan's ANA Holdings Inc, which . operates the world's biggest fleet of Dreamliners, also said today it . had found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator beacons, made . by Honeywell International Inc. The . U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing instructed airlines to . inspect or remove the beacons, after UK investigators found two wires . pinched together in the beacon inside the Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner . at Heathrow. The resulting fire caused extensive damage to the plane. Last December, three 787s had electrical problems that were made public. United Airlines experienced problems with electrical panels on two 787s, one of which diverted to another airport during a flight from Houston. Qatar Airways said that month that it grounded one of its 787 jets because of the same problem United had experienced. Boeing later traced the problem to faulty circuit boards in the panel. In January, regulators grounded the global fleet of 50 Dreamliners after batteries burned on two jets within two weeks. Earlier this month a parked Ethiopian Boeing 787 Dreamliner caught fire at Heathrow airport, with scorch marks visible on top of the plane . Regulators lifted the grounding in April after Boeing redesigned the battery system, which supplies backup power to the jet and is unrelated to the emergency beacon, known as an emergency locator transmitter, or ELT, that is designed to send out a signal to help rescuers locate an aircraft wreckage. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said in May that the airline had to forego $200million in lost profit because of the grounding of 787 planes, but has received compensation from Boeing for the losses. At least one other airline says it is still seeking compensation. The fire on an Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner at Heathrow kept the airport shut for 90 minutes and was caused by a fault in the lithium battery powering the plane's emergency beacon . Aviation experts say it is common for the reported number of incidents to rise when an aircraft is in the spotlight, and that all new aircraft models have incidents when they first enter service. The 787 went into service in the autumn of 2011. Even aircraft with decades of service regularly suffer glitches that go unreported and rarely pose a direct threat to safety. However, aviation experts say U.S. and British authorities investigating the previous fires may try to establish whether anything can be learned from a pattern of reported incidents connected in various ways to the jet's electrical systems. Last week a Japan Airlines plane bound for Tokyo had to return to Boston's Logan Airport because of a possible problem with the fuel pump . Boeing chief executive Jim McNerney said this week he remained 'highly confident' in the future of the 787 Dreamliner programme and the integrity of the company's newest airplane. The 787 incorporates a raft of changes in the way passenger jets are designed, including greater use of electrical systems that save weight compared with older hydraulics. It is the first passenger jet built mainly from lightweight carbon-composites. Boeing shares were down 0.9 per cent at $105.76 late on Friday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.","The 787 aeroplane, known as A7-BCB, has been grounded since Sunday .

A Michelin-star chef and restaurateur has been found dead in a Pennsylvania graveyard with a gunshot wound to his head. Colin Devlin, 42, who is thought to have had financial problems, was found dead yesterday morning in Chestnut Hill Church Cemetery in Coopersburg. The married father-of-two had been missing since Wednesday afternoon, when he left his Williamsburg home after being denied a business loan, sources told the New York Daily News. His wife Kristina Devlin became alarmed when she received a text at 4:18 p.m. asking her to take care of their children, the Wall Street Journal reported. Colin Devlin, who owned the popular restaurant Dumont Burger, pictured, in Williamsburg, has been found dead in a Pennsylvania graveyard . She told New York City police she thought her husband, who owned popular Williamsburg eateries DuMont and DuMont Burger, was going to their second home in Saylorsburg. One of his restaurants, the upscale Dressler on Broadway in Williamsburg, recently closed after Devlin was unable to negotiate a new lease according to a website message. Dressler received a coveted Michelin star in 2007. Paul F. Hoffman Sr., the chief deputy coroner for Lehigh County, ruled the death was a suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police recovered a gun near his body and he said that a note was found in Devlin's car. Devlin began washing dishes at a catering company in Philadelphia when he was 14, according to the website for DuMont. He then moved to New York where he worked with celebrated restaurateur Keith McNally at restaurants including Pravda and Balthazar, before opening DuMont in 2001, the website said. He was still frequently seen in Balthazar after he left. 'We're shocked and devastated. It's a surreal tragedy,' said Polo Dobkin, the chef who anchored the kitchens at all of Mr. Devlin's restaurants before leaving last September told the Wall Street Journal.

Scroll down for video . Transformation: Jenny Lee, a plastic surgery addict who appeared on Oprah in 2004 (left), still struggled with body issues seven years later (right) after a weight gain caused by fibromyalgia . Dissatisfaction: When she first met Oprah, the talk show host told her that she looked like Barbie. Jenny responded: 'I'm trying very hard to find acceptance. But when I look in my reflection, I still don't like what I see' 'Initially my self-esteem took a huge . blow,' the blonde tells Oprah. 'I was just like, ""Are you kidding me?"" Because I look at some . pictures. . . where I was really thin. But I was the healthiest and the happiest at that time, and I miss those days.' Indeed, Jenny appears completely different in the episode, displaying a puffier face and noticeable weight gain.

Enduring habit: Seven years after her first Oprah appearance, Jenny had undergone 33 more procedures - including a fourth rhinoplasty . 'I feel like my spirit was broken,' she says. 'And I'm trying very hard to find acceptance. But when I look in my reflection, I still don't like what I see. 'If I could be just OK with it, just OK, I would be very happy,' she added. 'I'm trying to find acceptance, but when I look in my reflection, I still don't like what I see' Jenny's dissatisfaction led to her getting 26 plastic surgeries by the time she was 28 years old, including three lip implants, two boob jobs, three breast lifts and liposuction. After her first appearance on Oprah, Jenny . and her husband had a baby, and she briefly kicked the surgery habit in order to . be a more attentive mother. But soon enough, she was back on the bandwagon and had undergone 33 more procedures - including a fourth rhinoplasty. Side effects: 'I am in constant pain, all the time, every day, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,' Jenny (pictured with daughter Priscilla) said of her condition . Jenny Lee . In the follow-up episode, Jenny says her final nose surgery, which took place in February 2008, was finally to her satisfaction. 'Now, I look at my nose and go. . . it's . perfect!' she says. But other events in her life have not gone according to plan - like her diagnosis with fibromyalgia, a disorder that makes sufferers feel chronic widespread pain. 'I am in constant pain, all the time, every day, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,' said Jenny, who cuts a noticeably fuller figure now, due to the disorder. Still, while Jenny continues to struggle with her . own body image issues, she has tried to make . sure that her oldest daughter, Kaleigh, will never have to do the same.

'I just. . . at this time in my life, I really don't see anything wrong with me' 'She's beautiful the . way that she is and personally I would prefer that she don't do . anything to change that.' For her part, it seems Kaleigh has got the message. 'My appearance isn't too important,' she says.

A 34-year-old Pennsylvania man who was a fitness fanatic and was taking dietary supplements, died from a massive heart attack. Todd Battuello appeared to be in great shape, yet just weeks after using the 'fat-burning' diet pill OxyElitePro, he collapsed after dining with his wife. His family are now suing the makers of the drug that Mr Battuello was taking after learning the Food & Drug Administration had ordered a batch of the pills to be 'destroyed' earlier this year. Todd Battuello: He was described as a 'fun and hardworking barn manager' - despite his healthy appearance, Todd suffered a heart attack a weeks after starting to take dietary supplements . Mr Battuello  died on May 15th last year, just a week after he and his wife Lauren celebrated their first wedding anniversary. The couple had just finished dinner when he began to feel sick and began convulsing before collapsing. He was pronounced dead a short time later at Chester County Hospital.

OxyElite Pro claims to target the 'stubborn' belly fat that is difficult to shift. Yet even in early 2012 there were cases of users suffering heart attacks after taking the product . OxyElite Pro was the fat-burning supplement that Mr Battuello had been using in the weeks leading up to his death. The pill claims to remove 'stubborn' belly fat around the belly in particular. The family told Philly.com they have filed a lawsuit earlier this month against USPlabs, the Dallas-based company that produced OxyElite Pro, and Bodybuilding.com, an Idaho-based company that sold the product on its website. USPlabs has come under fire from the FDA, which earlier this month ordered the company to destroy its entire inventory of OxyElite Pro. In April, the FDA warned consumers on . its website that both supplements contained a stimulant called . dimethylamylamine (DMAA), which 'can elevate blood pressure and could . lead to cardiovascular problems, including heart attack, shortness of . breath and tightening of the chest . . . and may be particularly . dangerous when used with caffeine.' According to the lawsuit, a warning label on the OxyElite Pro bottle indicated that the supplement did contain caffeine. The family's lawyer Tom Kline said a toxicology test showed that Mr Battuello had DMAA in his system when he died. Lawsuit: Todds' wife, Lauren, is now suing ths website that sold the dietary supplements claiming there should have been more explicit warnings over the dangers of using the drug . Although a warning not to mix DMAA and caffeine is posted on the website now, the lawsuit alleges that USPlabs is to blame for Mr Battuello's death because the product did not give a warning to customers of the potential dangers or risks to health. USPlabs claim the supplement is 'pharmacist formulated' and 'university studied,' stating the product must be used with 'extreme caution, only by healthy adults capable of handling its true power.' The family are seeking more than $75,000 in damages. Jacob Geissler, USPlabs CEO, has not responded to MailOnline's request for a comment. Muscular: Here, Todd Battuello is shown grinning while sitting behind the wheel of a small tractor in a white tank top. He was described as a 'fun and hardworking barn manager' who 'maintains the vast property' This is not the first time that the stimulant DMAA has come under the spotlight. In February 2012, two U.S. Army soldiers had fatal heart attacks during training exercises. At the time, USPlabs told the New York Times: 'there have been over 1 billion doses of DMAA-containing products taken without a single corroborated serious health problem.' Mr Kline says the OxyElite Pro from Bodybuilding.com was ordered by Mr Battuello who was into physical fitness: 'but he had no idea how dangerous this product was.' On the website of the Pennsylvania horse-training company the couple ran, Evolution Training Center, Mr Battuello is described as the 'hardworking barn manager who fell in love with farm life.' His role involved maintaining the property and taking care of the horses each day. Mr Battuello and wife Lauren were high-school sweethearts who had been together for nine years before getting married. Mr Battuello's lawyer paid tribute to his client saying: 'He was a wonderful, loving young man who had his whole life ahead of him. He was an exceptionally warm, generous human being, and his life was destroyed by a drug that ended up being destroyed on an order from the FDA.'","Todd Battuello was taking pill to help lose weight .

Firefighters discovered the victim's naked body slumped over a wheelbarrow full of firewood inside the burning garage at her £750,000 property called Parklands in the Cheshire village of Cranage. Police said she had been killed then mutilated by Ryan in an attempt to destroy evidence of that they had sex the previous night. The night after the killing he spent the night drinking cocktails and beer with a friend at his local pub. Married Ryan - a neighbour of Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell - had met Diana whilst targeting wealthy women enjoying ceroc and modern jive dance classes at the Cinnamon Rooms in Bowdon, Cheshire. He had already had an an affair with one local teacher and had pestered another woman to have a fling with him whilst they were dancing together at the weekly classes. During their 18 month fling Ryan and Diana - who ran an up market cattery - would have secret trysts and he would ring her her from a telephone kiosk near his home in Hale to arrange their rendezvous - whilst his unsuspecting wife Karen, 50 was at home. But penniless chancer Ryan had debts of £90,000 and had had his £200,000 home repossessed after the failure of his double glazing and conservatory business. Ms Lee, 54, suffered fatal injuries in the attack at her luxury cattery in a large gated property, where she was put in a wheelbarrow and set alight . Divorcee Mrs Lee - who had been nursing a traumatic relationship break up - was thought to have become besotted with Ryan and withdrew £70,000 from her account to help him with his mounting debts - and invest in a fictitious business he said he was setting up . He later frittered away the cash he took from Diana on designer clothes, exotic holidays, a puppy, extravagant purchases for his rented terraced home, and even used the money to fund his wife's IVF treatment. He also had a secret pot of £60,000 cash stored at his home, stuffed in socks, hidden under his wardrobe and in his drawers. It emerged over the course of many years Ryan had borrowed money from virtually every friend, family member or associate - only to fail to pay it back. Today at Chester Crown Court he was convicted of murder following a seven week trial. He denied murder and will be sentenced tomorrow. Criminal: The killer admitted he had sex with Ms Lee in the back of her abandoned Vauxhall Corsa (pictured) on the night before her body was found, but had denied murdering her . After the case Assistant Chief Constable Ruth Purdie of Cheshire Police said: 'David Ryan gave Diana attention and affection and preyed on her trusting and kind nature for his own ends. 'We now know that his intentions toward Diana were fuelled by greed and Ryan's intention to exploit her financially to try and recover himself from the mountain of debt he faced. Grim discovery: A forensics officer at the murder victim's house last year . 'We have been left in little doubt that Ryan's attack on Diana - a diminutive and gentle lady, was brutal and sadistic. He showed contempt and compounded his disregard for her when he did his utmost to remove DNA evidence and then destroy her body. 'Although Ryan refused to admit his guilt in this horrific murder, the prosecution were able to prove that he concocted a web of lies and brutally murdered a woman who had done nothing more than fall for the charm of a con-man'. Diana was last seen alive on the evening of 8 August last year, when she met a group of friends for dinner at a Chinese restaurant in nearby Knutsford. She left the restaurant and went to meet Ryan nearby before driving him back to her home. The couple has sex after which Diana was battered with a blunt instrument in the bathroom. Ryan then dragged her body and her bedding to the garage and set four fires in the building in a bid to destroy any evidence that connected him to the killing. Ryan even used Diana's mobile phone to send hoax text messages to clients asking them to delay dropping off their pets that morning, to bide himself time at the scene of the crime. He fled the scene in Diana's silver Vauxhall Corsa, before making attempts to set fire to it in Mobberley and continuing his escape on her pushbike. Calculated: The murderer fled the scene in Diana's silver Vauxhall Corsa and then continued his escape on her pushbike, which also dumped (pictured) The prosecution described Ryan as 'devious' and a 'conman' and said he targeted Ms Lee when he was 'at a particularly low ebb' due to his spiralling debt . The following morning, the victims brother Colin Sherwin, a local farmer, visited Diana at her home, found the detached garage beside the property blowing out plumes of smoke and called for help. It emerged Ryan had tried to 'frame' Mrs Lee's lodger for the murder by slashing the victim's dressing gown, covering a knife in her blood and planting her underwear in his room. Police were led to Cinnamon Dance Club and Ryan after examining Mrs Lee's mobile phone. At the time he denied being in a relationship with Diana Lee, but later admitted having sex with her in her car on the night of her disappearance. He denied killing her saying he was watching the Olympics on TV at the time of her death. But bloodied footprints were found by forensics teams in Mrs Lee's home matching the unusual brand of Italian boots worn by the defendant. His DNA was also found on her body. Ryan described their relationship to police, claiming he and Ms Lee were 'friends with occasional sex' Ryan's wife Karen Ryan later revealed she woke up alone on the morning of Mrs Lees death and did not recall seeing her husband until two hours after the time of the murder. In a statement the dead woman's family said: 'It is hard enough to deal with the death of a loved one through sickness, accident or old age but Diana's death was planned. 'Every effort, calculated and brutal, was made by the perpetrator to try and ensure he could not be traced. 'David Ryan has only showed himself to be a coward. He has lied to try and explain away his barbaric crime. He feels no remorse or regret. His selfishness and indifference is no more than contempt for the life he has cruelly snubbed out and the family he has destroyed. 'Diana was a quiet and unassuming person. Nobody had a bad word to say about her. She was a loving daughter and sister. She had a wide circle of friends. She is sorely missed by everyone she knew. She has a left a hole in ours and many people's lives'.","David Ryan battered wealthy businesswoman lover Diana Lee to death .

Lost her femininity: Claire lost all her body confidence after a botched boob job left her with scarred and deflated breasts . 'I was horrified, it looked to me like what they had put in was just hanging out from the bottom of her breast,' her mother commented after seeing her daughter following the combined breast lift and enlargement surgery. 'My implant was actually falling through,' Claire added. Claire was taken to hospital where an emergency operation to remove all the infected skin and the implants left her with little breast tissue. 'I was distraught, I thought I'd lost all my breast. I had the surgery because I wanted it to look more feminine and I ended up with nothing,' she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:06 EST, 26 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:55 EST, 26 July 2013 . A Utah judge has ruled that a man accused of killing his four-year-old stepson can stand trial for murder charges. Prosecutors, who claim Nathan Sloop and his wife starved and abused the boy for several days until his death in May 2010, plan to seek the death penalty. Four-year-old Ethan Stacy's body was found, with his face disfigured from hammer blows, in mountains. The makeshift grave had been sprinkled with dog food. In court: Nathan Sloop listens as a judge rules that there is enough evidence for him to stand trial for aggravated murder . Sloop, 34, was ordered on Thursday to stand trial for aggravated murder, child abuse, obstruction of justice and desecration of a body. After a preliminary hearing in March, Judge Glen Dawson was asked by the prosecution consider the constitutionality of 'Shelby’s Law,' a 2007 amendment to Utah’s homicide statute that allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The law allows the sentence to be handed down in cases where a child dies as a result of abuse. The prosecutors would not have to prove the killing was intentional, only that it was a 'reckless indifference to human life'. Sloop's defense lawyers are trying to . challenge the law under which the prosecution is seeking the death . penalty, according to the Huffington Post. They argued that the hearing in March was only preliminary and that their full case had not yet been heard. However, the judge said it was too early to hear constitutional arguments about the death penalty. Sloop, from Farmington, Utah, who is due back in court on August 13, pleaded guilty to charges last year, but later invoked his right for a judge to hear testimony and evidence to determine whether there was probable cause for a trial. His wife, Stephanie, who is also accused of contributing to her son's death, is awaiting trial. Ethan had traveled from his home in Virginia, where he lived with his father, Joe Stacy, to stay with his mother as part of a custody agreement. Accused: Nathan Sloop is accused of killing his four-year-old stepson, Ethan, whose body was found in mountains . During a preliminary hearing earlier this year, a medical examiner testified that Ethan died from a combination of too many over-the-counter medications, pneumonia and severe burns, likely caused from hot water in a tub. A burn specialist testified that the injuries would have left the boy dehydrated and nauseous and caused his skin to blister and fall off. The burns would have required skin grafts and weeks of hospital treatment. Dr Jeffrey Saffle said. The child's face was beaten beyond recognition . with a hammer, his body was burned and dog food was sprinkled over him. He had allegedly also been starved and bruised. Innocent: Officials said Ethan suffered about 10 days of severe abuse, including starvation, burning and beatings . Accused child murderer: Nathan Sloop arrives for the first day of his preliminary hearing on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, at Second District Court in Farmington, Utah . At a hearing in March defense attorneys said that though the parents did not seek the right . medical treatment, they did try to get help for the boy. The evidence showed the Sloops had . asked their chiropractor how to treat Ethan’s second-and third-degree . burns, along with how to handle Ethan’s behavioral issues, according to . the Salt Lake Tribune. The chiropractor, who never examined . Ethan, told them to put honey on the wounds and give the boy oregano oil . to control the behavioral issues. Defense attorney Richard Mauro said: . 'They thought that Ethan was sick. They believed that he was ill and . they thought he had an allergy. They were giving him over-the-counter . medications and they ended up harming him more than they were helping . him.' The court also heard about . the amount of prescription medication that Sloop was taking in . the months before Ethan died, during the preliminary hearings. According to a Department of Professional Licensing document, which . tracked all of the narcotics that the 34-year-old was prescribed, he was . given 4,146 pills in an 11-month period including Lortab, Valium, Percocet, an antihistamine and anxiety medication. Crime and punishment: Nathaniel Sloop, left, could face the death penalty for allegedly beating his stepson, four-year-old Ethan Stacy, right, to death in 2010 while the boy was staying with his biological mother . At the hearing in March the court heard disturbing video recordings, phone calls and horrific messages about how the Sloops would allegedly treat Ethan and how they would have to 'break his ego'. In addition to capital murder, the . defendant also faces charges of obstructing justice and intentionally . inflicting serious injury on a child, and desecration of a dead body, Desert News reported. Prosecutor David . Cole told the March hearing that Ethan was scalded, beaten, over-medicated and not given the medical care that he needed. The defense argued the boy was given too much Benadryl, Tylenol and decongestant and died from dehydration. The court heard tapes where Sloop told police he would slap the child, make him stand with his nose against the wall and once pushed him into scalding water. Courtroom procedure: Judge Glen Dawson, left, set the pretrial hearing for Sloop, right, for March 27-29 . Two homes: Ethan Stacy pictured with his biological father Joe Stacy . The court also heard a jail-house . phone call at the hearing in March to his mother when Sloop called Ethan 'poison' that sunk his . relationship with the child's mother 'like a battleship'. He . also said the boy was disobedient and misbehaved, often sneaking from . his room and turning on video games or going to the refrigerator. In a . short video that was shown during the March hearing, Ethan can be seen looking dishevelled . with some redness on his cheek. He says to the camera: 'I'm having fun . with Nathan. He's not scary anymore.' In . an audio recording also played in court, Sloop can be heard . asking Ethan numerous times whether he wanted to stay in Utah or return . to live with his father in Virginia. He repeatedly asked the boy if his . father was mean or hurt him. 'Where do you want to live?' Sloop asked. Through tears and wheezing, Ethan croaks back: 'My mom, my mom, my mom.' Accused: Nathan Sloop, left, and his wife and Ethan's biological mother, Stephanie Sloop, right, reported the boy missing a day before his disfigured and burned body was discovered in a shallow grave near a ski resort . Heart-breaking: The Sloops allegedly left the boy beaten and locked up at home when they married in May 2010 . Investigators say that on the day of Nathan and Stephanie Sloop's wedding May 6, the child was locked in an apartment bedroom on his own because the couple feared people would call police if they saw the toddler's injuries. Following her arrest, Stephanie Sloop told police that on May 7, 2010, she got a call from her husband saying that her son had burned himself while taking a bath, according to CBS News. When the mother reached home, probable cause documents state she found Ethan with severe burns to his feet and along the back of his legs. She also noticed what she described as human feces in the four-year-old's mouth. She told police that she did not seek medical help for her injured son because she was afraid that Sloop would harm her if she tried to do so. On Mother's Day, May 10, 2010, the couple reported the boy missing after discovering that Ethan had died, according to prosecutors. The Sloops told police that the toddler wandered out of the apartment in Layton. However, the following evening, the child's remains were discovered wrapped in plastic and dumped in a shallow grave near Powder Mountain in Weber County.

Dr Judith Ames (right), began a romance with Robert Owens (left) days after his wife succumbed to lung cancer . A doctor who fell in love with the husband of a patient who had died and risked her career to be with him was found to have abused her position as a GP today. Dr Judith Ames, 52, began a relationship with Robert Owens, 66, days after Joyce Owens succumbed to lung cancer and they became engaged a fortnight later. The doctor knew she faced possible censure from her colleagues and governing body but was prepared to quit her job to be with Mr Owens. Every day the couple, who are due to be married in a few weeks, held hands as they arrived at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. The tribunal panel today found Dr Ames’ actions were sexually motivated and amounted to an improper use of her position as a doctor. During the hearing Mr Owens is referred to as ‘Mr X’ and his late wife as ‘Patient A’. Dr Ames wiped away a tear as the findings were read out, but defiantly left the hearing room hand-in-hand with her husband-to-be. ‘The panel inferred that sexual motivation was an element of embarking on and developing what you described in your oral evidence as an “emotional” and “romantic” relationship. The panel determined that although this may not have been the primary motivation it was a factor,’ said tribunal chairman Gareth Davies. ‘The panel has determined that proceeding with an emotional relationship with Mr X while he was still a patient of your practice was an improper use of your position as a GP,’ he added. ‘The panel are of the view that had it not been for your professional relationship with Patient A, you would not have met Mr X in these circumstances.’ The hearing was told that Mr Owens was 'in the driving seat' of the relationship but the panel ruled that he was vulnerable following the recent death of his wife. Mr Davies added: ‘His intent to proceed so rapidly and so soon after his bereavement should have alerted you to Mr X’s vulnerability. ‘In drawing your conclusion that Mr X was not vulnerable, the panel took the view that you placed too much weight on Mr X’s self-assessment and allowed no time for reflection or further observation before entering into an emotional relationship.’ The doctor knew she faced possible censure from her colleagues and governing body but was prepared to quit her job to be with Mr Owens . The panel will now decide if her actions amounted to misconduct and if her fitness to work as a doctor is impaired. If so she could face sanctions by her governing body which could include a ban from the profession. Dr Ames, a divorced mother-of-three, was working at the Mannamead surgery in Plymouth when Mrs Owens attended the practice complaining of dizziness. She was later diagnosed with cancer and Dr Ames became a frequent visitor to the family home. Dr Ames said she could not help becoming emotionally involved with Mrs Owens and her family. ‘I found it very rewarding because there was a patient who I could make a difference to her suffering,’ she said. Dr Ames was working at the Mannamead surgery, in Plymouth, (pictured) when Mrs Owens attended the practice complaining of dizziness . She added: ‘I found Robert very impressive as a carer, as a very logical man who wanted to care for his wife to the best of his abilities.' When Mrs Owens passed away on Thursday, March 8, 2012, Dr Ames visited their home and said there was ‘a sense of relief’ among the family because of their ‘strong Christian faith’. Although it was not her practice to attend patients’ funerals, Mr Owens sent her a text on the day to remind her while she was on holiday in India. 'The panel inferred that sexual . motivation was an element of embarking on and developing what you . described in your oral evidence as an “emotional” and “romantic” relationship' - Tribunal chairman Gareth Davies . When Dr Ames returned to the UK on March 22 she arranged to pay a ‘bereavement visit’ to Mr Owens, who had already returned to work, at the marital home. After talking about the death of Joyce for around half an hour the conversation turned to Dr Ames’ holiday. ‘We talked about everything we wanted to talk about. He then said ""I would like to thank you very much for that it was very helpful. I have no further need for help or counselling"",’ said Dr Ames. ‘I think he recognised the professional boundaries and said ""now can we leave that? Can we finish that professional relationship? And now I would like to hear about your holiday"".’ Mr Owens met Dr Ames the following day, a Sunday, so the GP could keep her promise to Mrs Owens to attend church with her husband after her death. Dr Ames called the General Medical Council herself to discuss the implications of her relationship . ‘I realised I was developing strong feelings for him and a very strong connection of spirit and mutual intuition,’ she said. ‘I was very concerned about my professional position, which is very important to me,’ said Dr Ames. By Tuesday Mr Owens had proposed, and the couple were making practical plans to pursue the relationship. Mr Owens explained how the whirlwind romance with the medic had blossomed after they discovered a shared ‘free spirit.’ ‘I have found in Judith my fiancee,’ he said. ‘I recognise on the day we met, March 24, I was attracted to the qualities of compassion and care she had shown my wife and given the best treatment possible to her.' Mr Owens explained how his Christian faith allowed him to ‘live for the moment’ enabling him to cope with the death of his wife. He added: ‘I have this mental attitude that I live for the present. I live with a very strong faith and relationship with God and I’m able to deal with things very quickly when they happen. I cared for my wife in her dying days. ‘Once she is dead, in my understanding, that’s it. I move on.’ Dr Ames and her new partner both moved quickly to deal with practical aspects of the relationship. Mr Owens applied to be transferred to another practice and on March 30 Dr Ames spoke to a colleague, Dr Peter Leman, about the relationship. She told him she was willing to face the consequences and would accept a period of suspension from her professional regulator. The GP called the General Medical Council (GMC) herself to discuss the implications of her relationship. Dr Ames resigned her post at the Mannamead surgery at the request of her colleagues, but has since found another position at the Stoke surgery, in Plymouth. The hearing continues.","Dr Judith Ames and Robert Owens started relationship after his wife died .

Shopkeeper Giorgos Xedakis said: ‘They have been telling us someone was going to die.’ Malia mayor Zacharias Doxastakis added: ‘It’s not just this –  we have also had a big problem with rapes.’ But relatives of those who have been arrested claim Greek police simply rounded up everyone who had visited the club that night, irrespective of whether they had been involved or even there at the time of the brawl. The mother of one of the Britons arrested said: ‘My son didn’t know the man who died, and wasn’t there when it happened – he had left  earlier with some girls. But they arrested him and put him in handcuffs to take him to court.’ Another mother said: ‘My son was privately educated and he is a stockbroker. He had nothing do with it but has been arrested anyway.’ Litchmore-Dunbar is studying towards an economics degree  at Northampton University, according to a profile on a modelling website. A tourist who met him in Crete said: ‘He didn’t seem like trouble at all. He was very laid-back and relaxed. I don’t believe this is anything to do with gang  violence. I think it was over something really petty.’ A British tourist with blood on his T-shirt is taken to a prosecutor today after Tyrell Matthews-Burton was fatally stabbed - today a relative of his said he was a friend of Tyrell who had tried to help his fatally injured friend . Handcuffed and with blood on his top, a British tourist covers his face as he arrives in Heraklion Court on Crete . The young Britons appeared in Heraklion Court this morning in relation to the incident in Malia yesterday . Police said there had been a mass brawl involving up to 30 Britons outside the closed bar in the resort . Handcuffed together, the young British tourists were hauled before the court on the holiday island today . The resort of Malia was the setting for . the 2011 comedy film The Inbetweeners Movie, in which four young men . went on a ‘lads’ holiday’. BBC DJ Tim Westwood, who performed in Malia on Monday, tweeted about the death yesterday, calling Tyrell by what is thought to be his nickname, Sterling. He wrote: ‘Saddest nite in Malia. RIP Sterling – deepest sympathies to the family and friends.’ More than 60 of the 250 gangs in London are considered dangerous by the Met Police and commit half of shootings and a fifth of serious violence in the capital. Relatives of some of those arrested said police had simply rounded up everyone who had visited the club that night . The Britons were taken to appear before the prosecutor today, a day after Mr Matthews-Burton died in Malia . The man was found dead in front of a closed bar after being stabbed in the chest . Policemen enter their vehicle outside the place where a 19-year-old British tourist was found dead. Another British tourist of the same age was arrested today . In most areas, gang members carve up the streets according to postcodes, with names such as the Leytonstone Man Dem  and the Catford Wildcat. Teenage gang members regularly boast about their activities  by posting videos posing with weapons on YouTube. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Malia, Greece, on July 23. ‘We are aware of the arrests of a number of British nationals. ‘We are in touch with the local authorities and stand ready to provide consular assistance.’ DJ Tim Westwood tweeted after the young man died during a night out in the Cretan holiday resort of Malia .

A taxi driver could lose his cab licence after refusing to take a fare because the passenger had a guide dog. James Chesney, 53, was fined £1,000 for telling the customer his boss would ‘go ballistic’ if the golden retriever was allowed into the car. The driver claimed Desmond Baldwin's guide dog, Denby, could cause the daughter of one of the other drivers to have an allergic reaction. Chesney, from Droylsden, Tameside, was charged under the Equality Act with refusing to take a pre-booked disabled passenger because he was accompanied by an assistance dog. Taxi driver James Chesney, pictured left, has been found guilty of breaching the Equality Act for refusing to pick up blind customer Desmond Baldwin, pictured right, from his house because he was with his guide dog Denby . He denied the offence but was found guilty by Manchester magistrates after a three-hour trial. He was fined £300 and ordered to pay £800 costs. The court heard how Mr Baldwin had pre-booked the taxi to go for a meal with friend Stephen Kingsberry, who is also blind, at The Pearl restaurant in Audenshaw on June 24. Laura Raine, prosecuting on behalf of Manchester council, said that when Chesney arrived he refused to take the fare, stating his boss would ‘go ballistic’. Mr Kingsberry’s carer Pauline Harrop told magistrates she was ‘100 per cent sure’ that Chesney refused to take them on those grounds. Chesney said he believed the car was exempt from taking guide dogs because his colleague - who also drove the vehicle - had a poorly daughter who may be allergic to dogs. Trial: Chesney denied the charge - claiming he was exempt from taking guide dogs as another driver who used the car had a daughter with a dog allergy, but he was found guilty at Manchester Magistrates' Court, pictured . But he also claimed he was about to take the men to the restaurant when another cab, from Hastings taxis, the same company, pulled up and took them. James Street, defending, told the court the firm had sent another car as a replacement and added: 'He didn’t refuse the job, he queried it, and when he was told to go (and do the job) he did it.' Magistrates ruled that Chesney ‘appeared confused by the sequence of events’ when he gave evidence in court, while Mr Baldwin and Miss Harrop were ‘clear and concise’. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Baldwin, 59, from South Elmsall, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire, said: 'I’m glad he’s been found guilty. It’s over with now, and let’s hope it reminds the other taxi drivers they can’t refuse people with guide dogs.' Mr Kingsberry, who made an official complaint which sparked the investigation, added: 'I believe everyone who has a guide dog has the right to go where they want.'","Desmond Baldwin, who's registered blind, ordered the taxi from a local firm .

Heartbreak: The child was found still locked in her car seat and was rushed to hospital but paramedics were unable to revive her . Tragedy struck just before 1.30pm Wednesday when Katie Luong approached her SUV parked on 19th Street and Oxmoor Road on Homewood, only to discover her baby daughter unresponsive inside. The child was still strapped into her car seat. Searing heat: Gabriella was just days away from her first birthday . First responders who arrived on the scene attempted to revive little Gabrielle before taking her to Children's of Alabama hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later. According to a local business owner, the child's family operate Genesis Nail Spa. Her mother, 31-year-old Katie Luong, usually takes the daughter to a day care center, but on that morning, she had too many things on her mind. The witness said that the toddler was locked inside the vehicle from 10.30am to 1.30pm. The temperature outside was around 91 degrees that day, but inside the car it was closer to 130, police said. On Thursday, Gabriella's mother stated to AL.com that she blames no one but herself for her daughter's death. ‘I . want to tell everybody that I wish I was in that car seat, not her,’ Katie Luong said. ‘If I had to die for her to live, I would have done . that.’ The inconsolable . mother explained that she was supposed to drop her daughter off at a . babysitter's house Wednesday but was preoccupied by thoughts of an . employee who recently hung himself and a close family friend who had a . stroke and is still hospitalized.

Death crash: Victoria McClure, 38, killed a cyclist after taking her eyes off the road while she fiddled with her sat-nav, Reading Crown Court heard . A mother killed a cyclist after taking her eyes off the road for almost 20 seconds as she fiddled with her sat-nav in her car, a jury heard yesterday. Victoria McClure, 38, 'drove blind' as she attempted to use the zoom function on the device while driving down a 60mph road, the court was told. There was no evidence that she braked before crashing into 46-year-old cyclist Anthony Hilson near Twyford, Berkshire, on a long straight section of road, the jury heard. Mr Hilson, who was out for an early Sunday morning ride, died after suffering 'devastating and unsurvivable' injuries. McClure, who was on the way to a baby shower, has admitted causing death by careless driving but denies the more serious offence of causing death by dangerous driving. Prosecutor Matthew Walsh said motorists on the A4 Bath Road where the married father was killed would have typically had about 500m of clear visibility. 'Assuming for a moment she's . travelling at the speed limit of 60mph, it takes about 18 seconds to . cover the distance - that's the length of time she would have had the . cyclist in her view,' he said. 'In other words, she had a window of . about 18 seconds - maybe more, of course, if she was going slower - . approaching the cyclist in order to see him. 'But she didn't. Did she try and take any avoiding action, braking or steering? 'Well, from the witnesses that were in the general area, nobody heard the sound of braking or horns or anything of that nature. 'There weren't any skidmarks on the road to suggest emergency braking or any evasive action.' McClure was at the wheel of her Honda Accord when she crashed into the cyclist on September 16 last year. The jury was told steering lightly to the right would have been enough to pass Mr Hilson as he travelled in the same direction on his Specialized road bike. McClure said at the roadside and in a police interview that she had taken her eyes off the road to use her sat-nav, the court heard. She allegedly told police officers she had been zooming in on her sat-nav and added: 'I looked up and it was too late. In the blink of an eye I just hit him. I didn't think I was going that fast.' There was no suggestion McClure had been speeding, Mr Walsh added. During her police interview she was asked if she could offer any explanation as to where Mr Hilson had come from. She replied: 'I think the cyclist was there all the time. I think I just didn't see him.' McClure had admitted causing death by careless driving, Mr Walsh told jurors. 'In other words, she accepts she caused Mr Hilson's death that day, she says by careless driving. 'The prosecution say it goes beyond that, it was more than careless driving - it was dangerous driving. Crash scene: The accident happened on a long straight section of the A4 Bath Road (pictured) near Twyford, Berkshire, the court was told . 'To in effect drive blind for upwards of 18 seconds is dangerous driving.' A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Hilson had died of severe head and chest injuries. Mother-of-two McClure wept in court today as she recalled the moment she collided with the cyclist after taking her eyes off the road 'for milliseconds'. She said between sobs: 'There was no time to do anything - swerve or brake. 'For the cyclist, for his family, I don't stop thinking about it and I feel very sorry about it.' McClure, a paediatrician turned . housewife, told the jury how she noticed the map on her satnav was more . zoomed in than normal after her children had been playing in the car. While continuing to drive, McClure tried to zoom it out to see the route it was taking her to in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. She added: 'It looked as if it was going to take me and hour to get to Berkhamsted rather than 45 minutes. Accused: McClure outside court where she is standing trial accused of causing death by dangerous driving. She has already admitted the less serious charge of causing death by careless driving . 'It was zoomed in. I could only see the road but nothing more...I wanted to see the entire road on the screen to see which way it was sending me. I glanced at it for milliseconds.' McClure said she pressed the zoom out button and 'looked straight back at the road'. She then 'glanced' back at the satnav and realised it hadn't zoomed out enough. 'It was always at different zoom levels at different times. The children when the car was parked often fiddled with the satnav so it could be anything,' she explained. 'I pressed the zoom out button again. I looked down to press the button and looked straight up.' McClure then suddenly burst into tears as her defence barrister Alistair McDonald continued: 'Had you seen the cyclist before?' 'No, I hadn't,' she replied, adding: 'He was on his bicycle. He was on it, but I didn't see anything else. 'There was no time to do anything - swerve or brake,' she trailed off as she burst into floods of tears. The jury heard how McClure was 'hysterical' by the roadside after the crash and told stunned witnesses: 'What have I done? I have probably wrecked some lives. If I have, how am I going to live with this?' McClure, of Charvil, Reading, denies a single count of causing death by dangerous driving but has admitted causing death by careless driving. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Victoria McClure, 38, was 'attempting to zoom on her sat-nav on a 60mph road in the moments before the crash'

The grass has disappeared as groundsmen at the SW19 club strip the courts to resow them. The team, led by head groundsman Neil Stubley, are tasked with the arduous job of keeping the lawns at the All England Club in perfect condition. Barren wasteland: The crowds have disappeared from Wimbledon - and so has the grass . Groundsmen use specialist Koro machinery to strip away the grass and prepare the soil for the new seed . Every inch of the courts is painstakingly tended to by a team led by Neil Stubley . The famously green court looked barren as work was carried out to replace the grass . The court was constantly tended throughout the championships but showed some wear by the time Andy Murray won the men's singles final . As well hand-weeding, rolling and mowing the grass to 8mm every day during a tournament, staff also have to replace the grass every summer. They use specialist machinery to take up the grass, remove weeds and till the soil, before laying the new seed. Wimbledon courts are laid with a mix of perennial rye grass designed especially for them by seed company Limagrain, followed by a controlled-release fertiliser made by Everri to speed up growth. Finally, the edges of the courts are sprayed with a herbicide to stop the growth of Poa Annua - a meadow grass which spreads quickly and would disrupt the perfect surface of the courts.

The grass caused controversy at this year's Wimbledon when several high-profile stars, including Maria Sharapova, blamed the surface for players slipping during matches. But Mr Stubley insisted that the grass was exactly the same high quality as it has always been. Wimbledon will host a number of events before next year's championships .

"By . Jack Doyle and James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 17:29 EST, 26 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:01 EST, 26 July 2013 . Soca chairman Ian Andrews has refused to publish the list of private firms and individuals who hired corrupt private investigators . Global banks and big City institutions paid corrupt private detectives to carry out spying missions in Britain in the run-up to the financial crisis. International banking institutions dominate a list of 102 companies and named individuals who hired private investigators engaged in hacking, blagging and stealing private information. The revelations are a further blow to the reputation of a finance sector mired in a string of embarrassing scandals. The list, compiled by the Serious Organised Crime Agency, is also said to contain the name of a person so famous, ‘you’d have to live down a rabbit hole in the Arctic not to have heard of them’. In addition, the Mail understands at least one of the companies which appears on the list appears on the FTSE100, the stock exchange list of top companies in Britain. The list was compiled by Soca as early as 2008, just as the global banking crisis gained pace – leading to multi-billion-pound State bail-outs of banks in the UK and elsewhere and ultimately the collapse of the world economy. Following the phone hacking revelations, the Press was subjected to a full public inquiry at the hands of Lord Justice Leveson into all its activities. At the same time the Metropolitan Police launched its biggest ever investigation, into the alleged wrongdoing by journalists. But no police investigation has been conducted into the reckless lending at the heart of the financial crisis. Bankers have also emerged largely unscathed from subsequent scandals such as the fixing of the Libor rate. This week, pressure has been heaped on the police for their failure to pursue those who commissioned private eyes to snoop on their behalf. Soca is insisting that the list of 102 names remains secret, on the grounds that it could damage both the commercial reputations and human rights of the companies and individuals involved. They also claim it is ‘entirely possible’ the private investigators acted illegally but their clients were ‘entirely unaware’ of what was going on. Yesterday it was reported that the Met Police will also seek to block the release of the list, which was finally handed to the home affairs select committee on Tuesday and is locked in a Westminster safe. Last night a senior backbench Tory MP rounded on Soca, accusing the agency known as Britain’s FBI of ‘excessive secrecy’ and calling for the list to be made public. Secrets: MP David Davis (left) criticised Soca for withholding the information for three years. Keith Vaz (right) chairman of the Commons Home Affairs . Select Committee said 'This affects all manner of organisations' Former shadow Home Secretary David Davis said: ‘Yet again a police agency is hiding behind excessive secrecy. ‘It is simply not acceptable for Soca to withhold information of serious public interest three years after the event under the excuse of an “ongoing police investigation”.’ Committee chairman Keith Vaz has written to the committee’s other MPs to ask for their views on whether they should defy Soca and expose those allegedly involved with jailed private detectives. But no decision on whether to publish the names is likely until Parliament returns from its summer recess in September.","List of 102 companies and individuals who hired private investigators has been compiled .

Standing in a room filled floor to ceiling with old irons, pensioner John Rollins shows his astonishing collection of the trusty household appliance. The 74-year-old has one of Britain's largest collections of irons - amassed during three decades of scouring fairs, antique shops, and auction houses. He now owns a staggering 800 irons - which includes irons in all shapes, makes, sizes and colours, ranging from the first one he ever bought, a box iron right up to modern day steam irons. Astounding: John Rollins from Newark, Nottinghamshire, shows off some of his collection of 800 irons . Prized: Mr Rollins amassed his extraordinary collection of irons over the past 30 years . And his record breaking array of gas irons numbers no less than 240. But his passion for collecting irons has not quite stretched to using them – his second wife Avis, 67, still does all the ironing in the house. 'I suppose the daftest thing is that don’t even iron,' admitted John. 'Avis does all the ironing in our house. I’m absolutely useless at it. 'All of my shirts are pristine hanging in the wardrobe, but it’s nothing to do with me.' Mrs Rollins said: 'John did try but he wasn’t very good at it, he ended up with more creases than when he started. 'I don’t let him use my iron, it’s modern and electric and I don’t let him anywhere near.' Ironic: Mr Rollins confesses to being useless at pressing his clothes so leaves all the ironing to his wife Avis . Restored: Mr Rollins founds many of his collection in poor condition but he managed to restore them to good condition . Neither of Mr Rollins' two children have inherited their father's passion for irons, which was kindled more than 30 years ago. Since then he has been gathering an impressive array of the everyday household item most of us wouldn’t think twice about. It all started back in the 1980s when Mr Rollins had an idea how to make the hearth in his front room look a little less bare. 'I was walking around a scrap yard and I thought I’ll have that flat iron,' he said. 'I paid about a fiver, I cleaned it up and put it in the hearth. Things just grew from there.' Bygone age: Many of Mr Rollins's collection would have been commonplace decades ago but are increasingly rare . History: An old photograph from around the 1900's shows how the irons would of been used in laundry factories . Since then retired engineer Mr Rollins has spent much of his spare time at antique shops and fairs following his passion. He said: ‘I’m six feet tall and they tower above me.' 'I clean and dust them, it’s a bit of a task. There’s a dehumidifier in there to stop them getting rusty. It’s on all the time. 'Many . of them are rusty when I get them, I restore them, coat them in wax, . then put them on display. I think it looks rather splendid.' Cherished items: Mr Rollins has one of Britain's biggest collections of irons which he has amassed over the past 30 years. Spectrum: Mr Rollins's collection includes models in a wide variety of colours . Dedication: Mr Rollins has spent the past 30 years searching for additions to his growing collection of irons . Posterity: Mr Rollins hopes he can preserve a bit of history with his collection of gas irons . But despite the size it’s not the . biggest collection in the country. That honour goes to one of his rivals . in London who has around 1000 irons. 'At the last count I had 240 gas irons and no one else can rival that,' he said. 'People think ""what do you need all those for, you only need one?"" and I suppose they’ve got a point. 'But . for me it’s all about history, for every iron I’ve saved hundreds must . have ended up in skip. I just thing young people should know how people . lived in the past.' Naturally he ended up joining the British Iron Collectors Club. There are about 120 members and they meet twice a year. Rivalry: Mr Rollins, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, has a little friendly competition with other collectors to find the rarest or most prized irons in antiques fairs and sales around the country . Peerless: At last count John Rollins's collection included an unrivaled 240 gas irons . 'For . some people it might seem like the sort of gathering where things could . get a bit flat, but we enjoy ourselves, swapping stories and irons,' explained John. Mr Rollins has always said it would 'make his day' to own a GLC speckled green gas iron. He believes only 10 colours were made. But . he’s not the only one scouring stalls and eBay. 'There’s lots of . competition between members... friendly rivalry you know,' he said. 'There . are a couple of irons I would love to get my hands on, but I won’t say . what they are. People might try and cash in. They are gas irons. That’s . all I’m going to say.'","John Rollins spent 30 years amassing his array of the household appliances .

'Embarrassed': Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has vowed to clean up the Church's portfolio . The Archbishop of Canterbury is to review the Church’s investment strategy, after ‘very embarrassing’ revelations that it has holdings in firms that profit from payday lending, and may have invested in companies involved in arms dealing and pornography. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he was irritated and embarrassed to discover that the Church has indirectly invested in payday loan firm Wonga, which earlier this week he vowed to drive out of business. It also emerged that the Church’s ‘ethical’ rules allow it to invest its £5.2billion assets in firms involved in gambling, tobacco and alcohol. Even firms involved in arms dealing, pornography and human cloning are not barred from receiving Church investment. The Archbishop confirmed the Church had a £75,000 stake in US venture capital firm Accel Partners, which injected capital into Wonga in 2009. The disclosure came less than 48 hours after he revealed he had told Wonga chief executive Errol Damelin that he wanted to drive the firm ‘out of business’ by supporting not-for-profit credit unions. The Archbishop said: ‘What’s clear is that this is an embarrassment. 'We think that the payday lenders charge vastly excessive amounts for the loans they make, that there is a totally inadequate range of choice for consumers in deprived areas. ‘It shouldn’t happen. It’s very embarrassing, but these things do happen. We have to find out why and make sure it doesn’t happen again.’ Lambeth Palace said an independent inquiry would be launched into the Wonga investment to uncover how ‘this serious inconsistency’ occurred. The Church’s investment portfolio is managed by the Church Commissioners, who are not directly controlled by the Archbishop. Under the Commissioners’ rules, they can invest in firms who make up to 25 per cent of their money through payday lending or gambling, up to 10 per cent through arms dealing or up to 3 per cent from pornography. Irritated: Justin Welby was irritated to find that the CoE had invested indirectly in payday loan firm Wonga, which he had vowed to drive out of business earlier this week . The Archbishop said these thresholds should be revisited, adding that the Church ‘shouldn’t be investing in Wonga’. He said: ‘I think we have to review these levels and make sure we are consistent between what we’re saying and what we’re doing.’ Symon Hill, spokesman for the campaign group Christianity Uncut, said revelations about the Church’s investments were ‘extraordinary’. 'I think we have to review these levels and make sure we are consistent between what we’re saying and what we’re doing.' Archbishop Justin Welby . Mr Hill said: ‘It is complicated. Of course, no one is expecting Justin Welby to have every figure from the church accounts in his head. ‘But there is this issue of percentages. The Church of England can invest in a company that sells arms, as long as arms are less than 10 per cent of its business – which in the case of a big company can still be millions of pounds. ‘I think it’s a problem, and with payday lenders it isn’t even 10 per cent, it’s 25 per cent – a sizeable chunk of any company’s business.’ But the Archbishop said it was a ‘complex’ issue, and warned it was difficult to invest in firms that had no controversial operations, such as hotel chains who made money from pornography sold in their rooms. The Church needed to be realistic in accepting that the ‘complexity of the markets means that a lot of companies get involved in things at a very small level, indirectly’. He said it was a ‘valid question’ whether a ‘little sin’ was tolerable, adding: ‘Sin is a bad thing by definition. Just for the record, I’m not in favour of sin.’ The Archbishop revealed that the Church was examining whether it could invest directly in rivals to firms such as Wonga, which have been blamed for driving desperate families into debt by charging annual interest rates of more than 5,500 per cent a year on loans.","Justin Welby to review Church of England's investment strategy .

The gun found near Osama bin Laden's body when he was killed by  U.S. Navy Seals has gone on display at the CIA headquarters. The CIA's collection of unique artifacts from 70 years of major historic events, including bin Laden's gun, are on display to CIA employees only at their secretive base in Langley, Virginia. The AK-47 was recovered from the Abbottabad compound after bin Laden died in a midnight raid in May 2011. Personal weapon: The CIA's collection features this assault rifle found near Osama bin Laden during the raid on his compound in Abottabad . Most wanted: Osama bin Laden, often pictured armed in videos and interviews, was eventually killed by U.S. special forces in May 2011 . It was analysed and found to be a Russian AK-47 with counterfeit Chinese markings. CIA museum curator Toni Hiley told NBC in their exclusive tour of the museum that the explanation for the Chinese markings remains a mystery. The careful planning of the raid is also recorded in the CIA's collection, with the model of the compound that former CIA director Leon Panetta used to plan the mission and part of the life-size mock-up of the compound used to practise the raid, on display. The mock-up of the Abbottabad compound . turned out to be pieced together so accurately from intelligence reports . that when the seals entered 'they said ‘We felt like we'd been there . before,'' Hiley told NBC as she showed them around private museum. Watershed moment: Bin Laden's Pakistani hideout, where the AK-47 was discovered after he was killed . Last pictures: This video seized from the walled compound in Abbottabad, showed some of the last images of bin Laden alive . Careful plans: Another artifact at the CIA's museum is part of the life-size model of the Abbottabad compound, pictured, used to practise the Navy Seals' raid . Tense moment: President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, along with with members of the national security team watching the bin Laden raid from the White House . Although the CIA had thought since . September 2010 that Bin Laden was in Abbottabad, it waited to attack until May 2011. It . found bin Laden's hideout by tracking a man identified as his key courier. When the courier was found in Abbottabad, the CIA began the surveillance . that led to the raid. After careful practice on the CIA's model of the compound, the raid was planned for May. Via a video camera fixed to the helmet of a U.S. Navy Seal, the President and his staff at the White House saw the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks shot in the left eye. The Seal then carried out what is known as a ‘double tap’ – shooting him again, probably in the chest, to make certain he was dead. Following the raid, relations between Pakistan and the West were put under intense strain amid disbelief that intelligence chiefs in Islamabad had no idea Bin Laden was living only 800 yards from the country’s leading military academy. Rare access: The exhibits at CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia are not open to the general public . Pieces of history: CIA museum curator Toni Hiley showing NBC's Richard Engel other remarkable artifacts, such as the Enigma machine . Other recent museum acquisitions from the War on Terror include a partially-burned al-Qaeda training guide to firing surface-to-air missiles found in Afghanistan, as well as the raw lapis lazuli used to pay its members. The displays began in the early 1990s but the . museum's collection starts with the agency's origins running spy . networks in the Second World War when it was known as the Office of Strategic Services, through its Cold War years and right . up to the War on Terror since 9/11. The OSS wing of the CIA’s museum, which . opened in 2011, traces the history of an organisation that was . founded in 1942 to aid resistance fighters before it became the CIA in 1946. The exhibit . from the Second World War period includes counterfeit German postage stamps created by the OSS , the desk of OSS director William 'Wild Bill' Donovan, and a selection of false identification documents, maps and escape equipment. There is a further layer of top secret artifacts that are not on display even within the CIA.","Gun was found near Osama bin Laden when he was killed in Pakistan .

Hearing: Dr David Waghorn was struck off after being found guilty of misconduct after he was caught performing liposuction in basement clinic . A cosmetic surgeon has been struck off after he was found performing liposuction in a dirty Mayfair basement littered with blood-stained swabs and needles. Dr David Waghorn, who had a clinic in Harley Street, was discovered operating in unhygienic conditions without proper safeguards during a spot check by inspectors. He initially tried to stop them from entering the basement by padlocking the door but when he eventually did let them in they found him performing liposuction on a woman whose name, he said, he did not know. The work surfaces were found littered with unsheathed needles, blood stained swabs and discarded latex gloves. A panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found Dr Waghorn had placed the patient at increased risk of infection. A lack of monitoring and resuscitation equipment meant that there was an increased risk of death, it added. Panel chairman Professor Stephen Miller said: ‘The panel is in no doubt that Dr Waghorn’s misconduct resulted in serious risks to a patient, undermined proper standards of professional behaviour and brought the profession into disrepute.’ Expert witness Professor Simon Kay said Dr Waghorn’s clinic was ‘one of the most egregious cases of stepping outside of every boundary’ that he had seen. The hearing in Manchester heard that inspectors from the Care Quality Commission went to the clinic on Dover Street after receiving a tip off that another doctor was disposing of bodily waste. Dr Waghorn's basement clinic was in London's famous Harley Street, but it was unregistered as a clinic . Dr Waghorn had rented the basement – which was unregistered for use as an operating clinic – because other registered premises were unavailable. A woman in her 20s who was being treated at the time of the inspection became upset when she heard he should not have been performing the procedure on her. She fled the premises before being properly patched up. Dr Waghorn later told investigators she was a ‘Jordanian woman’ who had visited him at his Harley Street clinic a few days earlier, but he didn’t know her name. Surgery: A female in her 20s was undergoing liposuction in the clinic when inspectors arrived, but fled when she found out Dr Waghorn was not registered to practice there (image posed by models) Finding him guilty of misconduct, Professor Miller said Dr Waghorn had been found to have a ‘cavalier approach’ to patient safety incompatible with working as a doctor. He was struck off the Medical Register with immediate effect. Dr Waghorn has already been fined £2,500 under the Care Standards Act at Westminster Magistrates’ Court for his work at the basement clinic in March 2010. He set up his own company offering cosmetic surgery procedures after he lost his job working at a private treatment centre in Plymouth. His company, LipoSurgery, advertised it offered treatments in Harley Street, Mayfair and Weybridge. The website stated: ‘Clients rave that our LipoSurgery liposuction procedures are painless and quick (Many patients even return to work on the next day).’","Dr David Waghorn found guilty of misconduct after caught doing liposuction .

Astonishing photos showing British soldiers performing 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum'-style concert parties at a Prisoner of War camp have emerged after nearly 70 years. The images depict the incredibly elaborate theatre productions the men of Stalag 383 put on to keep up the morale of the 4,000 prisoners during World War Two. The sets, costumes, performances and concert programmes were of almost professional standards, with a great deal of time, effort and skill clearly going into creating them. Costumes: This picture shows the effort that went in to the costume and set design for the performances . Productions: John Roberts (left) compiled images of the productions during his time at Stalag in a scrapbook (right) which has emerged after 70 years . The theatrical and musical concerts . were held in a barn-like building the men called the 'Ofladium Theatre', . as the camp had once been an Oflag - a camp for officers. Many . tons of earth were transported and stamped down methodically to form a . sloping floor in the hall to give the audience an unobstructed view. The . photos show servicemen wearing women's clothing, playing female roles . in classics like HMS Pinafore, The Gondoliers and Dick Whittington. They . also highlight a sizeable orchestra playing saxophones, trumpets, tubas . and guitars, tackling numbers like Beethoven's Eroica and music by . Mendelssohn that had been banned by the Nazis. Music Maestro Please: Dennis Whiteley and his Orchestra band in 1944 . Dressing up: Two of the men convincingly dressed up as English ladies in productions at Stalag . The pictures made up a scrapbook . dedicated to the 'Ofladium National Theatre Company' and was compiled by . John Roberts, a leading light of the movement.

Whiteley and a 'National Orchestra' that was conducted by David Laird. Richard . Westwood-Brookes, of Mullock's auction house, said: 'The whole book . provides an almost surreal impression of PoW life in the camp. 'Each . production is featured with a remarkably - almost professionally - . produced programme, with a typed cast list, and stage photographs. Entertainment: A clinching moment between two men, one convincingly dressed up as an English lady, during a show at Stalag . 'Looking at the photographs, one might think it was the West End rather than a PoW camp. 'While . other Allied PoWs were digging tunnels and doing anything to escape, it . seems the inmates at Stalag 383 were having a jolly good time of it. 'And . because there were no women in the camp, the many female roles taken in . the productions had to be fulfilled by the PoWs themselves, and judging . from the many photos, they managed to carry them off with aplomb. 'The . history of the camp bears out the lifestyle they enjoyed. It was almost . exclusively given over to NCOs, and as anyone in the forces knows, a . band of NCOs will always get the best for themselves. 'In . the case of 383, it appears the Germans had despaired of the various . antics of NCOs at other camps in getting out of work duties, so they . were almost exclusively sent to 383 and given the ""fur lined"" treatment. 'Instead of being held in draconian conditions, the inmates enjoyed small dormitory huts housing 14 or fewer. 'They enjoyed sports like cricket, which bemused the Germans, walking and the theatre, which was particularly popular. 'One . inmate wrote home that he was ""14 pounds heavier than when he joined . up"" and many of the German guards helped out their British counterparts, . and gave them information on the progress of the war. 'Events . like World War II carry with them many different stories. The accepted . version of PoW life has been borne out in Hollywood blockbusters like . ""The Great Escape"" and films like ""The Wooden Horse"".

Prized vineyards in Burgundy have been 'catastrophically' damaged after a torrential downpour on Tuesday. As much as 90 per cent of vines in some vineyards could be unusable, creating a ruinous effect on the grape harvest. Hailstorms and high winds caused major damage in the Beaune region, home to five celebrated wine-growing villages, including Pommard, Meursault and Volnay. Damaged crop: The Burgundy village of Meursault, pictured, was one of many wine-growing villages affected in the Côte de Beaune region which stretches over 12 miles . Cecile Mathiaud of the Burgundy Wine Board said the grapes were destroyed in the hail and many vineyards were hit by flooding. Ms Mathiaud explained simply: 'If the grapes burst open, you can’t harvest.' It is thought that in the high-end producing region of Aloxe that 50 per cent of vineyards suffered damage and 40 per cent of Meursault vineyards. Jean Yves Devevey, who runs an eponymous vineyard, described hailstones the size of marbles on his blog today, as he estimated losses in his Beaune vineyard at 70 percent to 80 percent. The region produces some of the most expensive wines in France. A Premier Cru Meursault can change hands for up to £1,050 and a Grand Cru from Aloxe-Corton can cost £150. Winemakers fear they will be able to supply their usual amount and that . the price will have to increase because of the scarcity in 2013-4 vintages. Compounding the effect is the fact that the same area suffered hail last year, already causing high losses. Bad for business: Burgundy wine supplies will be hit for the coming vintage, meaning that the price will have to increase because of the scarcity . Premier cru: Burgundy is home to some of France's most expensive and respected wines, which are now in jeopardy . Caroline Parent-Gros, another local winemaker, said: ‘It’s a really hard blow for the winemakers, especially after 2012, which was already half the usual harvest due to hail.' Jasper Morris, Burgundy director at wine merchant Berry Bros. & Rudd in London warned: 'Some people could go out of business. These guys are working 365 days a year for one harvest to produce something magical, and in a space of two hours, they can lose the lot.'

A jilted husband, who repeatedly stabbed his estranged wife with knives that were given to them as a wedding present, has been found guilty of her murder. Ty Medland, 26, used one of four knives he concealed on himself to launch a 'frenzied attack' on 24-year-old Samantha Medland in central Brighton. Before the attack, Medland uploaded to his Facebook page a link to a series of graphic pictures and videos of the couple having sex. Ty Medland (left) has been found guilty of stabbing his estranged wife Samantha Medland (right) to death . A message he wrote accompanying the link referred to Mrs Medland as 'the cheating, lying, unloyal whore who destroyed everything I loved and believe in'. A two-week trial at Lewes Crown Court heard that she had become close to another man and had rebuffed her husband’s repeated attempts to patch up their marriage. Medland, described as a 'petulant, self-centred man' incapable of dealing with rejection, knifed her to death as she collected belongings from him near her workplace in Queen Square, Brighton, on February 17. Medland, of Cavell Avenue, Peacehaven, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but today he was convicted of murder after six hours and four minutes of deliberation by the jury. He showed no emotion in the dock as the jury foreman announced the verdict, but some members of his family were seen clasping their hands to their mouths and sobbing. Adjourning sentencing until Monday, Judge Anthony Scott-Gall told the jury: 'You have convicted the defendant on the most compelling and overwhelming evidence. 'It was really the most ghastly killing. I’m sure you will never forget it.' The judge said Medland faces life imprisonment with a minimum term of at least 25 years behind bars when he comes to sentence him. Following the verdict, prosecutor Richard Barton read part of a victim impact statement made by Mrs Medland’s mother in which she described her devastation. In happier times: Ty and Samantha Medland first met in 2010, but by earlier this year had become estranged . The statement said: 'My family has been absolutely devastated and shocked that Sam has been taken from us in such a way. 'She was in the prime of her life. We are all still coming to terms with her death. We know us as a family will never get over the loss of Samantha.' Three of the four knives Medland armed himself with were weddings gift, the jury heard.  The fourth, and the one Medland most likely used to fatally stab her, was a lock knife. In a message he wrote to a friend in the minutes before murdering his wife, he wrote: 'The only thing I want right now is murder/suicide.' Ty Medland was found guilty of murdering his wife, Samantha, at Lewes Crown Court . Another . read: 'I could make a joke about murder/suicide but that probably . wouldn’t be funny unless I actually did it', the court was told. When he met his wife he told her that he intended to kill himself. Mr . Barton told the trial: 'Whatever was said, it had an immediate and . dramatic effect. The defendant took out one of the knives, in all . probability the lock knife, and used it to stab Sam. 'As she fell to the ground, he climbed on top of her, pinning her down with his knees.' Ben Kennedy, a friend who had accompanied Mrs Medland, turned to see her collapsing from a distance. He . then realised 'to his horror' that, as Medland was 'softly punching . her', he had a large knife in his hand, Mr Barton told the jury. As a large crowd gathered, Medland used a smaller knife to slash his own wrists and stab himself in the leg. He then asked if he could have a cigarette and a member of the public placed one on a low wall nearby. Police . then arrived to detain Medland before he was taken to hospital. Paramedics tried to revive his wife, who was also taken to the Royal . Sussex County Hospital. Despite . the efforts of medical staff, she was declared dead at 10.02pm from . multiple stab wounds, including to her scalp, forehead, cheeks, neck, . abdomen and back. Two . of the stab wounds penetrated major arteries, one in her shoulder and . one in her abdomen, with a pathologist concluding she bled to death from . those injuries. Toxicology tests found no alcohol or drugs in either Medland or his wife. The court heard that Medland was aware of her growing bond with another man, because he had accessed her Facebook account. Medland first met his wife at a club . in Luton, Bedfordshire, in November 2010, after he travelled from his . home in Sussex to meet a friend. They . 'hit it off almost immediately' through their shared love of heavy . metal and computers and, just over a month later, on Christmas Day 2010, . they got engaged. Two months later, Medland left Sussex to move in with her in Luton. Medland . had trouble finding work in Bedfordshire and, when his wife ran into . difficulties with her job at a hotel, the couple moved to Sussex to live . with his mother, Janet Medland. In . the same period Mrs Medland fell pregnant, but by January last year, at . the time of her first scan, it emerged that she had miscarried, placing . a strain on their relationship. Mr . Barton said Medland was hit with further bad news around the same time . with the death of his daughter from a previous relationship. He started to suffer from depression for which he received medication, jurors were told. Mrs Medland, on the other hand, 'seemed to deal with things rather better'. She . gained new work at warranty company Domestic & General in Brighton, . initially as a call handler, before winning promotion to a supervisory . role. Cross-examined by Mr Barton, Medland was asked: 'The overwhelming preponderance of evidence is that you murdered your wife, didn’t you?' Medland replied: 'No, I did not murder her.' In a statement following the case, Mrs Medland’s mother, Amelia Shah, said: 'My family and I are absolutely devastated and shocked that Sam has been taken from us in such a way. 'She was in the prime of her life. She was young, beautiful, loving, and a wonderful daughter, sister and auntie who we miss terribly.  We are all still coming to terms with her death and miss her so much. The loss is immense. 'No-one should outlive their children. The actions of Ty Medland have caused devastation and heartbreak to my family. Through the court trial I can understand what happened to Sam and how much effort was taken to try and save her. 'We would like to thank everyone who tried to help Sam that night, especially her good friend, Ben Kennedy. We extend those thanks to Sussex Police, ambulance and hospital staff and everyone else who has helped and supported us. I know we, as a family, will never get over the loss of our Sam.' Detective Chief Inspector Mark Preston, of the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said: 'Sam Medland was just 24 when she was murdered by her husband, who she had been married to for just a short time. 'Medland has tried to blame his actions on his severe depression, but the jury has not let him use this as an excuse. 'There were a lot of people in the area at the time who tried to help Sam and I want to thank them and their bravery in attempting to stop Ty Medland from carrying out his vicious attack. 'Our thoughts are very much with Sam’s family who have sat through the trial, hearing very distressing evidence about what happened that night. I hope the verdict brings them some comfort.'","Ty Medland stabbed wife after efforts to patch up marriage were rebuffed .

This is the shocking moment a vulnerable care home resident is allegedly slapped, shaken and shouted at by a worker. The resident is sleeping on a sofa at Selborne Care Home, Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, when the carer attempts to wake him by appearing to slap his stomach and then pull on his ears and nose. During the 41-second incident, the staff member also allegedly shakes and shouts at the man - and clicks his fingers in his face. Worrying: These are the images allegedly showing a vulnerable Birmingham care home resident being slapped, shaken and shouted at by a worker . Concerns: The resident is seen sleeping on a sofa at Selborne Care Home in Birmingham when the carer attempts to wake him by seeming to slap his stomach and then pull on his ears and nose . Police are now investigating the mobile phone footage which was secretly recorded and handed to the force by Esther Lee, 23, a former employee at the home. The care home has also reported the matter to police and has stated the worker in the footage has since left the company. Miss Lee said:  'I want this video out there so that people can see exactly what happened in the home where I worked. 'I secretly recorded the resident being abused and was horrified by what I saw. 'I brought this to management’s . attention on a number of occasions, and tried to work in accordance with . them to raise their standards. And after many months of failed attempts . I felt as though I had no other alternative but to contact the external . bodies. 'I haven’t done this for money, but simply just to raise awareness.' Allegations: During the 41-second incident, the staff member is also apparently caught on camera shaking and shouting at the man and clicking his fingers in his face . Probe: Police are now investigating the mobile phone footage which was secretly recorded and handed to the force by Esther Lee, 23, a former employee at the home . Miss Lee recorded the first clip on June 10, 2012, showing the alleged attack on the resident. A second clip, recorded on June 25, appears to show a distressed female resident seen standing behind a table between two workers. A third video, recorded 20 minutes later, shows her in the same position. The care home said one member of staff has been suspended, while another is on maternity leave. 'I reported what I saw to the Care Quality Commission but there was no action taken that I know of,' said Miss Lee. 'I told officials I had video evidence but they did not ask to see it. 'I also went to Birmingham’s Social Services and again flagged up the videos. But yet again no one asked to see them.' Birmingham . City Council says it has no record of Miss Lee’s complaint. Selborne . Care Home said that management had not received any complaints from Miss . Lee about the treatment of residents. A . spokesman for Selborne Care Home said a member of staff had been . suspended once managers had seen the videos. 'The . company immediately reported the matter to the police and Birmingham . Social Services to initiate the Authority’s Safeguarding procedure,' he . said. 'The company will be . undertaking its own investigation into the actions of the staff involved . following the Safeguarding procedure, which is normal practice. 'The male worker seen in the footage left his employment with the company in September 2012. 'In . regard to the members of staff viewed in the other video footage, one . person has been suspended from duty pending investigation. The second is . currently on maternity leave. Investigation: This image shows Selborne Care Home in Handworth Wood, Birmingham . 'The company will be in a position to answer questions in more detail once the investigations have been completed by all the agencies involved.' Miss Lee left the care home in September and took the company to a tribunal for unfair dismissal, which ruled in favour of Selborne Care. She says she has appealed against the decision. Asked specifically about Miss Lee’s dismissal, Selborne Care said: 'The matter regarding Esther Lee’s dismissal is a private and confidential. 'However, I can confirm that, as a result of her dismissal, Esther brought a claim against Selborne Care for unfair dismissal. The Tribunal found in favour of the Company.' Selborne Care provides care and support for people with learning disabilities and those who may have associated mental health needs. On its website, the company boasts: 'Selborne Care prides itself on being a quality provider of specialist, flexible and innovative care and support for people with learning disabilities. 'We believe the key to successfully meeting the needs of people in our care is the skills, qualities and attitudes of our staff. After a rigorous selection process, all staff complete a full induction programme, followed by ongoing training and supervision to ensure high quality service is achieved.' A spokesman for Birmingham Social Services said: 'Our priority as ever is to protect the welfare of vulnerable people in Birmingham and in the case of Selborne Care Home we have worked with the management team to ensure acceptable standards of care are in place. 'Until recently we had not seen the video footage but we do know that the home management has previously disciplined staff and been very proactive in respect to safeguarding issues. 'With any home we liaise with the residents, their relatives, the CQC and the home if any safeguarding concerns are brought to our attention. 'We openly encourage individuals to voice concerns and we will respond immediately to investigate those concerns.' A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'We have received an allegation of historic abuse from a Birmingham care home. We are in the early stages of an investigation and are currently liaising with partner agencies.' A Care Quality Commission spokesman added: ‘We can confirm the Care Quality Commission received anonymous information regarding Selborne Care Home in Handsworth Wood which related to serious allegations in September 2012. 'This information was immediately referred to Birmingham City Council as the lead authority for investigating safeguarding matters, in line with our usual procedures. CQC has been in regular contact with the council regarding its investigation of these matters and has been monitoring the home closely.

Villagers blocking a rural drilling site earmarked for fracking were dragged away by police yesterday as protests turned ugly. Around a hundred police – including trained riot officers –  were brought in to break up the blockade which was in its second day in the West Sussex countryside near Balcombe. The site, which has been selected for  exploratory drilling by fracking company  Cuadrilla, has attracted a growing number of protesters all week who until yesterday  morning had managed to block all access from the road. Police and demonstrators clash at the protest camp in the Sussex village of Balcombe . The village has become a focal point for campaigners who have highlighted fears linked to fracking . Police said the arrests were made to 'ensure public safety' and came after talks failed . But last night Sussex Police confirmed . that 16 protesters had been arrested after they sat on logs across the . entrance and refused to move. Trucks and equipment for the drilling were then escorted into the site by officers. Anti-fracking campaigners including a . former page three model and the daughter of Pretenders singer Chrissie . Hynde have vowed to mount a round-the-clock campaign of resistance to . the fracking. Natalie Hynde, 30, said she was delighted to be part of the movement and dubbed yesterday’s police reaction ‘over the top’. She said: ‘It was quite distressing . when they started making the arrests. I saw police brutality. Someone . had her ears twisted and thumbs pushed back, it was extremely . upsetting.’ Miss Hynde, who defines herself as a . professional activist, has been protesting at the site entrance for four . days. She said: ‘I think fracking is a dangerous and expensive way of . producing energy when there are opportunities to invest in renewables . instead. It’s a bit like sucking the very life blood out of the planet.’ Anti-fracking campaigners had gathered yesterday for a second day in the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, where Cuadrilla is poised to start test drilling . Cuadrilla said obstacles blocking the road have now been removed and delivery of equipment has resumed . Some protesters have vowed to mount a 24-hour campaign of resistance against fracking . Balcombe has become a focal point for . campaigners who have highlighted fears linked to fracking, including the . use of chemicals. They claim that in a recent survey of local residents . more than 90 per cent were opposed to the drilling. The controversial method of hydraulic . fracturing involves using high-pressure liquid pumped deep underground . to split shale rock and release gas. Villagers Alex Henderson, 68, and . Pamela his wife, 66, joined the protest to protect their home. Mr . Henderson said: ‘We’re concerned about the prospect of hydraulic . fracking and what they may do to the environment.’ Balcombe resident Gemma Hodgson, 34, a . recruitment consultant, said she was worried about the possible water . contamination the fracking might cause. Natalie Hynde (left), daughter of singer Chrissie Hynde, watches while police and demonstrators clash at the protest camp. Campaigners have been highlighting their fears linked to fracking, including the use of chemicals . Police said they aimed to 'provide a safe and secure environment for protesters, residents and the contractors, to minimise disruption to the community and to prevent crime and disorder' The controversial method of hydraulic fracturing involves using high-pressure liquid pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release gas . She said: ‘I’m really shocked that an . area of outstanding natural beauty in Tory heartland can be used as a . pilot for a dirty fuel which potentially can contaminate the water that . at its source supplies the whole of Sussex. ‘I’m middle England, a public . schoolgirl with a master’s degree, in a corporate job, a proper Tory . supporter but they’ve lost my vote and I know they’ve lost the vote of . tens of thousands of others.’ Police broke the blockade at around 11am, . offering protesters the chance to move or be arrested. Some activists criticised the police response as 'disproportionate' Cuadrilla said it hopes to start drilling 'as soon as is reasonably possible' West Sussex County Council granted Cuadrilla planning permission to undertake exploration work in 2010 . Sussex police said the arrests were . made to ‘ensure public safety’ and came after talks between activists . and protest liaison officers failed. Last night Cuadrilla said it was . ‘disappointed’ at the actions of the protesters but that they remained . determined to continue their operations in Sussex and remain poised to . begin drilling next week. In a statement they said: ‘To date, . the vast majority of the protesters have been peaceful and good natured. We are disappointed by the actions of a minority.’ Keith Taylor, Green MEP for the South East, described the protests in Balcombe as a fight between the 'protectors of the land versus the protectors of private profit' Protesters have been camping for two days at Balcombe where an energy company is planning to drill an exploratory bore hole to extract gas by the process known as fracking .

Cancer sufferer Anthea Shaw, 65, had to cancel a trip to the Hotel Riviera in Sidmouth, Devon, because she was dying, but the hotel sent her daughter a bill for the full stay . A hotel sent its lawyers after a grieving daughter to recover £1,200 after she had to cancel a family holiday - because her mother was dying. Anthea Shaw, 65, was diagnosed with cancer in January and booked five nights at the four star Hotel Riviera in Sidmouth, Devon, in June for a final holiday with her relatives. But the retired florist soon became too ill to travel and her daughter Rebecca Wagstaffe, 42, phoned the hotel six weeks before their trip to cancel the booking. Her mother died three weeks later on May 31, and Mrs Wagstaffe expected the £150 deposit to be returned in full. But the hotel demanded £1,266.67 for the full stay because the cancellation was 'short notice'. Mrs Wagstaffe, from Bath, said: 'When you are going through cancer you need something to look forward to. 'My mother didn’t know she was going to die this early.' She is now asking for a formal apology and compensation from the hotel, which told her it would refund the deposit and cancel the fees if she withdrew her complaint on review site TripAdvisor. 'They are obviously embarrassed and ashamed about their business practices and they don’t want it communicated any further,' Mrs Wagstaffe said. 'In the memory of my mother I will continue to fight them until I get an apology because this is unacceptable.' Weeks after Mrs Shaw's death, her daughter received a solicitor's letter threatening possible 'recovery action' if 'full cancellation fees' were not paid within 14 days. The letter said that customers were advised to take out travel insurance and that the hotel had not been able to fill the room. Mrs Wagstaffe is now asking for compensation for having to take time off work to deal with the hotel. She said: 'Out of everything - . arranging the funeral, telling family - this is the most upsetting and . constant piece of administration I have had to go through. 'I don’t understand how in this modern customer service times they can be this rigid and unappreciative. 'Word of mouth is meant to be their bread and butter - this approach is really bad for the British hospitality industry.' The Hotel Riviera said Mrs Wagstaffe was refusing to accept a refund for her £150 deposit and was instead demanding £1,500 compensation. The Hotel Riviera in Sidmouth, Devon, has offered to cancel the fees if Mrs Wagstaffe withdraws her complaint from sites such as TripAdvisor . A spokesman said: 'At the time of the booking they made no mention to the hotel of any health issues. 'As with every customer they were strongly advised at the time of booking to take out insurance in respect of any potential cancellation and declined to do so. 'The booking was cancelled at short notice and the hotel was unable to reallocate the accommodation. 'It is the hotel’s standard practice in those circumstances, as it is across the industry, to invoice and recover cancellation charges. 'A polite and sympathetic request was sent to Mrs Wagstaffe by the hotel and subsequently by the hotel’s solicitors without success. 'Following communications from Mrs Wagstaffe the hotel promptly offered to forego the said cancellation charges and indeed to refund any deposit paid.' The British Hospitality Association said it would always advise customers to read cancellation procedures at the time of booking and take out appropriate insurance. A spokesman said: 'Likewise accommodation providers need to have a clear and simple cancellation policy that they tell customers about at the time of booking.'","Anthea Shaw, 65, booked a final holiday at the Hotel Riviera in Sidmouth .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 06:33 EST, 26 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:05 EST, 26 July 2013 . A prolific sperm donor who advertised himself for ‘breeding parties’ has been ordered to pay £300,000 after fathering a child with a married client during a fling. The man, who claims to have sired 30 children, was ruled the legal parent of a two-year-old boy conceived after an affair. His claim that conception was the result of artificial insemination rather than ‘ordinary sex’ was rejected by the court, which heard he used his fertility to get women into bed. Paying the price: A sperm donor who has fathered more than 30 children must pay £300,000 legal costs after an affair with a client, the High court found . A judge heard that his activity  on an unofficial donation website was designed ‘to meet his own  sexual needs’. The man – known only as Mr F – had . also advertised online for a ‘breeding party – a male-dominated orgy . designed to get a woman pregnant’. At London’s High Court Family . Division, Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that Mr F faces £300,000 in . legal costs as well as paying for the child’s upkeep. He said the donor and the client – . referred to as Mrs M – had an ‘intense extramarital affair’ in 2010 . after they met through a website. The woman had been told the chances . of having a baby were ‘pretty grim’ because her husband had had a . vasectomy and was 30 years older. In March 2010, they met the donor in a . cafe, but the husband was not happy with the plans and left. Ruling: Justice Peter Jackson called the man and woman 'untruthful, devious and manipulative' but agreed her pregnancy was as a result of them becoming lovers . However, three months later Mrs M . spent a weekend at Mr F’s flat, where she claimed they had sex. She . continued to see him and, according to her, they had sex on a number of . occasions. Her husband – who she divorced in . February last year – had been ‘out of his depth and powerless’ as the . fling with Mr F developed, the court heard. The matter came to court when Mrs M . claimed their meetings involved ‘15 days of sex’, while Mr F said they . involved ‘15 donations by artificial insemination’. The judge said: ‘I accept that Mr F . first became involved in licensed donation altruistically and even now, I . do not discount a residual element of altruism in his make-up or forget . that there are many much-wanted children alive today as a result of his . efforts. ‘However, I am clear that in relation . to his website activity his mainspring has been to meet his own needs, . at least at a sexual level.’ Mr F was also said to have ‘engaged . in sexual activity’  with both members of a lesbia  pair who had . approached him via the website. But his prolific sexual activity with . recipients amounted to a ‘brazen flouting’ of the rules of the website, . said the judge. Mr F was ‘bound in his professional life by a clear . code of ethics’, which made the risks he took ‘the more surprising’, he . said. ‘In one relevant period of two  to . three months alone, he was on his own account having sex with three . women and providing artificial insemination to two others,’ added the . judge. ‘Most of these contacts had  to be kept secret from the other women involved. ‘The sheer logistical challenge . alongside his professional life will have been a burden that he would . have been likely to have laid down if he had not been driven on by some . degree of compulsion.’ The judge said the case had revealed . problems in controlling the ‘informal trade’ in fertility treatment. Those seeking to conceive may be in a ‘vulnerable state and not all . donors are motivated by altruism’, he claimed. Career: The man was a licensed sperm donor who apparently used his fertility to get women into bed . ‘Some births follow treatment at licensed clinics and others originate from informal arrangements,’ said the judge. ‘Either way, those involved must often be confronted by profound feelings and powerful forces. ‘These include, relevantly to this case, a yearning for children, a need . for friendship and a hunger for sex, forces that can overpower and . defeat routine social conventions.’ He said the trade in informal donations – which is legal – is not regulated ‘in any meaningful way’. The website in the case – which was not named – charges high fees while . projecting a ‘rose-tinted account of successful, problem-free . conception’, he said. Its cardinal rule was ‘artificial . insemination only’, but Mr F’s  public profile on the site was  said to . openly advertise him as offering ‘artificial insemination and natural . intercourse’.","The man - Mr F - claimed that pregnancy was not a result of sex .

Kieran Knight, 16, was last seen desperately trying to swim back to the beach on an isolated stretch of coast close to the town of Messanges, in the Landes region, south of Bordeaux. He was swimming with his father some 150 meters off from the shore in an unsupervised area where coastguards regularly pitch warning flags when he apparently ran into difficulties.

Missing: Kieran Knight, 16, is believed to have got caught in an undercurrent after going swimming 150 metres off the shoreline by Messanges, pictured, south of Bordeaux, on Wednesday . The Foreign Office issued a statement on behalf of the 16-year-old's family. It said: 'On Wednesday July 24, while holidaying with his family on the Atlantic coast in south-west France, Kieran Knight, aged 16, got caught by a strong undercurrent and was unable to make his way back to shore. 'Despite extensive ongoing searches by the French authorities, Kieran has not been located. Kieran's family would like to request privacy at this time to come to terms with this tragic event concerning their much-loved son.' French officials had said earlier this week that rescue workers were alerted to the boy's disappearance near the town of Messanges, in the Landes region, on Wednesday afternoon. ‘The boy was seen disappearing under the waves,’ said a spokesman from the local coastguards. ‘He and his father had found themselves in difficulty quite a way out to sea, but the boy was unable to get back to the shore. ‘We immediately scrambled a patrol boat and three helicopters, but the boy has not been found. It is feared that he has drowned.’ The coastguards spokesman said that the stretch of coast was ‘extremely dangerous’ because of the fast currents and strong winds. At the time of the accident the weather was good, and the swell was less than one meter high, but there was a ‘very strong’ tide, said the spokesman. Kieran, a sibling, and his mother and father were on the first day of their summer holiday, having just checked into the Vieux-Port camp site close to Messanges.

People who write negative reviews on websites are often a retailer's most valuable and loyal customers, American research suggests. Retail specialists at MIT and Northwestern University found the harshest of critics may not have brought the product they were complaining about, but had strong feelings about a service or brand. The study, which is the first to take an in-depth look at the behaviour of customers who write negative reviews online, has disproved popular theories that peeved competitors or oddball customers make the harshest critics. Professor Eric Anderson of Northwestern University and Professor Duncan Simester of MIT, examined over 325,000 online reviews written by customers of a large clothing company and examined more than 7,219 book reviews on Amazon.com to produce their study, ABC News reported. They used data collected by the websites that made it possible to match reviews to purchases made. The experts concluded that a firm's most loyal customers are also their most negative reviewers, or to quote a French maxim, 'your best friends are also your harshest critics.' Professor Anderson said that no-one had previously looked at the behaviour of individual reviewers before and when they told the clothing company they were receiving negative reviews from their best customers, they were shocked. They also revealed that the harshest critics had not bought the product they were complaining about and around five per cent of product reviews were written by people who had not bought the item they disliked so much. The researchers found that these reviews . were also on average much more negative than the 95 per cent of genuine . reviews by customers who had purchased a product. After much hypothesising, the marketing . experts concluded that reviewers were acting like 'self-appointed brand . managers' who like the company and continue buying from it despite . penning a venomous review. Retail specialists at MIT and Northwestern University found the harshest of critics had often not brought the product they were complaining about but had strong feelings about a service or brand and were trying something new . They found that critics were often complaining about a new product that is slightly different from a company's core offering and want to tell a company if they suspect it is making a bad decision. Professor Simester believes that customers feel the need to lie about buying a product to review it as they are looking for credibility. He told ABC News that many people underestimate the importance of their reviews, which can have a harmful effect on a company's sales. He thinks the findings of the research might prompt companies to insist that reviewers have bought a specific product first before giving their opinion on it.","U.S. study is first to assess behaviour of customers who write bad reviews .

A taxi driver rapist who lured young women into his cab by decking it out with disco lights and sweets was today jailed for 16 years for two terrifying sex attacks. Terry Collins, 61, who was known as the ‘Disco Cabbie’, was told by a judge that he remained a danger to women for as long as he was sexually active. The predator cruised the streets at night looking to entice potential victims into his brightly-lit ‘honey trap’ taxi. The pervert took photos of female passengers in drunken and inappropriately-dressed states using a dashboard camera. In March 2010 he raped a girl of 14 after making her get into his taxi before forcing himself upon her. Two years later he raped a 20-year-old woman reveller after she got into his Citroen Picasso cab at a rank at the end of a night out. Police fear Collins has attacked other women customers in the past but they have never come forward. Fellow cabbies spent three years raising their concerns to the licensing authority about the predator’s suspicious behaviour and his oddly-decorated taxi. Their fears were raised further when he posted a number of his photos of female fares on his Facebook page in June 2011. Officials ordered him to strip out the camera and the disco and strobe lights as well as a collection of soft toys and lollipops, but he kept them up. He went on to attack his second victim after he opened the front passenger door as she staggered towards a taxi rank in Bournemouth, Dorset, during the early hours of March 10 last year. As he drove along, with his eyes on the road, he indecently touched the shocked woman. He then pulled into some darkened garages where he forced her to perform a sex act on him and raped her. Police arrested bespectacled Collins and quickly linked him to the 2010 attack on the 14-year-old. He denied two charges of rape and one count of sexual assault makin his two victims go through the ordeal of giving evidence in front of a jury. Police fear Collins has attacked other women customers in the past but they have never come forward . Grey-haired Collins was found guilty and was today jailed for 16 years. Jailing him at Bournemouth Crown Court, judge Peter Johnson said: 'There is not one shred of remorse whatsoever that emanates from you. 'You are a callous and intelligent man who knew exactly what he was doing and one that enjoys control over women. 'You are a callous and intelligent man who knew exactly what he was doing and one that enjoys control over women' - Judge Peter Johnson . 'You exercised no self-constraint and when asked to stop you carried on. 'You represent a danger to females while you remain sexually active.' Detective Constable James Lees, of Bournemouth police, said afterwards: 'Collins abused the position of trust that he held as a taxi driver and preyed on vulnerable woman. 'There may be more of Collins’ victims yet to speak with police. If they have any concerns about Collins I urge them to contact the police as soon as possible.' Collins’ second victim, a mother-of-one, told of her ordeal. The woman, now aged 21, said: 'I left a karaoke bar in the early hours of the morning and walked to a nearby taxi rank. 'What happened is all a bit blurry but the front passenger door of a taxi was open and ready for me and I just got in. 'We were driving for a little while when he touched me inappropriately. He put his hand down my shorts without taking his eyes off the road. I didn’t say anything to him, I just froze. 'He pulled up to the garages behind my flat and touched me again even though I said ""no"" over and over again. 'I just went numb and and was just thinking about getting out of there alive. All I could think about was my child. 'It lasted about half-an-hour and afterwards I threw a £20 note at him and got out of the car and phoned the police.' The woman said the attack had had a devastating effect on her. She said: 'I couldn’t leave my home for about two weeks and lost two stone in weight. It took a few months for me to even be able to get back in a taxi again.' John Tye, chairman of the Bournemouth Taxi Trades Association, said that licensing officials at Bournemouth council had questions to ask about allowing Collins to remain on the streets for so long. He said: 'Collins was allowed to operate a taxi decked out in such a way to attract young and vulnerable girls. 'Within his car there were extensive disco-type fairy lights and countless cuddly toys right across the dashboard together with a container of sweet lollipops. 'The Trade presented totally unsuitable images of women that were downloaded from his Facebook profile to the licensing board. 'The question has to be asked that had the vehicle not been so high profile and a honey trap, would his victims have been drawn to it?'

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 16:17 EST, 25 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:27 EST, 26 July 2013 . North Korea will put a captured U.S. Navy ship on display this week as part of a new war museum. The USS Pueblo, the only US Navy ship held by a foreign government, will go on display as the crown jewel of a North Korean military museum on Victory Day, which commemorates the signing of the treaty that ended the Korean War 60 years ago. Restored as part of the effort to renovate the museum, the Pueblo was captured in the late 60s of the eastern coast of North Korea. The Pueblo is held up in the North as proof the country stood up and drove out the U.S. Its a museum: The USS Pueblo sits on the banks of a Pyongyang, North Korea river as North korean soldiers walk past it . The museum, on the banks of a river in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, has been fully restored as part of the country’s celebration of the 60th anniversary of their victory by way of treaty. Once captured, the crew were held hostage in the reclusive Communist country for 11 months. Having not been recovered or sunk, the ship is still listed as a commissioned Navy vessel. ‘I got shot up in the original capture, so we were taken by bus and then train for an all-night journey to Pyongyang in North Korea, and then they put us in a place we called the barn,’ Marine Corp sergeant Robert Cicca said. Saying that food was scarce, causing him to lose 60 pounds, Cicca added that the crew was forced to eat ‘fried turnips for breakfast, turnip soup for lunch, and fried turnips for dinner.’ Tourist destination: North Koreans now tour the ship in groups as part of a visit to a war museum . Not a battleship: The USS Pueblo was barely armed, meant for intelligence gathering only . International waters: At over 15 miles from the coast,the USS Pueblo was well beyond the 12 miles of territorial waters claimed by North Korea . Never built for combat, the USS Pueblo was launched in 1944 as a US Army cargo ship before being repurposed for intelligence gathering in 1967, before being sent to the Far East later that year, according to the Navy. Purposely not heavily armed, the Pueblo was easily overtaken by North Korean forces in January, 1968, in an attack that killed one sailor and saw the remaining 82, including three seriously injured, captured. North Korean officials claimed shortly after the attack that the Pueblo was in North Korean territorial waters and posed a threat, a claim the U.S. denied. The Navy claimed the ship was over 15 miles from the coast of the nearest island – well beyond the 12 miles of territorial waters claimed by North Korea, in a subsequent film released by the US Navy. By corroborating that evidence with location reporting from both the Pueblo and a sub hunter in the area, the Navy believes it has proof that the North Koreans misled American officials as to the location of the ship when it was overrun by forces from six boats covered by air support from MiG fighter jets. In North Korean waters: North Korea asserts the USS Pueblo was in the country's territorial waters when captured, according to a propaganda video released by the Communist nation . Dear leader: North Korean patriarch Kim il-Sung, referred to as 'Dear Leader in the North,' is seen in this propaganda video in which North Korea claimed 'the US imperialists went down on their knees again' The US was hesitant to commit to a battle over the ship with North Korea because it was in the middle of the Vietnam War to the south, and was wary about being spread too thin. Despite being an intelligence gathering ship, according to the Navy, crew members have long asserted they had little information of value to share with North Korea, which resulted in brutal beating at the hands of North Korean soldiers. ‘The Koreans basically told us, they put stuff in front of us, they said you were here, you were spying, you will be shot as spies,’ Earl Phares said, adding that beatings were shared equally among the captive crew. Put in front of cameras to confess, Pueblo crew members were courageously defiant during their forced confessions, even extending middle fingers in images seen outside the country. Once wise to the gesture, North Korean soldiers beat the soldiers even more for their boldness. Held hostage: Crew members of the USS Pueblo hold up their hands while in captivity in North Korea in 1968 . Forced confessions: Crew members of USS Pueblo pose while in captivity in North Korea in 1968 . Long ago, but not forgotten: former USS Pueblo crew member Richard Rogala holds a painting of the USS Pueblo at his home in Sarasota, FL . Founder: Kim il-Sung founded the North Korean state, leading it until his son Kim Jong-il took over after his death . Only after a signed statement from Major General Gilbert Woodward, the chief US negotiator with North Korea, apologizing for ‘the grave acts’ committed against North Korea when the Pueblo ‘illegally intruded’ into the country’s territorial waters, were the hostages let go. Woodward read a statement into the record disavowing the confession both before and after the apology. The hostages were released across the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea two days before Christmas, 11 months to the day after their capture. Initially considered for a court marshall for losing his ship, Commander Lloyd Bucher never saw any charges brought against him after it was determined the crew had suffered enough. Hostile takeover: Several speedboats filled with Korean soldiers had little trouble taking over the lightly armed USS Pueblo after spraying it with gunfire for about an hour . For cargo: Known as the FP-344 prior to being commissioned the USS Pueblo for the Navy, the ship was used to transport US Army cargo in the waning days of World War II . Family business: Kim Jong-un, grandson of Kim il-Sung, took over North Korea in 2012 after the passing of his father Kim Jong-il . Defending the ship’s captain, Phares said ‘It would have been nice to take out some of the guys, some of them, and maybe go down fighting, but it would have been total suicide.’ North Korea was said to have been close to returning the ship to the US in 2002, but reportedly back-peddled – an act that haunts the former crew even now. ‘It's very disappointing to have it still there, and still being used as anti-American propaganda,’ Chicca said.","The only US navy ship held by another country, is still listed as a commissioned Navy vessel .

Debra Richardson, 49, has been sacked by Travelodge after she was attacked by a robber - because she left the door open . A Travelodge worker who was attacked during a robbery has been sacked - because she left the hotel door open. Debra Richardson, 49, was dragged to the floor by a man who walked into the Preston Central Travelodge and stole a petty cash box containing £48 in the early hours of the morning. The robber fled the scene and Ms Richardson, a mother of four, was treated for shock. She had worked 13 days in a row, totalling 85 hours, and was feeling unwell. She said she has since suffered from post-traumatic stress and has been put on anti-depressants. Following the robbery, Ms Richardson took a planned week's holiday but returned to be told she was being investigated because she had left the door unlocked. The investigation led to a disciplinary hearing and the mother-of-four was sacked. She appealed against the decision but this week learned the decision had been upheld. Ms Richardson, of Ribbleton, Lancashire, said: 'This bloke came in, I had left the front door open, I was mentally and physically ill from working all these hours without a day off. 'We have to give six hours’ notice if phoning in sick but because I didn’t have time to give notice I went in and tried to get cover but nobody could cover me. 'He came in I thought he was in the hotel, I asked him if he was all right, I was there on my own. 'He looked like a normal customer, I went into the office and the next thing I was on the floor in the office and he took the petty cash box with £48 in. 'I rang the police straight away and the police rang the management. I was in complete shock.' Ms Richardson, who worked behind the bar and reception, said: 'I just think it is disgusting, I have worked there for six-and-a-half years. 'I feel absolutely disgusted, I used to cover every shift that needed to be covered. They could ring me and within half an hour I would be in work, I was never off sick.' She was checked over by paramedics following the robbery, which happened at about 2.40am on Thursday, June 6. She said: 'Five hours later they rang me to see how I was, I was in shock. I never heard anything because I had a week holiday. 'Then I came in to see what shift I was on and I was told I was on investigation because I hadn’t locked the door. 'I told everybody how ill I was. I went to the investigation a couple of days later and was told it was going to disciplinary. The robbery took place at Preston Central Travelodge in the early hours of Thursday, June 6 . 'That was another meeting with different managers from HR. It took them a week to let me know I had been sacked. I appealed it but they are upholding the decision. 'They know I wasn’t involved. They have CCTV of the fella who did it. I told the police everything I could.' A Travelodge spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a robbery did take place at our Preston Central Travelodge on June 6. 'In response to this incident a comprehensive investigation was carried out by Lancashire Police and their key findings revealed that a member of staff was guilty of a serious breach of security. 'Travelodge operates a zero tolerance against any actions that could impact the welfare or safety of its customers and staff and therefore appropriate action was taken in response to the police findings.' A spokesman for Lancashire Police said nobody has yet been arrested for the robbery and the investigation continues.","Debra Richardson, 49, was dragged to the floor by robber at Preston hotel .

A grieving mother has been left furious after a nurse accused of neglecting her dying son was given a warning and allowed to continue working. Cheryl Cressey, whose ten-year-old son William died of meningitis in February 2005, reacted angrily at the Nursing and Midwifery Council’s (NMC) decision not to strike off Christopher Kirby. William, of Croft, near Darlington, died after doctors at Darlington Memorial Hospital diagnosed a migraine and discharged him. Angry: Grieving mother Cheryl Cressey, left, has been left furious after a nurse accused of neglecting her dying son William, right, was given a warning and allowed to continue working by a disciplinary panel . Mr Kirby, who was William’s named nurse, did not carry out regular observations or make notes about his condition. He said ‘just don’t touch it’ when the youngster complained about his bulging, pus-covered eyes. Tearful William was taken home, only to be rushed back hours later having suffered a fatal seizure. An NMC tribunal ruled that stiffer sanctions against Mr Kirby would be inappropriate, despite his standards falling well below what was expected. The panel noted there is no suggestion that Mr Kirby was responsible for William’s death. Mrs Cressey said: 'Every allegation against Kirby was proved and they just give him a warning - it is unacceptable and it is disgusting. 'They are saying Kirby was not to blame for William’s death, but if he had been checking on him, he could have given William the treatment he needed and he might not have died.' In October, a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel decided not to strike off Dr Malik Alam, the consultant in charge of William’s care, despite a series of failings on his part. Warning: The Nursing and Midwifery Council decided not to strike off Christopher Kirby, pictured . The NMC decision is the latest blow to Mrs Cressey’s efforts to get justice for her son, who would have celebrated his 19th birthday next week. She has made complaints against other nurses involved in his care and is waiting to hear whether the NMC will act upon them. Mrs Cressey added: 'I hold every single, stinking last one of them responsible for my son’s death - they failed him completely and absolutely. 'He could have been saved, there are things that could have been done for him that weren’t.' Summing up the NMC panel decision, chairman Polly Clarke told Mr Kirby: 'A caution is proportionate to the misconduct in this matter and will remind you to check on all patients in your care, respond to their needs as required, and not overlook any individual patient. 'While we recognise your excellent professional standing since 2005, we had to take into consideration the public interest and need to uphold the reputation of the profession. 'You ignored information from a colleague and suggested that the colleague also should not provide care to that patient. 'You failed to report observations on the patient who was in your care during the course of your shift. 'By not making records as you should have done, you deprived both clinicians and (William’s) mother of a clinical picture of how his condition progressed during your shift.' Ms Clarke said the panel considered giving Kirby conditions of practice or a suspension, but decided these were too strong for one 'isolated' incident of misconduct. She added: 'These charges arose from one shift in the course of a 33-year career. 'Before the shift and in the years since, you have never been subjected to disciplinary proceedings, nor have concerns been raised regarding your practice. 'You are held in high regard by your peers, and the risk of repetition of this misconduct is slight.' The caution will remain on Mr Kirby’s file for the next five years.","Cheryl Cressey's ten-year-old son William died of meningitis .

Grim discovery: Chief executive Carsten Schloter, 49, was found dead in what police are treating as a suicide . The boss of telecoms giant  Swisscom was 'dangerously addicted to his smartphone' after the breakdown of his marriage it has been claimed. Chief executive Carsten Schloter, was found dead in what police are treating as a suicide. The state-controlled firm, which dominates the Swiss market, said it was ‘in mourning’, after Schloter, 49, was found dead by police in his home near the city of Freiburg. Police are assuming the cause of death was suicide, although the company said that ‘an investigation into the exact circumstances is underway’. Schloter was known as a . workaholic who admitted in interviews that he found it impossible to . turn off his mobile phone and sometimes struggled to reduce the tempo of . his busy life. The German-born boss separated from his wife in 2009 and lived apart from his three children. He later told Swiss newspaper Blick . that he had tried to ‘play the strong man’ over the separation but that . this was ‘not credible’. Excerpts from interviews Mr Schloter gave to the Swiss media this year and in 2012 were published in Switzerland's Handelszeitung newspaper yesterday and may show his state of mind. 'Modern communications devices have their downside,' Mr Schloter told Switzerland's Schweiz am Sonntag in May, reported The Independent. The most dangerous thing is to fall into a mode of permanent activity and continuously consult one's smartphone to see whether any new mails have come in. Everyone should switch off their mobile phone from time to time.' Mr Schloter insisted that staff use the more . personal ‘Du’ form of address when speaking to one another, as opposed . to the formal ‘Sie’ form common in the business world. Tribute on Swisscom website: The news has rocked the Swiss business community, where Schloter was known for his modern and innovative approach to business, as well as his love of outdoor sports . The news has rocked the Swiss business . community, where Schloter was known for his modern and innovative . approach to business, as well as his love of outdoor sports. Swisscom chairman Hansueli Loosli said: ‘The board of directors, group executive board and the entire workforce are deeply saddened and pass on their condolences to the family and relatives.’ Swisscom’s performance under Schloter was considered strong despite small declines in revenue. But the company, which has 62 per cent of Switzerland’s mobile market and 55 per cent of broadband, had recently come under pressure from competition watchdogs. Weko, the Swiss equivalent of the UK’s Competition Commission, last week opened an investigation after rival Sunrise complained that Swisscom was abusing its dominant position in broadband internet for corporate clients. Schloter’s death is the third suicide by an executive at a leading Swiss firm in the space of five years. In 2008 the chief executive of private bank Julius Baer Alex Widmer took his own life, followed in 2011 by Adrian Kohler, the boss of Ricola, who threw himself in front of a train.","Chief executive Carsten Schloter, 49, was found dead at his home .

"By . Kathryn Blundell . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:49 EST, 25 July 2013 . After the birth of my son, through the fug of exhaustion, gas and air, I was sent off by the midwife to shower while my husband had his turn at cuddling and bonding with our scrumptious, sleepy baby boy. In a haze of euphoria as the warm water hit, I looked down at my body. For 40 weeks, it had steadily grown around my son, nurturing him while I carried on with my life, but now the firm bump had deflated. Here to stay: William, baby George, Kate - and her post-baby bump . Almost the same size it had been a day earlier, it was softer, less defined. Like a balloon the day after a party. In an instant, my baby bubble wobbled a little and I resolved to diet. So, on Tuesday, when a glowing Kate presented her gorgeous son to the world, I sent up a silent cheer. I had expected her to appear in a billowing frock, perhaps holding her son lower down across her tummy, a long shawl perhaps - anything to hide her figure. But she didn't. Her lovely mummy tummy was on full show in a belted, fitted dress. As the former editor of Mother&Baby magazine, I spent years trying to reassure women that their babies weren't the enemy of their bodies, despite harbouring the same fears myself. My heart would break every time I'd read the postbag from readers who were upset and angry at the pressure they felt to be super-skinny at their six-week check-up. I still remember one reader who was devastated because her 'celebrity pregnancy twin' - the star she was at the same stage as - was model Miranda Kerr. While our reader was wiping baby sick off the man-size T-shirts she was still wearing, Miranda was off on modelling assignments. Postpartum pride: Kathryn Blundell (left) thinks new mothers should be proud of their mummy tummies . Clearly, Miranda started off with a amazing body and has the extra motivation of being employed for her looks, but even the most normal-seeming celebs smile back at us with a washboard stomach, mere weeks after giving birth. And so we ask ourselves: 'If she can do it, why can't I?' Post-birth, I looked as though I could have popped another one out at any time, and I had been a size 10 before. But knowing I was normal didn't make me feel any less of a lump, and the low mood I had as a result spoiled what should have been a lovely time getting to know my baby. I was so sick of the dreaded stretch waistbands and empire-line dresses, and wouldn't let anyone go near me with a camera, always making sure I took the pictures of my beautiful boy, but was not in them myself. The truth is that the post-birth body has become alien to us. Contrary to what some people seem to think, women aren't elastic bands. There is no snapping back - and certainly not in 24 hours! Bumps are not just babies, neither are they simply fat stores. The womb is an amazing thing that grows with the baby, and it needs time to readjust once its role as infant transport has ended. Most doctors tell new mums not to expect to get near their pre-baby size until nine months later - any extra pounds took that long to go on, so it makes sense to wait that long for them to come off. Admittedly, that didn't stop me starving myself in the hope I could get back to a size 10 (six years on, I'm still not there). Our bodies don't just get bigger in pregnancy, they change shape, too. The ligaments around a woman's pelvis stretch to make it easier to give birth. It takes at least a few weeks for them to go back towards their earlier shape. Yet we are taunted by images of celebrity mothers who seem to give birth on Tuesday and are back on the red carpet looking whip thin by the weekend. Actress Kate Hudson says she spent six hours a day working out to get her pre-baby body back. Victoria Beckham exercised six days a week with celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson after the birth of daughter Harper. Joyous bond: Kathryn with son McKenzie, 6 . While it's important that new mothers in the real world remember the stars have personal trainers, special diets and nannies to allow them to focus on their bodies, the real lesson is that it's far better to spend this time bonding with your baby. Kate shows every sign of doing this. She's retreated to her parents' home in Berkshire to be cared for while she gets on with the important job of resting and nesting with her new family. Despite the pressure she must feel - she does, after all have the eyes of the world on her - she has already shown her pride in her post-birth bump. I wish I'd seen more famous mummy tummies like Kate's before I had my son. It would have brought home to me the incredible, indelible changes that my body had gone through. I wouldn't have felt that my softer bump was ugly. I would have stopped bullying my body, respected my shape and embraced the change. Let's hope that Kate helps the next generation of new mothers to do the same.","New mothers take note: Kate isn't trying to hide her post-baby bump .

Britain has seen another day of gorgeous . sunshine today, but the good weather is not set to last long as the sun . is replaced by storms and temperatures start to drop. An early warning of the unsettled conditions came in Scotland yesterday when a village was hit by a tornado which ripped off roof tiles and damaged trees. And the storms will quickly move across the rest of Britain, with the South East of England set to see as much as 30mm in a single hour tomorrow. Coming to an end: The gorgeous weather in places such as Hitchin, Hertfordshire is not forecast to survive the weekend . Glee: But the likes of six-year-old Tom Stocks do not have much longer to enjoy the lavender fields of Britain before rain comes . Harvesting: Teenager Bethany Joseph picks lavender at Cadwell Farm in Hitchin today . Summery: Plants have thrived in the weather but the sunshine is set to end for the time being . The tornado which struck Bothwell in Lanarkshire yesterday afternoon left residents cowering in fear as the twister ripped through the village. The streets were strewn with tree branches, roof tiles and other debris, prompting a massive clear-up operation. Locals described seeing the atmosphere suddenly darken with violent winds prompting the sensation of an earthquake. 'I was sitting in the living room,' said John Rundell, 69. 'The next thing I knew the fire place started shaking as if it was going to collapse. 'I didn’t know what was happening, but I got up and looked out the living room window. I saw loads of roof tiles flying around and crashing down into the street. 'The whole thing lasted around a minute and after it was over lots of neighbours came out to help clear up the mess in the street.' Twister: A tornado was pictured over the village of Bothwell in Lanarkshire yesterday as Britain faces storms in many parts . Damage: Car windscreens were smashed after debris flew around the town thanks to the sudden storm . Roof: Tiles were ripped off this home in Bothwell by the vicious tornado which swept through the village yesterday . Destruction: Trees had branches torn off them in the storm, which foreshadows a weekend of bad weather . Ross Neilson, 25, who filmed the terrifying event, added: 'I had just been at a meeting for work when I came out and realised it was very windy. 'As I crossed the road, the winds changed and rubbish started flying about in front of me. The sky grew very dark and there had been thunder grumbling away just before. 'I looked up and could see the winds spiralling and could make out debris being sucked up and spinning about.' Despite the sunny weather which has been prevailing in most of Britain for the past week, the Met Office has warned that many areas face a sudden downpour tomorrow. The South East will bear the brunt of the rain, with 30mm forecast to fall within an hour - compared to an average rainfall of 78.1mm in the whole month of July. By the seaside: Brightly coloured beach huts pictured in Scarborough today as visitors soaked up the sunshine . Spectacle: The Scarborough huts were first introduced more than 100 years ago and were looking at their best today . Ominous: This weekend is set to bring heavy rain and storms across most of Britain following the heatwave . A Met Office spokesman said: 'It’s going to be very wet over the weekend for some and we have a warning out for Saturday, as the South-East and Cambridgeshire receive a band of thunderstorms and heavy rain that is moving northwards from France. 'Then on Sunday we have another warning for the South West and south-west Wales as well as the East of England and East Midlands, the North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and the North East as well.' But the downturn in conditions doesn’t necessarily herald the end of summer and a return to the typically wet British climate. The spokesman said: 'It looks like July is going to end with unsettled conditions, but outside those areas temperatures will be normal for this time of year. Dry: The lack of rain this month has affected the soil in which crops are grown, such as this wheat field in County Durham . Longing for rain: Farmers and gardeners are likely to welcome the prospect of wet weather this weekend .

Tyrell Burton, 19, from London, believed to be the young man who was stabbed to death in Malia, Crete . More than a dozen British tourists have appeared in court on a Greek holiday island after a mass brawl in which one Briton was pinned down and stabbed to death 'execution-style'. The youths were taken to stand before the prosecutor on Crete today following the death of 19-year-old Tyrell Matthews-Burton, from Leyton, east London, who was stabbed through the heart. Police have questioned one British tourist, also 19, on suspicion of fatally stabbing Mr Matthews-Burton, and have detained 14 others after the incident which occurred in the early hours of yesterday. Today relatives of those arrested said Greek police had simply rounded up everyone who had visited the club that night, irrespective of whether they had been involved or even there at the time of the brawl. The mother of one of the Britons arrested told MailOnline: 'In those clubs you need ID to get in, so the police simply went around all the hotels arresting everyone who had been there that night, including my son. 'My son didn't know the man who died, and wasn't there when it happened - he had left earlier with some girls.  But they arrested him and put him in handcuffs to take him to court.' Several of the young men arrested rang their families to tell them they were asked to appear before the court one by one so that a lawyer could decide if they were to be charged or not. One mother said: 'My son was privately-educated and he is a stockbroker.  He had nothing do with it but has been arrested anyway.  The police just rounded everyone up.' A friend of one of the young men who had blood on his shirt said he was a friend of Mr Matthews-Burton, who had tried to help the teenager after he was fatally injured. He said: 'He and Tyrell were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It was nothing to do with gangs - they had just gone on holiday with a group of five friends and it was just bad luck.' An ambulance was called to the brawl outside the closed bar in the popular town of Malia, which is known for its wild nightlife, but the young man is believed to have died on his way to hospital. Today Greek coroner Manolis Michalodimitrakis said: 'There were two stab wounds, to the back and to the chest. 'He was clearly pinned down and killed execution style - there were no defence wounds. 'The knife punctured his lung and heart. He lost almost half of his blood.' Harry Nye, 18, from Kent, said he witnessed the fight, which is understood to have taken place outside the Safari Club in the resort. He told the Daily Mirror: 'We saw one guy having his head stamped on and this other lad just fell straight. I've never seen that much blood.' A British tourist with blood on his T-shirt is taken to a prosecutor today after Tyrell Matthews-Burton was fatally stabbed - today a relative of his said he was a friend of Tyrell who had tried to help his fatally injured friend . Handcuffed and with blood on his top, a British tourist covers his face as he arrives in Heraklion Court on Crete . The young Britons appeared in Heraklion Court this morning in relation to the incident in Malia yesterday . Police said there had been a mass brawl involving up to 30 Britons outside the closed bar in the resort . A spokesman for the Foreign and . Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm the death of a British . national in Malia, Greece on 23 July. He added: 'We are aware of the arrests of a number of British nationals in Malia, Crete, on July 23. 'We are in touch with the local authorities and stand ready to provide consular assistance.' Authorities on the island which is . popular with young British tourists on a budget said a post-mortem would . be conducted on Crete before the body was repatriated. Mourners took to Twitter to post tributes to the young man who died. Chardae . Denelle posted: 'R.I.P Tyrell.

Pharmaceutical companies could be forced to publish secret research into how drugs are created under new European laws, potentially revealing information about dangerous and unknown side-effects. The rules would mean that some of the world’s most powerful drugs companies would have to share the results of clinical trials which could then be analysed by independent scientists. Experts said that the move could also highlight if patients and customers have been fooled by placebos or drugs that have not been scientifically proven to work. Drugs companies currently only release a small amount of their research data from clinical trials, with critics claiming that negative results are only half as likely to be published. The proposed rules would mean that some of the world's most powerful drugs companies would have to share the results of clinical trials which could then be analysed by independent scientists . But the disclosure rules being drawn up by the European Medicines Agency, an EU body, have been met with resistance from pharmaceutical companies. They claim that some of their information might be misinterpreted, potentially sparking a significant health scare around the use of a particular the drug. In the last three years, 26 drugs companies have racked up fines of more than £7billion for acting dishonestly. Britain’s largest pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline announced earlier this year that it would support a move for such legislation by publishing the results of all its clinical trials. The move followed fierce criticism of the company after it was given a £1.9billion fine in the US in 2012, in part for withholding safety data about Avandria, its best-selling diabetes drug. News of law comes as a leaked message from the head of a leading pharmaceutical industry body to company bosses revealed that patient groups would be used to try to block amendments to the clinical trials directive. The email was sent by European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations director general Richard Bergström to the directors and legal departments at companies including Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. In the email, seen by The Guardian, he says that patient groups will be ‘mobilised’ to express concerns about ‘the risk to public health by non-scientific re-use of data’. Drug companies currently only release a small amount of their research data from clinical trials, with critics claiming that negative results are only half as likely to be published . But campaigners said that the groups – which are often funded by companies – are a ‘front for the pharmaceutical industry’. Tim Reed, from campaign grouop Health Action International, said: ‘It’s incredibly ironic that this is a transparency initiative and we’ve now got clear indications that the pharmaceutical industry is ready to use patient organisations to fight their corner. He told the Guardian: ‘It underlines the fact that patient groups who are in the pay of the pharmaceutical industry will go into battle for them. There’s a hidden agenda here. ‘Patient groups get traction because they are assumed to represent the voice of the suffering. But industry uses them to say we’re not going to get innovative medicines if the industry is deterred from investing by having to be transparent about their clinical trials.’ The EFPIA said: ‘Knowing that some people want all data to be made available to everyone, EFPIA is engaging with stakeholders to share concerns with harmful ‘re-use’ of data. ‘We will engage not only with patient groups, but also with the scientific community.’","Under new European laws, firms would have to share results of clinical trials .

Maddison Warwick, 10, had an operation after being diagnosed with Perthes’ disease - a condition which causes the top of the thigh bone to soften and break down. But when he was sent home from Royal Bolton Hospital, Greater Manchester, he was told he could not have a wheelchair because he lives in the wrong area. Maddison Warwick (pictured with mother Jill) had an operation at the Royal Bolton Hospital but was refused a wheelchair because he didn't live close enough. His mother has been forced to spend £100 to hire one . Maddison lives just five miles from the hospital, but his home is in Radcliffe, Bury, and therefore outside the Bolton boundaries. He had an operation at Royal Bolton Hospital on July 9 and was sent home two days later. Both of his legs are covered in plaster and there is a bar between them, meaning the Radcliffe Primary School pupil cannot walk. But his mother, Jill Warwick, said she was told Maddison could not have a wheelchair because he did not live in Bolton. Maddison suffers with Perthes' disease, a childhood disorder which causes the top of the thigh bone to soften . Miss Warwick, aged 31, of Ainsworth . Road, said: “I asked if I lived in the Bolton borough, would I get a . wheelchair, and they said yes. That’s the only reason that they wouldn’t . give me a wheelchair. With both legs in plaster, Maddison is unable to walk . 'We are being discriminated against because we don’t live in Bolton. 'I . feel really upset and let down. The hospital knew he would be having . the operation there and a care plan should have been put in place. 'I had no choice but to go to Bolton, because there is no children’s unit at Fairfield.' Maddison will have to spend six weeks in the double-leg cast and Miss Warwick says it is very difficult to take him out of the house. Miss Warwick, who has two other children, said: 'I have to lift him to move him and he’s sleeping on the sofa. It’s a real struggle. 'Maddison is getting a little bit fed up because he can’t get out. He’s frustrated and upset.' Sue Ainsworth, the hospital’s professional lead for children’s services, said: 'It is standard practice that we are only able to provide wheelchairs to patients who are Bolton residents. 'As Maddison lives outside the Bolton area, arrangements have been made for a wheelchair to be provided through the paediatric community nursing team in Bury.' However, Miss Warwick said the nursing team has not given her a wheelchair and she has resorted to paying more than £100 to hire one.","Maddison Warwick suffers with Perthes’ disease - a condition that causes the top of the thigh bone to soften and break down .

A grandfather has told how he went to Specsavers to have his sight tested and was diagnosed with such high blood pressure he could have died. Derek Day, 72, from Solihull in the West Midlands, was rushed to Birmingham City Hospital after eye expert Raj Sandhu spotted warning signs during a routine appointment. Doctors were amazed when later tests gave a systolic blood pressure reading of 254 – people should aim for a blood pressure of below 120/80. Derek Day, 72, went to Specsavers to have his sight tested and was diagnosed with such high blood pressure he could have died . Systolic blood pressure is the maximum pressure the blood reaches as it is pushed around the body when the heart beats. A measurement of more than 140 represents high blood pressure. The result was so high that staff at the Birmingham Midland Eye Centre, based at the hospital, thought their machine was faulty, only for a second reading to return identical statistics. Mr Day said: ‘At first they thought the machine had broken, so they tried again. ‘When they got the same reading, they told me I should have been dead. ‘My pressure was that high they were surprised I was still standing. It was such a shock - I'd never had any health problems before. Mr Day was seen by Raj Sandhu (left) who was concerned by his recurring headaches and referred him to Birmingham City Hospital for tests . ‘I have no doubt that Raj saved my life.’ Mr Day was put on tablets to help lower his blood pressure and has been fine ever since. His problems started in October when he started to suffer from recurring headaches and thought his glasses needed to be changed. He saw Mr Sandhu at Specsavers' Yardley branch, in Birmingham. The optician explained: ‘Mr Day's pressure tests were normal and his prescription hadn't changed, but I wasn't happy with how he was. Doctors were amazed to find Mr Day had a systolic blood pressure reading of 254 - people should aim for a reading below 120. This is the pressure the blood is under when it is pumped away from the heart . ‘His body language was wrong and the constant headaches were a concern. I also spotted two small splinter haemorrhages near his optic nerve at the back of his eye.’ Mr Sandhu called the eye centre and staff agreed to see Mr Day immediately. Mr Day said: ‘Without that visit and their prompt action I would have almost certainly suffered a stroke and could well have died. ‘It's hard to believe an eye examination can pick these things up. I'm now on tablets and I've been fine ever since. Mr Day was put on tablets to help lower his blood pressure and is now in much better health. Without treatment it is highly likely that he would have had a heart attack or a stroke . ‘I'm a really chilled out person and don't get stressed about anything, so hopefully that helped me.’ High blood pressure, or hypertension, is dangerous because it puts extra strain on the heart and blood vessels. This causes them to become weak and damaged. The higher your blood pressure, the greater your risk of health problems is. High blood pressure can cause heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, kidney disease and arterial disease. Opticians have previously been credited with spotting brain tumours, brain aneurysms and brain abscesses.","Derek Day, 72, went to his optician because he had recurring headaches .

Ms Adam said the pilot of the Virgin Balloons craft has apologised and offered to pay for a new rhea and the veterinary bills. Ms Adam, who auditioned for Britain's Got Talent last year and later recorded a single, said: 'It was first thing in the morning and I was out feeding the animals and I noticed this huge hot air balloon only a few hundred feet from us.

'We feel we are at risk of aerial attacks and I have contacted the Civil Aviation Authority for help in warning pilots to avoid flying overhead.' A Virgin Balloons spokesman said: 'We were very sorry to hear about this sad event. 'Unfortunately, the sanctuary was not marked as a sensitive area on the ballooning maps, so the pilot was not aware of it and the balloon was legally permitted to be below 1,000ft as it was on approach to landing. 'The site will now be added to the maps so balloonists are aware in the future and, at the owner's request, the pilot agreed to purchase a new rhea for them.'","White rhea bird died after low-flying hot air balloon scared him .

The Arab Spring revolutions across the Middle East already have seen ragtag movements take on some of the region's most feared authoritarian regimes. In Libya, rebels against dictator Colonel Gaddafi fought running skirmishes in the open desert using makeshift weapons that could have come straight from Mad Max. In Syria, civilians stood up against tanks and heavily armed soldiers with little more than Molotov cocktails. In Bahrain, hundreds were made martyrs as they stood their ground at a roundabout as the full force of the regime's Saudi-backed military cut them down. Now, in Egypt, where violence is once again reaching a crescendo, protesters are protecting themselves with whatever they can find as they fight fierce street battles with the militarised police of the interior ministry.

Sharing: Prince Charles told a nine-year-old how special it was to become a grandfather, on a visit to Gloucestershire today . The Prince of Wales shared the 'great moment' he met his grandson with a schoolboy today, telling him: 'It's fun to be a grandfather'. Charles described the emotional moment he saw Prince George for the first time when he met the boy's namesake George Austin, nine, as he opened a new garden at Kemble railway station in Gloucestershire this morning. George and sister Lucinda, four, were visiting the station - the closest to the Prince's Highgrove home - with their grandparents. He was also presented with cards written by . Oliver Horne, four, and brother Daniel, 22 months, who wore Union Flag . hats for the royal visit. The Prince attended the station to open a new garden worked on by students at the Royal Agricultural University, of which he has been president for 25 years. He appeared in a humorous mood, laughing and joking as he met members of the public, staff and designers and unveiled a plaque at the station. George, who lives in Wimbledon, south west London, said: 'I was asking him about the baby and he said it was great meeting him at the hospital. 'He said it was really fun being a grandfather. 'I was really hoping the baby would be called George, it is a great name.' George was at the station, a Grade II-Listed building, with grandparents Sue and Peter Skinner, who live in Kemble. Mrs Skinner said: 'It is marvellous that the baby has been born, I think he will make the most fantastic grandfather. 'He was brilliant with these two. Being a grandparent is very special.'

The Prince was congratulated on the birth of his grandson, Prince George of Cambridge, by delighted crowds at the station. The card Charles received read: 'To HRH the Prince of Wales and HRH the Duchess of Cornwall. Congratulations on becoming grandparents on the birth of Prince George of Cambridge. 'Love, Oliver Horne, four, Daniel Horne, one.' Proud mother Nicola Horne, 38, who lives in nearby Cirencester in Gloucestershire, said: 'Oliver said to him 'Congratulations on being a grandad'. 'Prince Charles said 'Thank you'. I think he was really touched. 'He asked Oliver 'Have you got a granny and grandad?' and Oliver told him he had. 'It was great for the boys to meet him, they love the new baby and were so excited to see him on the television.

Staff and students from the Royal Agricultural University worked on the project, which was started this year after a campaign by local resident Dawn Adams. Around 15 students have worked on the garden, designed by Sophie Crawford of Designspace Outdoors, since February. Charles' brother Prince Andrew, Duke of York, was at Loulou's private members club in Mayfair last night . Professor Chris Gaskell, principal of the Royal Agricultural University, said: 'He has double ownership of this project. 'He is pleased because he lives locally and loves bringing old things to life but he is also pleased that it was students from the RAU that put in the leg work.' The focal point of the garden is a dry stone wall, which runs through the middle, and has seats incorporated into it. Sophie Crawford said: 'Prince Charles knows about gardens and he commented on the skill it takes to build a dry stone wall. 'It was a difficult task but the students carried it off brilliantly.' Flowers in the garden were donated by Dobbies Garden World in Cirencester. The Prince, wearing the Royal Agricultural University tie, made a short speech after he unveiled a plaque to open the garden, which was finished yesterday. He said: 'I am so thrilled to have this opportunity as president of the Royal Agricultural University. 'I think that the students and everybody else involved in this is enormously encouraging. 'I must pay tribute to Dawn Adams who has worked hard to make sure that this garden is brought back to life. 'Thank goodness for people like you. 'It is a really encouraging project, I wouldn't have missed it for anything.' The Prince then congratulated staff from First Great Western on the station before meeting members of the public who lined the platform. Mrs Adams, a grandmother of 12, from Kemble, said: 'It was overwhelming. 'I've never met Prince Charles before and to have him say that was a great honour.

The family also revealed they had alerted police to the teenager before, after he allegedly vandalized one of their cars. Holder, who lived just two doors down from the Gallagher family, is in hospital in critical condition after an officer shot him in the head for opening fire on cops serving his arrest warrant. One of his bullets struck an officer in the groin. Mrs Gallager became emotional as she spoke about the alleged killer who had been living just yards from her three young children in Saginaw, Texas. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Laura Gallagher, whose daughter was found raped and suffocated to death under a tarp in the street, said she was horrified that a killer was roaming the streets so near to children . 'Nobody thinks you're down the street from someone developing into a monster,' she told CBS-DFW. 'There's not just our kids, but so many other kids we'd see out playing. 'And you think of all the times that all these kids were walking past that house, and you feel like it was a time bomb slowly building that we didn't know about, and it went off on our baby.' Her husband Karl added that he had contacted police about Holder in the past for allegedly vandalizing . one of their cars. He said that other cars in the neighborhood were . targeted too. Mrs Gallagher said she had not read the affidavit detailing Holder's alleged crimes because it is too graphic. Killed: Alanna Gallagher, left, was allegedly raped and suffocated by Tyler Holder, right, on July 1 . Heartbreaking: Her body was found under a tarp about a mile from her home hours after she went missing . The probable cause affidavit for the arrest, obtained by WFAA-TV, offers new details . about the suffering inflicted upon Alanna, who was found under a tarp hours after she went missing. The little girl, who was known for riding on her purple scooter in search of playmates, had been brutally raped, the affidavit shows. Injured: Detective Charles Lodatto was shot when he went to serve Holder's arrest warrant . Her partially clothed body was found by 14-year-old Owen . Whiddon bound and wrapped in a . grey tarpaulin in the middle of a street about a mile from her home . later in the day of her disappearance. Genetic . evidence was matched through DNA tests to a sample that Holder . voluntarily provided to police earlier this month, the documents say. His DNA was also found on the buckle of a belt used to wrap Alanna's body in the tarp. Four Wal-Mart bags were taped over the girl’s head with red duct tape secured around her neck. Her wrists and ankles were bound with the same tape and her body and clothes were wet with an unknown liquid. Police later allegedly found what is believed to be the same kind of duct tape in . rubbish bags outside the home Holder shared with his mother just two . doors from where Alanna lived with her family. Originally, . Saginaw Police had said they had no specific suspects, but the . affidavit suggests Holder was under suspicion almost immediately. Within . hours of Alanna’s body being found officers reported seeing Tyler . Holder 'pacing up and down the sidewalk', the affidavit says. Residents . allegedly informed police Holder had told them that it was Alanna’s body that had . been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of . the victim. Injured: Holder is taken away in an ambulance after an officer shot him in the head for opening fire on Monday . Scene: On Tuesday, police and FBI agents investigate the scene where the officer and Holder were shot . Violence: A Saginaw police car blocks the entrance to Babbling Brook Dr. where the shootout took place .

Alanna's death he woke up about 2pm, watched television and went to . apply for jobs, having recently been made unemployed by Sonic. The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,' Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden. But . video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling . Brook Drive allegedly  did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had . said. On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were notified on Saturday it matched evidence found on Alanna's body, according to the affidavit. Suspect: Tyler Holder gave police DNA that allegedly matched that found on a belt used to tie Alanna . At about 9am on Tuesday, officers arrived Holder's home in unmarked cars. Neighbours heard them pounding on the door shortly before multiple shots rang out. Detective Charles Lodatto, who was Arlington's detective of the year in 2012, was shot in the groin, and the bullet severed his femoral artery before lodging in his hip. Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson said he was recovering from his injuries, although he will need more surgeries and has a long road ahead of him. The Gallagher family donated blood to help the injured officer, NBC-DFW reported. Holder has now also been charged with attempted capital murder after opening fire and striking Detective Lodatto as officers served his arrest warrant on Monday. He remains hospitalized at John Peter Smith Hospital under police guard. His bond is set at $500,000. 'The three of us': A Facebook image shows Alanna's parents, Laura . and Karl (left) Gallagher with Miles McDaniel (right), who are in a . polyamorous relationship .

She said: 'He was the kid that you were always . really nice to because you didn’t know if he was going to come shoot up . the school.'

Lauren Allen, 15, recalled a confrontation between her older brother and Holder a few years ago after a rare snowfall, when Holder destroyed a snowman her brother had built. In retaliation, Lauren's brother threw a snowball at Holder, who 'just turned around and pulled out his pocket knife'. Coping: Neighbors set up a makeshift . memorial on the curb but it was torched along with the . family's car . Unthinkable: Laura Gallagher stands over charred remnants of her car after they were targeted last week . Lauren added: 'He was weird and creepy, and he’s been violent in the past.'

A secret Facebook folder marked as 'other' could contain important messages users have never seen. This inbox feature, which has the ability to harbour messages that you are not aware of, is part of a measure to protect users against spam, according to the social network. But as there are no push notifications to alert any of Facebook's 1.1 billion users that messages have been relegated to their 'other' folder, plenty of people will have old messages hidden in it. In a blog post for The New York Times, tech expert David Pogue said that he had discovered a secret folder full of Facebook messages that he had never seen. They included important messages and redundant invitations from friends going back years. He said that Facebook users can check their 'other' folder to discover if they have any old mail, by clicking on 'messages'. Next to 'inbox' in bold type, there is the word 'other' in light grey, which you have possibly overlooked. Mr Pogue said that it is this folder that probably contains a hidden stash of messages. The less than obvious folder is apparently part of Facebook's $1 message programme. The social network began charging users $1 to send a message to an individual who is not their friend, this year.

If the rumours are true, this giant iPad could be three inches bigger than the current model, pictured . According to the Wall Street Journal, . suppliers in Asia have said Apple has asked for prototypes of screens . that are larger than 4-inches for the iPhone. It is also said to be testing larger 13-inch iPad displays. This would make a jumbo iPad more than three inches bigger than the . current model. Earlier this year, industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets claimed Apple was working on a low-cost handset. Dubbed 'iPhone Mini' the new handset could come in a range of colours, be made of plastic, have a 3.5inch screen and a 5MP camera. Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400). Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7-inch screen. There may also be a 5.7-inch screen iPhone model due next year. If the rumours are true Apple's giant iPad could be same size as its MacBook Pro. It would also be bigger than some laptops, including HP's 11.6-inch EliteBook. These latest iPad rumours follow reports last month that claimed Apple is working on plastic iPhones with 4.7-inch screens. They could be available in a variety of colours including yellow and red - current iPhones and iPads only come in black and white - and may sell for as little as £63. At the same time Apple was said to be working on a larger, 5.7-inch iPhone dubbed a 'phablet' because its a cross between a phone and a tablet computer. These rumours originated in a note to investors written by industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets. The iPhone Mini could follow Samsung's lead and have a glass front with a plastic case. Apple traditionally unveils new handsets at an annual event in September and White believes this year's event will be dominated by the rumoured iPhone 5S. White claims that the iPhone Mini could be announced before this event so not to distract from the 5S launch, but Apple will likely show off both handsets together. The Telegraph also reported that accessory manufacturer Tactus had published a picture of a cheap, plastic iPhone model, rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and 5MP camera. A 13-inch iPad would make the tablet computer the same size as the company's MacBook Pro, pictured . Mr White added the iPhone Mini might 'have a curved back casing made of coloured plastic and will be thicker than the iPhone 5.' Other rumours to have generated from White's note include that the iPhone 6 - expected in 2014 - will have a much larger screen than the current 4inch iPhone 5 model.

With everything you can eat and drink thrown in, all-inclusive deals are promoted as the most economic way of enjoying your holiday. But they may not always be such good value, according to a survey. Bed and breakfast holidays where you buy your own drinks and eat out at restaurants can be £700 a week cheaper than a comparable all-inclusive break. A seven-night bed and breakfast trip to the Portuguese Algarve, for example, could be £648 cheaper per couple than an all-inclusive break in the same region where food and drink are part of the cost. B&B trips to Cyprus and to Spain’s Costa Blanca are also better value than all-inclusives. However, those visiting Spain’s Costa del Sol, Majorca or Corfu would be better off going all-inclusive. Bargain: A couple travelling to the Algarve in Portugal could save almost £700 by not going all inclusive . The study by Post Office Travel Money also found that one in six holidaymakers on all-inclusive breaks went out for restaurant meals, at extra cost, to avoid the repetition of eating in the hotel. Researchers compared the cheapest seven-night B&B and all-inclusive packages for two adults departing from London airports available on June 21 for travel between July 24 and August 6 this year. Package prices included return flights and three/four-star accommodation for two adults. For B&B packages the cost of evening meals, beer and Coca-Cola was added to provide a comparison with all-inclusive. The findings showed that those on Algarve B&B deals would pay £857 per couple compared with £1,505 for an all-inclusive package. In Cyprus, the B&B deal was £144 better than the all-inclusive one, and in the Costa Blanca those on B&Bs would be £5.43 better off. Savings: But all inclusive breaks in Majorca are better value than paying for meals yourself . An all-inclusive deal was the better option by £54 in both Corfu and Mallorca and by £6.69 in the Costa del Sol. Of 40 hotels surveyed, 30 excluded bottles of wine from their all-inclusive deals, although house wine by the glass was on offer. Dates in early July and September were also checked and results were consistent with the July/August findings. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: ‘Holidaymakers need to be aware of what is included to avoid getting caught out. ‘In some destinations like the Algarve and Spanish Costas, where restaurant prices have fallen dramatically this year, it may be cheaper to book a B&B package and eat out each day.’","Couples can save £648 by not going all-inclusive in the Algarve, Portugal .

A Texas paramedic who helped evacuate people in the minutes following the  fertilizer plant explosion that killed 14 at West, Texas, has been charged with possessing bomb-making materials, including a pipe and chemicals. Bryce Reed, 31, is in police custody and did not enter a plea during his appearance in court this afternoon. Sheriff's deputies were called earlier this week to a home near West where they found a pipe, chemicals and fuses. They say the objects belonged to Reed. His arrest came just hours before police launched a criminal investigation into the blast. Reed was one of the first to arrive at the catastrophic explosion and helped recover the injured. He was assigned to be the incident commander at the scene. In the days following the tragedy he spoke at . the memorial of those who were killed. According to sources, Reed is also said to have asked an co-worker to store a box for him sometime after the explosion. That person later found what appeared to be a pipe bomb in the container, and then contacted police. In recent days the sister of the man he eulogized has come forward to say she thinks her brother never even knew the paramedic and his Facebook page features him angrily denying that he has ‘profited’ from the tragedy. Scroll down to see video of Bryce at the memorial... In custody: Bryce Reed, a volunteer EMS worker who frequently spoke with the media during the aftermath of the West explosion, was detained and faces a charge of possession of a destructive device. According to an affidavit released by the federal court in Waco, the McLennan County Sheriff's Office was called on Tuesday to home in Abbott, which is near West, about 'a possible destructive device' and related items. The affidavit said that law enforcement officials determined that the device and related items belonged to Reed. The material is described as a 3.5-inch galvanized metal pipe an inch and a half in diameter. Two galvanized end caps were attached to the pipe. One end cap had a small hole drilled into it. Canisters containing a fuse, a lighter, six coils of metal ribbon and several pounds of chemical powders were also found. The powders were described as potassium nitrate, aluminum powder, red iron oxide, ammonium perchlorate, sulfur powder and other materials. The affidavit said that the materials had been left in the home by Reed on April 26, but the person at the home did not know what had been left. Potassium nitrate is used in fertilizers and can also be used in fireworks and gunpowder. Aluminum powder, potassium nitrate and sulfur are common ingredients in flash powder. The affidavit said ATF explosives and chemistry experts determined that the materials 'can be readily assembled into a destructive device.' On his LinkedIn profile, Reed said he spent time at the U.S. Biological and Chemical Weapon Depot in Ft McClellan, Alabama. Reed also lists one year from 2010-2011 as a technician/regional safety officer for Allied International Emergency LLC., where he said response teams dealt with 'Weapons of Mass Destruction Response, Nuclear Event Management, Chemical or Biological Weapons Containment, Large Scale Environmental Loss Mitigation, to DOT/EPA small scale spill cleanup...' Reed, who acted as the town's spokesman in the aftermath of the blast, had a court appearance in Waco today and will remain in custody until a further hearing on Wednesday. At this point, agents have not connected the arrest to the April 17 West Fertilizer Company explosion that killed 15, including 12 first responders.

At last month’s public memorial for the 12 people EMT personnel killed responding to the fire, Reed gave a heartfelt and often humorous eulogy to his 'close friend' Cyrus Reed. Bryce said that he and his wife Brittany Reed were listening to music at their home when they heard the town's siren and jumped into their truck to warn people nearby. 'Get your kids and go!' the couple said they yelled at residents of an apartment complex near the plant. They said they were about 50 to 75 yards from the plant when the blast rocked their car. Bryce Reed: Questions are emerging over the authenticity of Reed's friendship with another EMT responder, Cyrus Reed, whose sister Sarah said the two men were not that close at all . Arrest: Paramedic Bryce Reed, has been arrested after he was found to possess explosives . Reed also said that his home was destroyed and that he had lost his best friend, volunteer firefighter Cyrus Reed, in the blast. The two are not related, but were so close they considered each other brothers. 'There's no words to convey the magnitude of this incident,' Reed he said at the time. In a video that aired at the memorial, Bryce Reed said Cyrus lived life to the fullest. He also said Cyrus also loved fire and was known for backyard high jinks that included shooting BB guns at pressurized cans of processed cheese. 'He would giggle and then proceed to plead his case and say, ‘You don’t understand, it was like 15 feet in the air and it spun and it was so cool,’ Bryce Reed said at the April 25 memorial in Waco that was attended by Gov. Rick Perry and President Barack Obama. However, Sarah Reed, who is Cyrus Reed’s biological sister, said her family had been 'fooled by Bryce Reed.' She told the Dallas Morning News that she let Bryce Reed eulogize her brother because he led them to believe that he and Cyrus Reed were very close. Sarah Reed says that she has gone through Cyrus Reed's computer and cellphone records and have found that the two first responders might not have been as close as the suspect led the public to believe. 'He convinced us that he and Cyrus were very close, like brothers,' she said. 'But I want people to know they are not brothers, and he is not part of our family.' Bryce Reed’s Facebook page indicates that some people may have accused him of profiting off of donations. He described this week as 'a trying one'. On Monday he posted that he is 'appalled at how people are tearing me apart.' He mentions that his wife, Brittany, left him because he was 'lost in his own emotions'. 'I have not received ONE CENT for ANYTHING that I did to help with this situation,' Bryce Reed wrote the following day. 'I have not been paid by the media, by press, I made nothing for delivering my brothers eulogy, and made NOTHING off of this tragedy. I was a shoulder to cry on, I found a GREAT new family, and was blessed to get to tell them about their son.' By Wednesday, Reed had decided to come off Facebook for a while: ' just wanted to tell everyone thank you for all the prayers and support. I'm going to take a break from Facebook to reflect. I assure you that I'm ok. God bless you all, and please if you heed nothing else I have said, love one another.

But as these hilarious examples show, the birth of the royal baby isn't the only event to have inspired an ad. Like his nephew, Prince Harry has inspired some - though he probably won't want to dwell on the news behind them. Prince Harry’s birthday-suit shenanigans in Vegas made international headlines.

Another ad inspired by Prince Harry's birthday suit shenanigans was created by deodorant brand Lynx. Referencing the brand's 'Lynx Effect', the strapline read: 'Sorry Harry... if it had anything to do with us.' Other brilliant ads that made the most of the news include Gareth Southgate's famous Pizza Hut ad after the defender missed a penalty and sent England crashing out of Euro 96. EasyJet followed suit when England's disappointing form at Euro 2012 ended in ignominious defeat, releasing an ad that read: 'Tears dry faster in the sun. Make England's exit easier to deal with.

The images have been collated by advertising agency Inferno which also runs a website, trendjacking,com, that contains an archive of newsjacking ads.

'By riding on the hype of current affairs brands can become part of the news. 'People have become great at ignoring traditional advertising.

Most trendjacking ads fail to make any impact, but the good ones become part of the story for years to come.' Other brands to have capitalised on memorable news include Ford, Mini, O2, Newcastle Brown Ale, Virgin and Specsavers. But the award for the most entertaining ad of all probably has to go to Konnectbus. The ad, carried on the back of the company's coaches, read: 'So cheap even an MP wouldn't claim it back: A month's unlimited travel between Norwich and Walton for as little as £3 per day'.

The UK Government has announced plans to provide £60 million for a revolutionary new rocket engine capable of taking people to Earth's . stratosphere in just 15 minutes. The engine is called Sabre, which stands for Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, and was built by British firm Reaction Engines. Reaction Engines claims Sabre can be used to help accelerate existing aircraft up to five times the speed of sound and plans to use the technology on a unique 3,500mph 'spaceplane' called Skylon. Scroll down for video . The UK Government has announced plans to provide £60million for a new rocket engine called Sabre, capable of taking people to Earth's stratosphere in just 15 minutes. It is built by British firm Reaction Engines which plans to use the technology on a unique 'spaceplane' called Skylon, pictured . The Oxfordshire-based company also add that at these speeds, a plane could theoretically travel from the U.S to Australia in under five hours. David Willetts, minister for . universities and science, said the investment in Sabre would provide support at a 'crucial stage' to . allow a full-scale prototype to be built. 'We’re investing £60 million in this and we expect them to go out and find private support as well,' Willetts told Radio Five Live. 'But we’re backing this because it’s technology that has been tested in the lab, it’s been assessed by outside experts as right in principle. 'Now it needs to be built on a full-scale prototype before it can get commercial. 'We think it’s right to support it through that crucial stage. Modern-day traditional aviation engines have to carry tanks of liquid oxygen when travelling at more than 1,900mph because they can't 'breathe' oxygen. Oxygen helps an engine to burn the fuel needed to power its propulsion. Reaction Engine's Sabre design uses a system of pipes, filled with . helium. The air passes through these pipes and the helium helps remove any heat and the oxygen is carried to the engine. Once in space, the engine is capable of switching into rocket mode. This means the craft can travel in orbit for around 36 hours and used to launch satellites, for example. Alan Bond, founder of Reaction Engines, told International Business Times: 'Rockets are stuck in a rut. The weight problem means it . costs a great deal of money to launch even the smallest satellite. 'The basic problem is that when you suck air into an engine at high . speed it instantly heats up to 1,000C - which is unmanageably hot. 'The challenge was to cool it back down to 140C in just a hundredth of a second - the time it takes to pass through the engine.' Bond continued: '[Sabre] would allow us to launch satellites far more cheaply, to build space . stations or to create orbiting solar arrays that would beam power to . earth. We could even construct spaceships for missions to other . planets.' 'That’s where too many great British ideas in the past have failed.' Willetts is expected reveal details of the investment at this week's UK Space Conference in Glasgow. Skylon is likely to be viewed a competitior to Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic business, in which people can experience six minutes of weightlessness during a sub-orbital spaceflights. Sir Branson and his Virgin Galactic company offer trips into . space, that include six minutes of weightlessness, for around £121,000. Skylon is expected to offer similar flights for cheaper, but has not announced any prices. Figures from the company believe the Skylon space place could cut the cost of space launches by around 95 per cent. An artist's impression of the British-built Sabre engine, pictured, which stands for Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine. When fitted to an aircraft, the engine is capable of travelling up to five times the speed of sound and will be used to send astronauts into space .

Oxygen helps an engine to burn the fuel needed to power its propulsion. Reaction Engine's Sabre design uses a system of pipes, filled with . helium. The air passes through these pipes and the helium helps remove any heat. Once in space, the engine is capable of switching into rocket mode. This means the craft can travel in orbit for around 36 hours and be used to launch satellites, for example. An artist's impression of the Skylon 'spaceplane' that can travel up 3,500mph when fitted with the Sabre engine. Skylon is expected to offer space flights to the general public and will compete with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic flights . Alan Bond, founder of Reaction . Engines, told International Business Times: 'Rockets are stuck in a rut. The weight problem means it . costs a great deal of money to launch even the smallest satellite. 'The basic problem is that when you suck air into an engine at high . speed it instantly heats up to 1,000C - which is unmanageably hot. 'The challenge was to cool it back down to 140C in just a hundredth of a second - the time it takes to pass through the engine.' Bond continued: 'It would allow us to launch satellites far more cheaply, to build space . stations or to create orbiting solar arrays that would beam power to . earth. 'We could even construct spaceships for missions to other . planets.' This artist's impression shows the Sabre engine fitted to the Skylon spaceplane.

"By . Tom Gardner . UPDATED: . 15:26 EST, 23 March 2012 . Alive: Glen Folkard shows off his horrific scar after surviving a shark attack . A surfer has spoken of his terror as a ferocious bull shark sank its teeth into his leg. Glen Folkard was thrown off his board and dragged beneath the surface as the 10ft animal caught him it its vice-like grip. But as the bull shark  - a species known to be highly aggressive towards humans - released him for another bite, the 44-year-old seized his chance for life. He managed to climb back onto his . board and ride the waves back to Redhead Beach, north of Sydney - all . while the menacing dark shadow stalked behind in the blood stream gushing from his horrific thigh wound. ‘It was everything you'd think it would be, just sheer terror. ‘He's . hit me from underneath, he's grabbed me, he's turned me, took me under . and then let go cos I think he had fibreglass in his mouth... and that . was my chance,’ he told AFP, five weeks after the savage attack. The father-of-one collapsed in the sand with a ‘big mass of yuck’ where his thigh once was, but euphoric to be alive. He added: ‘I just remember rolling off the surfboard onto my back, looking at the sky and just loving life instantly,’ ‘I was laying on my back looking just . at the blue sky, going ""I'm alive, I made it"" because it was all but . over. He was metres away from having a second go.’ Mr Folkard lost more than four pounds in weight of flesh from his leg and nearly bled to death. He spent several days in intensive care fighting for his life after suffering horrific blood loss. But he does not hold a grudge against the shark that bit him -- ‘he didn't know any better, it was a mistaken identity'. One witness, who identified himself only as Peter, said the attack scene was like something out of the movie Jaws. Predator: Bull shark's are one of only a few of the species that are aggressive towards humans . He said at the time: 'My son actually said he saw the shark leap out of the water and grab a fish before the attack. 'The man's skin was really grey. He obviously lost quite a lot of blood. 'It . was kind of like Jaws, you know, the scene at the start where . everybody's pulled out of the water and it's a hot day and the water's . inviting.' Scores of people were in the water at the time and hundreds were on the beach and heard the frantic cries 'I'm in trouble, I'm . in trouble', from Mr Folkard. Surfer Steve Tidey described a terrifying scene of panic and blood. He said: 'There was a disturbance in the water and I looked back and saw him get back on the board. 'There . were bits of his board floating in the water and blood was streaming . out from behind him. I knew there had been a shark attack.' Ferocious: The highly aggressive bull shark took more than four pounds of flesh from the father-of-one's thigh during the attack on February 23 on the Redhead Beach, left . Bull sharks are typically solitary hunters and cruise through shallow waters. They are extremely territorial and attack animals that enter their territory. Along with the tiger shark and great white shark,  they are one of the species most likely to attack humans. One or several bull sharks may have been responsible for the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, which was the inspiration for Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. The speculation of bull sharks possibly being responsible is based on some attacks occurring in brackish and freshwater, as well as there being certain similarities in bite marks between bull and great white sharks. In India, bull sharks swim up the Ganges River and have attacked people. He added that Mr Folkard started losing consciousness as soon as he was carried onto the shore. As paramedics rushed to the scene, lifesavers gave Mr Folkard oxygen before he was carried to a nearby shed. Mr . Tidey told how a brave Mr Folkard even managed to crack a joke about . wanting to see his surfboard because it was his favourite after . paramedics gave him some oxygen. This was the first shark attack at a netted beach in New South Wales since February 2009 when a surfer lost his hand at Bondi. It is not known, however, whether the net at Redhead Beach had been removed by maritime authorities. The . New South Wales government's shark net programme includes more than 50 . beaches over a 200 mile part of the coast north and south of Sydney. They are a series of short nets stretching from one end of a beach to the other and are in about 50ft of water. The region's Green Party called . for the removal of all shark nets, because they are ineffective and . pose a hazard to marine life. The . Sidney Morning Herald quoted Greens MP Cate Faermann as saying shark . nets were nothing more than a psychological comfort to swimmers. Idyllic: The shark attack has not put off too many surfers from enjoying the waves at Redhead Beach near Newcastle but has led to some calls for improved safety features . 'The nets are supposed to be a barrier to stop sharks reaching shallow water, but in reality almost half of shark entanglements occur on the beach side of the nets,' she said. 'Shark nets kill thousands of turtles, dolphins, rays and other species that are not a danger to humans at all.' But New South Wales's Department of Primary Industries disputed the claims. 'Since (shark meshing) was first introduced in 1937 there has only been one fatality on a meshed beach,' a spokesman for the agency said. The spokesman added that only about three dolphins and three turtles a year are caught in nets, while more than 60 per cent of rays captured are released alive.","Beast took nearly 4lbs of flesh from father-of-one's leg .

But Tony Blair has not always enjoyed success with the buying and selling of his many homes. Until now, for I learn that he and his wife Cherie have scooped £170,000 on a recent sale. The bonanza profit — more than the UK average price for a whole house — was made in just four years on a home in Marylebone they bought for their son Nicky in 2009. Bonanza profit: Tony Blair and his wife Cherie made £170,00 on the sale of a house they owned for just four years . They paid £1.13 million to purchase the four-bedroom Georgian townhouse for cash, and have sold it for £1.3 million to a former Pakistani politician and would-be Tory MP. The new owner, Dr Ashraf Chohan, who has British and Pakistani citizenship, says he was selected by the Conservatives as a potential parliamentary candidate. Instead, he stood for election in Pakistan. Dr Chohan, 59, already owned the house next door to Nicky, from where he runs a medical clinic. He says Cherie had initially tried to buy his house from him. ‘I bought my house in 2009, the same time as the Blairs,’ he says. ‘Mrs Blair contacted me and asked if we wanted to sell our house. I think she wanted it for her daughter. But I did not want to sell. ‘Then, a few years later, I made an offer to the Blairs they found difficult to turn down, and we bought their house.’ Dr Chohan says being a neighbour of Nicky had been an eye-opening experience for him. ‘It has been shocking to see children of Tony Blair doing their own shopping at Tesco, and cycling around like ordinary children. We would never see children of ministers in Pakistan mixing with anyone other than their own class.’ He adds: ‘The Blairs have been very good neighbours, always courteous. The Blair children were very down to earth, very polite.’ Nicky, 27, moved out last month to a larger property nearby, which the Blairs bought for him for £1.35 million in cash. The Blairs still maintain a portfolio of eight properties worth an estimated £21 million. Their two other elder children, Euan, 29, and Kathryn, 25, also have their own houses. Earlier this year, the Blairs bought a woodland retreat for the former PM’s sister Sarah close to their Buckinghamshire mansion, which they paid £5.75 million for in 2008. 'I can't believe I'm still working': Anita Harris, 72 . Once the highest paid cabaret artist in the world, Anita Harris lost everything in a Swiss banking fraud — but now at the age of 72 she has become a workaholic as she battles to regain fame and fortune. ‘I can’t believe I’m still working, but now I’ve got two jobs,’ Anita reveals at the opening night of Wag! The Musical, at the Charing Cross Theatre. ‘I’m touring the country in  A Murder Has Been Arranged and also rehearsing for my new one-woman show,’ she adds. ‘It’s tough going at my age — I had thought I might be retired by now.’ A former Carry On star, convent-educated Anita has been married to artist Mike Margolis for almost 40 years. In 1985, they lost millions after, she claims, a bank embezzled their savings. Her woes were compounded by the loss of their £1 million Barnes home and personal tragedy — both she and Mike have suffered cancer. ‘But being a workaholic is saving me,’ beams Anita. ‘I look on the bright side.’ In 2008, Paul Stewart was snowboarding in the French Alps when an avalanche swept him over the side of a mountain, dumping him on his back 200ft below. He was paralysed from the waist down and told, at the age of 27, he would never walk again. But Paul has astonished doctors and now gets around, largely under his own steam, on sticks and with leg braces. And next month he will take on a remarkable physical challenge. Over two weeks Paul, son of stockbroker and racing figure Andy Stewart, will swim two-and-a-half miles, cycle 112 miles, walk 26 miles and then, uniquely, climb the face of the very cliff from which he fell. It is called the Iron Spine Challenge and has inspired a host of celebrity figures from David Cameron to Sir Alex Ferguson to back him. Paul, a member of England’s wheelchair tennis team, tells me: ‘I want to do a challenge for charity and going back to the scene of my accident seems very appropriate.’ He hopes to raise £350,000 for Spinal Research and Wings For Life.

The couple are childhood sweethearts, but Tudor Hall-educated Daisy, also 25, who  runs her Lilah design company making elegant silk jackets for clients including Pippa Middleton, prefers to keep a low profile. This weekend, they are heading to the posh Secret Garden music festival, which is held in the grounds of her father landowner Lord de Ramsey’s 6,000-acre estate, where he lives with second wife Alison at Abbots Ripton Hall near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire.

Councillors in Merton have decided to give Murray the Honorary Freedom of the London borough where the championships are held, but realised, to their horror, that they hadn’t done the same for three other Britons who have won the singles — all of them women. So, after quite a wait, the Freedom Of Merton is also being granted  to Angela Mortimer Barrett (who won  in 1961), Ann Haydon-Jones (1969), and Virginia Wade (1977). Better late than never.

Mr Cummins, 65, is a retired house builder who has spent much of the past two years working in the communal garden at his block of flats. He removed rubbish, including hazards such as broken bottles, which deterred youths from littering as the area was suddenly so nice. The retiree also put up violas, pansies, and marigolds in 37 baskets hanging from the wall above a communal patch of grass, brightening up the view for passers-by as well as residents.

The teenager from Cramlington, Northumberland, went missing earlier this week after fleeing from her mother with Murat Can Ertani, 22, while on holiday at the Turkish holiday resort of Marmaris. She was found by police four days later trying to hitch a ride with Can more than 40 miles from where they was last seen. She was reunited with her distraught mother Rhonda, 39, right away and, now back in the UK, the pair appeared on ITV's This Morning. Scroll down for video . Moment of madness: Teenager Faye Jones said she didn't know what she was doing when she ran away with Murat Can Ertani . Bad behaviour: On This Morning, the teen said she's ashamed of what she put mother, Rhonda, right, through . Faye, 16, saw a video clip of her mother's desperate appeal to find her daughter and said it was 'awful' to see her reaction to her disappearing act. She explained: 'When I woke up I didn't have plans to run away. It was just planned and done in half an hour.' Faye said she had argued with her mother about returning to the UK as she wanted to stay on in Turkey with her grandmother. But Rhonda said she was so concerned about her daughter's proximity to Can - who she had seen slap another girl in a bar - she did not want to leave Faye behind. 'I couldn't leave her knowing what he could do,' Rhonda said. Faye vented her anguish by messaging Can on Facebook complaining about having to leave and he told her she didn't have to. Not long after he was outside her hotel in his car. Sympathy: Presenter Emma Bunton said it must have been a 'scary' time for Rhonda . 'When I got in the car it was a thrill but at the same time crazy,' she admitted. 'I didn't really know what I was doing.' Rhonda said she chased the car down the road in her tankini and flip flops and then rushed to the police station to report her daughter missing. She said: 'I had to be calmed down I was just beside myself. I never dreamt she would do something like this, she's always been a really good, homely girl, it was out of character.' Presenter Emma Bunton sympathised saying: 'It must have been so scary for you, as a mother myself you just worry so much.' When asked by the former Spice Girl why she didn't contact her mother to let her know she was safe, Faye said: 'Later on I was hoping to be found because I was too ashamed to ring home. I knew she would forgive me but I was too ashamed. 'I knew what she must have been going through but it was a selfish outburst I don't really know what took over.' Smiling again: The mother said they won't be returning to Turkey . When asked how she managed during her days on the run with Can, she said: 'We didn't have any money, I sold a gold ring for £10 that got us some food to get by but apart from that we had no money. We stayed at different, horrible places. We didn't have much to eat just enough to keep going.' The Turkish waiter, who has been to prison six times, has been released by police after Faye decided not to press charges. She said they did not have sex and he did not force her to run away. She explained: 'I went willingly and it was my idea. Even though he's older and people will say he should know better it was also my fault and I have to take responsibility for that so I don't think he should go to jail.' No charges: Faye said it wouldn't be right for Ertani to go to jail because it was her idea to run away . Photos have already emerged of Can back on the prowl in Marmaris as it was revealed yesterday that he is unrepentant. He is reported to have said that English girls were 'easy' and claimed he would run away with Faye or another English girl, as long as they were over 18 - the Turkish age of consent. 'I am in love with the girl next to me,' he said. 'When she leaves there is always another one. Girls love a bad boy and that is me. Girls get boring and I cannot stay with just one for more than a few weeks.' However, Rhonda said she won't be putting her daughter into that situation again. 'We won't be going back to Turkey,' she said.","Teenager appeared on This Morning with mother, Rhonda .

Well, a new technology might spell the end of your favourite summery excuse to dodge exercise. The UK's first sweat-fuelled sportswear range designed to keep you cool has hit the British high street as temperatures push 30 degrees Celsius. Scroll down for video . A model wears the UK's first sweat-fuelled runnign top. The range called Way2Cool is from Mountain Hard Wear and prices start at £20 . Californian sportswear company, Mountain Hardwear, has developed a range of clothing with elite athletes that it tested in the searing 40 degree heat of the Grand Canyon. The 'Way2Cool' range of sportswear is made of the world's first fabric technology that uses wearers' sweat to activate in-built cooling agents. The Cool.Q.Zero fabric has been developed to give runners and keep-fit junkies a winning edge in hot weather by preventing overheating. The running top (pictured) is made from the world's first fabric technology to use wearer's sweat to activate in-built cooling agents . The company claims that running tops with Cool.Q ZERO technology are the 'world's most advanced'. It also said that the clothing range is the industry's 'first active-cooling technology designed to actually lower the overall temperature of the fabric when you sweat.' The technology works due to hundreds of tiny rings embedded in the fabric and uses materials from industrial water filtration processes to ensure that excess moisture is 'sucked' away from the body. The rings, which contain a cooling agent, react to sweat and moisture causing them to suck and swell to create an instant and prolonged cooling effect on the skin. An athlete wears the sportswear on the Grand Canyon Rim 2 Rim hike. It was developed by Mountain Hardwear and tested on elite athletes in searing 40 degree heat to see if the technology really did keep them cool . 'Hot weather and heat are incredibly challenging conditions for anyone participating in outdoor activities, especially runners and aerobic athletes,' said Topher Gaylord, president of Mountain Hardwear. 'Cool.Q ZERO changes that by enabling athletes to run more comfortably in hot conditions. 'It's a no-sweat solution for even the most extreme temperatures.'

Scientists at Oxford University are working with Nissan in Sunderland to create ‘robotcars’ that can drive themselves independently using details of the road they are driving on stored in on-board software. Other vehicles being developed by Sweden’s Volvo, Vauxhall’s US parent General Motors, and Germany’s Mercedes-Benz and VW groups take their cues from their surroundings. The Nissan self-drive Leaf electric car is controlled by an iPad, and the Oxford team behind it claim the technology could be installed in mainstream cars as a £60 option.

A laser at the front scans 164ft ahead 13 times per second for obstacles, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or other cars in an 85-degree field of view. If it senses an obstacle, it slows and comes to a controlled stop. The driver can tap the brake pedal to regain control of the vehicle from the computer. Backers say robot cars could lead to cheaper insurance because the vehicle will know what is up ahead on the road better than the driver, who must chose to switch to autonomous driving.","Government gives green-light for 'robotcar' trials to happen this year .

Stunning blonde Carrie Reichert claims she was alone with a naked Prince Harry for between 15 and 20 minutes in his hotel room . Wild times: Carrie partied with the young Royal on his now-infamous night in Sin City . However, despite the intimate nature of their rendezvous, Carrie insisted the kiss was 'fun' and 'not romantic'. She also claimed that, in spite of many people stripping off at the party, it was not an orgy. Instead, she said, Harry was a 'gentleman' but added he was completely 'wasted'. The 32-year-old is the first woman to speak out about Harry's wild night in Vegas, where he was pictured frolicking naked with a young woman during a game of 'strip billiards'. Carrie, who had been visiting from San Diego with a group of girlfriends, claims she was hand-picked to join the Prince's party after his friends spotted her near the swimming pool at the Encore At Wynn hotel, it was reported.

Instead she's relying on equipment that surrounds her with . an electrical field to deter the predators. Her support team consisted . of more than a dozen navigators, handlers and medical personnel who were . escorting her on the 44-foot (13-meter) catamaran Sealuver. Support: Ms Palfrey (third left) with members of the crew that will follow her for the journey - estimated to take around 50 hours - and ensure she's safe from sharks . Australian Susie Maroney made the . crossing in 1997 at age 22, but with a shark cage. American Diana Nyad . made two unsuccessful cageless attempts last year on either side of her . 62nd birthday, but had to call them off due to a debilitating asthma . attack and painful Portuguese man o' war stings. She plans to try again . this summer. Palfrey began the swim in a regular . sporting swimsuit, but said Friday that she planned to put on a porous, . non-buoyant Lycra bodysuit that provides cover down to the wrists and . ankles whenever jellyfish may be a threat. 'Every single swim is individual. Each swim comes with its own challenges. This is a really big challenge, the Florida Straits, 103 miles,' the well-tanned, muscular Palfrey said. The swim was completed successfully in May 1997 by Australian Susan Maroney, who unlike Nyad and Palfrey, used a shark cage for protection. Maroney was 22 at the time, but Palfrey, who has three grown children and two grandchildren, dismissed the idea that her age could be an impediment. 'I think my track record speaks for itself,' she said. Cheerful: Ms Palfrey chats with TV crews about the swim which she is feeling confident about, despite the last person who attempted the journey failing three times . Last June, Palfrey captured the world . record for what are referred to as 'unassisted open ocean swims' by . swimming 67.25 miles (109 km) in the Cayman Islands, Cuba's fellow . Caribbean country. Ms Palfrey will have to contend with venomous jellyfish as well as the sharks that like to swim alongside people . Her resume contains a long list of . marathon swims, including twice across the English Channel, a round trip . in the Strait of Gibraltar and three swims around Manhattan Island. She decided to take on the Florida Straits after flying over on her way back from the record-breaking Cayman swim. 'We . flew from Grand Cayman island to Miami and out of my window on the . airplane I could see the Florida Straits. We flew over Cuba and I could . see Miami and it was such a beautiful sight,' she said. She started researching the straits when she got home and before long, she 'was already hooked.' As Nyad did, she will get liquids and food at regular intervals that she must take without touching the boat. There were reports that her crew killed several sharks that approached during her Cayman Island swim, but Palfrey said that was not true and would not happen on this swim. 'We don't kill sharks. We love the ocean. We like to preserve the ocean,' she said. Palfrey had planned to make her attempt a few days ago, but had to wait for Tropical Storm Debby to stop churning in the Gulf of Mexico off northwestern Florida.","Marathon swim through shark-infested waters for 49-year-old .

Former newspaper owner Eddy Shah repeatedly raped a 14-year-old girl during sex sessions with a prostitute, a court heard yesterday. Shah, founder of the now defunct Today newspaper, raped the teenager on six occasions in the early 1990s, it was alleged. He paid prostitute Susan Davies for sex in ‘smart hotel rooms’, and she brought along the girl, the Old Bailey was told. Eddy Shah, 69, pictured here with wife Jennifer outside the Old Bailey today, denies raping the schoolgirl in the early 1990s . On one occasion, the youngster claims . Shah told her while raping her that he had ‘planned this since I was a . little girl’, it was said. Yesterday Davies, 53, sat in the dock alongside Shah, 69, for the start of their four-week trial. She is charged with child cruelty and . with aiding and abetting the rape and indecent assault of the schoolgirl . by Shah. She is also accused of pimping out the youngster to a second . man, businessman Anthony Pallant, who is accused of rape and indecent . assault. Susan Davies, 53, left, and her former lover Anthony Pallant, also 53, right, deny the charges against them . The girl did not tell police for . nearly 20 years. Now 34, she was composed and clear as she gave evidence . from the witness stand yesterday. Gillian Etherton QC, prosecuting, said . Shah, Davies and Pallant were arrested on sex charges in September . 2011. All three deny the accusations, accusing the girl of ‘a series of . lies, malice or pure fantasy that never happened’. But Miss Etherton said: ‘These allegations are about child abuse. ‘She was a young girl who should have had the protection of the considerably older adults around her. ‘Instead, she was used by these adults for their own selfish personal needs resulting in her sexual abuse.’ Miss Etherton said Davies, of Swanley, . Kent, was pivotal to the case and had worked for many years as a . prostitute, slipping out in the evenings after working in the shop that . she ran with her husband. ‘She is a woman of few moral scruples,’ added . the QC. She told the jury the alleged  victim . ‘was taken to a hotel where [Susan Davies] had clearly arranged to see . and perform sexual favours for Eddy Shah’. Jurors at the Old Bailey heard that the girl had to have sex with Shah in various upmarket hotels . She waited outside a room and, ‘a . short while later Mr Shah came out, knelt down in front of her and asked . if she wanted to come through to the adjoining room. ‘She refused and said no.’ Davies is alleged to have turned on . the youngster as soon as they left the suite, telling the girl: ‘You . better ****ing do it next time.’ On the next occasion, the three met at . a hotel and the girl was ordered to strip, and Shah had unprotected sex . with her while the prostitute watched, the court heard. In the dock, . Shah, wearing a tieless blue shirt and grey suit, slowly shook his head. Eddy Shah, 69, from Kington Langley, near Chippenham in Wiltshire, denies the charges . Shah’s wife of 40 years, the actress . Jennifer White Shah, who uses a wheelchair after her back was damaged . during bouts of lifesaving cancer treatment, listened to the evidence . from the side of the court. The prosecutor said the girl eventually became ‘used’ to the abuse. ‘She said, to deal with it, she . switched off and became robotic during these events,’ said Miss . Etherton. ‘At this point in her teenage years, she now cared very little . about herself and had little self-respect or respect for adults.’ The girl said that the last time she had sex with Shah was when she was 15. Miss Etherton said Davies had had an . extra-marital affair with Pallant, of West Malling, Kent, and had become . ‘obsessed’ with him, and had used the girl as a ‘bargaining object’ to . maintain her affair. Shah launched Today in 1986 and was . known for bringing in new technology and colour pages. He sold his . newspaper empire in 1988. Shah, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, owned . and ran the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club in Royal Wootton Bassett, . before putting it on the market for £3.5million. It was sold in February . this year. The trial continues. Born Selim Shah in 1944 to an English mother and Iranian father, Shah was educated at Gordonstoun and a crammer in Brighton. Finally achieving nine O-levels, he didn't go to university and instead began his career working as a theatre stage manager. Shah moved on to the BBC and Granada where he worked as a floor manager on shows including Coronation Street, before working at the Manchester Evening News. When he was made redundant by the paper in 1976, he decided he would never work for anyone else again, and sold his first house in Sale for £14,000 to start his own free newspapers. Over the next decade, Shah's business took off, and he eventually built up a portfolio of 60 newspaper titles. In 1983 he confronted the trade unions at his Warrington printworks and Manchester newspaper offices, and as owner of the Warrington Messenger he sacked six workers using the new Labour Laws.  His home was picketed for months, he was sent death threats including coffins delivered to his house, and earned the nickname the 'Shah of Warrington'. Shah, pictured at the 1984 AIMS of Industry awards with then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, saw off the unions in 1983 . In 1986, Shah launched Today, then seen as extremely technologically-advanced with its full colour offset printing at a time when newspapers were still using Linotype machines and letterpress. Launched as a rival to the Daily Mail, the paper was inspired by American newspaper USA Today and had Alastair Campbell as political editor and his girlfriend (now wife) Fiona Millar as news editor.  Today was bought by Tiny Rowland's Lonrho a few months later. Shah went on to launch the unsuccessful national tabloid The Post in 1988, but by 1989 he'd sold his entire newspaper group. In 1989 he set up Messenger TV company, before moving to the US and writing four novels: The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring Of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994).  In 2008 a further novel, thriller Second World, was published. Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels in cluding the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club at Royal Wootton Bassett.  He has also dabbled in property development with a scheme of 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire golf club. He is married to actress Jennifer White Shah and they have three children.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:17 EST, 22 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:53 EST, 23 February 2013 . Chilling audio of an 17-year-old admitting to murdering and dismembering a 10-year-old girl and hiding her remains in his home was played before a court today while including his admittance to previously attempting to kidnap a female jogger. In the five-minute recording Austin Sigg, now aged 18 of Denver, Colorado, is heard telling police dispatch that he killed Jessica Ridgeway and promises full proof and zero resistance with his arrest. 'I murdered Jessica Ridgeway, I have proof that I did. I'm giving myself up completely, there will be no resistance whatsoever,' Sigg is heard in the call recorded on the night of October 23 – 18 days after her abduction. Scroll down for video . Murder trial: Austin Reed Sigg, 18, will be charged as an adult in the murder of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway in October . Sigg's mother Mindy Sigg broke down in court when hearing her own voice on the recording asking for police to come quickly, the Denver Post reports. 'I need you to come to my house, my son wants to turn himself in for Jessica Ridgeway's murder,' the mother tells a dispatcher after his personal confession to her that included admittance that he hid some of the girl's remains in the crawl space of their home. When asked by a dispatcher if he has a previous criminal history he admits to a previous attack on a jogger involving home-made chloroform he learned to make off the internet. 'The only other (incident) was Ketner Lake, where a woman was attacked. That was me,' Sigg said. On the day of his confession his . mother recalled returning home from work to find her son lying on her bed. She said he told her that he needed to talk. 'I'm a monster,' he told her before spilling every horrifying detail of his crimes to her. On Friday Detective Michael Lynch who interviewed Mindy Sigg, shared those details, claiming that Austin Sigg grabbed Jessica from the street when she was walking by his car on the morning she disappeared. He put her in the backseat and zip-tied her arms and legs before driving around for a bit. Tragic end: Jessica Ridgeway went missing on her walk to school in a suburb of Denver in October . He then brought the girl back to his bedroom, took off her clothes, and tried to choke her with zip ties before strangling her, according to Lynch. After moving the body to a bathtub he . said he used a saw from the garage to dismember her body. From there he . bagged up the pieces, leaving some in the crawl space and moving others . to a field. Lynch said Sigg denied sexually . assaulting as well as torturing Jessica. Those claims were argued by a . nurse on Friday who had examined Jessica's torso and testified that the girl was bruised, cut and sexually assaulted. Because of this, three new charges were added including sexual assault and . sexual exploitation of a child — namely child pornography. Austin Reed Sigg, 17, is also accused of attacking a jogger in a park on Memorial Day 2012 . Four days earlier two FBI agents took a DNA . sample from Sigg after a tip-off from a neighbor. As police sought Jessica Ridgeway's . killer, that person called a tip line suggesting they check out Austin . Sigg because he seemed preoccupied with death, Westminster police . detective Luis Lopez said. Today, he testified that Sigg's DNA evidence not . only matched Jessica's but also was linked to the clothing of a jogger . who reported being attacked near Ketner Lake over Memorial Day weekend 2012 - the same attack he mentions in his taped confession. The 22-year-old woman said she was . running in a Westminster park when a man grabbed her from behind and . placed a rag with a chemical smell over her mouth but she managed to escape. Jessica disappeared while walking . to school on October 5. Some of her remains were found in garbage bags . in an open space park five days later. Today was the first time . investigators revealed that the bags contained her torso. A wooden cross was also found that . was later linked to Siggs as was evidence found in Jessica's backpack . which contained her glasses, T-shirt, pants, underwear and boots with . pom poms . The 18-year-old faces 16 counts related to the death of Jessica and six . counts, including attempted murder, related to the attack on the . jogger. Hundreds of officers canvassed the . area at the time and investigated leads and took DNA samples as parents waited with . their children at bus stops and thought twice about letting them out of . sight. Heartbroken: Jessica's dad, Jeremiah Bryant, pictured, breaks down during a press conference, as Jessica's mother describes their little girl . Comfort: Jessica's mother Sarah Ridgeway and Jessica's father, Jeremiah Bryant embrace at the Westminster Police Department on Tuesday, October 9, 2012 . Police asked residents to be on the . lookout for anything suspicious from their bosses, friends and family . members, watching for things like leaving home unexpectedly, missing . appointments or changing their appearance. Lopez said Sigg's mother turned her . son in on October 23, a day before testing was completed on the DNA . sample taken based on the neighbor's tip. An autopsy determined that the cause . of death was asphyxiation secondary to suffocation or strangulation, according to the Denver Post. The judge originally ordered the . hearing to be closed to the public but the Colorado Supreme Court sided . with media organizations who argued that he failed to show that holding . the hearing in public would jeopardize Sigg's right to a fair trial.

"Gingrich says the politically correct can't handle 'uncomfortable facts' By . Louise Boyle . UPDATED: . 11:34 EST, 17 January 2012 . Two standing ovations and applause greeted  Newt Gingrich's comments during a GOP TV debate last night as he attacked Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney and defended allegedly racist comments he made earlier on the campaign trail. In particular, Gingrich stood by remarks he had made in December, when he said poor children in low-income households should be given the opportunity to be janitors at their own schools. The former House speaker was confronted in front of a 3,000-strong crowd in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina by leading commentator Juan Williams. Scroll down for video . Having his moment: Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich speaks to the media following his defiant performance at a debate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina . During the debate, which took place on Martin Luther King Day, Mr Williams asked: 'Can't you see that this is viewed at a minimum as insulting to all Americans, but particularly to black Americans?' Gingrich responded: 'No, I don't see that' to whoops and cheers from the mostly white GOP voters. The presidential hopeful went on to say that his daughter had . held a cleaning job at the age of 13 and offered other examples where . children as young as 11 have earned their own money. Gingrich added: 'They'd be getting money, which is a good thing if you're poor. Only the elites despise earning money.' In December, the former Georgia lawmaker had told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, that children in poor neighbourhoods have 'no habits of working and nobody around them who works'. War of words: Newt Gingrich (L) denied that his comment, that poor children should work as school janitors, was racist after being questioned by commentator Juan Williams (R) Mr Williams, an award-winning, liberal . commentator, then asked Gingrich if his remarks had . been 'intended to belittle the poor and racial minorities' . Gingrich stuck to his argument, once again referring to Barack Obama as 'the food stamp president'. 'Money is a good thing if you're poor. Only the elites despise earning money.' Newt Gingrich . The crowd gave him a standing ovation when he responded: . 'Well, first of all, Juan, the fact is that more people have been put on . food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history. 'Now, I know among the politically correct you're not supposed to use . facts that are uncomfortable.' Throughout his campaign, Gingrich has reiterated the point that successful people have started out working early in life, shovelling snow, babysitting and delivering newspapers. He has questioned child labour laws and spoken of the need for people to help break themselves out of a cycle of poverty. Gingrich said his daughter did janitorial work at the First Baptist Church in Carrollton, Georgia, when she was a teenager and that the example could be turned into a model for the entire country. He also took a swipe at New York City unions saying that 30 schoolchildren could be hired to replace one janitor because the unions had negotiated such high pay for their workers. Gingrich gave way on little at last night's debate as he also turned on Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney ahead of Saturday's primary vote in South Carolina. Then there were five: (l-r) Ricky Perry, Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul took part in the debate after Jon Huntsman dropped out of the race yesterday . He won two standing ovations from the crowd during the 16th debate between the candidates, with comments such as: 'We need to satisfy the country that whoever we nominate has a record that can stand up . to Barack Obama in a very effective way.' Some of Gingrich's . remarks to the packed auditorium were booed (including when it was . mentioned that Romney's father was born in Mexico). Following the debate, Gingrich told Mail commentator Toby Harnden that he felt his exchange with Mr Williams had been crucial to the debate. No holds barred: Newt Gingrich led an attack on Mitt Romney's tax record and urged voters to take a critical look at the former Massachusetts governor . He told waiting reporters: 'It's the only time I've ever seen a standing ovation, certainly in the debates I've been involved. 'There . was a spontaneous sense that somebody finally had the courage to just . tell the truth about how we've got to go about helping people, and the . fact that I was very clear.' Former Massachusetts governor Romney has won the first two events of the campaign, the Iowa caucuses and last week's New Hampshire primary. He leads in the pre-primary polls in South Carolina and won an endorsement from campaign dropout Jon Huntsman earlier in the day. Gingrich has virtually conceded that a victory for Romney in South Carolina would assure his nomination as Democratic President Barack Obama's Republican rival in the fall, and none of the other remaining contenders has challenged that conclusion.",Gingrich says the politically correct can't handle 'uncomfortable facts'

The Queen has launched a discreet campaign to ensure that Prince Charles, Prince William – and eventually baby George – inherit her role as Head of the Commonwealth. Contrary to popular belief, the position does not extend to her successors. However, the Queen wants David Cameron to use a summit later this year to urge Commonwealth leaders to change its rules so that her son, grandson and great-grandson take on the role when they become King. Born to rule: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their new born son, Prince George of Cambridge . The Palace believes Commonwealth joy over the birth of George provides the ideal opportunity to guarantee the British Monarchy does not lose its most prominent international platform when the Queen dies. Her position as Head of the Commonwealth was secured in the ‘London Declaration’ of 1949, three years before she acceded to the Throne. But, crucially, it did not state her heirs would take over. Technically, it is up to the leaders of the 54 countries that make up the Commonwealth to decide who will replace her as Head. But if the Buckingham Palace initiative succeeds, the job would be secured for future British Monarchs when the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) takes place in Sri Lanka in November. International platform: The Queen wants her son Prince Charles and subsequent monarchs to also be Head of the Commonwealth . A pledge at the summit that Charles and his heirs would succeed the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth would avoid nations such as Australia and Jamaica – where there are vocal republican movements – using the meeting as an opportunity to demand a break in the link with the British Monarchy. Evidence of covert diplomatic manoeuvres by the Palace is revealed in a subtle change on the website of the London-based Commonwealth Secretariat, the organisation’s official HQ. Until recently the section on the ‘Head of the Commonwealth’ stated that although the Queen occupied the position, it ‘does not pass automatically to her heir’. Good timing: The Queen has chosen a moment while the Royal family is at its most popular to launch her campaign . This has been quietly removed in recent weeks. Foreign Office insiders say this is part of a discreet campaign. Charles will attend the CHOGM alongside Mr Cameron. The Queen will miss the biennial event for the first time because of Prince Philip’s ill-health and controversy over staging it in Sri Lanka, which has a poor human rights record. ‘It would be awful if, when the Queen dies, there was a political wrangle in the Commonwealth over whether Charles should follow her,’ said one diplomat. ‘Removing the reference on the  Commonwealth Secretariat website to the fact the British Monarch does not automatically get the Commonwealth job was a clear signal. There are one of two ambitious, rather distasteful figures in the Commonwealth who could use this uncertainty to try to grab the job vacated by the Queen. ‘If David Cameron asks Commonwealth leaders to secure the role for little George, few could object.’ Critics say appointing a hereditary figure to lead the Commonwealth undermines its efforts to spread democracy. But supporters say it emphasises the Commonwealth’s character as a ‘unique family of nations’ rather than a political, UN-style organisation.","It is currently up to leaders of the Commonwealth who will be next Head .

A family's tears flowed at an emotional reunion with a mother who had disappeared more than three decades ago and who they believed was long dead. Betty Lukich, 69, left Bangor, Maine, in 1981 after an acrimonious divorce, leaving her four children and four of her sisters with no idea where she'd gone. They falsely believed she was dead after a brother rang them up drunk one day and told them he had buried her in a marijuana field behind his home in Indiana. 'We thought she was dead': Betty Lukich, 69, far right, with her sisters, from left, Virginia Allen, 72, Mary Inman, 75, and Laura Riegelmen, 78, for their first reunion after she left town more than three decades ago . Long-lost mother: Debra Carmona says of these pictures of Betty Lukich (left): 'My mom, as we knew her... This was the last photo we had of her before we lost touch' and (right) 'This is how I remember my Mom' Instead Ms Lukich, who was in her mid-30s when she moved away, spent the next 14 years driving an articulated lorry around the U.S., visiting all the lower 48 states save North Dakota. Another life: Betty Lukich aged 50 in 1995, when she'd been missing for 14 years . Yesterday, the family was finally reunited when Ms Lukich, now of Pheonix, Arizona, flew into Bangor International Airport for a month-long visit. 'I had to get away from it all,' she told the Bangor Daily News, which was on hand to witness the scene. Her daughter, Donna Keniston, was just 18 months old when Ms Lukich divorced her husband. She and her three siblings stayed in the Bangor area with their father. With tensions high between the two parents, visits from their mother were rare, she said. She was 12 the last time she saw her. 'My dad told us that my mother didn’t want us,' said Ms Keniston, now 50 and a grandmother herself. Then . one day, a brother of Miss Lukich - who is one of 13 siblings - called . one of her sisters still living in Maine to tell her she was dead. 'He . got drunk one day and called and said he’d buried her in the pot field . behind his house,' said Laura Reigelman, 78, of Glenburn, a small town . to the north of Bangor. With no news from their long-lost sister, the family soon began to believe the story. Reunion: Debra Carmona (right) is reunited with her mother Betty Lukich (left) who she hasn't seen since 1981 .

The family were finally reunited after Ms Lukich used the online family tree service www.heritage.com to connect with cousins living in central Maine. Today: Betty Lukich in 2013 following her emotional reunion with the family she hadn't seen since 1981 . They had stayed in touch with Ms Luckich's sisters and asked if they could let them know that she was still alive and how they could contact her. Ms Keniston only learned her mother was still alive in February - on the day of her grandson's fifth birthday. They spoke on the phone and connected over Facebook, catching up on 33 years' worth of lost time. Yesterday Ms Keniston, Ms Lukich and Ms Riegelman gathered at the Glenburn home of another sister, Mary Inman, 75, along with two more sisters: Virginia Allen, 72, of Winter Harbor, and Dorothy Ham, 77, of Brewer. The mini-reunion evoked many tears, according to The Bangor Daily News. Ms Lukich is set to stay in Maine for a month. When she returns to Arizona she says she has plans to move to North Carolina to live with another daughter. However, she admitted that Maine still held a special place in her heart. 'I missed Maine springs, summers and falls,' she said.","Betty Lukich, 69, left home in Bangor, Maine, after an acrimonious divorce .

She might be small in stature, but tiny Harleigh Jackson, who was born with a rare type of dwarfism, knows she can stand tall next to her best friend Taylor. Both girls are aged six, yet the diminutive youngster only comes up to her friend’s waist. Wearing clothes suitable for two-year-olds, the real-life Thumbelina has to stand on a special stool to reach the sink and lives in a specially-adapted home. Standing tall: Six-year-old Harleigh Jackson is the same age as her friend Taylor, but half her height . But even though she may be tiny, her proud parents say it is Harleigh who rules the roost at their house in London. Her mother Karina, 26, said: ‘Harleigh may be small, but she’s really cheeky and has lots of attitude. She knows what she wants and she is the boss in our house. ‘She has a big appetite too, even though her stomach is so tiny. She loves chicken korma and her favourite is chinese takeaway.’ Doctors first noticed that something was wrong with Harleigh when Karina went for a scan seven weeks into the pregnancy. Karina, who lives with fiance Anthony Jackson, 28, an electrician, said: ‘I went for my scan and doctors couldn’t see Harleigh at all as she was so small. ‘They suspected I might have suffered a miscarriage, but told me to come back in another two weeks for a further scan. 'It was a nerve-wracking two weeks as I had already suffered from one miscarriage. ‘When I had the next scan she was only just visible on it, so I was still pregnant but the doctors were worried that she had some growth problems.’ At 22 weeks, Harleigh was still so small that doctors offered Karina a termination, but she refused. She said: ‘They knew that something was seriously wrong as she wasn’t growing, but they didn’t know what. So they offered me a termination. 'I refused as I wanted to give her a chance. ‘She was still my baby, even if she did have something wrong with her, and I was prepared to deal with anything. 'I’d lost one baby, I wasn’t prepared to lose another.’ Harleigh with her mother, Karina and (right) aged two, when she was just the size of a newborn baby . Harleigh pictured with her cousin, Lily, who at two-years-old is as tall as her petite cousin . Harleigh was born in October 2006 at St George’s Hospital in London. She was full term, but she weighed only a little more than 4Ibs. Karina said: ‘She looked perfectly formed, but she was so tiny. 'She had problems breathing, so she was whisked off to intensive care. 'We were allowed to see her and we were just praying that she would survive.’ Harleigh was allowed home from hospital after five weeks, but she still only weighed 5Ibs. Scans and x-rays had been carried out, but doctors still could not find any explanation for her tiny size. Karina Jackson, 26, was aware her baby was not growing in the womb, but refused a termination . Over the next 12 months, Harleigh had numerous tests and continued to stump medical experts. But when she turned one, she was diagnosed with Russell Silver Syndome, a rare growth disorder that occurs in one in 75,000 births. It is a type of dwarfism and its cause is unknown. Karina said: ‘It was just such a relief to get an answer at last as to what was wrong with Harleigh. 'She hadn’t got much bigger from the day she was born, so we knew there was something seriously wrong. ‘But when we were told what it was, we weren’t upset. 'It was as though a weight was lifted from our shoulders. It had been awful not knowing what was wrong with her.’ The couple have since adapted their house for their real-life Thumbelina. Harleigh has a special stool so that she can reach the sink and cupboards and coat hooks have been placed at a height where she can reach them. She also has a bike specially adapted for her tiny body. ‘Other children her age tower over her - she is half their size. And when I’m out with her, people can’t believe she’s nearly seven years old. Small, but determined: Harleigh's mother says what the little girl lacks in size, she makes up for in attitude . ‘But she’s so determined, even though she is so tiny. She is smaller than everyone else her age, but what she lacks in size she makes up for in attitude. 'She has a tiny little voice and her legs are like a sparrows. But she has a will of iron. ‘She’s a little girl with a big personality and she doesn’t let anything hold her back.’ Harleigh and her family are supporting the Jeans for Genes Day on September 20, which supports families affected by genetic disorders.

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 13:24 EST, 14 September 2012 . A mother-of-six who coughed up a tumour a year ago has been told she is now free of cancer. Claire Osborn, 38, had the shock of her life when she started coughing and a 2cm lump flew out of her mouth. She took the lump to her doctor and was told it was a type of cancer called metastatic adenocarcinoma - an aggressive throat and mouth cancer. Cancer free: Claire Osborn, 38, had the shock of her life when she started coughing and a tumour flew out of her mouth . Ms Osborn was initially given a 50 per cent chance of survival and had to undergo an operation to see if there were any remaining cancer cells. An initial scan in February revealed there were no other tumours and now, after a final scan last week, doctors have told her she is entirely free of cancer. Ms Osborn said: 'The consultant turned round to me and said, ""It appears you have coughed up your cancer. Congratulations.""' Chance of survival: Ms Osborn, pictured with husband Kevin after the operation, was initially given a 50 per cent chance of survival and had to have the operation to see if any cancer cells remained . Ms Osborn, of Holbrooks, Coventry, said the events of the last year have completely changed her outlook on life - at one point she had started saving for her own funeral. She said: 'I feel like it’s been a miracle. I feel I’ve been reborn, everything has changed. I really feel I’ve been given a second chance at life. 'I have various conditions including Asperger’s and fibromyalgia but I don’t sit down and mope now. 'I had become unsociable and wouldn’t go out and I used to get upset about the smallest things, like if I broke something around the house. But now I realise that life is far more important than a broken item. All gone: Ms Osborn has been told she is totally free of cancer . 'I have a social life now, I go out, I . go to church and I have lots of friends. I try to raise awareness of . cancer by telling people what happened to me.' Ms Osborn said the experience and the initial worry she was going to die from cancer has changed the whole family. She said: 'It’s brought the family closer together. I have six children and two grandchildren and this has changed us all. 'I used to think it was only me going through this but now I can see they have suffered too, watching me go through it.' Ms Osborn is now applying to Guinness World Records as she believes she is the only person to have coughed up an entire tumour. Remembering . the day she had her coughing fit last year, Ms Osborn said: 'I’d taken . some tablets and they felt like they were sticking at the back of my . throat. 'I coughed and something came out. I . went to the GP and he sent it off to the lab where it was diagnosed as . metastatic adenocarcinoma. 'The . metastatic part means the cancer spreads from one organ to another so . I’m extremely lucky. If I hadn’t coughed it up it would have spread to . another organ. 'I had a scan in February and it came back saying I had no cancer. 'I’ve just had my second MRI and there’s been no regrowth. It looks like I actually coughed up all of the cancer. 'I’ve got to go back in two months’ time for checks but I probably won’t need any more scans. The likelihood of this coming back is extremely small.' However, the full-time mother added: 'Anyone with a persistent cough should get checked out as a precaution.'

The device monitors the brain’s electrical activity and alerts patients when they are most likely to experience an epileptic fit. Epilepsy is a neurological condition that causes repeated seizures, also known as fits. Epilepsy disrupts electrical brain activity causing seizures. The the new device trialled in Australia could help patients manage their symptoms more effectively . It affects over 500,000 Britons and although symptoms can  develop at any age, it usually begins in childhood. Seizures are the most common symptom of epilepsy, although many people can have a seizure during their lifetime without developing epilepsy. The cells in the brain, known as neurones, communicate with each other using electrical impulses. During a seizure, the electrical impulses are disrupted, which can cause the brain and body to behave strangely. Severity of the seizures can differ from person to person. Some people simply experience a ‘trance-like’ state for a few seconds or minutes, while others lose consciousness and have convulsions . While medication cannot cure epilepsy, it is often used to control seizures. These medicines are known as anti-epileptic drugs. In around 70 per cent of cases, seizures are successfully controlled. Currently the only way to control epilepsy is with medication . One of the main dangers of epilepsy is the unpredictable nature of the condition. Sufferers can have seizures at any time of place. The new study, published Lancet Neurology, was carried out on 15 people in three hospitals in Australia. Using the new brain implant, signals were collected from the surface of the brain and sent via wires to another implant in the chest. This then transmitted the data to a device which worked out the probability of a seizure. The success rate was mixed. For the first four months, the participants' brain was monitored so the system could learn the pattern of their brainwaves before a seizure. Only eight patients were able to progress to the stage where the device was fully activated and they were constantly informed of their chance of a seizure. The implant was between 56 per cent and 100 per cent effective in those patients. Prof Mark Cook, from the University of Melbourne, told the BBC: ‘Being able to predict the events with many minutes or hours lead time could have significant impact on independence. ‘This could change the way the illness is treated. For instance, our current strategy of giving medications continuously because of the unpredictable occurrence of events could alter the types of medications being developed. The charity Epilepsy Action cautioned that it was still early days, but said it could be an ‘exciting development’.","New device monitors brain activity to calculate the likelihood that a patient might have fit .

Arrest warrant: Tyler Holder is in hospital after being shot in the head as police tried to arrest him on rape and murder charges . The 17-year-old accused of brutally raping and murdering his six-year-old neighbor Alanna Gallagher, left a note for his mother that read: 'I love you, I'm sorry,' according to FBI documents. Duct tape, used condoms and blood-stained toilet paper were also listed as items found by officers when they searched Tyler Holder's home. However, the first item listed on a receipt of 153 items seized by the FBI, according to KHou, was a 'sealed letter addressed to Mom with ""I . love you, I'm sorry"", and a crumpled up piece of paper with the . words 'Mom I' on it. Holder is still in a serious condition in hospital after being shot in the head by an officer on Tuesday as police confronted him at his Saginaw home to serve a capital arrest warrant. Charles Lodatto, an officer who was also wounded during the confrontation, has now been moved from intensive care. Mr Lodatto was shot in the groin, and the bullet hit an artery and broke into pieces. Holder's neighbors had described him as a trouble maker who had been involved in 'criminal mischief', the arrest warrant showed. Classmates have also described the 17-year-old as 'socially awkward' and in a Google picture of the suspect's home, two obscured people can be seen making obscene hand gestures at the Google car camera. It has not been confirmed if Holder was in the picture. According to the warrant, Alanna was sexually assaulted and suffocated, before her wrists and ankles were bound with red duct tape, and her body was dumped in a tarp less than a mile from her home on July 1. A purple Timex watch with pink and green flowers on it, girls' necklaces and jewelry, and latex gloves were also found. Computers, digital cameras and a journal were also taken. Officers were able to trace a roll of toilet paper found with Alanna's body to Costco, which Holder's mother was a member of. Anti-social: Holder, who has been described as a trouble-maker, lived opposite Alanna in Saginaw. A street view picture of his home shows two people making obscene gestures at the Google camera . Originally, Saginaw Police had said . they had no specific suspects, but the affidavit suggests Holder was . under suspicion almost immediately, according to 8 News.

Residents . informed police Holder had told them it was Alanna’s body that had . been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of . the victim.

The youngster had been raped. Right, Charles Lodotto, who Holder allegedly opened fire, on hitting the officer in the groin . Boyfriend: Patricia Hustede banned Holder from her home after he started dating her daughter, Cassie . The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,' Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden. But . video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling . Brook Drive did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had . said. When they analyzed his mobile phone, they found pictures of him with a garden hose in a sexual position. During an interview, Holder had admitted that he had sex with other men. On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were notified last Saturday that it matched evidence found on Alanna's body. At about 9am on Tuesday, officers arrived at Holder's home in unmarked cars. Neighbors heard them pounding on the door shortly before multiple shots rang out. When Holder's mother Kim was contacted on Tuesday evening last week. she said her son's condition was 'not so good'. Her . lawyer Lance Evans later added: 'Mrs Holder is in shock and is . extremely worried about the condition of her son, as any mother would . be. Suspect: The arrest warrant notes Tyler Holder was allegedly acting suspiciously after Alanna's body was found . 'I ask that the Holder family’s request for privacy be honored as they come to grips with today’s events.' Classmates . of Holder have described how the socially awkward teenager had a love . of weapons, carried knives, and would make sick jokes. Mikayla Dawson, 16, remembered him as an 'angry person' from their days at Wayside Middle School. She said: 'He was the kid that you were always . really nice to because you didn’t know if he was going to come shoot up . the school.' Police have also confirmed neighbours described Holder to them as a 'troublemaker' and that . he had been involved in 'criminal mischief'. One . neighbour even claimed to have seen a gray tarpaulin in Holder's back . garden two or three months ago, similar to that covering Alanna, when . she was found dead. Weapons: Holder was said to have carried knives and pulled one on a teenage boy after destroying his snowman, according to one source . Lauren Allen, 15, recalled a . confrontation between her older brother and Holder a few years ago after . a rare snowfall, when Holder destroyed a snowman her brother had built. In retaliation,Lauren’s brother threw a snowball at Holder, who 'just turned around and pulled out his pocket knife'. Lauren added: 'He was weird and creepy, and he’s been violent in the past.' Cassie Hustede dated Holder until earlier this year. The . 20-year-old is currently being held in Tarrant County jail on a . burglary charge, but her mother, Patricia, said that she had concerns . about Holder from the beginning. 'I said to Cassie, ""There’s something bad about him, keep him away from my house"".' She explained Holder would visit the house even after Cassie had gone to jail to see how she was doing. Belt: A DNA sample taken by police of Holder matched DNA found on Alanna's body and on a belt found at the scene . She added: 'He fooled me. It just freaks me out that I allowed him in my house, around my kids and my grandkids.' The . probable cause affidavit for Holder’s arrest, obtained by WFAA-TV . (Channel 8), offers new details about the suffering inflicted upon . Alanna, who went missing on July 1. The little girl, who was known for riding on her purple scooter in search of playmates, had been brutally raped. Her partially clothed body was found by 14-year-old Owen . Whiddon bound and wrapped in a . gray tarpaulin in the middle of a street about a mile from her home . later in the day of her disappearance. Genetic . evidence was matched through DNA tests to a sample that Holder . voluntarily provided to police earlier this month, the documents say. His DNA was also found on the buckle of a belt used to wrap Alanna’s body in the tarp. Four Wal-Mart bags were taped over the girl’s head with red duct tape secured around her neck. Her wrists and ankles were bound with the same tape and her body and clothes were wet with an unknown liquid. Police later found what is believed to be the same kind of duct tape in rubbish bags outside the home Holder shared with his mother just two doors from where Alanna lived with her family. Heartbreaking: The arrest comes after Alanna's body was found tied and partially naked with a bag over her head under this tarp in the street. A 14-year-old boy found her body . Alanna's family claim they have been targeted in the aftermath of the horrific incident. Alanna lived with her siblings, their . parents Laura and Karl Gallagher, and a second male, Miles McDaniel, who . was in a polyamorous relationship with her parents.

The disappearance on Friday of the three-year-old boys, Medhi and Yanis Boudjema, sparked a huge hunt in Levie on the French Mediterranean island, until they were both found separately. Mehdi - who was staying with Yanis and his nanny - was the last of the two boys to be found safe today, by Chief Warrant Officer Bruno Mourier and his dog Hugo, and was reunited with his father. Safe and sound: Mehdi Boudjema, a three-year old child, is seen aboard a helicopter after he was found overnight by firefighters today in Levie, on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica . Discovery: Mehdi's father (right) holds the boy (also left) today after he was found overnight by firefighters . Hunt: Around 100 police officers and firefighters, including trained mountain rescuers, were involved in the search, with air support from a helicopter. They are pictured outside the house from which the boys vanished . Yanis and Mehdi spent 30 and 36 hours alone respectively after vanishing on Friday at 7pm from Levie, a mountainous village around 24 miles from Porto-Vecchio in the Corse-du-Sud department. The brown and blonde-haired boys were said to have been playing in a small cabin below the house. A villager helped find the first child, Yanis, after hearing him crying in the silence of the mountains at around midnight on Sunday morning, before Mehdi was found by the dog at about 6:30am. The children were found around 440 yards from each other, about 1.2 miles from the house at the bottom of a valley where they were staying, reported French news magazine L’Express. A doctor found Mehdi to be in good health, before he was taken by helicopter to hospital in Ajaccio. It was said that the boys’ health would have entered a ‘danger zone’ had they been lost for 48 hours.

Top effort: Chief Warrant Officer Bruno Mourier speaks with journalists after he and his dog Hugo found Mehdi . Searching: The brown and blonde-haired boys were said to have been playing in a small cabin below a house . Yamina Boudjema, 35 - the mother of the twins, who lives in Porto-Vecchio - said: ‘They are doing very well. They were a little hungry and dehydrated, but they have since slept and ate. 'I have not yet asked for an explanation of what happened - it will come in time. Mehdi said simply: ""Dog! Dog!"" Yamina Boudjema, mother of the twins . ‘I have not yet asked for an explanation of what happened - it will come in time. Mehdi said simply: “Dog! Dog!”.

Police divers in Connecticut have begun searching a lake in the hometown of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez for a handgun used to killed a semi-pro football player last month. Connecticut State Police troopers in wetsuits could be seen combing Pine Lake in Bristol, Connecticut, inch-by-inch. They waded through the lake in chest-deep water and also employed sonar equipment.

Authorities have executed several search warrants in Bristol, at homes linked to Hernandez and his associates Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, whom authorities say were with Hernandez when Lloyd was killed. Officers seized two handguns at Hernandez's $1.3million mansion in North Attleboro, but authorities say neither of them was used to kill Odin. Bristol police officers confirmed to the Bristol Press that the state troopers were on the scene looking for evidence connected to the Hernandez case.

The parents of a 17-month-old girl have been arrested after she was allegedly strapped in a car seat for 15 hours without food or water and suffocated to death after a blanket was stuffed into her mouth. Toni Maurie Gwynn was found unresponsive at her parents' home in Eden, North Carolina on July 11 after her father, Antonio Gwynn, 22, allegedly forced the blanket into the child's mouth to stop her from crying. Her father, Antonio Gwynn, 22, has been charged with felony child abuse and second-degree murder and her mother, Heather Gwynn, 22, has been charged with felony child abuse. Innocence: Toni Maurie Gwynn died after she was strapped in a car seat and left without food or water for 15 hours. Her father allegedly shoved a blanket in her mouth after 12 hours, suffocating her . Toni's grandparents, Chris and Sue Paul, have told the Greensboro News-Record that they fought to help the girl and her two siblings, but that their daughter would not let them get close. 'She just shut us out of her life,' Chris Paul of Heather Gwynn. 'I think she knew if we saw how bad things were in that house, we wouldn't have put up with it.' The couple said they moved to North Carolina from Maine to help their daughter with her children, but that Heather distanced herself from the family. 'We were afraid for their safety,' Sue Paul said, claiming that family members had called child services to voice their concerns. One relative 'called on numerous . occasions and her cries were left unanswered', she said. The county . would not comment on the case, citing confidentiality. Mrs Paul described how their daughter pushed them away and refused their help. Accused: Antonio Gwynn, left, and Heather Gwynn, right, have been charged with felony child abuse . Worries: Neighbors said Mrs Gwynn, pictured with another daughter, was controlled by her husband . 'We came over here at Christmas with . presents for the kids, just to make sure they had a Christmas,' she said. 'They wouldn't even let us in.' She added that they only met their granddaughter once and were not allowed to take pictures of her - and that they learned about the death on the news. Victim: Relatives said they tried to care for Toni but that her parents did not let them close . Tragically, many neighbors said they suspected that Toni, her five year-old-sister and their five-month-old sister were mistreated and left alone in the house. Neighbor Tina Rogers said she knew that something was going to happen to one of the children. 'And it didn’t have to happen,' she told the News Record. 'If they . needed help they could have given that baby to me, to any one of the . neighbors, and we would have helped.' She added that Antonio Gwynn controlled and beat his wife and that neighbors would hear her screaming during fights throughout the night. Police and paramedics were called to the family's house in Eden by the parents after they said they found her not breathing. The little girl was rushed to Morehead Memorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead. Police interviewed the parents about the details leading up to the girl's death and while investigations were underway, the couple moved out of their home. When authorities went back for a final interview, they found that the parents were missing and arrest warrants were issued after they failed to attend a scheduled meeting with social services. The couple had fled to a relative's vacant trailer in Caswell County and were discovered when the relatives went to check on it. They then contacted authorities. Scene: The little girl was found unresponsive at her parents' home, pictured, on July 11 and later died . Heather Gwynn's bail has been set at $1 million, while her husband's has been set at $3 million. Toni's siblings are now in foster homes but the family said they hope that an aunt will get custody. 'The condition at the house is not good for any of the children,' said Lt. Clinton Simpson with the Eden Police Department. If Antonio Gwynn is found guilty, he could face more than seven years in prison for child abuse and more than 40 years for second-degree murder. The couple's next hearing will be held next week.","17-month-old Toni Maurie Gwynn found unresponsive on July 11 .

Jenna Van Delden slept with the teen up to 30 times over a four month period after she harboured him. And the 25 year old was said to be so in love with the teen that she sent him a letter from prison suggesting they could elope together to Virginia. Guilty: Jenna Van Delden was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old runaway boy . The teen had been found hiding under a bunk bed when police searched her home in Great Falls, Montana earlier this year. Delden pleaded guilty to having sex with the underage boy when she appeared at a court in Great Falls. She showed no emotion as she was jailed for 10 years without any recommendation for parole. Van Delden took the boy in after he ran away from home in September 2012. He was found at Van Delden's home in January 2013 and during interviews with detectives gave specific information about Delden's body that could only have been known through an intimate relationship. Van Delden had initially been arrested on charges of harbouring a runaway and custodial interference. Emotionless: Van Deleden was emotionless as the guilty verdict was read and her sentence handed down . After her court appearance she travelled to the juvenile detention centre where the boy was being held in an attempt to speak with him.

He . never responded to the message, and it wasn't until a year later that . they finally contacted, 'poking' each other on a social networking site. From there, their relationship turned dirty, escalating to phone sex sessions twice a week from June to November 2012. Scandal: Leathers and Weiner started a relationship after Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 . Eye-catching: Leathers, a political blogger based in Indiana, chatted on the phone as she grabbed a Starbucks . Leathers called the affair 'dark and dirty' and that new-father Weiner was using their online trysts as a way of 'acting out.' But . she also said that they truly loved each other, and that Weiner even . offered to buy the Indiana-based Leathers an apartment in Chicago so they could spend time together when he was in town. 'I've found the perfect woman. Gorgeous, sexy and like a bit crazy,' Weiner wrote in one exchange. 'I think it was a fantasy thing for both of us,' she said. He even got jealous of her other online relationships. 'Me . being hit on by other men really upset him,' she said. 'We were . Facebook friends, so he could see if men were commenting on photos of . me, or telling me that I was pretty. 'Really minor things like that really bothered him.'

Nydia Velázquez, who was also Weiner's colleague back when he was a Democratic representative for the city, said his antics were a 'total distraction' from the real issues the mayoral campaign should be debating. Weiner's strongest rivals in the polls, Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson, criticised him but didn't directly call on him to quit.","Saleha Mahmood Abedin arrived to daughter Huma Abedin's Park Avenue pad on Saturday .

When billionaire Warren Buffett pledged to give away 85 per cent of his fortune in 2006, as part of a Giving Pledge where some of the country's wealthiest people would do more to help charity, he was applauded. But, seven years on, his son Peter warns that just throwing funds at problems in society such as poverty and ill health can prevent a more permanent solution from being found. In an opinion piece in the New York Times, the composer and chairman of the NoVo Foundation warned that a donor's desire to 'save the day' could have 'unintended consequences. Mr Buffett said that after his father announced his decision to give away a large portion of his wealth, including donations to three foundations set up earlier for his children to run, the composer noticed a damaging cycle beginning. He told the New York Times: 'People [including me] who had very . little knowledge of a particular place would think that they could solve . a local problem.' 'Whether it involved farming methods, education . practices, job training or business development, over and over I would . hear people discuss transplanting what worked in one setting directly . into another with little regard for culture, geography or societal . norms.' An example of unintended consequences from a well-intentioned attempt to help others was when the distribution of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDs in a red-light district resulted in creating a higher price for unprotected sex. However, Mr Buffett said 'conscience laundering' whereby the wealthy sleep better knowing they have donated large sums while the poor continue to have just enough to get by for the short term, is perpetuating the cycle of inequality. 'There are plenty of statistics that tell . us that inequality is continually rising. At the same time, according . to the Urban Institute, the nonprofit sector has been steadily growing,' he said. 'It’s a massive business, with approximately $316 billion given . away in 2012 in the United States alone and more than 9.4 million . employed.' The musician, who composed the score for . the fire dance scene in the film Dances With Wolves, said he was not calling for . an end to capitalism but 'calling for humanism'. He . added that as philanthropy became big business, it has become common to . hear people asking what the 'return on investment' is when discussing . projects to help those in need. Charitable: Billionaire Warren Buffett pledged to give away 85 per cent of his wealth in 2006 . Fresh ideas: Jennifer and Peter Buffett support campaigns to find a more permanent way to address poverty .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:54 EST, 29 July 2013 . A labour rights group today accused a Chinese company that makes iPhones for Apple of abuses including withholding employees' pay and excessive working hours. China Labour Watch said it found violations of the law and of Apple's pledges about working conditions at factories operated by Pegatron, a Taiwanese company. Conditions in Chinese factories that produce iPhones and other popular Apple products have been under scrutiny following complaints about labour and environmental violations by a different supplier, Taiwan's Foxconn, a unit of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Monotonous tasks: Workers, paid as little as £1.12 an hour, work on the production line at Foxconn factory . Apple said in a statement it was 'committed to providing safe and fair working conditions' and would investigate the claims about Pegatron. The Taiwanese company's chief executive, in a separate statement, also promised to investigate. China Labour Watch said its investigation covered two factories in Shanghai and one in Suzhou, a nearby city, that employ a total of 70,000 people. It found violations including discrimination against ethnic minorities and women, excessive work hours, poor living conditions, health and safety problems and pollution. Pegatron assembles products including the iPhone 4, iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 for Apple, according to the report. Apple said it confirmed one accusation by China Labor Watch - that identity cards of some workers were being held by management - and told Pegatron to stop. Finishing touches: An employee works on an Apple product at one factory. Pay is so low that an iPad would be more than two months wages for the lowest paid . Apple has published a code of conduct for its suppliers and joined the Fair Labour Association, a worker rights monitoring group. The association inspected Foxconn factories early last year and said in August that improvements it recommended were being carried out ahead of schedule. Conditions in factories in China are a sensitive issue for foreign companies that outsource production of shoes, consumer electronics and other goods to local contractors. In its report, China Labour Watch said the majority of Pegatron production employees worked 66 to 69 hours a week, far above China's legal limit of 49 hours. It said pregnant women sometimes were required to work 11-hour days, more than the eight-hour legal limit, and employees were pressured to falsify time cards to conceal the violations. The group accused Pegatron of 'discriminatory hiring practices' including refusing to hire those older than 35 or members of China's Hui, Tibetan, or Uighur ethnic minorities. The group said production line workers sometimes dump water laced with hazardous chemicals from cutting tools into sewers. Hard at work: Staff typically do long shifts for low pay at the factory in China . July 2009: A Foxconn employee fell from apartment building after losing iPhone prototype. 18 more workers try to commit suicide over next two years. 2010: 137 workers at Suzhou facility, owned by Apple suppliers Wintek, injured by poisonous chemical, n-hexane, used to clean iPhone screens because it dried faster. May 2011: Four workers dead and 18  injured in dust explosion at Foxconn factory in Chengdu, which produces iPad parts. December 2011: 61 workers injured in gas explosion at Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory in Shanghai, which was trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said it would send auditors to three Pegatron facilities this week to investigate the report's claims. The company said it has conducted 15 comprehensive audits of Pegatron facilities since 2007, including surprise audits in the past 18 months. It said the audits covered more than 130,000 employees. 'Apple is committed to providing safe and fair working conditions throughout our supply chain,' the company statement said. 'If our audits find that workers have been underpaid or denied compensation for any time they've worked, we will require that Pegatron reimburse them in full.' The company said its own audit found Pegatron employees making Apple products worked 46 hours per week on average. Pegatron, founded in 2008, also manufactures desktop and notebook personal computers, LCD televisions, broadband and wireless systems and other products. 'We take these allegations very seriously,' said Pegatron CEO Jason Cheng in a statement. 'We will investigate them fully and take immediate actions to correct any violations to Chinese labor laws and our own code of conduct.'","Conditions in Chinese factories producing Apple products have been under scrutiny after a string of complaints .

A senior minister has attacked the ‘disgraceful focus’ on the Duchess of Cambridge’s figure following the birth of Prince George. Jo Swinson, minister for women and equalities, said yesterday that observers were expecting Kate to meet ‘impossible standards’ to reduce her weight. She was reacting after OK! Magazine’s front cover promoted the Duchess’s supposed post-natal weight-loss regime soon after she left hospital. Other publications have followed suit. Kate was much lauded by organisations such as Mumsnet for showing off her ‘mummy tummy’ on Tuesday in a designer dress as she posed with day-old baby George for the first time. Miss Swinson, who is also expecting her first child, said discussion of Kate’s weight ‘shows just how extreme society’s obsession with women’s bodies looking “perfect” has become’. The Liberal Democrat minister said it was wrong to believe that Kate and other women who have just given birth were ‘failing’ if they did not work instantly to regain their pre-pregnancy figure. ‘Publications like OK! Magazine need to get some perspective,’ she said. ‘Fitting back into pre-pregnancy jeans is not the priority after childbirth.’ Miss Swinson, who has led a campaign in Parliament to help women and girls improve their body image, warned that most women who have just given birth feel under huge pressure to regain their figures. ‘We need to move away from the idea that women have to shed their baby weight quickly and that they’re failing somehow if they don’t. Surveys show this is a concern for two-thirds of new mothers,’ she said. Kensington Palace declined to comment on the furore but a family friend described it as ‘distasteful’. ‘She was very fit and healthy before falling pregnant and I am sure she will snap back naturally but that just isn’t her priority at the moment,’ said the friend. Kate, they said, was enjoying ‘nesting’ at her parents’ home in Berkshire with William and George. ‘They just want some quiet time getting to know each other as a family and learning how this parents thing works,’ the source said. The friend also revealed that Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, was ‘quietly rather worried’ about having a new baby in the house. Immediate pressure: Magazines have already started discussing the Duchess' post-natal weight-loss only a week after she gave birth . ‘It has obviously been a few years since she has had to do any of this,’ said the source. ‘Like any grandparent she has been terrified at the thought of dropping him on his head. ‘Fortunately she says it has all come flooding back.’ William and Kate have eschewed the services of a maternity nurse or nanny, but they have been accompanied by their housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone, who will run errands and prepare meals. While Kensington Palace will remain the Cambridges’ main residence, they are already preparing to move into their new country bolthole. It is understood the Queen has paid the tenant of Anmer Hall in Norfolk a ‘generous’ settlement to vacate the property as soon as possible, four years before his lease is up. The ten-bedroom Georgian property is situated on the monarch’s Sandringham Estate and is only two miles from Sandringham House, one of her favourite residences. The Queen is currently on her annual summer holiday in the Highlands and her new great-grandson was mentioned in prayers for the first time when the monarch attended Crathie Kirk near Balmoral Castle yesterday. All senior members of the Royal Family are named in the congregation’s prayers each week. Prince George should not grow up to be king of Scotland, says the chairman of the campaign for Scottish independence. Dennis Canavan, of Yes Scotland, said an independent nation should be given a vote to decide whether it wanted to retain the monarchy or elect a head of state. ‘Personally, I favour the latter,’ he said.","Minister Jo Swinson condemned pressure on Kate to lose weight .

Carissa Yip, 9, picked up her first chess piece three years ago - now she has become the youngest American to reach expert level. The child prodigy has moved so quickly up the rankings that she can already look down at 93 percent of the more than 51,000 players registered with the U.S. Chess Federation. But her father, Percy, who taught her until she began beating him within a year, said she has the potential to reach master level in a year. The current record for youngest master is 12-years-old. 'Some never reach master level,' he said. 'From expert to master, it's a huge jump.' Genius: Carissa Yip, 9, is the youngest person to ever reach 'expert status' since the chess federation began electronic record-keeping in 1991 . Carissa, from Chelmsford in Massachusetts, first played competitively at the MetroWest Chess Club and Wachusett Chess Club. Last fall, she competed in an international competition in Slovenia, and in December, she'll play the World Youth Championships in the United Arab Emirates. Carissa, who will be a fifth-grader at McCarthy Middle School this fall, is hesitant when asked about her accomplishments. But she also set a goal for herself this year to reach 2,100; an expert is anyone over 2,000 and a master is anyone over 2,200. She also wants to one day become the first female to win the overall championship - not just in the female category, her father said. 'It's not like the rating matters,' Carissa said. She later demonstrated her ability by playing with her back to the board, reading her moves to her father and keeping track of the whole board in her head. Ambitious: Carissa wants to become the first female to win the overall championship - not just in the female category . Her U.S. Chess Federation ranking places her in the top seven percent of all players registered with the group and the top two percent of female players. Closer to home, Carissa has impressed others who have been playing chess for far longer than she has been alive. 'This was not a record she won by a few days,' said Nathan Smolensky, the president of the Massachusetts Chess Association. 'It was a significant margin. So it's very impressive.' Among other younger stars at the Boylston Chess Club in Somerville, where Yip has played, most are in their teens and are boys, Smolensky said. 'Even they say they were nowhere near this strength when they were that young,' he said. Carissa also has three years to reach the next level, that of master, in time to set the record for youngest to reach that step as well, Smolensky said. Five-time U.S. women's winner Irina Krush has the record for becoming a master at age 12. George Mirijanian, program director for the Wachusett club and past president of the Massachusetts Chess Association, said Carissa and Percy Yip, both Wachusett members, both got a standing ovation when they arrived at the club last week after Carissa reached expert level. 'In my more than 50 years with the club, I had never witnessed such an exuberant outburst from club members,' Mirijanian said. 'They are really proud of Carissa and what she has accomplished.'","Carissa Yip, 9, is the youngest American to reach expert level .

The details of real people are being used by internet dating firms without their permission to create fake profiles . Internet dating firms are using the details of real people without their permission to create fake profiles designed to entice lonely customers into paying to find love. Investigators also found some matchmaking sites were buying the personal data of members of the public to artificially boost the number of people who appeared to be using their services, thereby helping the sites attract more customers. The details included those of Brad Pitt, Michael Caine and a member of the House of Lords. The Information Commissioner’s Office has now pledged to look into the industry over concerns that it is breaching data protection law. It acted after BBC Panorama investigators bought the data of 10,000 people from a company called Usdate, which has a sales office in Florida. The profiles included photographs and lists of names, email addresses, dates of birth and sexual orientation. Some contact details were clearly fake, featuring pictures of stars such as movie stars Pitt and Caine. But others in the batch were real, including the email addresses of the life peer, academics and BBC staff. All denied using a dating website. Simon Entwisle, director of operations at the Information Commissioner’s Office, said: ‘It’s appalling that people’s photographs are being used against a completely different set of personal details. ‘What concerns me more than anything is the scale of this. It’s not just an odd incident, it seems to me to be a matter of course and routine. And that gives me even greater cause for concern.’ The Usdate website boasts: ‘It has never been easier to buy dating profiles. Having more people on your dating site gives your users more choice so they buy more and longer memberships. Simple!! So stop waiting for new users to “trickle in” every day. Instead, become clever and populate your dating website with 1,000,000 new dating profiles and your business will soar.’ The internet dating industry is thought to be worth £2.5billion a year worldwide and there are an estimated 1,500 online dating websites in the UK alone. Some 5.7million people in Britain used matchmaking sites last year. Panorama launched its investigation after complaints from customers who went on to sites as free users and attracted a lot of interest from potential dates. They then paid for subscriptions to gain access to contact details, only to discover that interest in their profiles rapidly tailed off. Investigators spoke to whistleblowers who admitted creating fake accounts to lure in potential customers. Some contact details were clearly fake, featuring pictures of stars such as actors Brad Pitt and Michael Caine . Ryan Pitcher worked for Global Personals, Britain’s third largest dating company, which runs more than 10,000 dating sites worldwide. He said he ran a team who created fake profiles or ‘pseudos’ to con customers into thinking they were talking to other genuine online daters. He added: ‘We’d steal someone’s identity through say MySpace or something, we’d take someone from a totally different country – Spain or wherever. ‘We’d take the person’s photos online and we’d start knocking out messages. It was all fake and under the pretence that it was real. ‘If you didn’t have pseudo profiling and fake messaging you wouldn’t make any money.’Global Personals has previously insisted it had stopped using pseudo profiles. Edgars Apalais, the owner of Usdate, denied any profiles sold by his firm were fake and said the information sold to Panorama belonged to people who had consented to it to be passed on.","Investigators found some sites were buying people's personal data .

The county and the cities of Hickory and Newton - where dozens of streets were underwater Saturday afternoon - were among the communities declaring local emergencies as a precursor to seeking state and federal aid, assistant county emergency services director Mark Petit said. There were no reported injuries from the flash flooding, Dickerson said. Sections of at least six roads will remain closed for up to three months to repair damage, he said. Interstate 85 was closed for a short time Saturday afternoon in Cabarrus County because of high water, the State Highway Patrol said.","The victims, Juan Alberdi and Delilah Lovett, were from two Charlotte-area families .

The Duchess of Cambridge appears to be breast-feeding her son – showing her desire to give him the best possible start in life. Kate was seen leaving Kensington Palace last week in a £50 maternity dress made for breast-feeding mums. Staff at the private Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital had helped her encourage newborn George to ‘latch on’ properly. Natural feeding: The Duchess wore the breast-feeding dress as she travelled to Bucklebury after Prince George's birth . Big hit: The £50 Blossom Knot Front Lavender Dress she wore already has a month's waiting list . It appears she is continuing to follow their advice now she is at her home with her mother in Berkshire. Experts say breast milk is easier for babies to digest and helps prevent a myriad of diseases – protection that formula milk simply cannot replicate. On Wednesday the Duchess was seen leaving Kensington Palace wearing a Blossom Knot Front Lavender dress by maternity wear specialists Seraphine. The dress, which has sold out online and now has a four-week waiting list, is designed for new mums who are breast-feeding. Seraphine, which is also worn by actresses Halle Berry and Jessica Alba, claims that four of its dresses are worn by the Duchess. Owner Cecile Renaud said: ‘Kate’s ordered a couple of breast-feeding styles from us.’ The disclosure will be seen as a huge coup for the Breast is Best lobby, which encourages mothers to feed naturally rather than use formula milk. The Department of Health recommends that mothers breast-feed their children for the first six months. But the most recent figures showed that fewer than half of new mums were still breast-feeding by the time they took their newborns for six- or eight-week check-ups. Princess Diana breast-fed both Princes William and Harry. And the Queen breast-fed Prince Charles until a case of measles forced her to stop when he was two months old. The Duchess appears to be taking naturally to motherhood. It has been suggested that she coped so well with her 11-hour labour that she did not require the strong painkillers regularly offered to mums. Despite the details of Prince George’s birth being kept secret, sources said Kate declined the option of pain relief.","Experts say breast milk is easier for babies to digest .

A four-month-old baby died in hospital on Saturday after being left in a car in the parking lot of a San Diego apartment block. Police received calls from concerned residents about a baby left unattended in a car in the parking lot of the Belle Vista apartment block in the 500 block of North Mollison Ave in El Cajon around 1:30pm. Officials arrived and found the baby boy unresponsive. CPR was performed on the child at the scene before he was transported to Sharp Grossmont Hospital where he later died. Scene: The car was parked here at the family home in the Belle Vista apartment block in El Cajon when local children noticed the distressed baby inside . According to Belle Vista resident Larry Singleton, a group of children noticed the baby in the car and ran to tell him as he headed out to the grocery store. 'It hurts me to know that someone's baby passed away. It’s really sad,' said Singleton, who was one of several residents who called 911 about the child. He said the parents were new to the building. San Diego 6 reports that witnesses said the parents arrived home in the car and went inside the building, leaving the baby in the vehicle. Some witnesses said the child had been in the car for 30 minutes, while others estimated it had been six hours before the baby was discovered missing. Midday sun: Temperatures in cars parked in the sun can rise terrifyingly quickly . Police Lieutenant Eric Taylor said the parents, aged in their 20s, were being interviewed about the death. 'We’re conducting an investigation to determine whether it was an accident,' Taylor told NBC. Taylor said the couple had other children, who were being cared for by family members. The temperature in El Cajon on Saturday reached a high of 85 degrees. It's unclear whether the baby died of heat related causes or exactly how long he was left unattended in the car. 'Any time we have warm weather it’s a danger to infants, children, pets and the elderly,' Taylor told UT San Diego.","A baby boy died on Saturday after being left unattended in a car at the apartment block where he lived .

Older people on the hunt for a romantic relationship are increasingly finding it while travelling abroad, new research has revealed. One in five senior travellers say they would be more likely to contemplate having a holiday romance now than when they were younger and a tenth have admitted to having an exotic fling already. A small minority even admitted to planning their holidays based purely on their chances of finding love while away. Romance: Older travellers are now just as likely to find love while abroad as their younger counterparts . The look of love: Pauline Collins starred as Shirley Valentine in the 1989 film about an older lady who finds romance while on holiday in Greece . Although holiday romances have traditionally been the preserve of teenagers and twenty-somethings, older people are no strangers to the concept. Along with films such as Shirley Valentine, in which a middle-aged Liverpudlian housewife finds life-changing love while on holiday in Greece, there have been numerous reports of marriages arising from older unions - although they haven't always ended happily. Among them was Mary Cotnoir, now 61, who married a Gambian waiter 35 years her junior only to discover that his real interest was in gaining a British visa. Perhaps that is why the poll, conducted by over-50s travel insurance provider Staysure, also found that 61 per cent of those indulging in holiday romances wouldn't tell their friends about it. A lack of a long term future was another reason cited, with half of mature holidaymakers saying that although relationships often continued after arriving home, the majority lasted only a few weeks. Italy . Spain . Greece . France . US/Caribbean . Nevertheless, almost a quarter of the over-50s questioned said that they knew . somebody who had met their husband or wife on holiday. Despite the pitfalls, holidays are seen as a good route to romantic success, according to 60 per cent of mature travellers, although almost half ended up with a British man or woman. Just 15 per cent chose to strike up a relationship with one of the locals. Ryan Howsam, Chief Executive at Staysure, said: 'For over-50's holidaymakers, whether they are single and going on holiday to find love, or married couples having second honeymoons, romance is increasingly on the cards. 'Our research shows that one in five know someone who has met their partner on holiday. While this is heartwarming we do urge people to err on the side of caution as their own personal safety should be the number one priority.'","One fifth of mature travellers would like to find love abroad .

Delta Airlines is in the midst of a PR nightmare after a former college professor who is unable to walk filed a lawsuit claiming that the airline refused to accommodate his disability and forced him to crawl down the aisle of a plane, down a flight of steps and across a tarmac at a Massachusetts airport - twice. According to the suit, filed on July 23, in U.S. Federal District Court in Hawaii, D. Baraka Kanaan claims that on July 26, 2012, he was scheduled to take a series of Delta flights from his home in Hawaii to Nantucket Island in Massachusetts to attend a conference. Mr. Kanaan, who suffers partial paralysis of his legs stemming from a car accident in 2000, claims he called a Delta customer service representative several weeks before his scheduled trip to let them know about his disability, and that he would need a lift to get onto the airplane and an aisle chair to get him to his seat. Scroll down for videos . Disabled: A car wreck in 2000 left D. Baraka Kanaan without the use of his legs . Better Days: Mr. Kanaan, a former college professor, seen here prior to the accident that left him paralyzed . The representative, he claims, told him it wouldn't be a problem. Mr. Kanaan's initial flight was canceled due to weather, so he was booked on another flight the following day. When he arrived in Nantucket, he was told by flight attendants that the airline didn't have an aisle chair to get him out of his seat, nor a lift to get him off the plane. When he asked what he was supposed to do, Mr. Kanaan claims he was told, 'I don't know, but we can't get you off the plane,' according to the complaint, first obtained by the Huffington Post. Simultaneously, Mr. Kanaan claims, he could see a lift available at an adjacent gate. Mr. Kanaan, while wearing his 'best suit,' was then forced to crawl 'hand-over-hand' down the aisle, down a flight of stairs and across the tarmac to his wheelchair - without any assistance from the crew -as other passengers watched. PR Nightmare: This is the second time Delta's been accused of forcing a disabled person to crawl off of an airplane . The incident, he claims, caused 'great physical and emotional suffering.' Before heading home to Hawaii, Mr. Kanaan called Delta to report the incident, and to make sure the equipment would be available for his return flight in an attempt to avoid another humiliating ordeal. When Mr. Kanaan got to the airport, though, he says a flight attendant told him the chair and lift were again unavailable. The flight attendant then offered to put a piece of cardboard on the ground so Mr. Kanaan's clothes wouldn't get dirty as he crawled across the ground, he claims in the suit. Once he returned home, Mr. Kanaan says Delta offered him 25,000 'sky miles' and a $100 voucher. He refused the offer, however, in fear that any future flights might again have him crawling on his hands and knees. 'Lovevolution': Mr. Kanaan now heads the 'Lovevolution' Foundation, an organization dedicated to world peace . For more videos, please go to Baraka Kanann . For any airplane with a seating capacity of 31 or more passengers, the Air Carrier Access Act requires airlines and airports to 'provide boarding assistance to individuals with disabilities by using ramps, mechanical lifts, or other suitable devices where level-entry boarding by loading bridge or mobile lounge is not available.' The capacity of the plane Mr. Kanaan was in is unclear. A similar incident happened in 2008, when a woman with muscular dystrophy was forced to crawl off of two separate Delta flights. Delta has not commented publicly on the suit, and has not filed a response as of Friday, according to online court records. Mr. Kanaan is seeking compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial.","D. Baraka Kanaan was paralysed in a car accident in 2000 .

A sheriff's office in Lousiana is under fire from gay rights advocates for targeting men using an outdated law from the early 1800s. According to a report published Sunday in The Advocate, the East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's office has been conducting sting operations to arrest gay men looking for sex in public parks. Over the past two years the Special Community Anti-Crime Team has arrested at least 12 men under an unenforceable 'crime against nature' law deemed invalid by the U.S. Supreme Court a decade ago. Outdated: A report published in The Advocate Sunday revealed a two-year long series of sting operations in East Baton Rouge that seemed to target homosexuals in the community . Undercover officers would meet men in the park and get them to agree to have sex, and that was enough basis to arrest them under the 'crime against nature' law - R.S. 14:89 - which was put on the records book back in 1805. The statue includes language which bans 'the unnatural canal copulation by a human being with another of the same sex or opposite sex.' The Supreme Court struck down that part in a 2003 ruling with a similar law in Texas. Because of the Supreme Court precedent, the courts would be unable to prosecute anyone charged today with that crime. However, according to sheriff's office spokesman Casey Hicks, since the law is on the books police still have the right to enforce it. She also said the men were not targeted for their sexual orientation, but because the office had been receiving complaints about people using the parks to have public sex. Apologize: Metro councilmen John Delgado called for a public apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux . 'The issue here is not the nature of the relationship but the location,' Ms Hicks said. 'These are not bars. These are parks. These are family environments.' However, according to District Attorney Hillar Moore III, since the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 there would be no way of prosecuting any of the men charged with the crime. 'For the Sheriff's Office to be setting up these kinds of sting operations up is a waste of time because they can't prosecute these things,' said Tommy Damico who is defending one of the men arrested last month under the archaic law. Advocates in the gay rights community expressed their outrage over the series of sting operations. 'It is frustrating that people are using their resources to pursue issues like this and arrest people for attempting to pick someone up and go home with them,' said Bruce Parker of Equality Louisiana. 'It's perfectly legal, and we would have to close down every bar in Baton Rouge if that weren't the case.' Civil rights attorney Andrea Ritchie also found the operation unsettling. 'It's really unfortunate that police are continuing to single out, target, falsely arrest and essentially ruin the lives of gay men in Baton Rouge who are engaged in no illegal conduct,' Ms Ritchie said. Metro Councilman John Delgado called for an apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux to the men arrested in the operations and the rest of the parish. The Sheriff's Office seemed to partially apologize for the arrests, issuing a statement to The Advocate Sunday saying they 'should have taken a different approach' when dealing with inappropriate behaviour in the park.","The East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office set up a series of sting operations to arrest gay men in the community under an archaic law .

Disgusted employees, fearing for their health and the health of passengers, anonymously alerted the Centers for Disease Control to the conditions aboard the Silversea Shadow by sending in photos of piled up food sitting for hours everywhere but the ship's galley. The tip prompted a surprise health inspection by the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program on June 17, when the ship was docked at Skagway, Alaska. Scroll down for video .

Trolleys: Some 15 trolleys of food, including cheeses and deli meats, were stored each night in staff cabins to avoid inspections . But the VSP disagreed, giving the Shadow a damning score of 82 in the inspection when anything under an 84 is a fail. In its scathing report, the officials said 'dry foods, spices, canned foods, cooked foods, milk, raw meats, pasteurized eggs, cheeses of all types, baking goods, raw fruits, raw vegetables, and a variety of both hand held and counter model food equipment, pans, dishware and utensils' were piled up and stored in some 10 crew cabins, each sleeping two to three workers. It said foods such as cheeses, sliced and full pieces of deli meats and raw pork were all stored at potentially hazardous temperatures on the deck, and even on and under the beds of crew members. Kitchen equipment including knives and a large meat slicers were found hidden under blankets in the cabins. Equipment: Kitchen equipment including a large meat slicer and kitchen knives were discovered hidden under blankets and beds in crew cabins . World class: The company boasts of offering a world class culinary experience, but at least two people aboard the ship became sick presumably from the food, pictured, aboard . The company told CNN that the liner was 'deeply disappointed' by the score and that the result of the inspection was an anomaly, as they're used to getting grades in the high 90s. The spokesman refused to say who gave the command to hide food in cabins or whether anyone was fired. On the VSP's website, it inticates at least two cases of diarrhea among staff on the ship, no doubt caused by eating the hygienically kept food. But despite the abysmal score, all the VSP inspectors could do was pour chlorine liquid over the discarded food to prevent it from being used. They do not have the power to slap the liner with a fine or stop the ship sailing. Silversea simply has to submit corrective action statements for deficiencies.","Health officials conducted a surprise inspection of the Silversea ship Silver Shadow at Skagway, Alaska on June 17 .

Shocking evidence shows four in 10 people returning to their jobs after treatment have been unfairly treated - a 50 per cent rise in three years (file picture) Cancer patients are suffering a rise in discrimination at work, says new research. Shocking evidence shows four in 10 people returning to their jobs after treatment have been unfairly treated - a 50 per cent rise in three years. Patients are being denied time off for medical appointments, passed over for promotion or feeling abused by their employer or colleagues. Despite the recent introduction of the Equality Act which should protect workers with cancer, some felt so harassed they quit their jobs, claims the charity Macmillan Cancer Support. It commissioned a YouGov of UK adults who returned to work after cancer treatment which found around one in 10 could not continue in their job as a result of discrimination. One in eight said their employer failed to make reasonable changes to enable them to do their job. The survey of 168 adults found 37 per cent of people returning to work after cancer treatment experienced some kind of discrimination from their employer or colleagues. This figure jumped from 23 per cent in 2010. The poor practices included hassle over time off for treatment, failing to be considered for promotion and being given unfair workloads by bosses or work colleagues. Over 100,000 people of working age are diagnosed with cancer each year in the UK Almost half of those who are working when diagnosed with cancer have to make changes to their working lives after cancer, with around four in ten changing jobs or leaving work altogether. Macmillan Cancer Support said employers must reform their attitudes as an ageing workforce means growing numbers will be diagnosed before retirement. Chief executive Ciarán Devane said 'Employers are risking prosecution by flouting their legal responsibility to protect people living with cancer from unfair treatment and stigma at work. Unfair: One in eight said their employer failed to make reasonable changes to enable them to do their job (file picture) 'There needs to be far more understanding of cancer and how the effects of treatment may impact on people returning to work. Going back to work after treatment can be very isolating especially if someone has been off for a while and has lost confidence or contact with colleagues. 'As our population grows and ages, and the retirement age rises, cancer will become an increasingly common issue for employees and their managers. 'It's vital they are equipped to help people with cancer stay in work. It isn't difficult and it is likely to be cheaper and easier than recruiting a replacement or defending a discrimination claim.' Paul Ware, 46, from London, was diagnosed with a blood cancer in 2010, said 'When I told my employer that I'd been diagnosed with cancer and asked to have some time off for treatment, I was given the sack. The poor practices included hassle over time off for treatment, failing to be considered for promotion and being given unfair workloads by bosses or work colleagues (file picture) 'They said they couldn't employ someone who was not a hundred per cent committed. It was a shock as I had a very successful career, and a fulfilling life. 'I took them to an employment tribunal through a solicitor. But it was costing so much I had no money left to fight for my legal rights. 'I was paid a financial settlement. It wasn't a lot, and it's gone just trying to keep the bills paid. It's been a most soul destroying experience and I have never felt more alone than now, trying to regain my place in society with a new job.' Macmillan Cancer Support is calling for employers to fulfil their obligations to people returning to work after cancer treatment under the Equality Act 2010. These could include making reasonable changes to their work environment or hours and ensuring they have a back to work plan. The charity is also calling on the Government to address the lack of specialist back-to-work services for cancer patients in the UK such as counselling, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.","Patients being denied time off for treatment and passed over for promotion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:31 EST, 3 August 2011 . Fish stocks in one of Britain’s best-loved rivers are being decimated by groups of Eastern European poachers. The gangs are illegally plundering the River Wye’s bounty to feed themselves – and to sell on the black market. The number of wild salmon in the river has plummeted by an alarming 57 per cent over the past two years alone, environmentalists warned yesterday. Picturesque: The River Wye has been voted Britain's favourite waterway, but its wildlife have been plagued by poachers this year . The 134-mile long river topped a nationwide poll last year as the country’s best waterway. Astonishingly, the brazen criminals . even set up barbecues by the riverbanks where they swiftly cook and eat . their stolen fish before selling the rest on the black market. A 20lb fresh water salmon can fetch upwards of £300 and tend to be sold to luxury hotels. Numbers of trout, pike and barbel have also dropped as a result of the illegal fishing. The gangs responsible for the poaching are believed to be migrant workers who pick fruit on nearby farms. Profitable: The poachers who catch the salmon can sell it on to upmarket hotels . Some are even poisoning rivers to kill the fish before scooping them up in large nets. The river, the fifth largest in . Britain, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, which means it is . illegal to catch fish for food. The Wye stretches from Wales through Herefordshire and ends in Chepstow, Monmouthshire. The Environment Agency is stepping up . patrols and using covert spy-cameras hidden in trees and hedgerows . along the river banks in a bid to catch the poachers in the act. Chris Ponsford, who works for the . agency’s crime team, said: ‘We’re essentially the “environment police” and have the power to arrest. Repeat offenders could be slapped . with up to a £2,500 fine – but it’s hard to land a  conviction. So many . are getting away with it.’ Mark Lloyd, of the Angling Trust, . said: ‘We’ve noticed this trend across the country due mainly to the . influx of migrant workers from Eastern Europe. ‘Besides the River Wye, we’ve identified hotspots in Wiltshire and along the River Nene in the east of England.’ The Environmental Agency has seized . huge quantities of illegal fishing nets and poles hidden along the banks . of the river over the last three months. Each net is capable of catching dozens of fish, particularly salmon running upstream to spawn, in one go. Chris Ponsford added: 'There's a big problem throughout the Wye valley with poachers. 'Long lines have been found, but the majority of the poaching comes from local farms where hundreds and hundreds of Eastern European labourers work. 'What they're doing is very illegal - there are very strict regulations governing what you can and cannot take from rivers. 'They go down to the river in the evenings and over the weekends with their rods and barbeques, removing fish to eat. 'Some of the operations are bigger and the fish are being sold on. 'If these guys are taking maybe one or two fish a day, it doesn't take long for them to have a big impact on a stretch.' Last . year the Wye was voted the country's favourite river in a poll backed . by WWF Cymru, RSPB, the Angling Trust and the Salmon and Trout . Association. Voters . described it as 'magical and timeless', 'a haven for wildlife' and a . place 'to get lost and slow down'.  But fishing experts now warn the . iconic river is at risk from poachers. Nationwide trend: Mark Lloyd (pictured) from the Angling Trust said the poachers are part of a 'large-scale illegal operation' Conservation charity The Wye and Usk Foundation reported salmon stocks have dropped by 57 per cent drop in two years. In 2008, there were a 1,106 reported salmon catches compared with 640 in 2009 and just 477 last year. The average weight of salmon has also . decreased by over 20 per cent from 34lbs in 2008 to 27lbs in 2010 - . indicating the fish is being caught and killed before it reaches . maturity. Mr Ponsford said: 'It's an uphill battle but we have a variety of methods to combat fish poaching. 'These include regular patrols, during the day and night as well as at weekends. We also have boats and surveillance equipment such as hidden cameras at our disposal.' Fishing charities have reported similar incidents happening across the country. Mark Lloyd added: 'Those laying these lines, which carry multiple hooks, are part of large-scale, illegal operations. 'It is just part of their culture - in Poland, for example, the carp-like barbel is a delicacy and served for Christmas dinner, instead of turkey. 'However, the bigger illegal operations will take time to tackle.'",Thieves targeting British rivers as part of 'large-scale illegal operation'

Paula Deen has been accused of asking black kitchen workers to wear Aunt Jemima-style outfits while working in the restaurant that made her a star. Dora Charles, Deen’s longtime chef, claimed that African American staff were also asked to ring a bell while hollering ‘come and get it’ in a throwback to the past. Charles also alleged that she was paid just $10 an hour and had to endure the TV chef using racist language around her. 'I ain't ringing no bell': Seen here with her boss Paula Deen, Dora Charles (left) helped Deen become the restauranteur she is today. She says Deen asked her to wear an Aunt Jemima outfit and ring a dinner bell . Deen, whose career is in freefall after admitting using the N-word, denied the claims and said that Charles was just after more money. The claims will be another blow to Deen, who is currently scrambling to salvage what is left of her $17m a year empire over the race row. She has been dropped by The Food Network along with corporate sponsors like Walmart, Home Depot, pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and her book publisher - then fired her entire legal team. Charles’ told the New York Times that she wanted to speak up now because she felt that the truth should come out about the woman who she once considered her ‘Soul Sister’. 'Paula Deen don't treat me the way they think she treat me': Deen called Charles her 'soul sister' even before the chef became popular. But Charles says she wants to tell the world how Deen truly is . 'I ain't ringing no bell': Dora Charles, right, helped Deen become the restauranteur she is today. She says Deen asked her to wear an Aunt Jemima outfit, ring a dinner bell, and make hoe cakes and was paid just $10/hour despite her long history with Deen . Old stereotypes: Aunt Jemima, portrayed by an actress at left, is a brand of pancake flour and syrup that long used racial stereotypes in its logo . Ironic: Dora Charles (left), here with co-workers Larra and Hector, while they prepared to cater an event for president Obama. Charles says Deen would force her to make 'hoecakes' and asked her to dress as Aunt Jemima . She said: ‘It’s just time that everybody knows that Paula Deen don’t treat me the way they think she treat me’. Her . relationship with Deen goes back 22 years during which time she helped . her make a success of her now famous Lady & Sons restaurant in . Savannah, GA. Charles . did everything from developing recipes to training a new generation of . Deen-style chefs and became an integral part of her empire. But there was tension, not least when . Deen supposedly asked Charles to ring a bell at the front of the . restaurant when the food was ready. In deeper? Deen has been under fire for admitting to using the N-word among other supposedly racist tendencies. Charles says Deen asked her to ring a dinner bell and yelp 'Come and get it' to Deen's dinner guests . Charles told the New York Times: ‘I said: ‘I’m not ringing no bell’. That’s a symbol to me of what we used to do back in the day.’ Better days: Deen is seen here at an appearance in Miami Beach. The TV chef is now accused of mistreating her staff and asking them to play racist stereotypes for the amusement of her houseguests . When Charles refused Deen asked another worker called Ineata Jones - who everyone apparently called Jellyroll - to do it. An image of Jones doing it was made into a postcard and sold in Deen’s stores. Jones was also asked to make . hoecakes, corn patties which are served to every diner, and asked her to . wear an Aunt Jemima outfit whilst she did so. But Charles said that Jones ‘didn’t want to hear that’ and also refused. Aunt . Jemima is a brand of pancake flour that used to use racist pictures and . slogans of a black female chef in its advertisements. An image of a black woman is still used to advertise the product today. Charles said that there were benefits to working for Deen, not least being part of a successful empire. Their birthdays were a day apart so they celebrated together. Charles’ friends got jobs with Deen, she sometimes got free clothes and got to go on Deen’s TV show on the Food Network. Charles said: ‘I’m not trying to portray that she is a bad person. ‘I’m just trying to put my story out there that she didn’t treat me fairly and I was her soul sister.’ In . a statement to the New York Times, Deen’s spokesman denied asking . anybody to dress like Aunt Jemima and denied using racist words in . relation to her staff. According to a Deen spokesman: ‘Fundamentally Dora’s complaint is not about race but about money. ‘It . is about an employee that despite over 20 years of generosity feels . that she still deserves yet even more financial support from Paula . Deen.’ Deen’s career went into meltdown last month when her admission about using the N-word was first reported. Scrambling: Here, Charles helps set up to cater for the U.S. president. Paula Deen has since lost multi-million dollar endorsement deals with notable companies like Wal-Mart and Home Depot . It . came during a 2010 deposition in a case brought by Lisa Jackson, a . white manager working at Uncle Bubba’s Oyster House, the restaurant Deen . set up for her brother Earl. Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said: ‘Yes, of course. But that's just not a word that we use. ‘I don't - I don't know. As time has gone on things have changed since the 60's in the south.' In . an attempt to stop the rot Deen appeared on NBC’s Today show but . viewers were unmoved by her choreographed apology which went: ‘I is what . I is and I’m not changing’. Deen . had already been criticised for her fat-laden recipes and was mocked . when it emerged she is suffering from diabetes and became a spokeswoman . for Novo Nordisk, which makes a drug which treats the condition.

An Oregon woman has been awarded more than $18million after taking a major credit reporting agency to court. A jury awarded Julie Miller more than $18.5 million this week after suing over errors in her credit report leading to denials of credit. Ms. Miller contacted Equifax eight times between 2009 and 2011 trying to rectify the mistakes. The jury awarded Ms. Miller $18.4million in punitive damages and $180,000 in compensatory damages. Mistakes included erroneous accounts and collection attempts, the wrong Social Security number and birthday, according to a copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline. Mistaken identity: An Oregon jury award Julie Miller over $18million after Equifax failed to correct errors in her credit report after eight attempts to contact the agency over the course of two years . ‘There was damage to her reputation, a breach of her privacy and the lost opportunity to seek credit,’ said Portland attorney Justin Baxter. ‘She has a brother who is disabled and who can't get credit on his own, and she wasn't able to help him.’ Ms. Miller claims in the suit that she discovered the mangled mess made of her credit report after being denied credit by a local bank in December 2009. She reached out to Equifax and complied with multiple requests for forms and additional information only to have her efforts repeatedly go nowhere. Additional efforts to obtain copies of her credit report also proved unsuccessful. Credit reporting bureaus are required by federal law to provide consumers a free copy of their credit report annually. ‘After approximately two years of disputing, [Ms. Miller] gave up and filed this lawsuit,’ the suit states. Other credit reporting companies with similar errors promptly corrected the problem, Mr. Baxter said, adding that the information from another ‘Julie Miller’ had been placed in the wrong record by mistake. Ms. Miller’s financial information was even sent to a firm requesting information about another Julie Miller, Mr. Baxter added. An Equifax spokesperson declined to comment on the award, which will likely be appealed. A 2013 Federal Trade Commission study showed that 21 per cent of consumers who review their credit reports find errors, with five per cent of those errors being severe enough to lead to credit being denied.","Julie Miller tried to rectify the errors eight times over a two year period .

Rarity: Dwight Gayle's move from Peterborough to Premier League new boys Crystal Palace is almost unique . In Germany, seventeen of the eighteen Bundesliga sides have signed at least one German player in this window, while 41 of the 84 players (49%) signed would qualify to play for the German national team. Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1 sides are demonstrating a similar commitment. Seventeen of the twenty sides in both leagues have already signed an Italian - in the case of Serie A - or a Frenchman - in the case of Ligue 1 - ahead of the new season. A new English FA Chairman, Greg Dyke, arrives into the job this weekend to succeed David Bernstein and it is easy for ourselves to sit here and demand action. The England national team is the responsibility of the Football Association and the body must attempt to protect the future for English players. Different thinking: Thiago Alcantara would have been rushed into the England national side . ‘Quota’ is a speculative, scare word . and besides, any attempts to introduce more stringent regulations - say, . for example, that all Premier League clubs must field at least six . English players in any one game - may be derailed by EU Law. The . uncomfortable truth is that the Premier League, as a global phenomenon, . has now superseded the FA. Since the breakaway from the Football League . in 1992, the FA’s stagnation and structural paralysis has allowed the . Premier League to become the dominant authority of English football. Poisoned chalice: Greg Dyke officially takes charge at the FA this weekend, succeeding David Bernstein . With every record-breaking broadcasting deal agreed, the clout of the Premier League and its member clubs increases. While they set about organising initiatives and securing business, the FA is left to operate in the highly charged arenas of maintaining discipline and attempting to balance the needs of the professional game with the eternal challenges presented at grassroots level. The development of English players is left in the hands of Premier League clubs. But they can no longer be entrusted. The leading clubs increasingly stock their academies with teenagers from overseas, while managers are constantly scouring the foreign market for the finest global talent. And as the Premier League enters the new campaign with a more cosmopolitan look than ever before, English football fans do so with the inescapable fear that the structure of the national team now finds itself in an irreparable state.

These shocking findings arose after data released by a holiday home insurance provider revealed the extent of guests' antics and compiled a list of the worst, based on what they left behind. Among the top 10 horrid holidaymakers was one who filled his rental property with raw meat in a bid to avoid paying the bill and another who replaced his villa's EU plug sockets with British ones. Disgusting: Cottages in the UK, Spain and France were among those trashed by horrid holidaymakers . The list of gruesome guests is based on a survey of holiday home owners which asked whether they had had any unexpected surprises left by departing guests. Data was then collated by insurance company, Schofields LTD who also put together a list of the worst offenders. Topping the list was the guest who filled the bin of a UK rental cottage with human waste after misunderstanding a sign that asked holidaymakers to refrain from flushing items down the toilet. In second place was a French guest who tucked raw meat into cracks in the pipes and kitchen cupboards, and an American tourist who installed a satellite dish complete with cabling and a decoder in his rental property.

Speaking about the findings, Phil Schofield, spokesperson for Schofields Holiday Home Insurance, said: 'We were interested in discovering some . of the weirdest things found and discovered by holiday home owners and, . as you can see by the list, there have been some pretty horrific things. 'The team at Schofields could not believe what some Britons got up to, . with the faeces in the bathroom bin definitely the worst.

The easiest way to lose weight isn't willpower but to take away temptation, according to a new study. Research shows that the best way to avoid temptation is not to face it in the first place. In the case of dieters, this means not buying chocolate biscuits, rather than trying to resist raiding the biscuit tin. The study found that the most impulsive people benefited the most from avoiding temptation, or ¿pre-committing¿, as it is known to scientists . Those who are strapped for cash might do well to put their money in a savings account with stiff penalties for early withdrawals. Similarly, cutting up a credit card will likely do more for bank balance than simply trying not to use plastic. The advice follows Cambridge University research into how easy people find it to give into temptation. A group of men were given the choice of looking at a ‘mildly enjoyable’ erotic picture straight away or waiting for an image that would be ‘extremely enjoyable’. Sometimes, they had to exert their willpower to wait for the second picture. Other times, they made their choice at the beginning and the instant temptation was taken away from those who said they’d rather wait. When this was the case, more men viewed the second image. The study also found that the most impulsive people benefited the most from avoiding temptation, or ‘pre-committing’, as it is known to scientists. Sciensists said cutting up a credit card would do more for a bank balance than simply trying not to use plastic . Researcher Molly Crockett said that willpower is not the only form of self-control and anticipating problems also helps. Dr Crockett, who worked with German researchers on the project, said: ‘Our study suggests that the most effective way to beat temptations is to avoid facing them in the first place. ‘It confirms in the lab what we knew all along intuitively, which is that removing temptation from your choice base is a really effective way of reaching your long-term goals. ‘If you are on a diet, don’t buy sweets at the store because if they are in the house, right in front of you, you are not going to be able to resist them.’ Dr Crockett, who resists temptation by using a computer programme that stops her from browsing the internet while she is working, admitted that many people will find the advice hard to follow. She said: ‘People really like to have a choice and pre-commitment over-rides your preference to keep your options open. ‘Maybe one way to encourage people to pre-commit is to emphasise the benefits of achieving their long-term goal.’ The study, published in the journal Neuron, also shed light on the brain regions involved in the different aspects of self-control. Professor Jason Halford, chairman of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, said: ‘If you know what situations causes you problem, then avoiding it is a useful way of changing your behaviour. ‘As the study shows willpower alone is clearly not a superior strategy. Indeed in situations of temptation or stress it may set individual up for failure.’ However, he added that having someone else set the rules by, for example, denying certain foods, could be a source of arguments.","Research by Cambridge University has found that the best way to avoid temptation is to not face it in the first place .

A selfless father has won back his partner 20 years after they split – by donating his kidney to her. Gordon Henry, 53, has rekindled his love with Joanne Macfarlane following the extraordinary and brave gift that saved her life. The pair split in 1993 and lived 135 miles apart but stayed friends for the sake of their son, Jordan. When Mr Henry, a courier, heard his former love was in desperate need of a donor when a chronic kidney condition flared up again, he stepped forward to help. Together again: Gordon Henry and Jo Macfarlane reunited after 20 years when he donated a kidney to her . He offered one of his kidneys and went under the knife when doctors discovered he was a perfect match. Miss Macfarlane, 44, said: ‘He did it after all this distance between us for years. He risked his life to do it for me and Jordan. At first, I didn’t think he would go through with it, but he went through all the tests and when he was nursing his own mother and having a tough time himself. ‘He didn’t look back. It was very strange. Everyone was saying he wanted to get back with me, even the nurses at the hospital, and I completely dismissed it.’ She added: ‘I’ve heard of couples getting back together after years of separation, but not this way. We’ve put everything that happened in the past behind us.’ Illness: Ms Macfarlane received a kidney transplant when she was 19 but later needed another one . Miss Macfarlane had her first transplant in 1988 at the age of 19 when a kidney was donated by her older sister Amanda Pilgrim. The pharmacy assistant separated from Mr Henry shortly after Jordan was born in the second half of 1993, but the pair remained on friendly terms. In 2004 she moved from her home in Reading, Berkshire, to be nearer her sister in Sheffield when the symptoms of her complaint started again. She underwent five gruelling years of dialysis until Mr Henry, who still lives in Reading, heard of her plight. After undergoing all the necessary tests, he donated his kidney to her in 2009 at Northern General Hospital in Sheffield. The first signs of their old love returning came as they spent two weeks recovering in hospital, when they would visit each others’ room every day to talk. Even after they were discharged the couple kept in more regular contact, and 18 months ago they decided to give their relationship another go. Mr Henry said: ‘Giving Jo a kidney was a chance to repay her for all she’s done for our son, she’s brought him up all these years. ‘One of the strangest things about it was we had been apart for so long, but it definitely felt like the right thing to do. I was over the moon I was able to help. I hadn’t any intention of us getting back together, that wasn’t the reason for doing it, but it is a fantastic ending.’ Miss Macfarlane, who now spends her free time raising awareness of organ donations, is planning to move back to Reading to be with her old love. Their son Jordan, now 19, said: ‘It was a really good surprise to find out that dad was giving mum his kidney after all these years. I think him giving her a kidney and the time they spent with each other there got the ball rolling and after they were both discharged they started speaking a lot more often. ‘We joke about it all the time because it is such a weird scenario. Mum is really happy now though, I have seen a real difference in her since they got back together after the transplant.’ He added: ‘I just hope other people see their story and sign up to become organ donors.’","Gordon Henry and Jo Macfarlane split up in 1993 after having son together .

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 07:02 EST, 25 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:00 EST, 25 July 2013 . Increasing numbers of 'wild swimmers' are suffering stomach upsets and ear complaints after bathing in rivers, lakes and gravel pits during the recent hot weather, according to new research. Double the number of enthusiastic open water swimmers have contacted pharmacies compared to last year for health advice after swimming in open water. Complaints include abrasions to hands and feet caused by stony riverbeds and rock pools and 'swimmers itch' - an itchy rash caused by certain parasites that normally live in freshwater snails. Wild swimming - swimming in open water such as the sea, a river or gravel pits - is becoming increasingly popular. Experts say that the trend, combined with the hot weather is responsible for an increase in people developing infections . ChemistDirect pharmacist Omar El-Gohary said: 'Many stomach upsets are caused by swallowing dirty water, so we advise swimmers to avoid this and to always wash their hands and shower afterwards.' It is also important not to eat anything until you are sure your hands are clean. This advice is backed up by a report published by Public Health England in May this year, following an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness amongst participants in a sponsored swim in the Thames last year. Over 1,000 people took part in the Hampton Court swim and 338 reported symptoms of nausea, diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting. The report revealed that this is likely to have been a result of swallowing river water and inadequate hygiene precautions when handling wetsuits. Experts have advised people to keep the amount of water consumed during a swim to be kept to a minimum . Waterborne diseases are far from uncommon in Britain – in 2010 Olympic Gold medal-winning rower Andy Holmes last year of water-borne Weil’s disease. Whether due to sewage or infections spread by wildlife, open water can easily become contaminated. Seawater usually provides fewer problems because water cannot stagnate and its saltiness prevents bacteria proliferation. Freshwater swimming is more risky. Dr Yvonne Doyle, regional director for PHE London, said: 'Open water swimming is growing in popularity in the UK. 'Many people may already be aware that swimming in natural rivers and lakes, which may not be designated bathing waters, carries a risk of picking up infections.' Sponsored open water swims and triathlons have seen a surge in popularity. The Great North Swim started in 2008 with 3,000 participants and now has more than 10,000 are taking the plunge every year. The boom in wild swimming has also seen greater numbers of people getting blocked ears and temporary hearing problems, according to Dr Simon Gane of the Clear Ear Clinic, which specialises in earwax removal. This is due to earwax absorbing water, which causes it to expand, blocking the ear canal. Experts say there are many health benefits to wild swimming which include boosting cardiovascular health, improving the immune system and giving swimmers a natural high thanks to endorphins triggered by the cold water. Nasa studies have also shown that over a 12-week period, repeated cold swimming leads to substantial bodily changes known as ‘cold adaptation’. This results in reducing blood pressure, cholesterol and fat disposition, inhibiting blood clotting and increasing fertility and libido in both men and women. This is echoed by advice from pharmacists, who say wild swimming can be great fun, but sensible precautions should be taken. El-Gohary added: 'Swimmers with cuts are advised not to swim outdoors to avoid the risk of infection. They should also ensure that they don’t get too cold, and always have warm clothes to put on afterwards.' Wild swimmers are also advised to consult the Environment Agency’s website to check the water quality of their local bathing spot before taking the plunge. SWIMMER'S ITCH . Swimmer’s itch is a short-term, uncomfortable but harmless immune reaction to a flatworm parasite called schistosomatidae. Symptoms, which include itchy, raised papules, which commonly occur within hours of infection and do not generally last more than a week. These parasites use both freshwater snails and vertebrates as hosts in their parasitic life cycles. WEIL’S DISEASE . Leptospirosis or Weil's disease is a bacterial infection spread by animal urine. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, severe headaches, muscle pain, fatigue and, without treatment, fatal organ failure. According to the Health Protection Agency, 58 Britons contracted it in 2009, and eight people have died from Weil's in the past 13 years. Fishermen, canoeists and jet-skiers are the usual victims because they often cut themselves in the water. Experts advise wearing sandals to avoid cuts and scratches and, if you already have a wound, keeping out of the water. Never swim in an urban area unless you know it is monitored for safety and never swim in flood water. CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS . Cryptospiridiosis (parasite pictured) can cause vomitting and stomach rashes . Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a parasite called Cryptosporidium (Crypto), which targets the small intestine. It is most common in children aged from one to five, but can affect anyone  -  about 5,500 Britons are infected with the parasite each year. Symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, severe headache and sometimes a rash around the stomach. Untreated, Crypto can be fatal in the very young or old but those with a healthy immune system normally recover within a month. It is common in streams where cows or sheep may have urinated. E.COLINormally associated with food poisoning, E.coli bacteria can also be picked up from streams and rivers containing sewage. Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea and can be fatal in the very young and old but is easily treated with antibiotics and healthy adults will usually recover quickly. SWIMMER'S EAR . Otitis externa is a common infection that affects the ear canal and is known as swimmer's ear because regular swimmers are five times more likely to develop the infection. Small scratches, cuts or blemishes leave the ear vulnerable to bacteria that are plentiful in water, which causes the ear to become inflamed and itchy. In severe cases the ear will excrete discharge, causing temporary deafness. ALGAE . In warm weather blue-green bacteria called cyanobacteria can cover the surface of slow-moving water. Algae rarely kills but can trigger itchy rashes, stomach upsets and, in severe cases, allergic reactions that cause difficulty breathing.","Research by ChemistDirect has revealed that number of people seeking medical advice for swimming-related illness has rocketed over three weeks .

Four British designers have created a website that predicts how many times you are likely to see your parents before they die. The website, called See Your Folks, is intended to encourage users to spend quality time with family, before it is too late. The designers used World Health Organisation data on life expectancy to make people more aware of mortality. The See Your Folks website predicts how many times you are likely to see your parents before they die. Users enter the country in which their parents live as well as their ages and how frequently they see their parents, to get the startling statistic of how many times they will likely see their parents again . The designers used World Health Organisation data on life expectancy to make people more aware of mortality. The calculator cannot take into account of illness or accidents. This calculation is for someone who visits their 50 year-old parents weekly . Users enter the country in which their parents live as well as their ages and critically, how frequently they visit their folks to get the startling statistic of how many times they will likely see their parents again. Of course the figure it generates is based on an average so does not take family history, illness or accidents into account. Using the calculator, if both your parents live in the UK and are aged 50 and you visit them daily, you can expect to see them 10,950 times. If you visit them every week you might . see them 1,560 times, or if you visit them once a month, 360 times. However if your visits are yearly, you could only see them 30 times . before they die. If both your parents are aged 60, you can expect to see them 1040 times if you visit them weekly, 240 times if you visit them monthly, or just 20 times if you visit once a year, according to the website's calculator . People visiting their 60 year-old parents once a month can expect to see them just 240 times. Modern scientific studies have reportedly shown that reminding people about death can be beneficial to them . If both your parents are aged 60, you can expect to see them 1040 times if you visit them weekly, 240 times if you visit them monthly, or just 20 times if you visit once a year. Ten years later, at 70, the amount of visits you can expect halves and you could see them just 10 times before they die, if you visit them just once a year. But if both your parents are aged 80, . you might get a real shock as the website says: 'Your parents are . expected to die this year'. The idea of reminding people of their mortality to improve their quality of life is not a new one. If your parents are 70, you can expect to see them half as much before they die as if they were 60, according to the calculator . People visiting their 70 year-old parents five times a year could expect to seem them just 50 times. The statistics generated by the website are a sharp reminder that we have a limited amount of time to spend with our loved ones . Roman generals returning from battle . had a tradition that a slave following them in a victory parade would . mutter 'remember you will die,' while many clocks in Renaissance Europe . included the phrase 'tempus fugit' to remind people to make the most of . their time, Slate reported. Modern . scientific studies have also reportedly shown that reminding people . about death can be beneficial to them, if it is done in a gentle or . subliminal way.

Doctors say they believe they can save the lives of the boys who were born in Jaipur, Rajasthan, on Wednesday. Rare: The unnamed boys have a condition known as Dicephalic Parapagus . Doctors in Jaipur, the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan, say they are battling to save the twins . Dr. S.D. Sharma, medical . superintendent of J.K. Lone Hospital, said that such cases are very . rare, especially in boys and are known as Dicephalic Parapagus. He added . that this is the first case in Rajasthan and second in India. Most of the time, children that are Dicephalic Parapagus are born dead and, in the vast majority of cases, are girls, reports CBS. But doctors are hoping they can help the boy. Another famous case of conjoined dicephalic parapagus twins are Americans Abigail and Brittany Hensel, whose story was featured on the TLC reality TV series Abby & Brittany. Earlier in September 2011, two 11-month-old girls from Sudan joined at the top of their heads were successfully separated at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.

Anthony Fox, 46, ate up to 70 slices of bread a week - and piled on the pounds as a result. Now the sandwich addict has finally beaten the habit and has shed a massive nine stone. Fox, ate his way through 20 loaves per month, which is 11,200 calories in bread alone. Carb addict: Anthony Fox used to eat up to 70 slices of bread a week - the equivalent of 20 loaves per month . Slimmer: Anthony's love affair with bread left him tipping the scales at 25 stone before he gave it up . Bread ban: Anthony can now fit into most of his wardrobe but couldn't when he was a carb addict . Instead of tucking into his favourite peanut butter and marmite sandwiches, Fox now plumps for healthier fare such as weetabix and jacket potatoes and has also cut out sweets and other fattening treats. 'I started putting the weight on when I got my first job in London in 1987,' revealed Fox. 'I moved from Derby to London and . there was food everywhere - KFC, Pizza Hut, McDonald's. 'Socialising . always revolved around drinking and eating. I've been on a few diets and have lost up to six stone, but for one reason or another I've always put it back on. 'I loved bread, I'd always eat at least 10 slices a day - sometimes all in one sitting.' Despite his unhealthy diet, Fox only realised matters had gotten out of hand when he discovered he'd grown too big for everything in his wardrobe but his work uniform and a pair of elasticated jogging bottoms. The Derby Homes employee said: 'I used to love peanut butter and marmite sandwiches - I'd be eating 10 slices for my breakfast alone at the weekend. 'But when I got invited to a work . Christmas party, I realised the only clothes that fitted me were my work . uniform, three tops and my jogging bottoms. 'I was fat, sweaty and unhealthy. I thought enough was enough. Now I'm much more confident and happier with myself.' Fattening: They might not look much but together, 70 slices of white bread add up to a whopping 2,800 calories . Moderation: Although he hasn't given up bread entirely, he's swapped sandwiches for brown toast and marmite . Prodded into action by the sartorial shock, Fox joined his local Slimming World group and, 18 months later, weighs just 16 stone. Instead of feasting on carbs, he now enjoys healthy home-cooked meals and has swapped his lunchtime sandwiches for salad. Along with looking better, the new diet has left Fox feeling better too. He used to suffer from high blood pressure and painful joints, but now his blood pressure has fallen and he no longer suffers from a bad back or joint pain. He said: 'Before I would get the bus everywhere, now I can walk to work and I even bought a bike for the first time in 30 years.' Despite the healthy new lifestyle, Fox, who now has plenty of clothes that fits and three Christmas parties already lined up this year, hasn't entirely quit the carbohydrates. 'I love carbs and this way I can still eat them,' he admits, before adding: 'But I don't eat sandwiches any more. 'If I want bread I have brown with Marmite, and if I get a craving for peanut butter I have a healthy peanut bar instead.' Binned: Now he's ditched the carb habit, Anthony says he's happier - and healthier - than ever . BREAKFAST: Two breakfast sandwiches or 10 slices of peanut butter on toast . LUNCH: Two cheese and onion sandwiches, crisps and chocolate . DINNER: Chilli con carne or spaghetti bolognese, one or two large bars of chocolate . SNACK: Toast with peanut butter or cheese .

A vaccine which protects against a potentially deadly form of meningitis should not be offered to children in the UK, immunisation experts have said . Campaigners have condemned plans to prevent  children from having a life-saving  new vaccine on the NHS. Ministers have been told it would not be ‘cost-effective’ to give routine jabs against meningitis B. In Britain there are 1,870 cases of meningitis B each year and up to 200 deaths, half among the under fives. As many as 400 children are left with . serious lifelong complications such as limb amputations, blindness, . deafness and brain damage. Vaccination programmes have been used . for pneumococcal meningitis and the C and Hib strains, but there is . currently no B vaccine in the UK. Bexsero targets a large number of the . 1,000 strains of the disease and was hailed as a breakthrough when it . was licensed this year. But an independent panel says it would . not be cost-effective – despite having no price for the new vaccine – . as the disease is on the decline. The decision by the Joint Committee on . Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) means worried parents must buy the . vaccine privately. Campaigners say Britain has one of the . world’s highest rates of meningitis B. In trials of 7,500 people, the . new vaccine produced antibodies against three-quarters of meningitis B . strains, suggesting it would give strong protection. Health Protection . Agency teams helped test the jab. Myron Christodoulides, reader in . molecular bacteriology and microbiology at Southampton University, said . he accepted there were uncertainties about the jab, but if efficacy . predictions are correct its use could have saved 60 to 80 lives this . year. Meningitis Trust chief executive Sue Davie said: ‘In terms of cost – what price can you put on a life? ‘[It] should be negotiated between the . drug company and Government because it needs to be on the NHS to save . the greatest number of lives.’ The JCVI says Bexsero’s efficacy ‘has . not been established’ and it is ‘highly unlikely’ to be cost-effective. It will take more evidence before finalising its advice in October. Manufacturer Novartis said it was not asked about cost by the JCVI. Andrin Oswald, of Novartis, said: ‘We . expected to have tough negotiations – but we did not anticipate a . decision saying the vaccine isn’t wanted at all, no matter what price.’ In April it was announced every child . in England and Wales will have yearly flu jabs, even though the illness . is very rarely fatal in children. Meningoccocal B (pictured) is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in this country and one of the most deadly. It poses the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target . Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said: 'This is a very difficult situation where we have a new vaccine against meningitis B but we lack important evidence. 'We need to know how well it will protect, how long it will protect and if it will stop the bacteria from spreading from person to person. 'We need to work with the scientific community and the manufacturer to find ways to resolve these uncertainties so that we can come to a clear answer.' Dr David Elliman, immunisation representative for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: 'Nobody doubts that meningococcal B disease can be catastrophic and that all reasonable means should be taken to prevent it. 'However, before introducing a new vaccine or drug, it is important to be sure that not only is it safe and effective, but bearing in mind the increasing financial pressures on the NHS, it also has to be cost-effective. 'Money spent on the vaccine is money not spent on something else. Unfortunately, evidence on these points is either lacking or conflicting. 'It should be possible to fill some of these gaps in knowledge and then the decision should be reconsidered.'","Meningitis B vaccine should not be rolled out, say Government advisers .

A young woman who was told by doctors that her crippling stomach pains were probably heartburn or a stomach ulcer is now battling advanced pancreatic cancer. When Kerry Harvey, 23, from Chichester, West Sussex, was eventually diagnosed with stage four cancer, it had spread to her liver and bones and doctors said there was little they could do for her. But to everyone's relief, she is responding well to palliative treatment. Her latest scan revealed the tumour on her pancreas has shrunk, that her liver has become less cancerous and that the cancer has entirely retreated from her bones. Kerry Harvey, 23, (pictured with boyfriend Matt Biggin, 29) started developing pains in her abdomen last December. At first she thought the pains were just harmless stomach cramps . Kerry said that she believes a . combination of medical treatment and holding on to a positive attitude . is responsible for her progress. She told MailOnline that she started developing pains in her abdomen last December. 'They started quite gradually and to be honest, I thought they were women's problems as I tend to get cramps every month.' But the pain continued to worsen and spread upwards towards the left side of her ribcage. Eventually, at the beginning of January, the pain became so unbearable she visited the A&E department at the she worked in. 'Doctors examined me and didn't seem to worried although they said I should go to the Women and Children's Unit for an internal ultrasound to check everything was okay with my ovaries,' said Kerry, a former hospital administrator at St Richard's Hospital. 'They just sent me home with painkillers.' Kerry (pictured with Matt) said she had exciting plans before her diagnosis - she was happy in her job as a hospital administrator and planned to marry and have children . When Kerry had the ultrasound the . following week, doctors said that they could see nothing sinister and . suggested that the pain was being caused by polycystic ovaries or that . she had maybe experienced a miscarriage. She . was this time given stronger Tramadol painkillers and told to go back . to the doctors if the pain still did not improve within two weeks. The pain continued to worsen and Kerry then began to lose her appetite. In . addition to this she developed intensely itchy skin that became so . unbearable that she would sometimes wake in the morning covered in cuts. Kerry (pictured with her family on her her 21st birthday two years ago) has does not have a strong history of cancer in the family and she said it never occurred to her that she might have the condition when she first developed strange symptoms . Kerry, who has a 21-year-old sister called Amy, visited her GP again in March but despite a thorough examination he said he could not find anything suspicious. 'He thought I probably had a gastrointestinal reflux [heartburn] or a stomach ulcer but said I should probably have a scan to be on the safe side,' explained Kerry. She was booked in for a scan two weeks later but within a week we was rushed to A&E while at work because she suddenly doubled over in pain. Kerry repeatedly visited her GP and A&E but no one suspected for one moment she might have pancreatic cancer, a disease more often associated with older men who smoke and heavily drink . She was again given a full physical examination but this time they found that she had an enlarged liver. Her blood tests came back showing that her liver enzymes were abnormal too. But this wasn't enough to hint at the severity of Kerry's condition. Doctors believed that her pains were being caused by a duodenal (intestinal) ulcer. They asked her to come back for another scan and sent her home again with painkillers. But the following day Kerry's health suddenly and rapidly deteriorated. 'I woke up screaming and crying because the pain was absolutely horrific,' she said. 'I was rushed to hospital at 7am where I was given morphine to reduce the pain.' Kerry has been undergoing treatment since her diagnosis in March this year . She was immediately given an ultrasound and when staff looked at the image they immediately summoned a doctor to review what they could see. 'They told me I was going to need a CT scan and I asked when that would be. 'When they said they were doing it immediately I knew something was very wrong - working in a hospital you know that means they think it might be cancer.' The CT scan finally revealed that she was suffering with cancer but because her liver was so enlarged they did not know where the cancer was originating from. Because he liver was so swollen, they initially thought it may be liver cancer, but a liver biopsy eventually revealed that it was the pancreas the liver was obscuring that was diseased. Kerry was suffering with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, the same cancer that killed Apple founder Steve Jobs. They also discovered that the cancer was so advanced - stage four - that it had spread to her liver and several bones. 'I couldn't believe it when I found out - this wasn't part of my plan. I was young, had a good job, had a boyfriend and always thought I was going to marry and have children. 'I'd already known two people who had developed cancer - I'd had my dose of knowing what it was like.' Kerry was immediately given chemotherapy but she didn't qualify for surgery to remove the tumours growing on her organs because the cancer was so advanced. Soon after she was referred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to undergo further palliative treatment so she could be closer to her mother and father who live in the city. Kerry's case is incredibly rare and she is not angry at the late diagnosis she was given. When doctors initially discovered that Kerry (pictured here with boyfriend Matt) had cancer they were not sure where it was originating from because it was advanced. Eventually they discovered she had a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, the same cancer that killed Apple founder Steve Jobs . The pancreas is a gland situated behind the stomach, where the ribs meet at the bottom of your breastbone. It produces digestive enzymes that help to break down food and a hormone known as insulin to control blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer affects around 8,000 Britons a year. It . is the ninth most common cancer in the UK, more common in people over . 60 and not usually found in people under 40 years of age. Approximately 65 per cent of people diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas are over 70. Men tend to be more affected than women. Kerry . had no history of the disease in her family and apart from genes, heavy . smoking and drinking is usually cited as the main cause. Symptoms usually include pain, jaundice, weight loss, diabetes and nausea. Surgery to remove the tumour is usually . the only way to completely cure pancreatic cancer, but this is a . suitable treatment for only around 15 to 20 per cent of patients. 'My consultant has specialised in pancreatic cancer for 30 years and he has never met any one as young as me with the disease. 'The youngest person I've since met with the cancer is 37 and every time a doctor discovers I have it they say ""Really?!""'

'It doesn't really make sense for me though as I've never smoked and if I had two glasses of wine in a week it was a treat,' explained Kerry. Pancreatic cancer is a very serious form of the disease as it is both difficult to detect and treat. Because pancreatic cancer causes few symptoms in its early stages, the condition is often not diagnosed until the cancer is relatively advanced. Kerry remains upbeat and tries to live life as normally as possible. She said that positive attitude has helped her psychologically but she also believe it has made her chemotherapy more successful . Surgery to remove the tumour is usually the only way to completely cure pancreatic cancer. But this is a suitable treatment for only around 15 to 20 per cent of patients. Kerry has been told she will not be able to get rid of the cancer and that most people do not survive beyond ten years after diagnosis. But her treatment combined with her positive outlook seems to be making a difference. 'Since I've had treatment the cancer has really retreated. At my diagnosis there was a very large tumour on my pancreas. 'My cancer was three-quarters cancerous and several of bones had also become cancerous too. Kerry (pictured with Matt earlier this month) said she is not bitter about having a cancer that is not curable. She said it was not part of her life plan but that she looking forward to becoming an auntie early next year . 'But since treatment, the tumour has shrunk significantly, my liver is only now a quarter cancerous and bones are cancer-free.' Kerry said that her boyfriend's support has been a massive help throughout her ordeal. 'He was there for me from day one. When Matt found out he offered to shave his head so I didn't feel alone - but I told him not to as he'd look stupid. 'He's taken time out of work to be there with me in hospital too. He's just been great.' And in terms of her future, Kerry remains stoical. 'You just can't be bitter about these things. It wasn't part of my life plan but you just have to get on with it, don't you. I'm really excited about becoming an auntie soon too, so I'm focusing on that right now.' Kerry is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s campaign to ensure no one faces cancer alone.

Andy Batty, 48, collapsed in agony and was dead before paramedics arrived in a helicopter. The 6ft engineer went into anaphylactic shock while helping his daughter, Catherine, 17, ride her pony, Bess. Andrew Batty, from Devon, went into anaphylactic shock after being bitten by a horsefly in a field. He died almost immediately and was pronounced death when paramedics arrived shortly after . Two ambulances and the helicopter were . scrambled to a field where Catherine had been riding at 12.30pm on . Sunday, but Mr Batty was pronounced dead at the scene. Last night, Dr Pamela Ewan, an allergy . consultant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, said: ‘Death from a . horsefly bite is incredibly rare. ‘Most people develop a small swelling . and some will go on to develop an infection but to suffer anaphylactic . shock is pretty unheard of.’ Mr Batty died almost immediately and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Horsefly bites develop into large, red itchy bumps within minutes but are usually harmless. Doctors usually recommend using an over-the-counter steroid cream . containing hydrocortisone,' However . it is important not to use too much as such creams can produce their . own allergic reactions. Ibuprofen gel can also help . with pain and swelling. It is important to keep the bite . clean because if bacteria gets into the skin, in very rare cases it can . cause cellulitis, an infection of the soft tissues. Symptoms include hot, swollen skin, nausea and high temperature. In . exceptional cases the victim can suffer an allergic reaction with . symptoms including dizziness, difficulty breathing, a blotchy rash and . severe swelling that may be visible in your lips or tongue and cause . nausea. If you suffer any of these reactions, seek medical help immediately. She said it was likely that Mr Batty . had been bitten by a horsefly before, adding: ‘This then triggered his . body’s immune system to create  allergic antibodies. ‘But he would need to be genetically predisposed to suffering such a  severe reaction.’ Dr Bill Frankland, consultant . allergist at the London Allergy Clinic, said: ‘The man will have . probably died within 15 minutes of being bitten. It’s normally a very . sudden death.’ But he added: ‘This is a very unusual . case, people shouldn’t worry if they get bitten by a horsefly as the . likelihood of someone being this allergic is extremely rare.’ Catherine had lived with her father since the keen rugby fan and former taxi driver separated from her mother several years ago. Mr Batty also had three children from a former marriage, James, Michael and Rachel. Last night, friends paid tribute to the ‘jolly giant’, of Brixham in Devon. Chris Forster, chairman of Brixham Rugby Club, where Mr Batty worked as a steward, said: ‘Andy’s death is very sad. ‘I spoke to his daughter,  who he was absolutely devoted to. It is very raw for her. She is in shock. ‘He always did what he could to help. He was very well liked. Everyone at the club has been saddened by the news.’ Colleagues at KJ Engineering described Mr Batty as fit, healthy and strong. Manager Keith Iszard said: ‘Andy was a big fellow, very broad like a rugby front-row man. He could lift any weight. ‘We couldn’t believe a small fly could knock him down. ‘His death has come as a massive shock . to everyone.  Andy was a lovely man – a jolly giant, always very . friendly and would volunteer to help anyone. Everyone liked him.’ Horsefly bites develop into large, itchy bumps within minutes but are usually harmless. It is important to keep bites clean because if bacteria gets into skin, it can cause cellulitis, an infection of the soft tissues . Mr Batty’s friend John  Rugman, 61, said: ‘He was  a fantastic father. He doted  on Catherine. ‘He was so proud of her. He was an . absolutely fantastic man, he would do anything for anybody without . question. He was a great friend and we’re absolutely devastated by the . shocking news.’ Horseflies are members of the bloodsucking tabanidae family of insects. They frequently attack humans and . livestock and are regarded as pests because their bites can carry . diseases and parasites. Horsefly bites are notoriously painful because – . unlike a mosquito, which pierces the skin –  the insect uses its . powerful jaws to rip into the flesh so it can feast on blood. They can cause rashes, dizziness, . wheezing, swelling  and infection, but anyone who has been bitten . normally makes a full recovery.","Andy Batty was in field with his daughter when he was bitten by the insect .

Philip was smartly dressed in a double-breasted blazer, but appeared to be wearing white surgical stockings under his loafers. He was holding a book about the . British Empire entitled The Crucible Of War: The Seven Years’ War And . The Fate Of Empire In British North America, 1754-1766. From his bookmark it appeared the duke was at least three-quarters of the way through its 900 pages. Philip was in ‘good spirits’ but will take a two-month ‘period of convalescence’, the Palace said. Initially he will rest at Windsor Castle, and possibly later move to Balmoral in Scotland. He is expected to resume engagements . in the autumn. It is the fourth time the duke has needed hospital . treatment since Christmas 2011, and last week he spent his 92nd birthday . in the London Clinic. Mystery: The Palace has kept the details of the Prince's operation private but said he was in good spirits and recovering well . Treatment: The Duke was taken to The Clinic in London after being taken ill at a Palace garden party almost a fortnight ago . Looking well: The Duke gripped his book as he said goodbye to staff and then walked in a spritely fashion to a waiting car with a smile on his face . Philip received more than 1,000 cards . from well-wishers during his time at the hospital, and in recent days . he has been asking for paperwork from his office. Yesterday the Queen was all smiles as . she took part in the historic Garter Day service at Windsor Castle, . believed to be the first time Philip has not been at her side for the . ceremony. Instead, in the latest sign of the . monarchy preparing the younger generation to take over, the Queen was . flanked by Prince Charles and Prince William. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: . 'The Duke is in good condition and good spirits. He'll take a period of . convalescence, of approximately two months. 'The Duke has expressed his thanks . and appreciation to medical staff at the London Clinic and the many . members of the public who have sent good wishes.' The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry's chauffeur-driven vehicle pulled up outside the hospital around 15 minutes after the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, so for a period of time the Duke had four members of his family with him at his hospital bedside. The Duke of Edinburgh had a full house as four of his family members were there at once last Friday . Security was tightened at the hospital as they royals visited the Duke. Earlier in the day his granddaughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie paid him a visit. Charles and Camilla stayed for just over 35 minutes and left the hospital smiling and looking relaxed. Seeing the Prince: Charles and Camilla were all smiles as they left the clinic last week . Once out of hospital the Duke will spend two months convalescing but he is described as progressing well. Prince Philip, pictured the week before his operation at a Buckingham Palace garden party, spent his 92nd birthday in hospital . The Duke celebrated his 92nd birthday four days ago with a visit from the Queen and the Earl of Wessex. Prince Charles and Camilla had been Birkhall, their private residence at Balmoral. Prince Edward was the first member of the Royal Family to visit the Duke last week and said he was doing 'well' after his visit. His visit lasted 20 minutes and as he left he was asked by the waiting press how his father was and replied: 'Well, thank you'. The Duke had already received the good wishes of the Prime Minister on his birthday and gun salutes were fired across the UK to mark the milestone. David Cameron took to Twitter to send a birthday message to Philip: 'Wishing the Duke of Edinburgh a very happy 92nd birthday as he recovers in hospital today.' The Palace has not revealed what prompted the exploratory surgery but sources said doctors ‘picked something up’ during a routine health check. The Duke was then admitted to the London  Clinic ahead of Friday's pre-arranged operation a week last Thursday. The surgery, known as a laparotomy, was performed the next day under general anaesthetic. He was visited by the royal doctor, Professor John Cunningham, on the Saturday and the results of the operation are expected later. Seeing her husband: The Queen was pictured holding an envelope addressed to HRH The Duke of Edinburgh . Watching: A large crowd gathered at the London Clinic as the Queen arrived at about 7pm last Monday . It is not usual for members of the Royal Family to visit the duke in hospital, because he disliked ‘fuss’. In 2008 he was admitted for four days with a chest infection but refused to receive any well-wishers. His eldest grandson Peter Phillips said last week that the family was kept informed but added: ‘He’s one of those people who wouldn’t want you to stop just because he’s gone into hospital.’ Last August he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to be treated for a recurrence of a bladder infection while staying with the Queen at Balmoral. He was in hospital for six days and was not visited by any members of the Royal Family, following doctors’ orders for the elderly Duke to rest. As well as recuperating after surgery, it appears Prince Philip has relaxed by reading about 18th century history. The Duke of Edinburgh today left hospital clutching The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 under his arm. The book by Fred Anderson costs at least £50, and looking at his bookmark it appears the Duke is at least three-quarters of the way through its 900 pages. Reading: Prince Philip left hospital clutching the Crucible of War by Fred Anderson (left), considered a masterpiece by academics and reviewers . The book, first published in 2000, tells how during the Seven Years' War, Great Britain decisively eliminated French power north of the Caribbean. Mr Anderson also says this profoundly changed the political and cultural landscape of North America, as the British influenced the first US President George Washington and others like him. Anderson also argues that men like Washington also worked hard to understand Britain's strengths and weaknesses, particularly militarily, which allowed America to successfully battle them and win later.","Duke had exploratory operation and has been progressing well .

Inspired: Firefighters say the popularity of 50 Shades of Grey has sparked a surge in people getting trapped in handcuffs . It is emergency calls that firemen are expected to answer, not embarrassing ones. But thanks to the popularity of the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, they are increasingly being called out to free people handcuffed to beds. London Fire Brigade said it had turned out to 79 such incidents - and nine instances of men with rings stuck on their penises - and urged people 'always keep the keys handy'. Third officer Dave Brown, said: 'Some of the incidents our firefighters are called out to could be prevented with a little common sense. 'I don't know whether it's the Fifty . Shades effect, but the number of incidents involving items like . handcuffs seems to have gone up. 'I'm sure most people will be fifty . shades of red by the time our crews arrive to free them.' The . Brigade has attended more than 1,300 incidents involving people being . trapped or stuck, often in everyday household items, since 2010. Each . incident costs taxpayers at least £290, meaning they have cost at least . £377,000. In 2010/11 crews attended 416 . incidents; in 2011/12 this rose to 441 incidents; and in 2012/13 this . increased still further to 453. A total of 307 people were injured as a . result of them.

'When firefighters are out attending to some of these avoidable . incidents, someone else could be in real need of emergency assistance. 'If there's a genuine emergency, fire crews will of course attend and will be on the scene to help within minutes.' The Brigade said its crews are called to more than one incident every day involving someone trapped or stuck. People getting into a jam with rings, bracelets and watches are a common occurrence, while firefighters are also regularly called to assist people and children with their fingers trapped in electrical items like washing machines, sewing machines and heaters. The most common type of callout for this type of incident is to people with rings stuck on their fingers, which accounted for almost 500 over the last three years. 'Our advice is simple,' said a Brigade spokesman. 'If the ring doesn't fit, don't force it on. 'As well as being painful, you could end up wasting emergency service time if you have to call us out.' Despite the unusual nature of some of the incidents, the Brigade was keen to stress that people should always call 999 in the case of a genuine emergency.","London Fire Brigade turned out to 79 incidents involving handcuffs and nine of men with rings stuck on their penises .

Mel Arundel, 54, and Roy Burgon, 58, of Melton, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, were convicted of drink-driving after they both denied the offence. They were ordered to fork out a total of £3,710 in fines and costs between them. Roy Burgon, 58, (pictured left leaving Ipswich Magistrates Court) and Mel Arundel (right), were convicted of drink-driving after they both denied the offence. They claimed they were the victims of spite . The pair claimed they were victims of spite involving a man who held a grudge against Arundel after she dismissed someone he knew from the care home she managed in Ipswich. Burgon, a staff nurse at another Ipswich care home, and Arundel accepted they were over the drink-drive limit when they were breathalysed. But they insisted they were under the limit when they drove home from St Audrey's Social Club after meeting up from work. They claimed they downed wine and cider when they got home. PCs Benjamin Coombes and Stephen Griggs went to the couple's home in Melton, near Woodbridge in Suffolk after receiving an anonymous 999 tip-off at about 11.35pm on April 19. The caller said the pair had driven home drunk, Ipswich magistrates heard. The couple, who have been convicted of drink-driving, insisted they were under the limit when they drove home from St Audrey's Social Club (pictured) after meeting up from work . The journey home from St St Audrey's Social Club was a mere 50 yards - both were caught after a tip-off to police who went straight to their home . The two officers put their hands under the wheel arches of Arundel's Kia Venga and Burgon's Ford Fiesta after getting to their home at about midnight. Both engines were still warm. Sarah-Jane Atkins, prosecuting, told JPs the couple were inside the house in a 'drunken state'. Burgon answered the door and smelled of alcohol. His eyes were glazed and he was unsteady on his feet, the court heard. Arundel was in the lounge and also appeared drunk, the court heard. Both were in their dressing gowns. Burgon told magistrates he had drunk less than two pints of lager in the social club. Arundel said she had had less than two small glasses of red wine. They said that after arriving home they had downed one bottle of wine and started another by the time police turned up. Burgon also admitted having a can of cider. Breath tests showed Arundel had 93 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, while Burgon had 70 mcgs in 100mls of breath. The legal limit is 35mcgs. Burgon was banned from driving for 12 months and Arundel for 17 months.","Pair claimed they were victims of spite involving a man who held a grudge .

Health and safety: Kirsty Hippolite, 39, has been told she can no longer bake cakes for her daughter Georgia's class bake sale . A girl of 12 was banned from selling homemade cupcakes to her classmates – because her mother does not have a food hygiene certificate. Teachers at Georgie Hippolite’s school stopped her from bringing in the treats for an end-of-term charity cake sale because they breached ‘health and safety’ regulations. Her mother Kirsty spent two hours making the 40 confetti and violet cream cupcakes – only to be told they were not fit for human consumption. Georgie’s tutor Gareth Balch at Cowes Enterprise College in Cowes, Isle of Wight, had called to check if she had the food certificate usually held by catering professionals. When she said she didn’t, the mother-of-five was told her cakes, which Georgie had previously sold at the school without issue, couldn’t be sold. The teacher explained Cowes Enterprise College could be sued if a pupil fell ill having eaten a cake from an uncertified source. And he added other pupils planned to bring in shop-bought slices, cupcakes, and sponges for the end of term sale instead. However, eager to ensure the cakes did not go to waste, he suggested Georgie still take the cakes in - for the teachers. Mrs Hippolite, 39, whose husband Paul is a . landscape gardener, said: 'Georgie came home from school and said they . were having an end of term cake sale to raise money for charity. 'I love baking and spend several hours a week making cakes and biscuits, so I offered to make some treats for her to take in. 'I spent about two hours baking and icing the cakes but got a phone call from her teacher later that afternoon. 'He was apologetic and sounded as if he felt a bit foolish as he asked if I had a food hygiene certificate. 'He explained Georgie was unable to sell . the cakes unless they had been made by somebody who had the . qualification because of ""health and safety"". 'I couldn’t stop myself from laughing as . he told me the school could be sued if a pupil fell ill after eating . one of my cakes. It’s ridiculous. 'People have been baking cakes at home for sale at fetes and village fayres for years without any issues. 'The teacher said other pupils planned to buy slices, cupcakes, and sponges from a supermarket and take them in to resell. 'My daughters never eat that sort of food because it is often pumped full of artificial preservatives and e-numbers. 'Risk': Mother-of-five Kirsty Hippolite, 39, was told she needed a food hygiene certificate to make cakes for her daughter to bring in to class because the school could be sued if a child fell ill after eating food from an uncertified source . 'I would rather make them something . fresh and natural - even though it’s easier to nip to a shop and spend a . pound on something in there.' Mrs Hippolite, who lives in Cowes, Isle of Wight, criticised the health and safety regulations. She added: 'The qualification . the school was demanding is usually only held by catering professionals - . not mums who enjoy baking as a hobby. 'Health . and safety has gone mad when a mum must have a qualification to prove . she is ""safe"" to make cakes for her daughter’s friends. 'However, the teacher did tell me all was not lost and that Georgie could still take the cakes in for the teachers to enjoy.' The food hygiene certificate requires three hours of self-study time and costs about £15 to complete. It ensures people working in catering understand the impact of food borne illness and how to prevent contamination. Regulations: James Stewart, the headteacher of Cowes Enterprise College in the Isle of Wight, said the safety of the school's students was its number one priority . Bill Murphy, head of planning and regulatory services at Isle of Wight Council, said the school had been over-zealous. He said: 'While it is indeed accurate that generally people preparing food for public consumption must be registered with the Environmental Health department, parents making the occasional cake to sell at a school event do not need to be registered. 'I am sure though that the teacher clearly had the best of intentions for the health and safety of their students. 'The council is very keen to support community events such as school fetes or village fayres and our Environmental Health service is more than happy to provide advice and guidance to organisers to ensure their day goes ahead with no problems.' Headteacher James Stewart said: 'Our health and safety advisor told us it is good practice to make sure somebody with a food hygiene certificate has made or supervised the preparation of the cakes. 'The safety of our students is of paramount importance so we followed the recommended guidance. 'If somebody fell ill having eaten a cake in a classroom - and we had not done all we could to ensure they had been prepared safely - we would be liable. 'Home baked cakes which were not sold were left in the staff room where staff could leave a donation.'","Kirsty Hippolite often made cakes for her daughter Georgia's class bake sale .

Victory: 'Godfather of retail' Tony Shiret outside The East London Employment Tribunal building, where he won his unfair dismissal case against Credit Suisse . A City big-hitter nicknamed the 'Godfather of retail' could be handed a £1million payout because he was unfairly dismissed at 55, a tribunal has ruled. Expert analyst Tony Shiret also successfully argued he was the victim of age discrimination after banking giant Credit Suisse made him redundant in favour of younger staff. After 18 years there he lost his job in June 2011 but said the process was 'preselected without any consultation, weighted against me and inherently unfair'. Mr Shiret said the points system set-up to decide who would stay was 'fixed' in favour of a colleague in his thirties. 'It is apparent that I was targeted for redundancy whilst my younger subordinate was given some form of assurance that he would progress in his career. It will be seen these scores were inherently unfair and were tainted by age discrimination,' he told a London tribunal. He added that Credit Suisse 'merely went through the motions' of a redundancy process but had already decided he must go. The bank 'vigorously denied' his claims but was found to have acted in a 'discriminatory and unfair way' when judging their former employee. Employment Judge Brown criticised  Steven East, co-head of the pan-European equity department, and told of emails which referred to 'knifing' Mr Shiret. 'The tribunal finds that Mr East was not a credible witness when talking about these emails. He did not make eye contact. He gave brief answers and appeared to be uncomfortable,' she added. Case: Tony Shiret, successfully sued Credit Suisse (its London HQ pictured), after they unfairly made him redundant . Mr Shiret said he was thrilled Credit Suisse would be 'held to account', and could receive a seven-figure pay-off. 'I think that you have to give people a chance to demonstrate that they can still do a job and not assume that, once they reach a certain age, they cannot do a job for you,' he told The Times. 'The other side can argue that, in this case, it was a screw-up. But if you read the judge's ruling, it looks more systemic.' A spokesman for the banking giant said: 'We are disappointed by the decision. Credit Suisse is an equal opportunities employer and does not condone discrimination on any basis. 'Having had an opportunity to review and consider the judgment, we have decided to appeal.'","Tony Shiret successfully claimed that Credit Suisse 'fixed' redundancy .

A schoolgirl was slashed and stabbed at home as she apparently tried to stop a knife-wielding intruder from attacking her father. Ayeshea Collins, 13, was fighting for her life last night after coming to the aid of her DJ father as he was repeatedly stabbed. As Rob Jackson, 41, desperately tried to defend himself his daughter rushed downstairs to protect him. But the teenager suffered horrendous injuries herself when the knifeman turned on her. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Victim Robert Jackson, 41, (left and right) was stabbed to death at home and it is alleged that his daughter Ayeshea, who is in a critical condition, may have been trying to protect him . Murder: Forensics close off the home of Robert Jackson in Moston, Manchester, where he was killed and his daughter Ayeshea critically injured after a knife attack last night . Probe: Forensics are working in the house and outside to piece together what happened . Mr Jackson, a part-time DJ and carpet fitter, who was friendly with members of bands the Happy Mondays and Oasis, died after collapsing in a pool of blood. Ayeshea also collapsed, bleeding heavily from deep stab wounds all over her body and was last night said to be in ‘critical’ condition. Police found an ‘extremely shocking’ scene, with blood spattered across the house in a quiet Manchester street and Ayeshea lying side-by-side with her dead father. Shortly afterwards, as officers hunted the killer, a suspect hijacked a car at knifepoint and drove the vehicle into the side of a pub as he was being approached by a police patrol. Police found Darren Gasper, 34, slumped over the wheel suffering serious stab wounds. He later died in hospital. Last night detectives were mystified over a motive for the attack. They are examining the possibility it may have been a robbery that went horrifically wrong. Unemployed Gasper was known to the family and officers say he may have seen the DJ as an easy target. A police source said: ‘It is a possibility the attack was a robbery or burglary or simply a heated argument that erupted into an armed struggle.

The Manchester Communication Academy pupil had been looking forward to her school holidays. Greater Manchester Police said they were called to an address in Moston at around 10.20pm on Sunday, following reports of a disturbance. Mr Jackson, nicknamed ‘Jacko’, was a DJ at a number of pubs and clubs in Manchester. He was said to be friends with Happy Mondays percussionist Mark ‘Bez’ Berry and knew Oasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher. Mystery: The two dead men appear to be the only people involved in the incident, which has left 13-year-old Ayeshea Jackson badly injured .

'100 per cent sure': Paul Meehan, 40, who is charged with wasting police time, is seen arriving at Croydon Magistrates' Court . The neighbour of Tia Sharp's grandmother told police he was '100 per cent' sure he had seen the murdered schoolgirl when she was already dead, a court heard today. Paul Meehan, 40, risked derailing the police hunt for the 12-year-old by lying about seeing her just before she was reported missing, it is said. He claimed to have spotted Tia leaving her grandmother's home in New Addington, Surrey, on August 3, last year. But her grandmother's boyfriend Stuart Hazell, 37, had murdered Tia the previous night, bundled her body into plastic bags, and hidden it in the loft. Meehan backed up Hazell's bogus claim that Tia had gone missing after leaving to meet friends in Croydon town centre, Croydon Magistrates' Court heard. He made a statement about the supposed sighting just after noon last August 3, telling officers: 'I'm 100 per cent sure in my heart it was Tia, and I know it was her walking down that path on Friday.' 'While Tia was missing, he told police on several occasions that he had been standing outside his own property and had seen Tia leave the property in The Lindens at about noon on Friday, August 3', said prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward. 'He was thereby confirming Stuart Hazell's account of her leaving, walking out of the front door at that time, apparently never to be seen again. 'In fact, this was impossible at the time he claimed to have seen Tia, because she was already dead. 'As a result, he immediately became a figure of importance in the investigation, as he became the last person to see Tia alive.' When Tia was initially reported missing, a massive manhunt was launched with members of the local community joining officers to search for the schoolgirl. Significant resources were then diverted towards investigating Meehan's claim, the court heard, and he maintained his story up until Tia's body was finally found. 'Mr Meehan's false confirmation of Hazell's account through his statement led police down an incorrect and unnecessary lines of investigation', said Ms Ledward. 'It compounded the family's false hopes that she may be alive. 'Police spent time and money investigating his story and attempting to find corroborating evidence. 'It was a waste of valuable resources at a critical time that could have delayed finding Tia's body and the detention of Stuart Hazell.' Ms Ledward said Meehan first made the bogus claim on August 6, three days after Tia was reported missing, but he had been keen to help police in the missing person's search before that. He searched online for images of the trainers Tia had been wearing, emailing pictures of them to the officers investigating, and offering to 'keep and eye out' for the missing girl. Meehan is said to have learned . Hazell's bogus story about Tia going missing when officers and family . members were at his home on August 6. He . claimed to have been having a cigarette on his porch, and knew it was . around midday because the news headlines had just begun, the court . heard. After reporting . his claims to police, Meehan told his wife and boss at work that 'top . brass' at the police would want to speak to him. False hope: Tia Sharp, 12, (left) had already been murdered by Stuart Hazell (right) at the time Meehan claimed to have seen her leaving her grandmother's home . He texted his wife to say: 'If police have their way, top brass will want my statement.' When interviewed by police, Meehan gave a detailed description of Tia, wearing headphones and with her hair up in a ponytail. 'He was emotional during the interview, expressing regret at not having spoken to her', said Ms Ledward. 'At the interview, his statement leaves no room for doubt as to who he had seen, including her clothing, where, and when. He expressed himself to be sure with 100 per cent certainty.' Meehan, a bus driver with Metrobus who volunteers with St John's Ambulance and with London Ambulance Service, told police: 'How do you describe a 12-year-old walking care-free? 'There didn't seem to be any urgency in her walk at all. She just seemed like a 12-year-old walking care-free. 'It seemed she was preoccupied', he said. 'I saw her left profile and back, I thought she had headphones in so I didn't say anything. When Tia's body was eventually discovered, on August 10, Meehan started to backtrack on his claims, saying he was no longer sure it was Tia he had seen, the court heard. He was arrested and interviewed over the bogus claims, and was charged in February this year with wasting police time. Hazell admitted murdering Tia in May this year, and was jailed at the Old Bailey for at least 38 years. The alcoholic window cleaner, who had previously served time for drug dealing, brazenly joined the search for Tia and even gave a TV interview appealing for help. But there was no suggestion, after extensive investigations, that Meehan knew anything about Hazell killing Tia. The bus driver told the court that although he now accepts it could not have been Tia, he believed his statements to police were true at the time. Meehan said he did not initially tell police about the potentially vital sighting when first asked on August 4, the morning after she had been reported missing, because he had just woken up. But he claims he did pass the information to an unidentified officer the following day. 'I was tired and I wasn't fully awake when the door knocked on Saturday afternoon', he said. 'I had just woken up, but I'm sure I said it to one of the officers.' Meehan said his memory of seeing the girl leaving his neighbour's house returned 'at the end of Saturday into Sunday'. He told DC Gavin Seeley about the sighting just before midnight on Sunday, when he was at the house Hazell shared with Mrs Bicknell. 'Are you really telling us the truth?', asked prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward. 'You were aware the granddaughter from next door was missing, you knew police were making enquiries, and you have seen her. 'You had woken up, came to your senses, found out it was all really true, and you kept that information to yourself for the best part of a day?' But Meehan reasserted that he had already mentioned it to another officer, and did not think he needed to repeat it to DC Seeley. 'As far as I was concerned, I had mentioned it to an officer prior', he said. 'I can't be responsible for how they deal with it.' Frequently flustered under cross-examination, Meehan repeatedly told the court: 'At the time I made my statement to DC Seeley, I believed it to be true.' But Ms Ledward told him: 'You told what you thought would be a white life, something you believed was true, but something you hadn't seen at all. 'You did that to draw attention to yourself, to draw attention to yourself as the last person to see Tia.' But Meehan responded: 'I came forward doing something I thought would be the right thing.' Asked if he still remembered seeing a girl leave the house that day, he told the court: 'I still have a recollection of someone - knowing it is not Tia - but I recollect someone walking up the path. 'My recollection is still clear in my mind, even if it can't be true.' Meehan has one previous conviction, on April 17, 1998, for theft at Swansea Crown Court, for which he was given 80 hours community service and ordered to pay £470 compensation. Expert witnesses will now be called to give evidence on Meehan's state of mind when he spoke to police. Meehan may be suffering from a false memory that makes him believe he did actually see Tia that day, an expert psychologist told the court. Dr Ian Anderson told magistrates that Meehan may have a 'confabulated memory', a common problem which causes the sufferer to believe something that is not true. 'It is entirely possible in this case', he said. 'What we have heard today was the way Mr Meehan's memory changed over time. 'His early memory wasn't entirely sure, but then he became more sure as he keeps telling it.' He suggested there was an absence of personality defects or a motive to life, this was the most likely explanation of Meehan's claims. 'It is one of the possibilities, although I believe in considering all the possibilities I can think of, it seems to me a likely possibility.' Dr Anderson said Meehan showed no signs of being a compulsive liar. And he suggested there was no sign that Meehan was hoping to enhance his importance by claiming to have seen Tia. Dr Anderson added that Meehan appeared confused at times during his evidence, but this may have been a side effect of the anti-depressant medication he is taking. Meehan, who now lives in South Norwood, denies wasting police time. The trial continues.

Many like to think of Britain as an island that may be small and isolated, but one that is supremely tough. But one author has smashed the theory that Britain has been impenetrable since the Norman invasion of 1066. Whereas British history may crow about the nation's ability to invade and conquer other larger countries, this book will definitely deflate the idea that Britain has not been on the receiving end of an invasion for centuries. Successful invasion: William of Orange was one of many rulers to have invaded Britain since 1066 . Invasion: A sketch of William III of Orange leading the Glorious Revolution at Hellevoetsluis in 1688 . Ian Hernon, author of Fortress Britain, has found dozens of examples that prove that Britain has been invaded and attacked at least 70 times. He did not include the hundreds of small invasions on the south west coast, or Wales, that plagued many a small town, the Daily Telegraph reported. Enemies arriving from Africa, America and - perhaps unsurprisingly - France have all landed on Britain's shores and attempted to invade, with varying degrees of success. The author told MailOnline: 'Everyone knows about the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and Germany's occupation of Guernsey during World War II. Charge: William of Orange, later King William III of England, leading the Dutch army in England's Glorious Revolution . New history: The invasion by William III of Orange, who landed at Brixham in southwest England on 5 November 1688, is one of many detailed in Ian Hernon's book . 'But there's a myth that Britain was never successfully invaded between these two wars. 'In fact there were many invasions between 1066 and 1940, but they have been forgotten and lost from the general British consciousness. 'I wanted to fill in the gap in this collective memory.' The journalist-turned-author counted 73 significant invasions - but most failed because of the terrible British weather. Dreadful conditions made it difficult for troops to cross the Channel and land on the shore. Under attack: The French fleet attacks Bembridge in the Isle of Wight in 1545 . Fire ships: The Dutch burn English ships on the Medway during the expedition to Chatham in 1667 . The French bombardment of Algiers which was led by Admiral Duppere in June 1830 is shown in this sketch by Antoine Leon Morel-Fatio . A painting by Richard Paton of the 1779 Battle of Flamborough Head off the coast of Yorkshire between an American Continental Navy squadron led by John Paul Jones and the two British escort vessels protecting a large merchant convoy . The . last time French troops landed on British soil was during the Battle of . Fishguard - also known as the 'last invasion of Britain' - in 1797. Over the years, Britain has taken a pummelling from foreign adversaries. In 1193, the Danes teamed up with the most persistent offenders, the French, for a full-scale invasion, Mr Hernon's book says. The French Prince Louis the Lion came close to a successful exactly 150 years after the Battle of Hastings. The 100 Years War was a source of . constant pain for British towns and ports, as the Spanish and French . carried out multiple raids. The Germans invaded the Channel Islands during World War II, which was one of many attacks on Britain's land . Following the Armada, there was the bloodless invasion of 1688, with countless invaders landing on Britains shores until the German occupation of the Channel Islands between 1940 and 1945. The last shots exchanged with an enemy on Britain's mainland were at Graveney Marsh in Kent, as Germans and Britons engaged in fire. in March hundreds of French armed troops along with 43 vehicles, four helicopters, two landing craft and a catamaran, stormed a beach in Gosport, Hampshire. But far from being a serious assault on the scale of a Napoleonic invasion, this was a unique training exercise for the French military. While Britain has been on the receiving end of many an attack, a study in November last year showed its true global reach was far more extensive than maps would suggest. Throughout the ages, Britain has invaded almost 90 per cent of the world’s countries. An analysis of the histories of almost 200 nations found that only 22 have never experienced a British assault. These include Luxembourg as well as Guatemala, Tajikistan and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. Britain is often considered an impenetrable island safe from foreign forces - but as this list of invasions since 1066 show, it's not as secure as many believe... 1067: Edgar Aethling attacked the West Country twice (2) 1060s–70s: Sweyn Estridsson invades in the north and then East Anglia (2) 1208: The Channel Islands are seized by Eustace the Monk (1) 1216: The French invade Kent, which sees their leader crowned (1) The Hundred Years War . 1217: Eustace the Monk invades near Sandwich 1 . 1338 to 1339: Attack on Harwich, Southampton, Plymouth, Jersey (twice), Guernsey, Alderney and Sark (8) 1340: French raids along the south coast; at least six landings (6) 1360: Attacks on Sandwich, Rye, Hastings and Winchelsea (4) 1373: Another French invasion of Jersey (1) 1376: Attack on Rye (1) 1377: Raids on Rye (twice), Rottingdean, Portsmouth, Dartmouth, Plymouth, Isle of Wight, Winchelsea, Folkestone, Southampton, Poole (11) 1380: Winchelsea attacked again (1) 1386: Winchelsea attacked once more.

This flamingo has shunned standing on one leg for floating in water like a swan in a bid to cool down during the British summer . Paul Rose, a flamingo expert at WWT Slimbridge, said: 'Lots of flamingos go for a quick paddle around but I've never seen anything like this. 'I first noticed the unusual behaviour as the weather warmed up a few weeks ago so I think it is his way of keeping cool in the heat of the day.

Fugitive: Mental health patient Ian McLean who is serving life for stabbing his partner escaped to Poland for a week . A prisoner serving a life  sentence for repeatedly stabbing his girlfriend was able to flee abroad after a doctor signed his passport application. Ian McLean, 44, walked out of a mental health facility and boarded a Eurostar train to Belgium. He spent more than an hour in Brussels before anyone noticed he was missing. The career criminal then travelled to Berlin before moving on to the Polish  seaside resort of Kolobrzeg. His escape forced police officers to place Michelle Storer – the ex-lover he stabbed – in protective custody. McLean was jailed for life in 2004 after he admitted stabbing Miss Storer, 37, all over her body. He stopped only when the handle of the knife broke, and then  whispered ‘die’ in her ear. Miss Storer was stabbed so many times that doctors were unable to count the number of individual wounds. McLean spent some of his sentence in Bullingdon Prison near Bicester, Oxfordshire, before being transferred to a secure mental institution to treat an ‘extreme personality disorder’. He was then sent to an unlocked ward at Littlemore Mental Health Centre in Oxford. While at Littlemore, he persuaded a doctor to sign his application for a passport, which he later used to escape to Europe. McLean was finally arrested in Kolobrzeg, 300 miles north-west of Warsaw, after eight days on the run. A major inquiry has been launched into how Oxford Health, the NHS Trust that runs Littlemore, allowed a dangerous prisoner to escape. Miss Storer, a mother of two from Banbury, said her former boyfriend should never have been placed in an open mental unit. She said: ‘When the officers came to the house and told me he’d escaped and they needed to take us to a safe house, I just burst into tears. Holiday: Ian McLean travelled 930 miles to the Polish seaside resort of Kolobrzeg in north-west Poland . ‘I asked, “How has this happened,” but they said they didn’t know. I was scared to death – not knowing where he was or if he’d come back to finish the job. 'I don’t believe he should ever be put in an open unit as he will do it again.’ Oxford MP Nicola Blackwood added: ‘This is a deeply worrying incident.’ Detectives said McLean booked a taxi on his mobile phone while inside the mental unit. At 1am on July 8, he paid the driver £100 take him to St Pancras Station in London where he boarded the Eurostar to Brussels. He arrived in the Belgian capital just after 9am – more than an hour before police in Oxford were told by the mental unit that he was missing. Police then circulated his picture through Interpol. British officers, working with their Polish counterparts, captured McLean in Kolobrzeg eight days later. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Johns, who led the manhunt, said: ‘I am really pleased we managed to get him so quickly. ‘Throughout the whole investigation I was very conscious he was in a foreign country, not under any treatment and I was concerned what risk he posed. 'The Polish police were under no illusion as to the potential risk.’ Oxford Health has apologised to Miss Storer and has launched an investigation into how McLean escaped. A spokesman said: ‘We have sent a letter expressing our apologies to her and are offering her the opportunity to meet with senior staff to discuss her concerns. 'This man was not deemed to present a substantial risk to the general public, despite his previous offences.’ McLean is being held in a Polish prison and will return to the UK in the next few weeks.","Ian McLean walked out of Littlemore Mental Hospital in Oxford on July 7 .

Today the care home described the collision as a 'tragic accident'. Both the Health and Safety Executive and the city council's safeguarding team confirmed they were investigating the circumstances. Care home regulatory body the Care Quality Commission was also informed of the incident. The powered wheelchair has a top speed limit of just 4mph. The care home is owned by Dorset-based company Oceancross Limited. Manager Cheryl Morison said: 'We have fully co-operated with all agencies regarding this accident. 'The resident in the electric wheelchair was fully assessed and deemed to be safe to use it and had been assessed only a week prior to the accident. 'All this information was given to the coroner who fully investigated the accident. 'We have informed CQC about the accident.

The streetlight was put up outside the £160,000 home of Kath Jones, 72, when the estate in Bayston Hill, Shropshire, was being built in the 1970s. Mrs Jones said at the time of its construction, her late husband Albert pleaded with their local authorities to shift the lamppost by just two metres because he had already laid foundations for a garage. She said the couple even offered to pay for the work themselves but their pleas were ignored by highways bosses at Bayston Hill Parish Council. Mrs Jones says the lamppost has caused her a headache ever since with the widow damaging her car while pulling off her driveway six times in the last few years. But after more than four decades of complaining to the authority they have finally accepted her offer to pay £500 from her own pocket to have it removed. Emma Kay, Bayston Hill Parish Council . clerk, claimed the situation had only been brought to her attention two . months ago and confirmed work would begin soon. Mrs Jones today said: 'My car has got lots of scratches on it. When you reverse out there is literally a two inch gap to get it past or it catches.

Work is now due to get underway next week to move the lamppost.

In the latest preview shots from hit costume drama Downton Abbey, Lady Mary Crawley proudly clutches her newborn son. The last time fans of the show saw her during last year’s Christmas special, the character – played by Michelle Dockery -  had just given birth and the youngster had yet to be named. ITV apparently named the fictional baby George (pictured left) after King George V . The series ended with her husband Matthew dying in a car crash, leaving the newborn fatherless. As filming on the new series started months ago, ITV clearly named the fictional baby George first - apparently after King George V. The photo will also set off wild speculation of a new romance among Downton Abbey’s many fans.Posing with his daughter Sybil, Lady Mary’s brother-in-law Tom Branson – played by Allen Leech - also lost his spouse in the last series. His wife – also called Sybil – died during childbirth. Now two of the show’s key protagonists have been left as bereaved parents, it seems they may be on the cusp of forming a new relationship. Filming on the fourth series at Highclere Castle and Ealing Studios began in February. It will be broadcast on ITV in the autumn. Last year, Lady Sybil’s tragic demise helped boost the show’s ratings to 9.5million. But some viewers criticised the show’s convoluted and dramatic plotlines. It has had five premature deaths in just three series. The choice of name couldn't be more relevant as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge presented Prince George to the world this week . Previous episodes have seen young fiancée Lavinia Swire succumb to a deadly flu virus, footman William Mason die in the Battle of the Somme, and Turkish diplomat Kemal Pamuk suffer a fatal heart attack in Lady Mary’s bed. Last year, the  writer Julian Fellowes revealed he was forced to kill off Lady Sybil and Matthew Crawley because the actors who played them – Dan Stephens and Jessica Findlay – wanted to leave the show. He said: ‘We would have loved to keep [Stevens]. We would have loved to keep Jessica too. We have always tried to persuade him to stay. He had done fantastically well for the series and his creation of Matthew was terrific. ‘But this is life. Dan felt that this was right thing for him, and the right moment to move on to different areas.’","Last season of the hit show ended with Matthew Crawley dying in a car crash .

Police have called on the mother of a baby whose remains were found on a path near a cemetery to come forward. A dog walker discovered the body on an old railway path in Edinburgh's Seafield area last night. Detectives said the investigation was at an early stage and did not reveal the sex of the child, but said it may have been a newborn. Harrowing: A policewoman stands guard near to where the body of a baby was found in Seafield Cemetery, Edinburgh, while forensic teams look for clues . They appealed for the mother, who may be in need of medical or emotional support, to contact them. Detective Chief Inspector David . McLaren said: 'We are carrying out further investigation to try and . establish the cause of death of that child and how the child came to be . on the path. 'Obviously there is a mother out there who may be in need of some sort of medical assistance or emotional support. Cordon: Police officers guards the scene after the remains of a baby were found on a path near Seafield Cemetery in Edinburgh . 'I would ask that if she's out there . and hears this appeal that she gets in touch with us at Police Scotland . so that we can provide her in the first instance with that assistance or . support that she may need and, secondly, to try and establish just . exactly how this baby came to be on the path.' The remains were found at around 5pm in undergrowth on Restalrig path near Seafield Cemetery. Police sealed off the area as a forensic team attended the scene. Officers stood on a footbridge over . Seafield Place, which was cordoned off and there was police tape around a . section of the residential street which borders the public park known . as Leith Links. Appeal: A police officer watches over the scene where the remains of a baby were found as detectives urge the mother to come forward . Investigation: Police fear the mother of the dead child may be in need of some sort of medical assistance or emotional support . Grim discovery: The body of the small baby was found near Seafield Cemetery in Edinburgh, pictured, by a member of the public, last night . Mr McLaren said it was difficult to say how old the child was, but confirmed it was 'a young infant, a baby'. He said it was possible the baby was a newborn. 'Clearly a line of inquiry will be . around expectant or new mothers to try and establish whether or not . there's information in that community,' he said. Asked whether the remains had been hidden, he said they were 'not overtly visible' from the footpath. Police are exploring the possibility that the mother was local to the area. Mr McLaren said: 'That's something . we're looking at. It's a popular path, it's used by both dog-walkers and . cyclists. It's difficult to say at this time but that's a possibility. 'Certainly in terms of looking at expectant or new mothers, the immediate focus will be in the local area.' Mr McLaren said it was difficult to say how long the remains might have been at the spot. He said: 'I must stress our . investigations are at a very early stage. As the day progresses, . hopefully that kind of information will become more apparent.' Appealing to the public for . information, he added: 'The quickest way for us to get answers is for . the mother or a family relative or friend to get in touch with us if . they have any suspicions about a mother who was expecting and is maybe . not with child now. I would urge them to get in touch with us.' A worker at a car body repair centre on Seafield Place said he arrived to find lots of police activity outside the shop. It has been reported the remains of the baby showed signs of mutilation, but police have not confirmed these details. This discovery comes just a few months after the body of another baby was found near Bolton. Detectives investigating the death of a newborn girl fear she may have been alive when she was stuffed into a Tesco carrier bag and dumped in a ditch. Officers believe the child they have named 'Alia' was not stillborn as at first thought and lived for around two hours. The girl’s body was discovered by dog walkers at the remote Ox Hey Lane in Lostock near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on Mother’s Day this year.","The remains were found in bushes by Seafield Cemetery at 5pm on Sunday .

Moors murderer Myra Hindley hatched an audacious plot  to escape from jail and work as a missionary in Brazil with her  lesbian lover. The notorious child killer planned to copy jail keys using bars of soap and use them to flee over the perimeter wall after falling in love with a prison officer who had previously been a nun. During months of meticulous preparation for the plot in the early Seventies, Hindley studied the movements of the guards at Holloway in North London, changed her name by deed poll and applied for a driving licence in the name Myra Spencer. She also posed for passport pictures in the prison chapel wearing a wig, according to Scotland Yard files released to the National Archives. With the help of her lover, she used pink Camay soap bars to take key impressions for three prison doors and the master key to her D Wing cell. The impressions were smuggled out of the jail in an old tea packet. She planned to have copies of the keys made by a contact  outside jail and get to the  perimeter wall of the prison on a night when her lover was  not working. Once she was over the top, she intended to rendezvous with her lover in a hire car to catch a night flight together to South America, before her disappearance had been noticed by other guards. Hindley tortured and murdered at least five children with Ian Brady in Manchester in the 1960s before burying their bodies. She was jailed for life in 1966 and died in Cookham Wood prison in 2002, aged 60. Her plot to flee Holloway was foiled when an off-duty policeman was asked to inspect a suspicious parcel containing the key impressions. Her lover Patricia Cairns was arrested and confessed to detectives that she and Hindley had also recruited another inmate, petty criminal Maxine Croft, to help with the plan. In her police statement Cairns said: ‘At the beginning of September 1973 we began to consider getting her [Hindley] out.Various plans were discussed between us over the weeks until I suggested taking Myra to Sao Paulo to do missionary work. Jailbreak: Myra Hindley fell in love with a prison guard and plotted to escape Holloway Prison in north London . ‘I suggested going out at 9pm so Myra and I would have all night to reach our destination before she was missed. ‘Sometime in late September, or early October 1973, I brought three bars of Camay soap into prison. I took them upstairs to the kitchen where Maxine worked, and allowed her to take impressions of my prison keys on the soap. ‘I collected the soap later in the day, when they had dried, and took them home... ‘As the escape plan was to be put into effect during the night a copy of the master key was needed. One night during this period I was on dinner patrol in charge of the key safe. ‘During a quiet period, I slipped upstairs with the master key and Maxine took an impression of it in prison soap. She gave it to me, in an empty tea packet, later in the day.’ Cairns had arranged to leave the parcel containing the key impressions in the left luggage locker at Paddington station to be picked up by a contact who could make copies. Moors muderers: Ian Brady and Myra Hindley killed and tortured children in the 1960s . Hunt: Police search for bodies of those killed by Brady and Hindley on Saddleworth Moor . But when she arrived police told them . luggage was not being accepted because of an IRA bomb scare, so she . posted them to the contact at a garage in Ilford, East London, with a . set of instructions. But the plot was exposed after the . contact was suspicious of the parcel when it arrived and, fearing it . might be a bomb, asked an off duty police officer who was at the garage . to open it. When officers later searched Cairns’ flat they found Hindley’s false driving licence and 20 pictures of the . killer posing in her cell. Cairns later pleaded guilty to the escape . plan and was jailed for six years.

He said: ‘It was only because of an IRA bomb scare and a  suspicious policeman that the plot failed. ‘She then turned to more conventional . routes to secure her release, but never really came close to having her . case heard by the parole board.’","Myra Hindley plotted to escape Holloway prison in 1973 .

Six people were killed when a building being demolished collapsed Wednesday and nearly obliterated an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store, among the dead a woman who only recently got engaged, a young art student and a mother of nine. The mayor's office identified the victims as Anne Bryan, Roseline Conteh, Borbor Davis, Kimberly Finnegan, Juanita Harmin and Mary Simpson. The 13 people pulled alive from the rubble are Susan Randall, Betty Brown, Shirley Ball, Linda Bell, Jennifer Reynolds, Nadine White, Margarita Agosta, Richard Stasiorowski, Rosemary Kreutzberg, Rodney Geddis, Felicia Hill, Daniel Johnson and Myra Plekan. Wasteland: A four-story building being demolished collapsed Wednesday on the edge of downtown, killing six and injuring 13 people . Cleanup: A firefighter sprays the debris on Market Street in Philadelphia, which is all that was left from a building . ‘Our deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of the deceased,’ Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said during a press conference Tuesday. ‘I ask all Philadelphians to remember those who perished and their families in their prayers and thoughts.’ While city officials and the victims’ loved ones began picking up the pieces in the aftermath of the tragedy, new questions were being raised about the cause of the collapse. It was revealed Thursday that nearly a month before the deadly collapse that ended the lives of six people, the City of Philadelphia had been made aware of potentially unsafe demolition practices at the site. NBC Philadelphia reported that Center City resident Stephen Field, 49, called the municipal hotline on May 6 to express his concerns that the demolitions crew dismantling a building at 2134 Market Street used no safety equipment and had no protection for pedestrians. New beginning: Kimberly Finnegan, 35, just got engaged two weeks ago and was working her first day as a cashier at the downtown store when she was killed . Lives cut short: Borbor Davis, 68,  (left), pictured with his wife, Maggie,  died working at the Salvation Army store; Anne Bryan, 24, a first-year student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, was shopping at the store when the building came down . In memory: A reporter makes a photograph of a makeshift memorial for Kimberly J. Finnegan near the scene of a building collapse . 'There was nothing resembling efforts to prevent people walking by from being hit with brick,' he told the station. Licensing & inspection data shows contractor Griffin Campbell Construction was handing demolition at multiple adjacent properties along the 2100 block of Market Street, including house number 2136, which came crashing down on Wednesday. All three properties were either owned by or have ties to New York-based STB Investments. Field said that after some back-and-forth with a city representative, he was notified that an inspector visited the site in question and found no safety violations. At a press conference Thursday morning, Philadelphia Department of Licenses & Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market Street was not inspected because demolition work had not begun at the time of Field's complaint. Loving mothers: Juanita Harmon, 75, a retired secretary, is survived by four grown sons; Roseline Coneth, 52, an immigrant from Sierra Leone who worked as a certified nursing assistant, was a mother of nine . The 49-year, however, insists that he witnessed crews doing demolition work on both sites before he called the helpline. In a press release this afternoon, Williams said that the city will now begin conducting 'proactive inspections' of all private demolitions. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter pledged a 'wide-ranging' investigation into the collapse. John Dougherty, head of Local 98 of the electrical workers' union, called the deadly collapse a 'sad metaphor' for the city's construction process, adding that his group had been concerned in recent years with similar demolition sites. The collapse of the building left six people dead, and in the hours after the tragic incident, their stories slowly began to emerge as their families struggled to come to terms with their loss. Anne Bryan, 24, was a first-year student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts who was described by teachers there as ‘dynamic, inquisitive and smart.’ Allegations: It was revealed that nearly a month before the deadly collapse that ended the lives of six people, the City of Philadelphia had been made aware of potentially unsafe demolition practices at the site . Official response: Mayor Michael Nutter, center, pledged a 'wide-ranging' investigation into the collapse . Philadelphia Department of Licenses & Inspections Commissioner Carlton Williams said that 2136 Market Street was not inspected last month because demolition work had not begun at the time . Her family called her a talented art student and generous friend, sister and daughter. ‘That she will not be here to continue to touch the lives of those around her is of intense pain to all of our family and her friends. This pain is fresh and it runs deep,’ the family said in a statement that asked for privacy. Bryan had been shopping at the thrift store when the edifice crumpled to the ground. Borbor Davis, 68, of Darby, was a Liberian immigrant who died working at the Salvation Army store. His stepdaughter called him a hardworking man and devoted husband. ‘He loved my mom so much,’ said Maryann M. Mason said, who said they'd been married several years. ‘They looked so good together.’ Davis’ wife, Maggie, told CBS Philadelphia that her husband called her just 15 minutes before the collapse. At 10.45am, she got a frantic call from her daughter telling her to turn on the TV. ‘I took out my phone right away and called him, he didn't answer me, and we had just put the phone down 15 minutes, so I call him again and I been calling him, he never answered,’ said Davis. The widow described her husband as a kind-hearted, Christian man who loved his job and never missed a day of work. Kimberly Finnegan, 35, of Philadelphia, was working her first day as a cashier at the downtown store after about a year at a Salvation Army shop in the city's Roxborough neighborhood, where she lived. She got engaged only two weeks ago, according to her brother, Bob Coleman. ‘The main thing, I think right now, is how incredibly happy she was,’ Coleman said. Juanita Harmon, 75, a retired secretary and a mother of four grown sons, loved to travel and shop, according to her family. Her son Andre said she would often go to the Salvation Army store to find him and his brothers special items. Dramatic moment: A dust cloud rises as people run from the scene of a building collapse on the edge of downtown Philadelphia, which killed six people . Rescue continues: Emergency personnel and others pull a man from the rubble . Seeking signs of life: A Philadelphia Firefighter, center, lays with his hand thrust into an empty area underneath a clothing rack . 'Certain people deserve certain things in life, and what she deserved she didn’t get,’ said friend Michael Morgan. Roseline Coneth, 52, an immigrant from Sierra Leone, worked as a certified nursing assistant, her loved ones told the station, adding that she came to the country to make their lives better. She was a mother of nine who enjoyed bargain-hunting - a hobby that brought her to the thrift store on Wednesday morning. Her grieving family are now planning to send her body back to her native West Africa for burial. So far, no information has been released on the sixth victim, Mary Simpson.","The mayor's office identified the victims as Anne Bryan, Roseline Conteh, Borbor Davis, Kimberly Finnegan, Juanita Harmin and Mary Simpson .

The glorious spell of sunshine Britain has been basking in for the last few weeks has come to an abrupt end this weekend. The Met Office's warning for heavy downpours and thunderstorms today became a grim reality for spectators at London's Olympic Park. After weeks of sun, the audience at Sainsbury's Anniversary Games dove for cover and panic bought anoraks to protect themselves from the heavy showers. Weather experts have warned some regions may be hit by localised flooding from this evening into Sunday as thousands of holidaymakers prepare to set off for their summer break. Scroll down for video . Washout: Spectators at London's Olympic stadium were caught in heavy showers yesterday watching stars from last year's Games compete .

Rain and thunderstorms have been predicted for this weekend, although many people were still enjoying the warm weather at Brighton . Downpour: Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected for parts of the country today, the Met Office has warned, emulating these showers in Glasgow earlier this week . The Met Office has issued a 'yellow' warning of rain following concerns that heavy showers and thunderstorms expected over France today could move north to affect south-east England and East Anglia. The thundery weather is then expected to move north to cover large parts of England on Sunday, with as much as 30mm of rain falling in an hour in South East areas, forecasters have warned. Sean Penston, forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said there was 'every chance' of flash flooding in areas affected by the torrential rain. 'There's a pool of warm air moving up from the continent which should arrive in the south east of England by (the) afternoon,' he said. 'That will bring heavy and thundery rain across much of south-east England, before it moves in a north west direction across the Midlands, parts of east Wales and south-west England. 'This rain will keep pushing north on Sunday into northern England and Scotland. Then, moving in from the west, further showers and outbreaks of rain with the risk of thunder will affect south-west England and Wales.' Crowds gather in the last of the UK heatwave at the 25th International Sunderland Airshow . RAF Red Arrows perform at the 25th International Sunderland Airshow . Flooding: Parts of the country were hit with flash flooding earlier this week as torrential rain fell on dry ground . The South East will bear the brunt of the weekend's rain with as much as 30mm expected to fall within an hour, and 50mm within three hours in some places, according to the Met Office. This compares with an average rainfall of around 80mm for the whole month of July, MeteoGroup said. In its weather warning, the Met Office said: 'Thunderstorms and areas of heavy, thundery rain are expected to move north from France during the course of Saturday afternoon and evening. 'The public should be aware of the risk of localised disruption to travel, due to surface water flooding and lightning strikes.' Armageddon: The hot weather has put paid to slugs . Temperatures will remain warm for . most of the country, however, with highs between 23C to 25C for much of . England today, Mr Penston said. Meanwhile, . as gardeners up and down the country have watched in dismay as the . heatwave turned their lawns a dusty brown, every cloudless sky has a . silver lining: the continued dry weather has put paid to two of the most . common garden pests – slugs and snails. Last . summer’s washout led to increased numbers of slugs, including an . outbreak of the Spanish ‘super’ slug, which can grow to more than 4in in . length and carry parasites. Hot: Beachgoers pictured on the beach in Weymouth this week have basked in two weeks of sunny weather, but it's about to come to an end . But the longest spell of warm weather since 2006 has so far put paid to fears of a similar invasion this year. Another summer nuisance, the mosquito, has also fared badly. They lay their eggs in water, as the larvae need it to survive, but the dry weather has evaporated breeding pools, dramatically reducing numbers. But weeks of uninterrupted blue skies and soaring temperatures, are about to come to a very wet end, with forecasters predicting up to two inches of rain could fall in the south-east in just three hours today, as violent thunderstorms sweep across the country. Met Office forecaster Sarah Holland, . said: ‘It’s going to be very wet over the weekend for some and we have a . warning out for today, as the South East and Cambridgeshire receive a . band of thunderstorms and heavy rain that is moving northwards from . France.’ Change: July's glorious hot spell, seen being enjoyed here by a woman in a lavender field in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, is to end with temperatures dropping . Dramatic: A lightning bolt strikes the Eiffel Tower in Paris during one of the biggest storms ever to hit Paris . But the downpours are not bad news for everyone. They will be welcomed by those whose gardens are in need of water, and could bring an added boost for summer berries. More . drought-resistant plants, such as blackberries, have been helped by the . hot spell, but the forecast rains will help swell the berries for a . bumper late-summer crop, according to Matthew Oates from the National . Trust. Flash floods: Cars were completely submerged following flash flooding in Southwell, Nottingham, this week . There is also potential for a really good apple and plum harvest, he said. Mr . Oates, who highlighted the impact of the heat on slug numbers, . explained: ‘Much of Britain’s nature is booming after the warm spell, . and many of those doing best are species humans are particularly fond . of. As for those doing badly, they are creatures that are mostly seen as unpopular such as slugs, snails and biting flies. ‘And . with an abundance of insects, there are rich pickings for a lot of our . birds who are enjoying these conditions, with species such as swallows . and housemartins doing particularly well.’ The . July heatwave saw the longest spell of hot weather to affect the whole . of Britain for seven years, with temperatures exceeding 28C (82f) somewhere in the UK for 19 consecutive days. The . warmest day since July 2006 was recorded last Monday at Heathrow and . Northolt, in west London, when the mercury reached 33.5C (92f) The . Met Office’s Lindsay Mears said: ‘The best of the summer weather is . over for now, and it looks like the next few days will be unsettled, . with thundery storms moving up from the South East over the weekend. ‘Temperatures . will stay above average, but it will remain quite humid, with the risk . of some wet weather in much of the country.’","Met Office has issued a weather warning for heavy rain and thunderstorms .

The boat driver charged with killing a bride-to-be and best man in Rockland County, New York is believed by police to have been intoxicated as he piloted the doom vessel on the Hudson River on Friday. Now, the sheriff’s department awaits a toxicology report to verify their belief and determine exactly what had 35-year-old Jojo K. John intoxicated enough to smash into a construction barge, killing two and injuring three others. John was charged with felony vehicular manslaughter and three counts of felony vehicular assault from his hospital bed on Saturday and his charges were based upon eyewitness accounts. He will now presumably face an additional manslaughter charge after the best man Mark Lennon’s body was found Sunday, a day after bride-to-be Lindsey Stewart’s. The news that John was likely intoxicated came as police revealed that the Nyack, New York man has an arrest record for a previous offense involving drugs, though the exact nature of the charge has not been released. 'At this point, we have probable cause to believe he operated the boat while intoxicated, and that's the basis for the charge,' Rockland County Undersheriff Robert Van Cura told ABC News.

Immigration figures are ‘little better than a best guess’ which could downplay the numbers coming in by 35,000 every year. In a blistering report, MPs said the statistics – based on interviews with the equivalent of 13 immigrants a day – were ‘not fit for purpose’. They were told that Disney World has a better way of recording visitors than the UK. The level of net migration, even if the margin of error was only 5 per cent, could be 35,000 higher or lower, a committee warned . The revelations have put ministers under pressure to crack down harder if they are to hit their target of reducing net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Currently, cutting net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the UK, and those leaving – to anything below 100,000 would be considered a success. But the Government’s own panel of experts, the Migration Advisory Committee, said ministers must aim for a total of 50,000. This was the ‘only way of being certain’ the key Tory election pledge had been achieved, the experts said. In the year to June 2012, immigration was estimated at 515,000, while emigration was estimated at 352,000, putting net migration at 163,000. A finger print scanner is seen at the entrance to Walt Disney World. MPs were told that theme park has a better way of recording visitors than the UK . But Westminster’s Public Administration Committee said the figures produced by the Office for National Statistics and the Home Office were ‘blunt instruments’ and ‘not adequate’. They are based on the International Passenger Survey, which interviews a tiny number of the 100million people arriving in the UK every year. MPs said just 5,000 migrants a year were identified through the survey and it had a ‘large margin of error’. The level of net migration, even if the margin of error was only 5 per cent, could be 35,000 higher or lower, the committee warned. Chairman Bernard Jenkin said: ‘Most people would be utterly astonished to learn that there is no attempt to count people as they enter or leave the UK. As an island nation, with professional statisticians and effective border controls, we could gain decent estimates of who exactly is coming into this country, where they come from, and why they are coming here. ‘As it is, the top-line numbers for the Government’s 100,000 net migration target are little better than a best guess – and could be out by tens of thousands.’ Philippa Roe, leader of Westminster City Council, said: ‘When I gave evidence to this committee, I said Disney World has better technology to keep track of its visitors than we do.’ The report, which compared the UK's tracking system with Disney World's, said just 5,000 migrants a year were identified through the survey and it had a 'large margin of error' But Lib Dem Vince Cable said: ‘We are not a totalitarian state. We don’t count every single person . . . the idea there’s some vast, hidden army of people, is almost certainly completely wrong.’ Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch campaign group, said: ‘Better statistics would, of course, be helpful. But blunt instruments have their uses. ‘The immigration target has been vital in turning around immigration policy which has already resulted in a reduction of approximately 100,000 in net migration. ‘The exact figure may not be precise but there is no doubt that this is a major achievement.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We disagree with the report’s conclusions. Government reforms on immigration are working and the statistics do show that net migration is at its lowest level for a decade. ‘The Government is determined to build a fairer system and to address the public’s concern about immigration. ‘We are committed to getting net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands, and we want to be judged against the very best available evidence.’","Cutting net migration to anything below 100,000 would be a success .

A woman who murdered her 'sugar daddy' ex-boyfriend with the help of another lover and then hid the mutilated body in a freezer was jailed for life today. Sharon Swinhoe, 44, battered retired civil servant Peter McMahon to death in a sustained assault which saw the 68-year-old's eyes gouged out. Along with her accomplice, one of her other lovers Joseph Collins, 54, Swinhoe wheeled Mr McMahon's body in a suitcase from her home to Collins's flat in Elswick, Newcastle, where they hid the body in his freezer. Sharon Swinhoe, 44, left, was jailed for 25 years today for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Peter McMahon, right . Police found the badly decomposed body some time later. A third boyfriend of Swinhoe's Ronald Douglas, 77, also helped the pair move the body, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Swinhoe plundered Mr McMahon's bank account after his death. All three denied murder during a six week trial, but Swinhoe was jailed for a minumum of 25 years and Collins for a minimum of 20 years after they were found guilty yesterday. Douglas, from Blaydon, Gateshead, admitted conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and was sentenced to four years in jail. Jailing Swinhoe, Mr Justice Globe said that she appeared to show no remorse for the killing, adding: 'You appear to care more about the rats you kept as pets than the man who loved you and asked to marry you and bought you an £1,100 engagement ring. Jailed: Another of Swinhoe's former lovers Joseph Collins, pictured, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the killing . 'Peter McMahon was a well-liked respected, generous, mature man living comfortably on his two pensions in the Newcastle area. 'In common with the two men sitting alongside you Sharon Swinhoe, his downfall was that he fell victim to your charm that has attracted men to you like magnets. 'Ultimately he fell victim to your much more sinister, controlling and violent personality.' More than £2,600 found in her flat after the murder must be repaid to the family, the judge ordered. During the trial, twice-married Mr McMahon was described as being besotted with Swinhoe, who was 24 years his junior. He would buy her presents and she was described by the prosecution as seeing Mr McMahon as a sugar daddy. Prior to his body being discovered in the second-hand chest freezer, Mr McMahon’s son phoned from New Zealand to tell his father he had become a grandfather. Swinhoe answered the call and said he could not come to the phone because he was sleeping - despite it being early evening. David Jeremy QC, defending Collins, said his client’s existence 'consisted of little more than orbiting the life of Sharon Swinhoe'. Mr Justice Globe said Swinhoe and Douglas’s relationship had finished by the time of the murder, but she continued to use him as a taxi service and recruited him to help move the body. Douglas was jailed for four years, down from eight years, on account of his age, and his guilty plea, the judge said. Chilling: Sharon Swinhoe, Joseph Collins, and Ronald Douglas pictured in the lifts at Collins's flat after the murder of Mr McMahon last year . Sentenced: The trio were all jailed for their part in the horrific murder at Newcastle Crown Court today . After the case Detective Chief Inspector Paul Young said: 'Peter McMahon was a decent, hard-working man who was looking forward to becoming a grandfather. 'Swinhoe and Collins targeted him for financial gain, preying on his generosity and then plundering his bank accounts after his death. 'Mr McMahon believed they were his friends, but they brutally murdered him and then conspired with Ronald Douglas to cover up their crime by hiding the body and denying responsibility.' 'You appear to care more about the rats . you kept as pets than the man who loved you and asked to marry you and . bought you an £1,100 engagement ring.' Mr Justice Globe . In a statement, Mr McMahon’s family described Swanhoe as 'cruel, calculated and cold hearted. The statement said: 'He (Mr McMahon) will be greatly missed by his family and friends. 'It is particularly tragic that he not only had his life taken from him, but that these people showed utter disrespect for it afterwards. 'He was also denied the chance to learn he had become a grandfather which he had always dearly wanted. 'We still can’t believe that anybody could be so cruel, calculated and cold hearted against our dad. 'Rest in peace dad.' The family thanked Northumbria Police and the CPS for bringing Mr McMahon's killers to justice. Following the verdict, Gerry Sydenham, head of the Crown Court Unit at CPS North East, said: 'It is clear from the evidence in this case that Swinhoe manipulated Peter McMahon in the same way that she manipulated the two men who would later assist her in his murder and the disposal of his body. 'It is evident that Peter had genuine affection for Swinhoe but she chose to exploit those feelings and, on October 18 last year, she led Peter to believe that he was leaving his home to rekindle their relationship. The truth is that she was leading him to his eventual death. 'After the murder, Swinhoe and Collins showed not a scrap of remorse. 'Their every action from that point was a calculated attempt to evade justice, including their inhuman treatment of Mr McMahon’s remains and the web of lies they told, both to Peter’s family and to police. 'Ultimately, the only thing that they have achieved through their despicable actions is to prolong the suffering of Peter’s family and friends. 'I am pleased with the sentences passed today and I would hope that they give some measure of comfort to those who knew Peter McMahon at what must be a very difficult time for them.'","Sharon Swinhow will serve at least 25 years in jail for killing Peter McMahon .

Boris Johnson's plans for an island airport on the Thames might sound ambitious, but these drawings prove the idea has been at least 80 years in the making. Vintage architects' designs unearthed today show how floating hubs like 'Boris Island', with at least four runways, were already being planned in the 1930s. The Mayor of London has been demanding the grand idea of an island airport made out of landfill with superfast links to London. Brave New York world: This 1931 design for the centre of the Big Apple shows how airport docks should be built for the metropolis . Eye opening: The wonderfully named Charles Clever argued for an airport to be built on London's roofs while in Detroit they argued it should be in top of a City Hall . But it appears pre-Second World War architects had ideas even more dazzling and ahead of their time, which included placing an airport on top of city centre buildings in London. Designers in New York also argued for a huge transport terminal in water, with an airstrip on top and a shipping port below. In Detroit planners suggested a an airport was built in the sky above their City Hall. This month the Mr Johnson underlined his commitment to a futuristic estuary airport, either on the edge of the Thames or right in its heart. Revolutionary: This spinning airport conceived by a French designer was planned so it could sit on the top of any major city, this plan said . Very similar: This one from New York even looks like current plans for an estuary airport in London, while North Beach Airport off Long Island would have had four runways too . His first choice is Sir Norman Foster’s plan for an airport on Kent's Isle of Grain. Mr Johnson says it would be able to support more than 375,000 new jobs by 2050 and add £742billion to the value of goods and services produced in the UK. Planes would fly in over the sea into the four-runway 'Foster Island', which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers and include an international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes. The Boris Island plan, designed by Global firm Gensler, would be artificially created from landfill in the heart of the estuary, and would be two miles north of the Isle of Sheppey. Ferries would link the site to Kent and Essex while a railway bridge could connect it to the mainland. Vision: Foster Island (pictured) on the Isle of Grain has today been backed by the Mayor of London above his own Boris Island plan because of its proximity to London . New favourite idea: Boris has backed the four-runway 'Foster Island' (pictured) in the Thames Estuary airport, which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the Isle of Grain in Kent . Elaborate plan: The Isle of Grain's proposed international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes . The final 'compromise' idea is an enlarged Stansted, as the Mayor is desperate to stop a third runway at Heathrow. He is so bent on preventing it, that he'd like to buy the west London site for £15billion to create a new borough for 250,000 residents. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'The UK needs to take a bolder approach than ever before to respond to our shortage of world-class hub airport capacity. And a four runway hub airport in either the outer or inner estuary or at Stansted is both credible and deliverable. It is necessary to ensure that London and the UK can continue to compete at the highest level in the world.'","Designs from 80 years ago reveal ideas for revolutionary airports .

A spoof sculpture trail which includes such highlights as an abandoned bath and a derelict house has been created to poke fun at art critics. A leaflet promoting the fictitious Colne Valley Sculpture Trail near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, showcases 12 eyesores which have supposedly been produced by modern artists. The blurb which goes along with each piece mocks the buzzwords favoured by certain critics and artists. 'Wash Behind the Ears': A bathtub features in a spoof artwork trail that mocks the conventions and pretensions of the world of modern art . The Colne Valley Sculpture Trail, described as a 'three-mile walk of shame', says this building is a 'house of recent construction whose sole purpose from the outset was to be derelict' The abandoned bath is supposedly a piece called 'Wash Behind the Ears', and is described as dealing with 'the contradictory concepts of filth and cleanliness, typically by placing a familiar bathroom item in a countryside setting'. It continues: 'Here, bathtub is rendered repugnant by dirt, brambles, and a crude gash where the hot tap should be'. A section of collapsed drystone wall titled Wall/Fall/Wall is supposedly the work of Karen Braithwaite who built it then destroyed some of it 'with some violence'. An 'artwork' by Pena Mosteiro called Wound Series 38: Cut 5. 'Mosteiro is a member of Portugal’s 'Arte Scalpele' movement, whose members inflict careful damage on plants and animals at early stages of their development. A small cut made in a sycamore sapling has grown to become the disturbing and almost threatening presence we see today - yet in counterpoint its soft hues and curves are surprisingly tender' 'Filled Arch' by Karen Braithwaite is described as a 'delicate interplay of precariousness and balance'. The artist comments: 'I am interested less in the wall, and more the area between the sky and the ground' Bjorn Starstrup's 'Longitudinal Torsion with Radials'. 'Here, the twists in the main section juxtapose the concepts of flow and rigidity, but the work also carries associations of pain, emphasised by the carefully entangled barbed wire and nettles' It continues: 'The resulting piece suggests a sense of bereavement, the turf above almost seeming to weep.' The leaflet which can be seen on the mapfodder.com website is a deliberate attempt to mock art gallery pomposity, but features a real-life three mile section of Pennines countryside. Its anonymous creator told the Yorkshire Post: 'I liked the idea of printing the trail as a tourism leaflet, and leaving it lying about for people to pick up thinking it's genuine, and gradually get the joke, and having no idea who did it or why.' Imran Choudray's (Re) Birth: 'A traditional building of significant visual appeal appears to be giving . birth to a modern concrete monstrosity, destroying itself in the process' The Pastoral Krew's Country Scene: Lake: 'The Pastoral Krew, (whose identity, or identities, remain unknown), transport the techniques of urban art into a countryside setting, creating pieces of surprising harmony and tranquility' The author said good feedback had been received, adding: 'My favourite thing I came across was somebody's blog, which, as far as I can tell, showed that they had walked the trail believing the 'sculptures' to be genuine works of art.' The author added: 'My advice to people is if they want to do the walk, do it asap because the 'sculptures' could disappear at any time. 'My dream would be to have a preservation order put on the lot of them.' Angela Paradina - Movable Border: 'In her second work, the border itself is of a more conventional form - a simple, circular metal fence- yet the area it encloses appears to be no different to its surrounding' John Hubert Diamond - Shrine To Myself: 'Diamond’s strict Methodist upbringing has found its expression in this courageous piece. When this piece was completed, the artist spent eight weeks permanently residing inside, sustained only by food and drink offered by passers-by' Karen Braithwaite - Wall Fragment: 'A short section of wall mysteriously emerges from, then disappears back into, a grass bank. This seemingly futile gesture is, according to the artist, ""intended to symbolise the pointlessness of all human endeavour""' Angela Paradina- Impermanent Border. The artist's work 'both mocks and question the concept of a border. 'She has used a random selection of found panels to create a clear border - yet has simultaneously subverted its implied permanence by its ramshackle and temporary appearance'","The leaflet promotes the made-up Colne Valley Sculpture Trail .

The Match of the Day presenter has discovered his great, great, great grandfather, James Pratt, was jailed in the 1800s for poaching birds to feed his eight children. James served his time in jail in Leicester which included six months for stealing chickens. The football legend made the discovery while filming BBC1's Who Do You Think You Are? According to The Sunday People, the father-of-four said 'Most of us would do anything for our children to keep them well, to keep them fed. He had no choice. He must have been desperate. You can understand that.' Lineker, who played for Leicester City, Everton, Barcelona and Spurs, returned to his old stomping ground of Leicester in January to film scenes for the history show. He joins a long list of celebrities who have taken part in the programme which traces their family trees to discover surprises from their past. Nigel Havers, broadcaster John Simpson, The Apprentice’s Nick Hewer, singer Marianne Faithfull, actresses Una Stubbs, Minnie Driver and Lesley Sharp, and EastEnders star Nitin Ganatra – agreed to open up their lives for the cameras for this series, and the surprising revelations come thick and fast.

Nigel Havers talks of how even he assumed that he was super-posh and came from an eminently connected family. While his father was a barrister and MP who served under Margaret Thatcher, his grandfather was a judge and a rather notorious one. He earned his place in the history books for being the last British judge to sentence a woman to  be hanged, having presided over the trial of Ruth Ellis.

Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said members could vote on whether unions should be allowed to hold around a third of the votes in leadership contests . Unions have donated £120million to Labour since the Electoral Commission’s online records began in 2001. Nearly £24million has been donated since Ed Miliband became leader three years ago. It also emerged that unions could be stripped of their voting rights in Labour leadership contests. Ed Miliband is preparing for a showdown at a special spring conference to decide how far to modernise the party’s links with the unions, following claims officials rigged votes in battles to select parliamentary candidates. Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan revealed how members could be asked to decide whether the unions should continue to hold around a third of the votes in leadership contests – a mechanism which handed Mr Miliband victory in 2010. It came as the extent of the party’s reliance on money from the unions was exposed, underlining how difficult it will be for Mr Miliband to reform links without bankrupting the party. According to analysis of Electoral Commission registers, unions have poured £120million into supporting Labour since records began in 2001. Labour was thrown into turmoil over the selection of a candidate to succeed its former MP – the now independent Eric Joyce – in the Scottish seat of Falkirk after he was caught in a Commons bar brawl. Labour asked police to investigate allegations that Unite tried to stuff the constituency party with 100 members, paying their subscriptions for them. However, officers last week decided there were ‘insufficient grounds’ to launch a criminal probe. Separately, the Metropolitan Police are looking at the role of unions in the selection battles in two London seats, Lewisham Deptford and Ilford North. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show yesterday, Mr Khan said it was a ‘good question’ whether unions should continue to hold 30 per cent of the votes in Labour’s electoral college. Aides to Mr Miliband had previously said that the electoral college – which broadly carves up voting rights into three groups Labour MPs, peers and MEPs, affiliated trade union members and ordinary members –  would stay the same in leadership contests. Mr Miliband and his office have received nearly £170,000, with an astonishing £118,190 from Unite the super-union and its predecessors. All full members of the shadow cabinet have been given funds since 2001. Only four individuals, including defence spokesman Jim Murphy, have not received anything from Unite or its predecessors, Amicus and the Transport and General Workers’ Union, which merged to form the super-union in 2007. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry has been one of the big winners receiving £50,519 in total with £15,700 from Unite. Four out of five Labour MPs have received donations from unions. Support includes cash donations, funding research, travel and advertising. Current Labour MPs have secured on average £11,000 from the unions. Almost half came from Unite or its predecessors. Mr Miliband himself was propelled to the leadership by union votes, beating his brother David who was the favourite among rank and file members. Mr Khan said Labour’s general secretary Lord Collins, a former assistant general secretary of Unite who was the architect behind its transformation into a super-union, will examine the unions’ voting rights. He added: ‘One of the things that Ray Collins is looking at is the knock-on consequence of [the] changes that Ed Miliband announced. For example, it may lead to a change to how we elect our leader.’ One of the planned reforms announced by Mr Miliband is making union members ‘opt in’ to paying a £3 levy to the Labour Party, rather than automatically deducting it from them. Mr Khan said: ‘We think in a modern, vibrant relationship between trade unions and the Labour Party you should have a choice to opt in whether your dues are paid towards the party.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband could struggle to balance reassessing the party's relationship with the unions with avoiding bankrupting the party . He added: ‘We hope trade unions will see the strength in the option of allowing their members to opt in. We want them to have a greater say in policy making, in selecting candidates, in how they fund the party, in the direction of the party to make us more electable come May 2015,’ he said. He urged Mr Miliband to follow the lead of Barack Obama, whose latest campaign was bankrolled by small donations from individuals, as well as French socialists who used similar tactics. He admitted that Labour would lose millions of pounds as a result, but said it was no longer right to rely on huge donations from hedge funds, bankers or trade unions. He said: ‘We think there should be a cap of £5,000 so nobody can contribute more than that to any political party.’ Lord Collins will produce a consultation document this autumn at the party conference. Members will then debate it ahead of the special conference, when they will vote on whether to approve it. But trade unions will still hold half the votes at that conference, casting doubt on whether Mr Miliband will be able to loosen their grip on the party.","More than £24million donated since Miliband took the top job .

Freebie-loving MPs have cashed in on corporate hospitality, enjoying junkets worth £120,000 in the past year. As well as receiving free tickets to major sporting events, they were also treated to pheasant shooting weekends, seats at awards ceremonies and even the use of a Jaguar. Commons Speaker, John Bercow, a keen tennis fan, was at Queen’s tennis club to see Andy Murray win the Aegon Championship on June 16. Mr Bercow registered the value of the seat as £1,070. He was also given two Centre Court tickets to Wimbledon worth £148 for June 29 by the Lawn Tennis Association. Harriet Harman, Labour’s deputy leader, received two tickets to Wimbledon in the Royal Box and lunch for two. The £2,790 bill was picked up by the All England Club. In total, 77 MPs received freebies last year, according to the register. Former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke shared a £6,346 trip to the British Grand Prix at Silverstone with Tory MPs Ben Wallace and Mark Garnier and Labour’s Peter Hain and Richard Burden. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson took his wife to Royal Ascot as a guest of online gambling firm Betfair, which paid the £1,000 cost. Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna was given tickets worth £3,060 to the Baftas and Mobo awards, while Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright was loaned a Jaguar XRG so he could go for a spin. The gift was worth £790. Tory MPs Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Edward Garnier, Graham Brady, Bill Wiggin, Sir Gerald Howarth and Simon Reevell enjoyed a lavish shooting weekend at Catton Hall estate in Derbyshire at a cost of around £800 each, paid by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation. Mr Garnier also accepted tickets to the Chelsea Flower Show from tobacco giant JTI.

Another Tory, Nigel Adams, received two tickets to the Grand National at Aintree worth £900, paid for by John Smith’s brewery, while Labour’s Steve Rotherham enjoyed hospitality there worth £800 . Labour’s Nia Griffith and Huw Irranca-Davies and Tory John Penrose were guests at Six Nations Rugby matches. Although the MPs have not broken any rules, provided the hospitality was declared in their register of interests, the junkets dismayed campaigners. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Anyone who feels their MP has spent excessive time living it up at someone else’s expense can remember it when they vote.’ Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said: ‘MPs should not be living the high life while workers struggle.'","77 MPs enjoyed hospitality at various high-profile and sought-after events .

A Texas Rangers player who claimed he was 'sucker-punched' in Cleveland on Thursday night has been accused of making the whole episode up. Reliever Tanner Scheppers claims he was hit in the face while he was on his way to dinner near the team's hotel in the city's downtown area. But after the report that Scheppers was 'sucker-punched' while innocently out for dinner did the rounds, another, less flattering report began to emerge. According to a local publication, the pitcher wasn't quite the blameless victim of random violence he made himself out to be. Sucker-punched: Tanner Scheppers is suffering a black eye and cuts after he was punched in what was either a bar brawl or an act of random violence . Original reports stated the the 26-year-old was on his way to dinner near his hotel when a group of young men accosted him and knocked hom to the ground. Scheppers suffered a black eye and cuts to his nose and couldn't play in the scheduled game. '[It was] one of those freak things,' Scheppers told the Star-Telegram. 'I was just getting food and was blindsided... It's something you don't want to be talking about. You want to be talking about baseball things.' Scheppers said he didn't retaliate and that the men ran after he fell to the ground. Police were aware of the situation, but according to Scheppers, they advised against filing a police report because 'it was unlikely that anybody would be apprehended,' according to the Dallas News. 'They said it happens a lot, actually,' said Scheeppers told the paper. However, according to a statement by police information officer Sergeant Sammy Morris, that's not exactly how officers remember the incident. 'The preliminary investigation reveals that on Friday, July 26, at approximately 2:30am Texas Ranger pitcher Tanner Scheppers was involved in a physical altercation at Panini’s Bar located on W. 6th Street,' reads the statement. Curve-ball: After Scheppers' version of events did the rounds, a new story has emerged with Scheppers cast as the instigator rather than the innocent victim he made himself out to be . It goes on to say that the 911 call was made by Downtown Alliance workers. 'Once on scene officers attempted to get information from Scheppers for a report however, he refused to provide information and refused to make a police report. Further, officers called for EMS and he refused medical attention and EMS was disregarded. The officers then conveyed Scheppers and another male to the Ranger’s team hotel.' If 2:30am seems a strange time to be heading out for dinner, then further muddying the waters are comments from a witness who says Scheppers was the instigator of a bar brawl. 'He lost a bar fight,' the witness told Scene. According to the witness, six-foot-four-inch-tall Scheppers was with fellow Rangers Joe Nathan, A.J. Pierzynski and 'a bunch of girls'. Street fighting man: The altercation took place here outside Panini's on West 6th St in Cleveland, where a witness says Scheppers had '10 chances' to walk away before being punched . He had been exchanging insults with a group of men before the physical altercation took place. 'He had 10 chances to walk away before this happened,' said the witness. Scheppers was unable to play in the game against local team the Indians on Friday. In light of this new information, Dallas News reports that the Rangers released a statement saying the team's managers plan to look into the matter. 'Following today’s reports, the Texas Rangers are in the process of investigating the incident involving Tanner Scheppers on Thursday night,' the statement said. 'The club has been in contact with officials from the Cleveland Police Department and the Cleveland Indians. Until our investigation is complete, no one from the organization will have any further comment on this matter.' Tanner Scheppers has pitched 46.2 innings this season with a 1.74 ERA and 33 hits given up.","Texas Rangers pitcher Tanner Scheppers said he was a victim of random violence in Cleveland Thursday .

A grandmother was run over and killed by her devoted husband in a tragic accident outside their home. Mavis Wood, 90, was knocked down on the couple’s driveway when her husband Kenneth, 86, reversed into her by mistake. Mrs Wood's daughter, Lynda Pugh, 68, was also injured as she tried to push her mother out of the way. Mavis Wood, 90, was run over and killed by her devoted husband Kenneth, 86, in a tragic accident at their Huddersfield home . Mr Wood was trying to park his Nissan Micra in the garage of the couple's home in Lepton, Huddersfield, on Monday and did not realise the pair were behind him. Mrs Wood was struck by the car and hit her head, dying in hospital shortly afterwards. Her husband, who used to work for the electricity board, was yesterday said to be ‘devastated’ at the loss of his wife of four decades. His brother James Wood, 84, said: ‘It’s been a big shock for him and for all of us, especially Mavis’s children. He has a lot of friends so I hope they are helping him through it. ‘Ken is devastated. He has probably been through the mill going over and over it. They were a very close couple.’ A 'devastated' Mr Wood was seen at home following last Monday's accident . It is understood the couple had just returned from Tesco and unloaded their shopping before the accident. James Wood said his brother was reversing into his garage, using his side mirror to check how near to the wall he was. Neighbours rushed to help Mrs Wood and gave first aid until paramedics arrived. She was taken to hospital but died a short time later. Mr Wood's brother added: ‘Ken is a good driver and always has been. I think if he wasn’t capable anymore or knew he couldn’t see properly that he would have given up driving a long time ago. ‘This is something that could have happened to anyone, it was pure accident and nothing to do with his driving abilities.’ Brian and Joan Jackson, who have been neighbours of the Woods for more than three decades, said Mavis was a ‘lovely lady’. Mr Jackson added: ‘She was very much a hardy person and active for her age. ‘Mavis has a hip operation fairly recently but that didn’t stop her getting out.’ Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘She was very friendly and we are all very sad at what happened. ‘It’s absolutely dreadful and my heart goes out to Ken.’ The pair had been devoted to each other ever since they married in 1975, after Mrs Wood’s first husband Leslie died. Mrs Wood was already a mother-of-two at the time. She also leaves three grown-up grandchildren. The tragedy happened at the couple's Huddersfield home, where neighbours paid tribute to a 'lovely woman' Friends said the pair remained very active even though Mrs Wood fractured her hip three years ago. Mr Wood plays bowls at Almondbury Bowling Club in Huddersfield and has been president of the local bowling association. His brother’s wife Sylvia Wood, 76, said: ‘Mavis was [...] full of spirit and loved her family.’ A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘A file on the tragedy has now been passed to the West Yorkshire Coroner’s office and inquest will be heard at a later date yet to be determined.’","Mavis Wood was knocked down on driveway after arriving home from Tesco .

A woman who shot her lover has beaten an attempted murder rap and avoided years of jail time after her lovelorn partner refused to testify against her. Evelyn Barnave, 43, of Brooklyn was slapped on the wrist with an assault conviction Monday, skirting what had been a potential seven years in jail. But while love may have conquered the penal system, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Matthew D’Emic threw cold water on the fiery relationship when he told boyfriend turned gunshot victim Randolph Costa to stay away from Barnave for a full year. Happier times: Randolph Costa, right, was shot in the head by lover Evelyn Barnave, left, in 2011 . The New York Post reports that Justice D'Emic forbade Costa from contacting the shooter he loves in any way, be it by email, voice calls, or text messages. While Costa implored the judge at Monday's sentencing, via Barnave's attorney Paul Hirsh, to be allowed to address the court in an effort to garner his lover a light sentence, his request was denied. It was Justice D'Emic's belief that, in taking their armed domestic conflict into the outside world, the couple had endangered the greater community and should therefor be kept apart. Times change: Barnave is pictured here with lawyer Paul Hirsh during her trial for shooting her lover in the head at close range in the Brooklyn neighborhood in 2011 . 'The problem that I have is that we have a situation here where these two parties have a tumultuous relationship and if it stayed between these two that would be one thing,' Justice D’Emic said. Barnave was facing an attempted murder charge for shooting Costa in 2011. After a fight over a joint checking account, Barnave shot Costa at close range through the window of her car in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn on January 11 of that year. 59-year-old Costa initially pointed the finger at his girlfriend, but then refused to cooperate with prosecutors in her trial at Brooklyn . Supreme Court despite a fight that left him with a bullet in his spine. Hot headed: Barnave's prosecutors weren't able to make attempted murder charges stick after Costa refused to testify despite having had a bullet lodged in his spine from their spat . Change of heart: Costa pointed the finger at Barnave initially but then refused to testify. Here, he holds a photo of the two of them . Meanwhile, Barnave insisted the whole . thing was an accident and the prosecution in her case was left unable to . make the attempted murder charge stick. Barnave was sentenced for the lesser charge of reckless assault last month. But that didn't mean the judge was going to let the lovebirds go celebrate Barnave's freedom. 'This . spilled out into the streets of Brooklyn where an innocent person could . have gotten hurt,' explained the judge as he handed down his stay-away . order. 'I love this man . and he loves me,' an emotional Barnave told the judge. 'I have a family . and I have never hurt anybody or done anything malicious to anybody in . my life.' Sentenced: Barnave, pictured here before she was acquitted of attempted murder, was convicted on the lesser charge of assault and handed 5 years probation. The judge also ordered her to stay away from Costa for a year . Barnave and Costa met about five years ago on a Subway platform. In June, when Costa suddenly decided he wouldn't testify, he said it was because he hoped they would get married one day. Now, despite the judge's order, Costa told the Post he was satisfied with the ruling. 'I’m . not disappointed that we can’t see each other,' Costa said. 'I’m just . relieved that she didn’t get jail time. It could have been a lot worse.' Barnave thanked the judge for the sentence that allows her to avoid jail. 'I just want to thank you judge,' she said. 'It was an accident.' To the press, Barnave would only say, 'It's fine,' before she left the court without the man she loves. Justice D'Emic said he would be willing to revisit the stay-away order in a year.","Evelyn Barnave, 43, shot Randolph Costa, 59, at close range in 2011 .

Sacha Mullins, 59, has lost her fight to get more money from her ex-husband - 21 years after they divorced . A financial agony aunt left penniless and on the brink of homelessness has lost her fight to get more money from the man she divorced two decades ago. Sacha Mullins, 59, used to advise women's magazine readers about how to manage their money but found herself destitute only months after ex-husband Peter Mullins sold his business for £2.6million. The couple had been divorced for 'longer than most people are married', the Court of Appeal heard. Mr Mullins had given his wife £24,000-a-year since their 1992 divorce for living costs and to help bring up their children. But a judge ruled that the couple should sever their financial ties after Mr Mullins, also 59, sold his wealth management business last year. Michael Horowitz QC decided that Mrs Mullins, who now runs a not-for-profit education through arts business, should receive her future maintenance as a £300,000 lump sum in instalments. Her appeal against the judge's decision was today rejected at the Royal Courts of Justice. Lord Justice Patten said: 'There should be a clean break - they . have been divorced longer than most people are married. 'This couple have . got to put an end to this war. They have got to get on with their . lives. He continued: 'When this marriage . ended, there was nothing, all of the husband’s wealth was built up again . post-separation... She can’t expect to enjoy the standard of living . which she would have had if they had stayed married.' Mrs Mullins' barrister Oriel Hinds accused Mr Mullins of not fully disclosing what he is worth and said his client would be left with almost nothing to live on before her next payment arrives next year. The court heard that, as the lump sum is to be paid in instalments, Mrs Mullins' maintenance stands at only five pence a year before her money arrives. She faces losing her Virginia Quays home in London's Docklands, Mr Hinds said, and would be left with almost nothing to live on after paying off mortgage arrears. Mr Hinds said that Judge Horowitz's original ruling had effectively asked Mrs Mullins to live on about £50-a-week in the meantime. 'What is she supposed to live on in these intervening months?' Mr Hinds asked the court. 'The judge knew she was facing . repossession proceedings, he had seen the paperwork. She is likely to . lose her property and that is her home.' Mrs Mullins her ex-husband lived together for a decade, but were married for only a few years before they were divorced in 1992. The businessman, of Hanley Castle, near Great Malvern, turned his financial services business, Bradley Stuart into a success following the divorce, counting the Ritz among its clients. For years, he made payments to make sure that his ex had enough money to live on and to pay towards their children’s upkeep and school fees. But, with the sale of his business looming, Judge Horowitz consolidated her future payments into the £300,000 lump sum, to be paid in three instalments, over two years, at each stage of the sale. At the Court of Appeal, Mr Hinds argued that Judge Horowitz’s assessment of how much Mrs Mullins should get was flawed, since nobody knew exactly what her ex-husband is now worth. A judge at the Court of Appeal today upheld last year's decision to restrict Mrs Mullins's maintenance to a £300,000 lump sum . He had admitted an approximate £230,000-a-year income, but had made provision for a tax bill of almost £200,000, suggesting his true income was much higher than that, the barrister said. A sales agreement showed details of his corporate clients, but did not disclose anything about his private clients, which could have provided him with another £500,000-a-year in income, he claimed. 'Mr Mullins continually delayed and delayed and delayed. He downright refused to - or just didn’t - produce any of the details of the assets held jointly with his partner. 'That information just isn’t available,' Mr Hinds said. 'It was always the appellant’s case that there was not full disclosure by her ex-husband. 'So, when the judge made a decision about what he could or could not afford, he didn’t have a clear picture of what Mr Mullins was worth.' Giving judgment, Lord Justice Patten refused permission for an appeal against the amount Mrs Mullins will eventually get, but granted leave to appeal the way that the money is to be paid. He continued: 'The wife has been left in the position under his order that she is required, in effect, to subsist throughout the remainder of this year with virtually no income at all. 'I think that it is at least reasonably arguable that that involves an exercise of discretion which doesn’t adequately take into account the unfairness to the wife.' Mr Mullins was neither present, nor represented, during the Appeal Court hearing. No date was set for the full hearing of his ex-wife’s appeal.","Sacha Mullins and Peter Mullins, both 59, ended their marriage in 1992 .

A mother and son have been jailed for persistent and appalling neglect of animals at their family-run rescue centre. Angela Russell, 44, and Robert Russell, 25, were today sentenced to 26 weeks at Oxford Magistrates’ Court, after they were convicted of 16 charges under the Animal Welfare Act. The court heard a long list of abuse and suffering which had been inflicted on animals including dogs, rabbits, puppies, horses, ponies and goats  at Crunchy’s Animal Rescue Centre at Longworth, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Angela Russell, pictured left, and her son Robert Russell were today jailed for their role in appalling animal neglect at their rescue centre in Oxfordshire . District Judge Timothy Pattinson listed a catalogue of neglect infliced on animals living in their own dirt: horses with overgrown hooves and dogs living in their own faeces . While sentencing District Judge Timothy Pattinson said: 'The . images which showed the suffering and appalling conditions endured by . those animals will be remembered by everyone who saw them for a very . long time. 'I’m thinking in particular of the . horses crippled by overgrown hooves, the horse trying to eat out of a . wheelie bin, the Staffordshire bull terrier in a cage which was almost . obscured by an enormous pile of faeces and the golden retriever, . Winston, delivered to you in perfect health, which was almost killed by . you as a result of starvation and neglect. 'If not for this prosecution by the RSPCA those animals would be continuing to suffer and, I suspect, die.' Mother and son were also banned from keeping animals for the rest of their lives. The RSPCA had issued warnings to the Russells, who ran the centre as a registered charity, as early as April 2010, urging an improvement in conditions on the plot . 78 animals were seized by the RSPCA along with the bodies of a horse and a rabbit. The picture shows aerial of Crunchys animal rescue . RSPCA officers had swooped on the site in January 2012 and welfare workers had described the scenario as the worst they had ever seen. Sentencing Angela Russell to the . maximum term allowed, the judge told . her he believed her to have been 'the prime mover' in the neglect. 'There is no way an animal lover could allow such profound neglect of this type,' he added. Four other family members were convicted of the charges. Mrs Russell’s elderly father Frederick Russell, 81, received a 26-week jail term, suspended for 18 months due to his age and was disqualified from keeping animals for life. He was also ordered to pay £1,000 . pounds in court costs plus a £80 pound victim surcharge. Daughters Louise, 22, and Kirsty Russell, 20, and niece Abigail McHugh, 21, were convicted of all of the charges. The RSPCA had issued warnings, but eventually swooped on the centre in January last year. Pictured: RSPCA Inspector Kirsty Withnall . Louise, was given a 12-week prison term, suspended for 18 months, placed under a three-month curfew and ordered to pay £1,080 in costs and surcharge. Wheelchair-user Kirsty Russell, was placed under a four-month curfew banned from keeping . animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £1,060 in costs and . surcharge. Abigail received 150 hours of unpaid work over 12 months and was told to pay £1,060 in costs and surcharge. All six were convicted after a three-week trial back in June when the court heard that the family members, who lived on the site, had played a greater or lesser role in its . operation. Animals at the centre had not been given enough food or water and were kept in inadequate accommodation or their enclosures were deep in their own waste. They were also found in poor health with little or no evidence of any veterinary care having been provided. A shih-tsu blinded by an eye condition had to be put down and a dead horse was found hidden under an old pick-up roof, in what the court accepted was an attempt to conceal it before its secret burial nearby. The dog Winston's owners, James and Sandra Luker, were in court to hear the sentences handed down to the family they had paid to board their animals, four dogs, two cats and a rabbit during a house move. Only two of their pets returned home. The RSPCA had issued warnings to the . Russells, who ran the centre as a registered charity, as early as April . 2010, urging an improvement in conditions on the plot. But when animal welfare officers . raided the site they found 'a horse eating from a . wheelie bin', 'dogs in cages of their own faeces' and 'horses with . hooves that hadn't been cut in three years', according to RSPCA . Inspector Kirsty Withnall. In all, 80 animals were seized, . although some are still 'missing, presumed dead', the judge said, while . the RSPCA believes some were removed from the site without its knowledge . over the course of its three-day search of the large rescue centre. On the day the site was raided, Robert Russell was found digging a grave for a horse which had died on the property. Once exposed, the family, particularly Mrs Russell, made a series of allegation against the RSPCA, and senior inspector Kirsty Withnall. She even alleged the charity had arrived with the faeces and urine and covered the site in it to discredit her. Mr Pattinson said he found those claims to be malicious. He told the family there were aggravating factors to their crimes. 'All of you inflicted this suffering in the name of a charity - a rescue centre, a sanctuary. Nothing could be further from the truth. 'You ignored advice and warnings given by the RSPCA. 'You received donations from the public, including a vehicle. In my view that money did not go towards looking after those animals.' He added nobody could fail to have been moved by an RSPCA video and photographs of the 'appalling' conditions at the site, which were shown in evidence. 'These images will be remembered by everyone who saw them for a very long time.' The Russells all lived at the charity in Oxfordshire, while Miss McHugh was from Pendennis Road, Swindon. Following sentencing RSPCA Inspector Withnall said: 'I’m delighted with the result, very pleased that the main defendants have been disqualified for life, meaning no other animals will suffer at their hands. 'The allegations they have made against the RSPCA and witnesses have been outrageous and I’m glad the judge saw through their lies.' The case is believed to have cost the charity £165,000 to prosecute. Nick White, of World Horse Welfare, also welcomed the outcome, saying: 'It sends out a strong message to other people with animals in their care to ensure their needs are met.' The judge said it was likely that many of the animals would be dead without the RSPCA's intervention. He said the case had several aggravating factors, with the Russells ignoring animal inspectors' repeated advice to improve conditions, evidence they had been selling kittens, puppies and rabbits for commercial gain, and the revelation the Russells had been receiving public donations to buy food, bedding and pay the site's overheads. Mr Pattinson added: 'In short, you exploited the animals and exploited the public - especially those people who made donations. 'That money clearly did not go towards looking after these animals.' Defending Angela Russell, Mr Patrick Duffy said his client was an animal lover and had not set out to neglect those in her care. She had been overwhelmed by the work she had, particularly given her poor health, he said. 'She is obese, has sores on her legs, suffers from diabetes and depression,' he told Oxford Magistrates Court. He also said she suffered from amnesia and 'confused the past and present'. 'She is now an elective mute and I have not been able to take instructions,' he said. Rebecca Vanstone, for Mrs Russell's son Robert, said her client had been taken out of school aged 14, and home-schooled by his mother and had no qualifications to his name. 'He was somewhat in the sway of his mother - this was her project,' she said. However, the judge said 'while not necessarily a prime mover' Russell had taken visitors around the site and taken an active role in its running. Following today's verdict, Mrs Russell's father Frederick Russell, spoke outside court saying he was 'really cross' about his sentence, denying he had had any involvement in the site's day-to-day operation. He added: 'I accept it (Crunchy's) should have been closed down a long time before - to be honest, I didn't realise what was going on.' Meanwhile, RSPCA Inspector Kirsty Withnall, who had led the action against the site, said she was pleased with the judge's sentences. 'We had given them warnings and offered them appropriate advice,' she said.

With the launch of its first UK boutique just months away, British fans of American fashion brand J.Crew will no longer be forced to rely on its website for their fashion fix. But while you won't have to go far to get your hands on the brand loved by Michelle Obama, Anna Wintour and Beyonce among others, you'll be paying through the nose for the privilege. And it isn't just J.Crew that is charging British shoppers more than their American counterparts. Other US brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Ralph Lauren and American Apparel are doing it too. Expensive: Getting your J.Crew fashion fix in the UK costs up to 40 per cent more than it does in the USA . Fans: American Vogue editor Anna Wintour and First Lady Michelle Obama are fans of the over-charging brand . According to the Sunday Times, which commissioned the study, the result is that buying American brands in Britain costs up to 50 per cent more than it would in the US. At J.Crew, for example, a women's Collection cashmere button-back sweater costs $259.12 (£169.80) if you're a customer in New York. British buyers, however, pay £238.25 - a mark-up of a staggering 40 per cent. Similarly, at American Apparel, you'll find a leather drawstring backpack on sale for £115 in the UK but just £89.18 in the US. At Abercrombie & Fitch meanwhile, the brand's practice of charging British customers the same price in pounds that Americans pay in dollars has resulted in mark-ups of 50 per cent or more. Shocking: Abercrombie & Fitch make UK buyers pay the dollar price but in pounds - a 50% mark-up . High price: Crocs Inc charge up to a third more for their rubber footwear on this side of the Atlantic . The Macey dress, for example, costs $98 (£64.22) at checkout on the brand's US website but sells for £98 including delivery on the British equivalent - a huge price hike of 53 per cent. J.Crew say the higher costs take into account 'the inescapable fact that costs in the UK are significantly higher than in the US'. But not everyone is convinced by their explanation, including Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, who said: 'For some reason, American companies seem to think that the British public are able to pay a lot more than American consumers. 'It certainly seems very unfair. In this economic crisis some people are having a bad time but others are still prepared to pay more for designer brands - and the US is cashing in on that market.'

JK Rowling spoke yesterday of her ‘anger’ after discovering that a lawyer at a firm that represents her had leaked the fact she had published a detective thriller under a false name. It was revealed last weekend that the Harry Potter author had written the novel, The Cuckoo’s Calling, under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. She was exposed after Jude Callegari, a mother-of-two, posted a message on Twitter saying it was not a first-time work and that JK Rowling, 47, was the real author. Entertainment legal firm Russells apologised 'unreservedly' yesterday after one of its partners was traced as the source of the leak that saw JK Rowling (left) being unmasked when she published detective book The Cuckoo's Calling under a false name . Finished copies of The Cuckoo's Calling come off the print line today at Clays Ltd in Bungay, Suffolk . The novel, The Cuckoo's Calling, which was released in April, tells the story of Cormoran Strike, a war veteran turned private eye, who is investigating the death of a model . When asked by a journalist how she ‘knew for sure’, Mrs Callegari responded, saying ‘I just know’ before deleting her tweets. The book, which had sold only 1,500 . copies and was languishing at 4,709 in Amazon’s bestsellers list . immediately shot to the top of the chart. It led to claims that the revelation . had been a marketing ploy to boost interest in The Cuckoo’s Calling, . which tells the story of Cormoran Strike, a war veteran turned private . eye, who is investigating the death of a model. A publisher admitted earlier this week she turned down The Cuckoo’s Calling after finding it 'perfectly decent but quiet'. Kate . Mills, fiction editor at Orion Publishing, said she couldn't see a USP . for the crime novel, submitted to her by 'first-time author Robert . Galbraith', in a 'tough' market. Unluckily . for her it turns out there was one, and now sales of the book, which . had had a lukewarm reception originally, are soaring. The . book, which had sold a modest 1,500 copies and was languishing at 4,709 . in Amazon's bestsellers list until last week, shot up 5,000 places to . the top of the chart after its true author was revealed. Confessing . that she wrote the book, published three months ago, Miss Rowling said: . ‘I had hoped to keep this secret a little longer because being Robert . Galbraith has been such a liberating experience. ‘It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name.’ Miss Rowling’s publishers have now . reprinted 140,000 copies of her crime debut to meet demand. But she has . spent the last four days trying to discover how her secret had been . passed to Mrs Callegari, a woman she has never met. Now the legal firm, Russells, has . apologised ‘unreservedly’ after one of its partners, Chris Gossage, was . identified as the source of the leak. He had revealed the true identity of . Robert Galbraith to Mrs Callegari – his wife’s best friend – during a . ‘private conversation’. Miss Rowling said in a statement: ‘I have today discovered how the leak about Robert’s true identity occurred. ‘A tiny number of people knew my . pseudonym and it has not been pleasant to wonder for days how a woman . whom I had never heard of prior to Sunday night could have found out . something that many of my oldest friends did not know. ‘To say that I am disappointed is an . understatement. I had assumed that I could expect total confidentiality . from Russells, a reputable professional firm, and I feel very angry that . my trust turned out to be misplaced.’ The London law firm said in a . statement: ‘We, Russells Solicitors, apologise unreservedly for the . disclosure caused by one of our partners, Chris Gossage, in revealing to . his wife’s best friend, Judith Callegari, during a private conversation . that the true identity of Robert Galbraith was in fact JK Rowling. ‘Whilst accepting his own culpability, the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he trusted implicitly. ‘On becoming aware of the circumstances, we immediately notified JK Rowling’s agent. ‘We can confirm that this leak was not . part of any marketing plan and that neither JK Rowling, her agent nor . publishers were in any way involved.’ The publisher of The Cuckoo’s Calling . had claimed it was written by a former plain clothes Royal Military . Police investigator using the pen-name of Galbraith. But literary sleuths would have . noticed that the ‘novice’ writer shared an agent with Miss Rowling. And . the novel was published by Sphere, part of publisher Little, Brown Book . Group, which released Miss Rowling’s first book for adults, The Casual . Vacancy, last year. Readers had noted on social networking sites how well the ‘male’ author had described women’s clothes. A worker packs finished copies of The Cuckoo's Calling onto a shipping pallet today . The Cuckoo’s Calling had received rave . reviews, with Val McDermid, author of The Wire In The Blood, saying it . reminded her ‘why I fell in love with crime writing in the first place’. Miss Rowling had said it had been . ‘wonderful’ to publish for once without hype or expectation and to get . feedback under a different name even if that meant some publishers . rejected her work. Last night there was no answer from . the intercom at Mrs Callegari’s large detached home in Claygate, Surrey. Mr Gossage was not available for comment. Miss Rowling has hinted that a sequel . will appear to the crime novel she wrote as Robert Galbraith. She wrote: . ‘Robert fully intends to keep writing the series, although he will . probably continue to turn down personal appearances.’ And despite her anger she has even . signed ‘a few copies’ of her detective novel as ‘Robert Galbraith’, . according to her publicist Nicky Stonehill. When she began publishing her Harry . Potter novels Miss Rowling decided to use her initials rather than her . first name, Joanne, because she feared that boys would not want to read a . book by a woman author.","Harry Potter writer used pen name Robert Galbraith for detective thriller The Cuckoo's Calling .
