Officer Ague had heard reports of two dogs escaping a car crash in the town of Palmyra while he was on call. The border collie had been captured, but he decided to find the distressed German Shepherd who had run away on her own. Eventually Mr Ague and other officers tracked down Mya, but every time the patrol car drew near, she started running. To the rescue: Mr Ague said that he was particularly keen to find Mya because he owns a German Shepherd himself . It was when Mya stopped that Ague realised there was something wrong with her. Mr Ague said: 'Her pads were all torn up from running on the hot asphalt because of the distance the dog managed to clear from the crash.'

"A lesbian cheerleader accused of having sex with her 14-year-old classmate may be headed to jail as it is revealed she continued their relationship despite court orders for her to stay away. Court documents accuse Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, of Sebastian, Florida, of 'covertly contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it. Some of the explicit messages contain footage of Hunt 'masturbating while moaning' and the state claims Hunt and the girl had sex as recently as two weeks ago. Meanwhile, her mom Kelley Hunt Smith may have helped her daughter cover her tracks. New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her . Explicit: Prosecutors say that included in the 20,000 messages were photos of Hunt's vagina . Just last month, Hunt was offered a plea deal by prosecutors, one that would trade a potential 15 year prison sentence and a lifetime on sex offender registries for three years probation. Hunt had not decided whether or not to take the deal as of Wednesday, but it is likely no longer an option. According to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend recently told detectives about the illicit contact they had while Hunt was out of jail on bond awaiting trial and that Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact.' The new evidence indicates Hunt and the girl, until recently, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day at Sebastian River High School in March. Violations: Hunt allegedly smuggled an iPod to her girlfriend and the two traded messages, including naked photos and masturbation videos from Hunt . Civil rights? Kaitlyn Hunt's parents took her case public after they claimed she was targeted because she is gay. While out on bond and barred from seeing the girl, Hunt may have had sex with her as recently as July . 'I'm out of jail on bond,' Hunt told the unnamed girl in a May message warning her not to tell anyone they were in communication, otherwise, 'I'll sit in jail until trial starts.' 'No matter what,' Hunt wrote. 'If they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts.' The state claims to possess over 25 lewd photos the defendant sent to her lover's iPod, photos which show her fully nude and sometimes pleasuring herself. The girl's parents have remained adamant, from the time they first brought charges against Hunt earlier this year, that she should be prosecuted as a sex offender. Criminal? Hunt could be hauled away from an emergency hearing scheduled for August 20 in cuffs if a judge finds she violated her court orders to stay away from her 14-year-old girlfriend . The case garnered nationwide attention after Hunt's father Steven Hunt and mother Kelley Hunt Smith took the case public with social media campaigns and television appearances in support of their daughter, who had just turned 18 when her relationship with the girl began. On or around May 21, the documents . allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their . continued relationship. Worldwide support: Thousands of people have protested against the prosecution of Hunt as a sex offender. But will they support her if she broke the terms of her bond with the aid of her mother? 'F**k you..you're stupid,' she wrote. 'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. Bye.' The two continued to converse, and on May 29, Hunt wrote, 'If my mom finds out we're talking, I'm blaming it on you.' The defendants mom, Kelley Hunt Smith, did find out. But the court documents suggest that, instead of putting an end to the contact, Smith tried to help her daughter cover her tracks. 'Delete EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.' Incriminating messages from Kaitlyn's girlfriend were also included in the court filing. 'Chill out, I'm f***king with you,' wrote the unnamed girl. 'Babe, you need to like smoke a Black and Mild or something.' To which Hunt replied: 'KK rolling our blunt now.' Ms. Hunt was not immediately available for comment, but the court documents make clear just how seriously the prosecution is taking these newest revelations. 'It is apparent that the conduct of both the defendant and Kelley Hunt Smith is severely threatening the integrity of the judicial process,' read the documents. Hunt had in just the past month been urged to accept the new deal which would keep her out of jail and prevent her from being registered as a sex offenderÂ  - if she pleads no contest to two misdemeanor battery counts and one felony count for interference of child custody. Her case attracted a glut of publicity after her parents did multiple interviews, claiming that their daughter was only charged because she is gay. As of May, 300,000 people have signed an online petition to have the charges against the teenager dropped. If she goes to trial, she faces 15 years in prison if convicted on the two original charges of lewd or lascivious battery alone. Under a previous plea deal in May, . Kaitlyn would have been forced to register as a sex offender as well as . remain on house arrest for two years. The latest plea deal was offered by the Florida state attorney's office in July, reported CNN, because it balances the needs of Hunt, the unidentified teenage girl and their parents. Defending his daughter: Steven Hunt (right) insists that his 18-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn (left), is being targeted by prosecutors for dating a 14-year-old classmate because she is lesbian . Under the deal, Hunt would have a curfew of 11pm for the first year of her 3-year probation. She . would also have had to agree never to contact the 14-year-old girl . again. Her criminal record would later have been expunged or sealed. Hunt's parents say that the . younger girl's parents demanded that Kaitlyn be arrested because they . can't come to terms with the fact that their teenage daughter had a . relationship with another girl. Thousands have signed petitions in support of Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt after she was jailed and charged with lascivious battery of a minor. But while she and her parents gave national interviews maintaining her consensual relationship was innocent, Hunt was breaking court orders that she stay away from her 14-year-old girlfriend and could now lose a plea deal offer and face additional felony charges. According to the documents: . February 17, 2013: A Vero Beach court gives 'no contact' order banning Hunt from 'direct or indirect' contact with the girl . March 1: On Hunt's last day at Sebastian River High, she slipped an iPod into the girl's locker and kept in almost daily contact for months and eventually exchanged 20,000 messages with the device . May 25: Hunt messages the girl, warning her to 'Keep the f**k' quiet . May 29: 'If my mom finds out we're talking,' wrote Hunt, 'I'm blaming it on you.' But Hunt's mother knew already, it seems. Back in March, documents indicate Kelley Hunt Smith contacted the girl herself. 'PLEASE delete everything,' Smith wrote, 'and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.' Hunt's . family claim that the relationship between the two girls was . consensual. However under Florida law, a person under the age of 16 is . not considered to be able to legally consent to sex. The victims' parents say that they are only protecting their daughter and it has nothing to do with her being gay. Kaitlyn has said the legal battle has been emotionally draining. She was expelled from Sebastian River High School near central Florida's Atlantic coast. 'Every day's different. Some days I'm my happy self. Some days I'm overwhelmed, some days I'm scared,' she said. Gay rights advocates say older high . schoolers dating their younger counterparts is an innocuous, everyday . occurrence that is not prosecuted â regardless of sexual orientation â . and not a crime on par with predatory sex offenses. Hunt . played on the basketball team with her younger girlfriend and shared . the same circle of friends, said Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt Smith previously said. The . two had a consenting relationship that began soon after Kaitlyn Hunt . turned 18, and Mrs Hunt Smith said she assumed the younger girl's parents . knew that. But . Hunt was kicked off the basketball team near the end of last year after . the coach learned of the relationship because players were not allowed . to date each other, her parents said. Then, . in February, prosecutors filed charges against her. The day before she was arrested, police and the younger . girl's parents secretly recorded a phone conversation in which the two . girls discussed kissing in the school bathroom, said Hunt's father, . Steve Hunt. Massive push: A 'Free Kate' Facebook page has generated more than 35,000 followers so far, and an online petition urging that the charges be dropped already has nearly 120,000 signatures .","Kaitlyn Hunt, of Sebastian, Florida, may no longer be eligible for her offered plea deal after court documents reveal she kept daily contact with the teen girl she's on trial for having sex with .

"A man suspected of abducting and killing a single mother who led a double life as a paid escort served time in prison for two kidnapping cases involving his former wife. Prosecutor Dan Rubenstein on Monday recounted Lester Jones' criminal history in court in Grand Junction, Colorado, arguing that the 63-year-old was a flight risk. Without objection from Jones' public defender, a judge agreed to hold the defendant on $2 million bond in the death of Paige Birgfeld seven years ago. Jones appeared for the court hearing via video feed from the Mesa County jail. He said nothing other than acknowledging that he had watched a video advising him of his legal rights. Lester Jones (pictured left), who was arrested Friday, was one of the last people to call Paige Birgfeld (right) before her eight-year-old daughter reported her missing in June 2007 . Birgfeld was twice divorced and living with her three children in Grand Junction when she was killed (pictured with two of her kids) Lester Jones, who was arrested Friday, was one of the last people to call Birgfeld before her eight-year-old daughter reported her missing in June 2007. Authorities allege he killed Birgfeld, dumped her body and torched her car. In 1999, Jones received a five-year prison term for two kidnapping cases involving Lisa Jones that year. Lester Jones first was arrested after authorities say he ran a car carrying his ex-wife and another man off the road, rammed their vehicle and fired two shots at the man. He pulled Lisa Jones out of the car, forced her into his vehicle and threatened to kill her several times as they drove, Rubenstein said. About a month later, Lester Jones was arrested again for second-degree kidnapping to commit sexual assault and other charges after taking his ex-wife to Grand Mesa â one of the world's largest flat-topped mountains â and threatening her, the prosecutor said. Jones was convicted of first-degree assault in the heat of passion, attempted second-degree kidnapping with a deadly weapon and violating conditions of his bond. Authorities alleged Jones killed Paige Birgfeld, dumped her body and torched her car seven years ago . In the Birgfeld case, Jones emerged as the main suspect after police dogs detected Jones' scent in the missing woman's charred Ford Focus. An arrest affidavit says Jones was unable to explain a gas can near his desk at the RV dealership where he worked. He denied any involvement when police interviewed him early in their investigation. Detectives also questioned â and ruled out â at least eight other men, including Birgfeld's former husband and several other clients. Birgfeld's skeletal remains were found in a dry creek bed in 2012. Birgfeld was twice divorced and living with her three children in Grand Junction â about 200 miles west of Denver. Friends knew her as a devoted mother who sold kitchen wares and did other jobs. Her apparent double life attracted widespread attention to the mystery of her disappearance, including a '48 Hours' segment in 2008.

"Native Americans are descended from Clovis man and may have originally travelled from Asia by way of a land bridge that disappeared long ago, it has been revealed. The DNA of a baby boy who was buried in Montana 12,600 years ago has given scientists new insights into the ancient roots of today's American Indians and other native peoples of the Americas. It isÂ  the oldest genome ever recovered from the New World, and artifacts found with the body show the boy was part of the Clovis culture, which existed in North America from about 13,000 years ago to about 12,600 years ago and is named for an archaeological site near Clovis, N.M. A nearly-complete projectile point, top, a mid-stage point made of translucent quartz and an end-beveled rod of bone from a Clovis-era burial site found in 1968 in western Montana. Scientists have recovered and analyzed the DNA of an infant who died more than 12,000 years ago and was buried at the site where these artifacts were found, and have linked him to modern day Native Americans. Clovis man lived in America about 13,000 years ago where they hunted mammoth, mastodons and giant bison with big spears. The Clovis people were not the first humans in America, but they represent the first humans with a wide expansion on the North American continent â until the culture mysteriously disappeared only a few hundred years after its origin. Centuries of cold, nicknamed the 'Big Freeze,' are believed to have wiped out the Clovis, as well as most of the large mammals in North America . The boy's genome showed his people were direct ancestors of many of today's native peoples in the Americas, researchers said. The so-called Anzick skeleton was found with about 125 artifacts, including Clovis fluted spear points and tools made from antlers, and covered in red ochre, a type of mineral. 'It is almost like finding the 'missing link' to the common ancestor of the Native Americans,' saidÂ  Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, who led the study. The Clovis boy's family is the direct ancestor to roughly estimated 80% of all present day Native Americans. 'Although the Clovis culture disappeared its people are living today. 'Put simply it is a sensation that we succeeded in finding an approximately 12,600 year old boy whose closest relatives can be regarded as the direct ancestor to so many people.' 'This also means that Clovis did not descend from Europeans, Asians or Melanesians, a theory that a number of scientists have advocated. 'They were Native Americans â and the Native American ancestors were the first people in America. This is now a fact.' The boy was more closely related to those in Central and South America than to those in Canada. The reason for that difference isn't clear, scientists said. The researchers said they had no Native American DNA from the United States available for comparison, but that they assume the results would be same, with some Native Americans being direct descendants and others also closely related. The DNA also indicates the boy's ancestors came from Asia, supporting the standard idea of ancient migration to the Americas by way of a land bridge that disappeared long ago. The burial site, northeast of Livingston, Mont., is the only burial known from the Clovis culture. The boy was between 1 year and 18 months old when he died of an unknown cause. He was buried with 125 artifacts, including spear points and elk antler tools. Some were evidently ritual objects or heirlooms. The burial site, marked by a pole at center left, where the remains of a boy from the only known burial site of the Clovis culture was found in western Montana. The artifacts and the skeleton were covered with powdered red ochre, a natural pigment, indicating a burial ceremony. The skeleton was discovered in 1968 next to a rock cliff, but it is only in recent years that scientists have been able to recover and analyze complete genomes from such ancient samples. The first humans came from Siberia via the so-called Beringia Land Bridge, which during the latest ice age connected Siberia with North America and did not bring the Clovis culture with them. The Clovis culture arose after they arrived in America and the boy from Anzick was more a descendant of the first immigrants. The team found that Native American ancestors coming in from Siberia split into two groups. One group is ancestors to the Native Americans presently living in Canada and the other one â which is represented by the Clovis boy â is the ancestor to virtually all Native Americans in South America and Mexico. The DNA analysis was reported online Wednesday in the journal Nature by scientists including Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark , Michael Waters of Texas A&M University and Shane Doyle of Montana State University in Bozeman. The burial site lies on the property of the parents of another author, Sarah Anzick of Livingston. It is known as the Anzick site. The end of a beveled rod of bone and an incompleted projectile point from the Clovis-era burial site . Doyle, a member of the Crow tribe, said the indication of such ancient roots for American Indians fits with what many tribal people already believed. He also said the boy's remains may be reburied at the site by late spring or early summer. 'This discovery by Eske and his team proves something that tribal people have never doubted - we've been here since time immemorial and all the ancient artifacts located within our homelands are remnants from our direct ancestors. 'But the discovery is only part of the importance of this study. 'The other part being Eske and his team's respectful commitment to interacting face to face with tribal communities and listening to Native American leaders, which has lead directly to the reburial of this little boy.' In a telephone conference with reporters, the researchers said that once they discovered the link between the boy and today's Native Americans, they sought out American Indian groups to discuss the results. Now an international team headed by Danish researcher Eske Willerslev has mapped his genome thereby reviving the scientific debate about the colonization of the Americas. Roughly estimated some 80% of all present-day Native American populations on the two American continents are direct descendants of the Clovis boy's family. The remaining 20% are more closely related with the Clovis family than any other people on Earth, says Lundbeck Professor Eske Willerslev from the Centre for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen. A nearly-complete projectile point, top, two mid-stage points and an ""end-beveled"" rod of bone from the Clovis-era burial site found in 1968 in western Montana. Willerslev, an expert in deciphering ancient DNA, called for scientists to work closely with native peoples on such research. 'Then who were the first immigrants? 'We don't know. Yet. 'Maybe a Native American, maybe an ancestor related to the Mal'ta boy from Siberia and another one who was East Asian. 'We don't know. But our results eliminate all other theories about the origins of the first people in America. 'The first people in America were the direct ancestors of Native Americans,"" says Professor Willerslev . The results are 'going to raise a whole host of new ideas and hypotheses' about the early colonization of the Americas, said Dennis O'Rourke, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Utah who wasn't involved in the work.","Clovis culture existed in North America from about 13,000 years ago to about 12,600 years ago .

"Michael Shrimpton, 57, is facing jail after being found guilty of phoning Parliament in April 2012 to say the Queen was the target of a nuclear attack . A barrister who claimed that German spies were plotting to attack the Queen with a nuclear weapon at the London Olympics has been found guilty of communicating false information. Michael Shrimpton, 57, called a close colleague of former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in April 2012 to say that a nuclear warhead had been stashed in an east London hospital and was going to be used to attack either the Queen, the Olympic Stadium, or the opening ceremony. He also claimed his house in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, was a 'bona fide' HQ for an international intelligence network - but he is today facing jail after being found guilty at Southwark Crown Court. A jury of nine men and three women found Shrimpton guilty of two counts of communicating false information after more than six hours of deliberation, with majority 11-1 verdicts. Sentencing will take place in February of next year afterÂ Judge Alistair McCreath QC ordered that Shrimpton be sent for psychiatric evaluation. Judge McCreath said: âThe sentence that I pass upon you will have to reflect that gravity of the conduct of which you have been convicted. âBut if, as may be the case, there is some underlying reason for it, then it seems to me important that I be informed of that underlying reason and I am therefore minded to order that you undergo psychiatric examination.â Shrimpton, author of âSpyhunter: The Secret History of German Intelligenceâ, replied he had âno objectionâ to the order. In April 2012, just as preparations for the London Olympics were entering their final phase, Shrimpton contacted Barry Burton, the principal private secretary to Philip Hammond. He told Mr Burton that spies from âa covert and rather sinisterâ Germany agency had sabotaged Russian submarine Kursk, which sank in 2000, and stole four nuclear warheads. The lawyer boasted of âcredible European sourcesâ, name-dropped members of parliament, and said intelligence had been blocked through official channels because the Germans had infiltrated MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. During the 20-minute call Shrimpton said he had gathered intelligence from his own network of volunteers that one warhead was being stored in a hospital in London to avoid detection. Mr Burton suspected that the call had been a hoax, but was forced to pass the information over to theÂ Olympic security team and the police. The following day Shrimpton phoned theÂ Aylesbury Conservative Association and asked to speak with MP David Lidington about the threat, which he described as being in the style of American TV show '24'. The call was reported to a colleague at Parliament, and Shrimpton was arrested the same day. Shrimpton called a close colleague of then Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to say German spies had looted four nuclear warheads from a sunken Russia sub and were hiding one in London for the attack . Shrimpton claimed his arrest was a âcolossal cock-upâ, blamed the Germans and demanded a ânice lunch with MI5â. In interview at Aylesbury police station he boasted he was a ânational security specialistâ with hundreds of intelligence contacts who acted as a back channel between governments. Representing himself at his two-week trial, he told jurors he worked on the investigation into Madeleine McCannâs disappearance and the case of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet. He read extracts from his address book with a number of âcontactsâ in the CIA, FBI, MI6, the Pentagon, Chinese intelligence and Parliament. Shrimpton said: âI admit that the stuff I deal with is bound to sound strange, high falutin, incredible and fantastic.Itâs my world, welcome to my world.â Shrimpton claimed he has rubbed shoulders with royalty, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and listed a number of famous names including Richard Branson and Steven Forbes. Giving evidence he boasted of meeting Prince Philip twice in a social context and claimed to have to Royal's phone number. Shrimpton said the information had been blocked through official channels because the Germans had infiltrated MI5, MI6, and GCHQ (pictured, the Queen at the London 2012 opening ceremony) Among his other claims were that he was consulted by the makers of TV show Spooks on his specialist knowledge, that the CIA had allowed him to enter the U.S. carrying a weapon, and that the LA Sheriff's Department had discussed terror attacks with him over a cup of coffee. He also insisted he has the authority to issue a Defence Advisory Notice on behalf of the government to stop British media from publishing stories that could compromise national security. He said he wanted to prevent the News of the World from blowing his intelligence, and added they were âvery cooperativeâ. Shrimpton told jurors that there had been an assassination attempt against him by the Chinese authorities who wanted to âwhackâ him. In response, prosecutor Alan Blake said: 'The information was extraordinary and dramatic, in essence Mr Shrimpton announced that a nuclear weapon stolen from the sunken Russian submarine the Kursk a number of years ago, that such a nuclear weapon had been smuggled into the UK and was being stored in a London hospital in preparation to be used during the Olympic games. âWith the benefit of hindsight the information may seem outlandish, perhaps even laughable. âBefore being too dismissive do recall the position in 2012 when those calls were made.â Sitting at Southwark Crown Court,Â Judge Alistair McCreath QC delayed sentencing for Shrimpton until February next year while the lawyer has psychiatric tests . At that stage, surface to air missiles had just been installed on the tops of a number of blocks of flats and it was feared terrorists could infiltrate G4S staff after the security company began frantically hiring after announcing a staff shortage, the court heard. Mr Blake said Shrimpton was a ârespected professional manâ who has âsuperficial plausibilityâ. He added: âIt is the prosecutionâs case that the information provided by Mr Shrimpton was false and that when he communicated those threats he didnât honestly or genuinely believe that they were true or rather knew or believed that they were false.' Shrimpton was granted conditional bail ahead of sentencing on February 6.","Michael Shrimpton, 57, called Parliament over nuclear threat in April 2012 .

"The millionaire boss of Ryanair, Michael OâLeary, warned this week that the cost of checking in baggage on one of his flights could go up even further. But thatâs not the only way he seeks to squeeze every pound he can out of the 80 million passengers who fly with the airline every year, says DAVID THOMAS. According to Ryanair, theÂ  so-called âancillary chargesâ that pile up on top of the cost of your basic flight ticket contribute an incredible 22 per cent of the companyâs revenue â thatâs a whopping Â£836ââmillion: an average of more than Â£10 per passenger, per flight. Flying in the face of public opinion: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary . In 2009, âancillary chargesâ generated a mere Â£512 million, meaning theyâve gone up more than 60 per cent in just three years. At the same rate of growth, Ryanairâs money-making efforts will be taking Â£1.3 billion extra from passengersâ pockets by 2015. Ryanairâs Michael OâLeary this week said itâs âprobably inevitableâ that airlines will charge passengers for carry-on bags. Traditionally, we donât have to pay for hand luggage, but many airlines are suspected of considering it as a new source of revenue. Ryanairâs carry-on allowance of a bag with a total volume of no more than 40 litres and a maximum weight of 10kg is already among the smallest in the business. Ryanair, of course, is at the forefront of profit-making when it comes to bags, and has raised its charge for hold luggage by up to Â£25 over the summer period. Mr OâLeary said: âWe donât want the bags. We will keep increasing charges until we get rid of hold bags.â Travellers now have to pay up to Â£160 in the peak season to take two 15kg suitcases on board. As well that punitive charge, it costs up to Â£60 to carry on sports equipment or musical instruments. Logical? The more customers O'Leary can cram onto his aeroplanes, the more chance of selling food and drink . Ryanair has abolished check-in desks. Passengers have to do it online and pay Â£7 per person, per flight to do so. In other words, youâre paying for turning up to catch the flight youâve already paid for. The company also charges a 2ââper cent surcharge if you book by credit card. Passengers are forced to pay Â£70 at the airport if they havenât already checked in online at home and printed their boarding pass. And thereâs more: if you are late for your flight and have to catch the next one, youâll be hit with a fee of Â£110. Maybe at that point youâll decide itâs easier to get a taxiÂ  â even if youâre heading for the Continent. Thatâs the kind of attitude that led Melinda Stevens, editor of Conde Nast Traveller magazine, to declare that âengaging with Ryanair is dabbling in the Devilâs workâ.â.â. throwing money at him while asking him to repeatedly jab you in the solar plexus with a jagged instrumentâ. God forbid that you actually get to sit where you want and with whom you want â at least not without paying for the privilege. If you want priority boarding, making you part of the first group to board the aircraft and thus able to choose your seat, itâs another Â£7 over the internet, or Â£10 onÂ  the day. If you want to reserve a place on the plane, thatâll cost you Â£15. In for the long haul: O'Leary shows no sign of slowing down as he continues expansion of Ryanair . Ryanair has more than 300 Boeing 737 jets. Always looking to make savings, the company bought half its fleet of aircraft after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when prices were low. Once you actually get on one of those planes, youâll find everything is squeezed to make more profits â and that includes seat space. Last year, a survey of 32 airlines placed it bottom of a table of airlines according to the width of their seats (16in) and last but one for their leg-room (29in). But as far as OâLeary is concerned, customers are still taking up too much space and demanding too many luxuries. Thatâs why heâs talked, not entirely in jest, of charging more for overweight passengers. Heâs also discussed getting Boeing to remove two of the three lavatories on their planes and replace them with six extra seats (as well as threatening to charge up to Â£1 per visit to the loo onÂ  the plane). Ryanair already carries the maximum 189 passengers itâs allowed in its aircraft. But OâLeary wants his 737s re-certified to allow him the additional passengers. In the past, he has even suggested removing the last ten rows of seats and letting passengers stand at the back, jammed together like factory-farm chickens. The more passengers Ryanair can cram in, the more it can soak them for additional charges, and the more it can raise money from other enterprises, such as selling scratchcards to customers, or slapping adverts on the doors of the overhead luggage bins.

Its iPhone app costs Â£2.49. And why waste money trying to attract passengers via social media? While most other airlines are desperate to maximiseÂ  their exposure on FacebookÂ  and Twitter, Ryanair simply doesnât bother. Squeezing every possible passenger on to each flight means more baggage as well. That means more weight, and Ryanair hates weight. The heavier an aircraftâs load, the more fuel it requires to fly, and aviation fuel is very expensive. T . hatâs why, as it was revealedÂ  this week, OâLeary has orderedÂ  his pilots to fly more slowly â adding two minutes to every Ryanair flight. Planes, like cars, use less fuel by going slower, so this will save the company Â£1 per passenger, totalling Â£80 million a year.","Ryanair charge passengers Â£160 to take two 15kg cases on board .

"A mother has described the 'heartbreaking' moment her seven-year-old daughter clung to her and sobbed as she explained how she had been taped to a chair by a teacher and assistant at her primary school. Rachael Regan, a classroom assistant, and Deborah McDonald, a teacher, are accused of carrying out a five-month campaign of bullying against the girl which included shutting her in a store room and tying her shoes on with string at a school in Calderdale, west Yorkshire. The girl's mother, who cannot be named, told Bradford Crown Court her daughter rushed to her in tears and told her she had been taped to the chair with Sellotape by the two women, and made to look 'like a clown' while the rest of her class laughed at her. Teaching assistant Rachel Regan (left) and teacher Deborah McDonald (right) are pictured leaving Bradford Crown Court today where they are on trial accused of bullying a seven-year-old during a five month campaign . The woman said her daughter 'clung to her' as she explained what had happened. She told the jury that her 'bubbly and outgoing' daughter, who is now nine, started to make excuses to not go to school but she did not understand why. She also told her mother she wanted to change schools. The jury has already heard that the girl was 'singled out and bullied' by the pair, who have also been accused of calling the child a nickname and goading her with a biscuit. McDonald, from Halifax, and Regan, of Illingworth, West Yorkshire, each deny a charge of child cruelty. The girl's mother told the court: '(My daughter) just came rushing out and hugged me and tears were just rolling down her face. 'It was just so heartbreaking to see her like that because (she) is so bubbly and outgoing and I have never seen my daughter so upset. 'She just clung to me for dear life.â The woman explained how her daughter told her she had been taped to a chair by Regan. A taped interview with the girl recorded her telling police officers she thought neither McDonald (left) or Regan (right) liked her. She said that Regan was not a very nice person and was 'always mean' to her . The girl's mother added: 'I said ""How did you feel?"" and she said ""Very upset.""' 'She said ""They all thought I was funny. I was the clown. They all laughed at me.""' The girlâs mother said she had previously spoken to the school after her daughter told her a teacher had stuck Post-it notes to her thumbs to stop her sucking them. She told the court her daughter also claimed that one of the teachers tied her pumps on with string and put her favourite doll in a storeroom. The jury was shown a video of a police interview with the girl. In the film she told officers that Regan, 43, and McDonald, 41, did not like her. She said: '(Reganâs) not a very nice person. Because she likes everybody else except for me. I donât know why she doesnât like me. 'Sheâs always nice to the other children in class but sheâs always mean to me.' When the police interviewer asked the girl how she felt about Regan, she replied: 'Very, very, very angry.' The child told a jury at Bradford Crown Court that she felt Regan did not like her and liked everyone else . She told police that she and McDonald liked each other but said she was sometimes not nice because she would shout at her. The girl described having her shoes tied on by Regan with string. She said: 'She has put string around me pumps. It were horrible, just because my feet are small, size 9, and somebody has got me size 10. 'Everyone was laughing because they kept coming undone.' She also described being shut in a store cupboard, which she called 'dirty' and 'dusty.' Earlier in the trial the jury were told about an incident when McDonald allegedly dropped the girlâs doll into a drawer and kicked it shut, and of another occasion when Regan allegedly took a photo of the girl of the wall and ripped it up in front of her. The alleged bullying took place between September 2012 and January last year. The court has previously heard the two women were jointly to blame. Police arrested the pair in February after the girl's mother complained to the school. The trial continues.

"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is today labelled as a problem in society, with diagnoses surging by as much as tenfold in some countries. But it may not have always been considered as something that needs treating. In fact, one scientist claims ADHD may have helped the human species survive. New York-based Professor Richard Friedman argues that nomads who were adventurous, hyperactive and impulsive were more likely to survive in their harsh surroundings. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is today labelled as a problem in society, with diagnoses surging by as much as tenfold in some countries (stock image used) These traits are similar to ones associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition that affects around five per cent of the population. 'Having the profile of what we now call ADHD would have made you a Paleolithic success story,' Weill Cornell Medical College psychiatry Professor Richard Friedman wrote in the New York Times. Scientific studies seem to back up this theory. Professor Friedman points to a study conducted several years ago on the Ariaal tribe in Kenya. The research, led by of Northwestern University, analysed part of the tribe that had settled into an agricultural community. The rest of the tribe remained nomadic. The tribesmen were tested for DRD4 7R, a genetic variant that the study said, 'has been linked to greater food and drug cravings, novelty-seeking, and ADHD symptoms.' Professor Richard Friedman claims that nomads who were adventurous, hyperactive and impulsive were more likely to survive in their harsh surroundings. Pictured is a band of Kung hunters in Namibia . Those tribesmen who had the ADHD-linked gene variant tended to be better nourished. However, in the settled group, people with DRD4 7R were underweight, reportedÂ Business Insider. The study suggests certain characteristics linked with ADHD may have helped some people survive under conditions similar to those experienced by early nomads. 'Nomadic Ariaal, with short attention spans and novelty-seeking tendencies, are probably going to have an easier time making the most of a dynamic environment, including getting more to eat,' wrote Professor Friedman. 'This same brief attention span would not be very useful among the settled, who have to focus on activities that call for sustained focus, like going to school, growing crops and selling goods.' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it is more common in people with learning difficulties. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 12. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age will continue to experience problems. Source: NHS Choices . Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school. In the US, around five per cent of children are thought to have ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD in US adult is at around three to five per cent. Professor Friedman says the lower value society places on ADHD traits may account for why more children are being diagnosed with the condition each year. 'Digital life, with its vivid gaming and exciting social media, is a world of immediate gratification where practically any desire or fantasy can be realised in the blink of an eye,' said Professor Friedman. 'By comparison, school would seem even duller to a novelty-seeking kid living in the early 21st century than in previous decades. 'The comparatively boring school environment might accentuate students' inattentive behaviour, making their teachers more likely to see it and driving up the number of diagnoses.' There remains controversy surrounding the condition. Last week, experts said the global surge in ADHD diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine. Diagnosis rates and prescriptions of stimulant drugs are soaring compared with five years ago. However, Professor Peter Conrad, of Brandeis University claims ADHD is 'more of an economic and cultural plague than a medical one'.

"A Houston, Texas couple was horrified when the baby monitor in their young childâs room was taken over by a hacker who verbally attacked them and even used their daughterâs name. Marc Gilbert says he was doing the dishes following his birthday celebration when he heard strange sounds coming from 2-year-old Allysonâs bedroom. He discovered they were coming from the baby monitor as a strangerâs voice called his sleeping daughter an âeffing moronâ and âlittle slutâ before he quickly unplugged it. Scroll down for video... Intrusion: This wireless baby monitor was taken over by a hacker who used profanity and verbally attacked 2-year-old girl and her parents . Appalling: Marc Gilbert heard sounds coming from his little girl's room and was horrified to find a stranger's voice coming from his daughter's baby monitor . The virtual intruder even knew Allyson by name because it was . written just above her head, on the wall over where she dozed. The hacker then yelled at Gilbert and his wife, using expletives in what they described as a âBritish or European accent.â 'He said, 'Wake up Allyson, you little (expletive),'"" Gilbert said. Allyson is deaf. Though she has a cochlear implant, it was turned off and she was never bothered by the shocking intrusion. Then things became even creepier. Helpless: Marc Gilbert says he believes his internet router was hacked and fears the intrusion has happened before without his or wife Lauren's knowledge . 'I see the camera move on us,' Gilbert said. âAt that point I ran over and disconnected it and tried to figure out what happened,â Gilbert told ABC News. The father of two did his research and now believes his home internet router was hacked and the monitor was subsequently accessed. â[I] couldn't see the guy. All you could do was hear his voice and he was controlling the camera,â he said. Gilbert said it was no different a violation than if the hacker had actually entered his home. 'It felt like somebody broke into our house,' Gilbert told KTRK. Even worse, the Gilberts are forced to wonder if the hacking had occurred in the past. âIt's quite possible that this had been going on more than one day,â he said. âSecurity vulnerabilities exist.â Making the creepy just plain scary: Gilbert said he took all the typical precautions to keep prying eyes out of his home. 'The router was password protected and the firewall was enabled,' Gilbert wrote in the comments section of the KTRK report. 'The IP camera was also password protected.' Like his sister Allyson, the couple's 3-year-old son . Ethan also managed not to hear the shameless intrusion. But . the terrifying experience has the Gilberts rattled enough to stop using . the monitor that Marc says they once âcouldnât live without.â 'Wake up you little slut': The hacker even spoke the sleeping girl's name, which was written on the wall above her bed . Taking no chances: Now Marc Gilbert is forced to wonder if the hackers had ever struck before. The father of two has decided to permanently unplug the monitor, which he once said he and his wife couldn't live without . âI don't think it ever will be connected again,â he said. The disturbing crime isn't unique, unfortunately. The newly-crowned Miss Teen USA recently revealed she was secretly photographed in her room after her computer's webcam was hacked. Cassidy Wolf, who took the crown on Saturday, said she was horrified to learn a stranger had hacked into her computer before trying to extort her on the promise the photos would not be leaked. The 19-year-old from Temecula, California now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime. For his part, Gilbert has plenty of reason to worry about the safety of his family, who have not appeared alongside him in reports of the camera hacking. He wanted to tell his story in order that other families know to be careful not to share the same terrible experience. 'As a father, I'm supposed to protect her against people like this. So it's a little embarrassing to say the least but it's not going to happen again,' Gilbert said.","The hacker cursed at Marc Gilbert and his wife and even used their sleeping daughter's name .

"A woman who began sprouting thick facial hair for 13 years following the birth of her first child says she no longer wants to hide her beard away. Indonesian Agustina Dorman, 38, first noticed the stubble growth when she was 25, days after the birth of her first child. Ever since she has hidden her face under a hijab whenever outside in Penaga village, Indonesia. Brave decision: Agustina Dorman, 38, who began sprouting thick facial hair after the birth of her child says she no longer wants to hide away and is finally embracing her beard . But she woman has decided to ditch the clothing and accept her condition - regardless of the stares and unwanted attention she now attracts. Agustina - who also sports a mild moustache and chest hair - says that whenever she attempted to cut or shave the beard she experienced unbearable pain. After several attempts to rid herself of the goatee, she was forced to let it grow. And scared that her children - aged . 19 and three - would be bullied for their mother's appearance, Agustina . hid away under the hijab. Among Indonesia's large Muslim population, Agustina could move about without attracting unwanted attention. But she says her eldest child began to receive taunts from others who found out about their mother's unusual condition. Tormented: Agustina Dorman, first noticed the beard growth when she was 25, days after the birth of her first child . Personal: Agustina's identity card clearly shows her beard . Worried: Scared that her children - aged 19 and three - would be bullied for their mother's appearance, Agustina hid away under the hijab . It led to her confronting her children's tormentors by unveiling herself and freely walking around their village for the first time this week. She hopes that through education about her condition, people will become accepting of her appearance. Earlier this year a German bearded lady called Mariam appeared on British programme This Morning to reveal she felt sexy with her stubble. Mariam now travels with a circus as the bearded lady act, which she says she enjoys since she has studied acting in the past and also likes educating people about the issue. 'I want to give people the opportunity to talk to a bearded lady, because usually they are too scared in the street' She said: 'I want to give people the opportunity to talk to a bearded lady, because usually they are too scared in the street.' Earlier this year a German bearded lady called Mariam appeared on Daytime TV in the UK to reveal she even felt sexy with her stubble . Agustina Dorman . It's estimated that one in ten women suffers from excess facial and body hair. But what causes it? 'Sometimes race or just a family tendency to be more hairy is to blame, rather than any medical problem,' explains Dr Rina Davison, an endocrinologist from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, with a special interest in excess hair. 'People of South Asian or Mediterranean descent tend to have more hair than Caucasians or those with black skin, for example. It's also possible to be quite a âhairyâ family regardless of race.' But there are other factors that could be to blame. Women normally produce low levels of male hormones called androgens, but an excess can trigger unwanted hair growth known as hirsutism. A common cause of hirsutism is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which has accompanying symptoms of acne, weight gain and irregular periods. Other, rarer, causes include a tumour on the ovary or adrenal gland as well as certain medicines including steroids. Rarely, a woman will have normal androgen levels and the cause of the unwanted hair growth will not be identified.","Agustina Dorman, 38, first noticed the stubble growth days after giving birth .

"A woman, who was involved in a horrific road accident, woke from a coma to discover that she was 12 weeks pregnant. Last year, Gemma Holmes was riding a moped when she was flung across a busy road into a lamp post. She suffered extensive injuries, including a broken back, and doctors didn't expect her to survive. But she defied the odds and is now on the road to recovery - with her now 12-week-old son Ruben. Gemma Holmes was involved in a road accident that broke her back and put her in a coma. When she woke up she was told she was 12 weeks pregnant but had not memory of who the father was . While in hospital, tests revealed that Gemma was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. Ms Holmes was in a coma and unable to be told the news, so doctors turned to her mother, Julie, to make the decision about whether the baby should be kept or terminated. 'Doctors suggested a termination because Gemma would not be able to undergo surgery to fix her back until she gave birth. 'So many things went through my head but I wanted to wait until Gemma was awake to make the decision,' Julie, who has taken on the role of Gemma's full time carer while she is confined to a wheelchair, told ITV's This Morning. When Gemma eventually awoke she was given the news, but she had no recollection having been in a relationship because she had developed severe memory loss. The previous three years were entirely blank. Ruben (pictured) was delivered by caesarian section 12 weeks ago. His mother, Gemma, gave him the middle name Miracle because he survived such an ordeal . Gemma suffered horrific injuries after the crash on her moped. She was hurled across a street and into a lamp post and was left with a broken back and in a coma for six weeks . Despite her grave health problems, she made the decision to keep the baby. 'I just thought that if this little baby inside me had managed to survive the awful crash then he was meant to be,' said Gemma. Gemma endured considerable pain during the pregnancy as she was unable to take high doses of painkillers, which can harm an unborn baby, while she recovered. In May this year she gave birth to Ruben Miracle Holmes by caesarian section. Despite his traumatic beginnings, baby Ruben Miracle was delivered with no complications by caesarian section . Gemma (pictured with son Ruben) couldn't have a natural birth because of the brain injury she suffered from the crash. Giving birth puts pressure on the brain which could have worsened any existing problems . Gemma's mother Julie (left) is now Gemma's (right) full-time carer while she is still confined to a wheelchair. The new mother hopes to one day walk again and be able to run around with her son, Ruben, (pictured) as he grows up . 'I couldn't have a natural birth because the brain injury I suffered from the crash put me at risk of further damage - giving birth puts pressure on the brain,' she said. 'I was also told my body would not be able to cope with the contractions after breaking my back.' The mother and son are now doing well and Gemma is to undergo an MRI scan soon to discover whether an operation will enable her to one day walk again. 'Ruben's my little miracle and I really hope I will one day be able to run around with him,' she said.","Gemma Holmes collided with a car and was flung across a busy road .

"A Spanish businesswoman killed her workmate and then injected the semen of male prostitutes into her mouth and vagina to make it look as if she had been raped and murdered. MarÃ­a Ãngeles Molina was jailed for 22 years yesterday for the grisly crime committed to cover up identify theft and plot to steal â¬1million in an insurance scame. The killer, known as Angie, lured her friend Ana PÃ¡ez to a Barcelona apartment she had fraudulently rented in her victim's name just three days before. Jailed: MarÃ­a Ãngeles Molina killed her workmate before injecting the semen of male prostitutes into her mouth and vagina to make it look as if she had been raped and murdered . She sedated her friend before placing a plastic bag over her head and sealing it with gaffer tape. To make it look like her victim had been raped, Molina then injected the semen, which she had obtained from a brothel. The elaborate cover-up came after Molina had stolen PÃ¡ez's identity and used it to take out bank loans and insurance policies worth â¬1million in her name. She was pictured on CCTV entering a bank, wearing a wig, to withdraw â¬600 from an account in her victim's name. Barcelona High Court yesterday sentenced Molina to 22 years in prison. It noted 'she took advantage of her friendship to steal ID documents with the intention of gaining economic benefit'. She was given 18 years for the murder, which took place on February 19, 2008, and a further four years for fraud. The court heard that, to gain an alibi, Molina travelled to Zaragoza in a Porsche to recover the ashes of her father. When she returned to the Catalan capital she carried out her sickening crime. Police searching her home found an unopened bottle of chloroform and an insurance policy in PÃ¡ezâs name. And Molina's boyfriend at the time also passed police PÃ¡ez's original passport and ID card which he found stashed behind Molina's bathroom cistern. Molina denied the charges and said she was out shopping at the time of the murder. She told the court: 'Without yoghurts or condensed milk I am nothing.' But the court ruled: 'The amount and the relevance of the evidence, amply accredited, leave no doubt as to the identity of the killer.'","MarÃ­a Ãngeles Molina had racked up â¬1million debts in Ana PÃ¡ez's name .

"The European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize yesterday, despite a year marked by riotingÂ  and the prospect of an acrimonious break-up of the euro. Awarding the prize, the Norwegian committee praised the EU for itsÂ  six decades of contributions 'to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rightsÂ  in Europe'. However, the announcement caused widespread bemusement and derision, with critics pointing out that it comes as the eurozone battles the worst recession for nearly a century. Scroll down for video . The European Union will receive the $1.2million dollar prize in December . The past 12 months have also seen Brussels help to push aside the democratically elected governments in Greece and Italy, and widespread civil unrest and rioting. This week saw Greek citizens dressed as Nazis burn swastika flags to protest at a visit to Athens by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Last night former Chancellor Lord Lamont ridiculed the decision, saying: 'Today's decision seems preposterous and absurd. 'It would require a heart of stone not to die of laughter. It is the most ridiculous decision since the committee gave the peace prize to Barack Obama when he had been US President for two minutes.' Norwegian Nobel committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland today said the award was for the 'advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe' The world's media gathered for the shock announcement at a press conference in Oslo, Norway . Nobel committee chairmanÂ  Thorbjoern Jagland acknowledged that the EU was facing 'graveÂ  economic difficulties and considerable social unrest'. But he insisted: 'The stabilising part played by the EU has helped to transform most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace.' The announcement was greeted with glee in Brussels, where European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso added: 'The EU is something very precious. We should cherish it for the good of Europeans and for the good of the entire world.' And former prime minister Tony Blair said: 'The EU is one of the defining concepts of the last half century. We would do well to remember that when the Second World War ended Europe was in ruins. What followed has been over 50 years of peace and progress.' Yasser Arafat was awarded the prize in 1994 for his role in advancing the Middle East peace process . In winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the EU has joined an inglorious list of people and organisations, including: . Barack Obama was given the prize in 2009 â nine moths after his election âÂ  for âstrengthening international diplomacyâ shortly before hisÂ  escalation of the drone wars in Afghanistan. Critics claim he was actually handed it for being the first black President in US history Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchu won the prize in 1992 for her campaigns to help the poor. She was later exposed as having made up many of her achievements. Here is a list of recipients in the last decade:2012: The European Union2011: Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberian activist Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman of Yemen.2010: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.2009: US President Barack Obama 2008: Martti Ahtisaari, UN Special Envoy at the Kosovo status process talks2007: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Al Gore2006: Bangladeshi banker Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank2005: International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei2004: Kenyan enivronmental activist Wangari Maathai2003: Iranian lawyer and human rights campaigner Shirin Ebadi2002: Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter . However, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said: 'Never a week goes by that we don't see riots and protests in capital cities against the economic prison they have imposed. Rather than bring peace and harmony, the EU will cause insurgency and violence.' Arch eurosceptic Bill Cash said: 'It is like giving an Oscar to a box office flop. It is thanks to Nato, the Marshall Plan and the help of the United States that Europe maintained peace after World War Two, certainly not the European Union.' Ridicule also flowed in from the City, where businesses and banks fear a breakup of the euro. Peter Hargreaves, co-founder of financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'It's mad.

'The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2012 is to be awarded to the European Union (EU). 'The union and its forerunners have for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe. 'In the inter-war years, the Norwegian Nobel Committee made several awards to persons who were seeking reconciliation between Germany and France. 'Since 1945, that reconciliation has become a reality. 'The dreadful suffering in World War II demonstrated the need for a new Europe. Over a seventy-year period, Germany and France had fought three wars. 'Today war between Germany and France is unthinkable. This shows how, through well-aimed efforts and by building up mutual confidence, historical enemies can become close partners. 'In the 1980s, Greece, Spain and Portugal joined the EU. The introduction of democracy was a condition for their membership. 'The fall of the Berlin Wall made EU membership possible for several Central and Eastern European countries, thereby opening a new era in European history. 'The division between East and West has to a large extent been brought to an end; democracy has been strengthened; many ethnically-based national conflicts have been settled. 'The admission of Croatia as a member next year, the opening of membership negotiations with Montenegro, and the granting of candidate status to Serbia all strengthen the process of reconciliation in the Balkans. In the past decade, the possibility of EU membership for Turkey has also advanced democracy and human rights in that country. 'The EU is currently undergoing grave economic difficulties and considerable social unrest. 'The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to focus on what it sees as the EU's most important result: the successful struggle for peace and reconciliation and for democracy and human rights. 'The stabilizing part played by the EU has helped to transform most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace. 'The work of the EU represents ""fraternity between nations"", and amounts to a form of the ""peace congresses"" to which Alfred Nobel refers as criteria for the Peace Prize in his 1895 will.'","Nobel committee said the award was for 'the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights'

"The New York City cop who killed an unarmed man last week knew he was in trouble just seconds after the fatal shooting. Officer Peter Liang told his partnerÂ Shaun Landau, 'I think I'm going to get fired,' moments after he 'accidentally' fired his gun on Thursday evening at theÂ Louis Pink Houses in the East New York section of Brooklyn, and before he was aware of the fact that he had even struck someone with a bullet. That victim, 28-year-old Akai Gurley, was pronounced dead at Brookdale Hospital shortly after the shooting and his death has been ruled a homicide. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The officer who killed young father Akai Gurley (above) in Brooklyn last Thursday told his partner 'I think I'm going to get fired' seconds after the fatal shooting . Accident: Officer Peter Liang claims he was holding a flashlight and had his gun drawn when he accidentally fired, striking Gurley in the chest while the young man was in a darkened stairwell (above) Scene of the crime: It all happened at theÂ Louis Pink Houses (above) in the East New York section of Brooklyn . According to an internal police report obtained by the New York Post, Liang entered the darkened eighth floor stairwell landing with his gun drawn and a flashlight in his hands Thursday evening during a routine patrol. The report then states, 'Almost instantly, Officer Liang discharged his service weapon one time directly outward.' That bullet traveled down approximately 12 feet, striking Gurley in the chest. Liang and Landau, both rookies, then ran down the stairwell, eventually coming across Gurley's girlfriend, Melissa Butler, sobbing over his body. The four did not exchange any words, and Liang called for an ambulance. Butler then ran to a neighbor's apartment to call 911, saying she 'feared for her life.' Lt. Vitaliy Zelikov, who arrived on the scene in the aftermath, said Liang was 'visibly upset, shaken up and clearly very distraught.' Left behind: Gurley was the father to a two-year-old daughter, Akaila (above) Justice: Now, the Brooklyn district attorney's office is launching an investigation into the shooting as friends and family mourn Gurley's death (above) On Monday, Butler met with Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson who is investigating the shooting. Thompson also met with community leaders on Sunday, this after more than 250 people marched in protest outside Liang's 75th Precinct on Saturday while holding up signs calling for justice. The Internal Affairs Bureau of the NYPD has also launched an investigation into the shooting of Gurley, Commissioner Bill Bratton called a 'total innocent.' Gurley, who has been described as a 'peacemaker,' was the father to a two-year-old daughter, Akaila.","Officer Peter Liang told his partner Shaun Landau, 'I Think I'm going to get fired' just seconds after shooting an unarmed young father in Brooklyn .

"Lieutenant John Thornton, 22, of 40 Commando, wrote the diary in the days leading up to his death . Poignant extracts from the war diary of a Royal Marine killed in Afghanistan have revealed he predicted his own death in a roadside bomb blast. Lieutenant John Thornton, 22, of 40 Commando, wrote the diary in the days leading up to his death. His vehicle struck a roadside bomb in the Kajaki area of Helmand Province in March 2008. The spiral bound memoirs, detailing every moment of his six month tour, have now been published in a new book entitled âHelmand: Diaries of Front-Line Soldiersâ, after his mother Linda painstakingly typed up his scribbled notes. It opens with an emotional account of him writing his 'death letters' to his family and friends and goes on to reveal his growing fear that the prevalence of improvised explosive devices was rendering survival a numbers game. He writes: '... it has dawned on me just how high the threat is from an IED strike within our area. I think it's the same for most when I say it is not the bullets that scare me but the cowardly bombs.' He was so convinced he would die, that during a patrol on December 27 he organised for an ambulance to follow behind him because he was convinced there would be an explosion, the Sunday Times reports. He writes: 'I apologise for writing my last entry as if I was about to die. I genuinely thought that I would.' The book features dramatic details of battles and attacks by enemy insurgents, with one episode leaving him feeling 'physically sick' after one of his troop fired three grenades which landed close to another group of British soldiers. The marine pictured with Daily Mail Defence Correspondent  Matthew Hickely in Helmand Province, Southern Afghanistan in December 2007.  He died in an IED explosion on Sunday 30 March 2008 . It also notes the sometimes absurd . nature of war. In one entry he describes watching what he thought was an . insurgent for five hours, but turned out to be a large owl. He was told by his . superiors that his men were constantly singing his praises and that he . was in line for a mentoring job at the commando training centre in . Devon. The book also includes an tribute from the Reverend Stuart Hallam, who was with ThorntonÂ  - nicknamed JT - when he died. He said he held his head as the operating theatre was 'awash with his blood'. But he added: 'JT just lay there looking utterly peaceful-Â  he was in a better place - certainly a better one than the rest of us.' He then describes having to find a room and weep alone at the young man's death, before breaking the news to a group of marines who had gathered outside the hospital. In 2011 Thorntonâs brother, Ian, deployed to Afghanistan in command of 9 Platoon from the 1st Battalion, to an area of Helmand province not far from where he fell. Ianâs diaries are also included in the book to highlight the vast progress that has been achieved in Helmand since his brotherâs deployment. The 31-year-old - who carried his brother's death letter inside his body armour when he went on patrolÂ  - spoke of his determination that he should not die on duty for his family's sake.

"A southwest Ohio family is searching for Sasquatch no longer. The Spence family in Delhi Township, west of Cincinnati, says their 400-pound concrete statue of the mythical beast, which was reported stolen Saturday, has been found. Sixty-one-year-old Ralph Spence says his two sons bought the statue for him several years ago. They affectionately call it 'Squashy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Found: Ralph Spence, 61, received a call from a friend saying he saw the estimated 400-pound statue nicknamed 'Squashy' in a nearby open field after it went missing on Saturday . The note: This letter was found with Ralph Spence's prized Sasquatch when it was found in a nearby open field wearing a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap and a new sweater . Though it started out as a practical joke, the statue became part of the family. They even dress it up for holidays. Spence says he received a call from a friend Tuesday who saw the statue in a nearby open field. A note found with the statue poked fun at its weight, and was signed by 'the body building bandits.' Fox reports that in the phone conversation Spence was told, 'that Sasquatch was chilling out in an open field near Pedretti and Mayhew.' 'Sasquatch is back home and appears to be in good health. During his absence, Sasquatch was given a nice sweater and Cincinnati Reds ball cap.' Spence says Squashy is 'a legend around here in the neighbourhood.' 'Sasquatch has been reunited with his owner and it feels so good,' reads an alert sent out Tuesday from Delhi Township police. Fox reports that the Spence family only paid $250 for the Sasquatch at a flea market but that it has a sentimental value thatâs worth much more.

"The Metropolitan Police examined the phone records of more than 1,700 journalists, lawyers and staff working for News UK, it has emerged . Scotland Yard has examined the mobile phone records of more than 1,700 journalists, lawyers and staff working for News UK, it emerged last night. In a major breach of privacy laws, Vodafone handed over data from phones belonging to journalists, lawyers, secretarial staff and senior executives working for The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun newspapers between 2005 and 2007 to the Metropolitan Police. Detectives working on Operation Elveden, which is investigating alleged payments by journalists to âpublic officialsâ, requested data last October from the phone of one reporter who had been arrested. But when the telecoms giant mistakenly disclosed a mass of staff phone records, police held onto the material for seven months despite requests to return it. It is feared that the data could have compromised confidential journalistic sources. Detectives conducted an analysis of the records and built a spreadsheet listing outgoing calls made from 1,757 phones, even know they knew the information relating to innocent journalists had been passed on improperly. The data breach is now being investigated by the privacy watchdog bodies, the Information Commissioner (ICO) and the Interception of Communications Commissionerâs Office (IOCCO). The latter, which is also investigating police use of surveillance powers against journalists, said the case was of âvery significant concernâ and it has urged the publisher News UK to take up the matter with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The case comes amid concerns about the extent to which police use surveillance powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) against journalists and their sources. The Met used Ripa to find who leaked the police log of the Plebgate incident to The Sun while Essex Police used the law to discover a journalistâs source in the Chris Huhne speeding points affair. Yesterday Vodafone said the material was âa corrupted datasetâ. A spokesman told The Times: âWe wrote to the Met to express our grave concern that the police continued to retain the data released to them in error and made it clear to them that any assumption that meaningful conclusions could be drawn from any aspect of the corrupted dataset was highly questionable.â The Met said it conducted an analysis on the âexcess dataâ to extract information about the phone contact between five more people â including journalists, lawyers and sources â who were under suspicion in police investigations into journalistic activity. A spokesman said: âWe recognised the sensitivity of the excess data provided and ensured it was retained securely, until it was returned to Vodafone. The Metropolitan Police consulted with the Interception of Communications Commissionerâs Office, and the Information Commissioner on how this error should best be managed. âThe Met agreed that it would only use the material for a policing purpose, when in the interests of justice to do so, and where people were already charged and facing criminal proceedings.â An IOCCO investigation has exonerated the Met, blaming Vodafone for the error.","Scotland Yard examined phone records of more than 1,700 News UK staff .

The Australian was in the U.S. on a baseball . scholarship and was returning from a visit to his girlfriend when he was . senselessly gunned down because the teens were 'bored'. Former Deputy Prime Minister Tim . Fischer called for his fellow countrymen to think of this shooting when . they are planning a trip to the United States. 'People . (who) are thinking of going to the USA on business, vacation, trips, . should think carefully about it given the statistical facts you are 15 . times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Australia per . capita per million people,' he told CNN's Piers Morgan. 'It is another example of murder and mayhem on Main Street.' For .

'This . is clearly a tragic death, and we extend our condolences to the family . and the loved ones. We understand that local authorities are focused on . bringing those responsible to justice.

But two of the accused teens' parents insist they were not involved in the killing, according to News.com.au.

"A man suffering from ALS, who shared his story with millions in a touching Ice Bucket Challenge video this summer, has been given his dream wedding. Anthony Carbajal, from Temecula, California, married his girlfriend Laarne Palec on November 19 in an intimate ceremony at the Grind Coffee Shop in Riverside, California, where the couple had spent their first date. The pair had been dating for a year this past January when the 26-year-old received the diagnosis - which was especially devastating because his mother has battled ALS for years, and the same disease took his grandmother's life. Just married:Â Anthony Carbajal, who suffers from ALS, marriedÂ his girlfriend Laarne Palec on November 19 . ALS is a neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells and causes muscle weakness, affecting one's ability to walk, talk, eat and breathe. According to the National Institutes of Health, most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within three to five years from the onset of symptoms. Mr Carbajal told Brides magazine, which helped put together the wedding, that he was hesitant to pop the question because he was worried about the amount of care he'll require when his symptoms worsen. 'I was cautious to ask Laarne to spend the rest of her life with me because this disease requires a lot of care. I donât want to be a burden on anyone,' he said. 'But throughout my diagnosis, Laarne made it clear that she wasnât going to leave my side.' Cut the cake: The coupleÂ had been dating for a year this past January when the 26-year-old received the devastating diagnosis . Unconditional love: 'She told me that she wanted to be with me through the good and the bad that's inevitable,' Mr Carbajal said . But his new bride put his fears to rest, assuring him that it was meant to be. 'She told me that she wanted to be with me through the good and the bad that's inevitable. Then I got down on my knee and proposed. Having her tell me that she loves me unconditionally was priceless and I think, looking back, I needed that,' he said. Mr and Mrs Carbajal are both wedding photographers and met when he was hired to shoot her sister's nuptials. First look:Â Mr Carbajal waits to see the bride in her wedding dress as she walks up behind him . Common interest:Â Mr and Mrs Carbajal are both wedding photographers and met when he was hired to shoot her sister's nuptials nearly two years ago . Mr Carbajal said that as a newlywed, he's now even more determined to fight the illness. 'Iâm doing whatever I can to change my outcome and be on this earth longer with Laarne. I think thatâs the hardest thing - I found my soulmate and ALS might take me away from her earlier,' he added. The wedding took place in front of 100 friends and family members, and the groom said that the couple 'just wanted all of our loved ones to feel like they were at home, have a good time and celebrate our love with us.' Determined: 'Iâm doing whatever I can to change my outcome and be on this earth longer with Laarne,' Mr Carbajal said . First dance: The groom said that the couple 'just wanted all of our loved ones to feel like they were at home, have a good time and celebrate our love with us' Special place: The ceremony was held at the Grind Coffee Shop in Riverside, California, where the couple had spent their first date . He's now eagerly anticipating the the joys of married life. 'Laarne's family is very conservative. So Iâm looking forward to going on a family vacation and sleeping in the same room together!' he said. 'I look forward to having a place to call our own and getting a dog. I'm just excited to wake up with her every morning and have a cup of coffee. We see a life full of happiness together - thatâs what we see.' Mr Carbajal's ALS Challenge video, which showed him caring for his ill mother and speaking of his own fears about the disease, now has more than 16 million views. 'Nobody wants to see a depressing person that's dying and has two to five years to live. They don't want to talk about it; they don't want their day ruined,' he said in the emotional video. 'Eventually, I won't be able to use my arms or hands at all. Eventually, I won't be able to walk, talk and breathe on my own, and that's the real truth of what ALS is. It's devastating.'

"Rotting and abandoned, these ghostly Spanish villages were deserted during the recession as their owners fled the country to find jobs in the city.

Similar villages in the same region are being sold for as little as Â£50,000 which includes a three-bedroom main house along with five other buildings . At Â£50,000 the whole village costs Â£200,000 less than the average house in the UK, and Â£350,000 less than the average flat in London . Another village is being sold online for Â£75,000, the same price as a parking garage in Battersea or a two-bedroom bungalow in Bognor Regis . These pictures show the village of Pena Vella, near Pontenova, one of many similar clusters of homes that are now being sold.

According to estate agent Rafael Canales there are around 2,900 empty villages in rural Spain, . the majority of which are bought by middle-class couples in their 50s or 60s . looking for somewhere quiet for their retirement.

Crumbling: Although the structures may be crumbling, the countryside setting is idyllic . This village is described as 'an absolutely lovely natural place with much wild life, deer, trout in the streams' Families who fled the villages for the town see returning home as a step backward . Take the example of British father-of-two Neil Christie who bought the hamlet of Arrunada in an idyllic corner of rural north west Spain. Even after he has totally renovated the four dilapidated properties, he expects to have spent no more than Â£140,000 on the project. He and his wife have moved from their former home in Cumbria and are now staying in a nearby village where Mrs Christie works as a schoolteacher, while Mr Christie spends his time renovating their future home. British pensioner Neil Christie bought a village last year and expects to spend just Â£140,000 renovating it for him and his wife to live in during their retirement . The villages, some of which have been owned by the same families for generations, were abandoned during the financial crash as they headed to cities to find work . A map shows the extent of the abandoned properties across rural Spain which are being snapped up for knock-down prices, 8 per cent of which go to foreign investors . Even the most expensive village on his books, Ribadero, will set the buyers back just Â£372,000, roughly Â£25,000 less than the average London flat. Spain was one of the worst-affected countries in the recession, with unemployment surging 20 per cent in the aftermath of the crash, and today more than 5million people are still without a job. Mr Canales added that families who fled to larger towns in order to earn money are often loath to return to the country because it is viewed as taking a step backwards.

Although exercise has its indisputable health benefits, experts have said that many well-intentioned gym goers overestimate how many calories they have burned, and in turn indulge in too many sugary and fat-laden snacks. For example, it takes over an hour of intensive cycling to burn a medium shop-bought pizza. Step away from the cake:  Experts said that people tend to overestimate the amount of physical activity they get each week and in turn eat too much . 'There's a war between exercise and nutrition in our heads,' said  Jonathan Ross, spokesperson for the American Council on Exercise. 'People tend to overestimate the amount of physical activity they get. They work out a little bit and treat themselves a lot.' A report by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that although Americans say they are more active, it has not made much of a dent in the obesity epidemic that affects more than one-third of U.S. and UK adults. The amount of calories a person burns varies according to a their weight. The below was worked out using the average UK weight of a man and woman. A typical woman weighs 11 stone and a typical man weigh 13 stone. It takes a 20 minute aerobic workout for a woman to burn off a small glass of white wine. It takes a man half an hour of weight-lifting to burn one pint of beer. It takes takes half an hour of breaststroke swimming for a woman to burn one Krispy Kreme Caramel Creme Crunch doughnut . It takes around 30 minutes of vigorous jogging for a man to burn a regular-sized Mars bar. It takes a woman an hour and 20 minutes of yoga to burn one packet of Maltesers . It takes a man an hour and a quarter of moderate intensity cycling to burn a shop bought Pizza Express Sloppy Giuseppe pizza . It takes a man an hour and 20 minutes of footballÂ  to burn one packets of McCoy's Ridge Cut Salt and Vinegar crisps . Mr Ross, a personal trainer based outside Washington D.C., said exercise can play a role in weight reduction, but without broader lifestyle and nutritional changes, that role is limited. 'We put exercise in a box and once that exercise box is filled in we don't do much the rest of the day,' he explained, adding that a calorie-dense treat does not help. 'Some (weight-loss) programs stress nutrition, some stress exercise,' he told Reuters Health. 'But the two together are greater than the parts.' The National Weight Control Registry, which gathers information from people who have successfully lost at least 30 pounds (13 kg) and kept it off for a least one year, reported that 90 per cent of its members exercise, on average, about one hour per day. U.S. health officials recommend that healthy adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week, or around 20 minutes a day. Dr Joseph Donnelly, an exercise physiologist with the American College of Sports Medicine said the U.S. government guidelines are for cardiovascular fitness, not weight loss. 'It was never intended for weight management, said Dr Donnelly, a researcher who focuses on obesity at the University of Kansas. 'People have misused it.' He added that studies suggest 250 to 300 minutes of exercise per week may be the minimum to lose weight: 'At 150 minutes, the best you can hope for is weight maintenance.' Dr Michele Olson, professor of . exercise physiology at Auburn University Montgomery, in Alabama, said it . is difficult to shed pounds through exercise alone. It takes around half an hour of intensive aerobic exercise to burn off just one small glass of white wine. It takes aroundÂ  an hour and 20 minutes to burn off a packet of McCoy's Ridge-Cut crisps . 'One . pound of fat has 3,500 calories,' she explained. 'If you ran a 26-mile . marathon, where you burn about 100 calories per mile, you would burn . 2,600 calories, falling 900 calories short of burning one pound of fat.' She added that people must be physically active regardless of their size or whether they are losing weight. 'Moderately intense exercise done in as few as 10-minute increments two to three times a day markedly reduces our risk of all causes of mortality, heart disease most effectively but all other causes, including cancers, deaths due to hypertension and strokes, etc,' she said.","Study found that while more people are active in the U.S., it has not reduced the number of people who are considered overweight .

"It is an epic battle to clean up this suburban yard that has now spanned 13 years. The home on Shaftesbury Road at Elizabeth Vale, north of Adelaide, is littered with old cars, rusty bikes and broken furniture and the owner's refusal to clean it up has already cost the local council $80,000. Playford Council has been battling David Tavitian in and out of the courts for more than a decade and the fight has now landed in the supreme court. Scroll down for video . The home on Shaftesbury Road at Elizabeth Vale, north of Adelaide, is littered with old cars, rusty bikes and broken furniture . Both parties have already appeared in court to work out what Mr Tavitian can or cannot keep on his property and they have until December to make written submissions supporting each of their cases. The council has argued that the amount of old cars and bikes on Mr Tavitian's property changes the land use from residential to storage of scrap metal, which they haven't approved. Mr Tavitian's neighbour Rodney has lived across the street for nearly 30 years and says unfortunately he has become used to the scrap metal 'eyesore'.

'Everyone tries to keep their houses neat and tidy but itâs not good to look out the window at that every morning.' Another long-time neighbour, Scott, says the council once pulled out about 10 cars from his property six years ago but it's overflowing again. 'It's just a pain in the a** to be honest,' he said. 'About 10 years ago he didn't have a fence around it, so I guess they have tidied it up a bit in that time with the fence. 'You see a lot of cats and rats coming out... I wish they could just demolish it.' The battle began back in 2001 when Mr Tavitian was issued with an unsanitary condition notice after claims of a rat infestation . An environmental report in 2006 found there were faeces, an old refrigerator, wheels, and pieces of timber and metal in his yard . MrÂ Tavitian has so far successfully appealed the orders in court - once because of insufficient evidence . The owner appealed two more court warrants in 2009 saying the notices had been printed on council notepaper and had not been officially sealed .

"Sapper: Mark Antony Smith, 26, of Swanley, Kent, died in Sangin, Helmand province, in July 2010 . Failures by the Armed Forces to check for ageing shells dating back to the Cold War could be putting their own troops' lives at risk from 'friendly fire', a coroner warned today. Sapper Mark Antony Smith, 26, was killed instantly by a stray coalition smoke shell up to 30 years old as he rested in a compound in the Sangin area of Helmand in July 2010. The serviceman,  from Swanley, Kent, who was with the Army's Counter Improvised Explosive Device Task Force searching for buried bombs, was hit when the 105mm munition fell 866ft short of its intended target. The inquest into his death heard that the age of the shell and its propellant had not been tested to check if they had deteriorated. This could have been one explanation why the munition fell short of its intended target. Experts told the inquest that crucial weather data affecting the speed and direction of the shell had not been inputted correctly into a malfunctioning missile launch system. The Ministry of Defence insisted the missile was no more than three years old. But Coroner Roger Hatch said the truth of the tragedy might never be known because of the Army's 'flawed' investigation. He condemned the Army's probe as 'unsatisfactory' due to missing evidence and incomplete documentation. Mourners: Friends and family of Sapper Mark Smith at his repatriation ceremony, after he was killed in 2010 . 'I take the view that there should be a statutory inquiry into the systemic failures,' he said. 'There has been a systematic failure in the collection of that evidence that leaves questions unanswered and potentially dangers remain for soldiers who use the ammunition that has not been tested. 'Because of the age of the rounds, it is possible their condition may require verification to discuss whether the propellant may have contributed to the shell falling short. 'It is now quite clear that this was never done. What is clear from all the evidence I have heard is that we are left without knowing why there was a short fall of the fatal shell.' He pledged to report the matter to the Ministry of Defence. He concluded that Spr Smith died of catastrophic injuries 'in the course of active service when a smoke shell fell short'. Solemn: The funeral of Spr Mark Smith, who was killed by friendly fire in Sangin, Helmand, Afghanistan . There were a 'number of possibilities or . combination of factors' that the missile, designed to provide cover for . soldiers working on the ground, went 'rogue'. Soldier: Spr Smith, from 36 Engineer Regiment, was taking part in an action against the Taliban in an area described as 'highly dangerous' Spr Smith, from 36 Engineer Regiment, . was taking part in an action against the Taliban in an area described as . 'highly dangerous due to insurgent activity'. A smoke screen was requested to allow the troops to advance towards enemy positions. In the morning one shell fell 1,476ft from its target, hitting an empty compound. Later that afternoon, a second shell intended to allow soldiers to fell some trees hit another compound where Spr Smith was resting. Two other servicemen were injured. Speaking at the end of the four-day inquest in Gravesend, Kent, today, Spr Smith's devastated mother Helen said: 'We believe that Markâs death was preventable. 'The evidence shows that a broken weather computer and use of incorrect data from earlier in the day resulted in Markâs death. 'This is compounded by the fact that the investigation was flawed.Key evidence has gone missing and has never been returned to the UK. 'We will probably never know if the ammunition failed on that fateful day. We believe the Ministry of Defence needs to take responsibility for this so as to avoid further deaths.â An Army spokesman said: 'This was a tragic accident, which resulted in the death of a gifted and well-respected soldier. 'Lessons have been learnt, including ensuring that a minimum safety buffer zone of 500 metres is established before firing smoke rounds.'","Sapper Mark Antony Smith, 26, killed in July 2010 in Helmand, Afghanistan .

"A disused railway linesman's hut in Scotland has gone on sale for Â£10,000. While the station it used to service has long gone, the railway line that passes within just inches of the building is still in use - with commuter trains whistling past every hour. While owner Ian Burns, 40, says it would make the perfect retreat for a hiking or fishing enthusiast, he admits the new owners will have to be train lovers as well. Dream home: Ian Burns, 40, bought this railway linesman's hut two years ago after passing it while on the train as a child and joking to his brother how nice it would be to live there . Niche market: However after having his plans to renovate the building shot down by the local council he is now selling it, and admits the new owners would have to be train lovers . Mr Burns, originally from Dundee used to pass the hut in New Haven, Angus,  when he took the train on holiday as a boy around 25 years ago. He once joked with his brother about how nice it would be to live in the hut, and when it came on the market two year ago he 'couldn't resist' buying it. However he has been forced into selling the property after the local council blocked his plans to renovate it. He said he has already received an offer for Â£20,000, but turned it down because the buyer planned to demolish the hut, an idea he is firmly against. He said: 'It would be perfect for someone who liked walking or fishing to use, because there's lots of good place to go around here. It's only about ten minutes from the beach too. 'You would definitely have to like trains though, because they pass within touching distance about once every hour. 'It's a really historic little hut, around 100 years old, and made out of old railway sleepers. Everyone knows it locally and I don't think you'll find another one like it.' Mr Burns, who owns a landscaping company, said he bought it because he just liked the idea of owning it, but soon developed plans to bring it back to its former glory. However he found his plans for allotments and a green waste recycling centre were shot down by the local council. He added:Â 'It is sad because if the right people don't buy it, it will just get flat-packed. 'I think the council just want it gone. They'd be happy if the land was just flattened and had a pony put on it or something, but that would be a huge waste. Valuable: Mr Burns says he has already had an offer of Â£20,000 for the hut and land, but said he rejected it because the developer wanted to flatten the hut - an idea he is firmly against . Historic: Mr Burns believes the shack, which contains an original coal fireplace, is around 100 years old and used to be located on the site of East Haven railway station which was demolished in the Sixties . 'Everyone knows the hut and I would like to have it kept so am looking for a buyer willing to do something with it. 'It's still got the original coal fireplace inside. The roof does need replacing, as do a couple of the sleepers, but its a perfectly usable hut as it is. 'All that would be needed is a little time and not much money to have it back to is former glory.' The hut used to be located on the site of the East Haven railway station near to where the trains used to pull over to load up fish from the village to take to markets across the country. According to Mr Burns, there are still sleepers set into the ground around the hut showing where the tracks used to be. The station was first opened in 1838 and continued operating until 1967, when it was demolished in the wake of the Beeching Report.","Owner Ian Burns, 40, estimates that the hut is around 100 years old .

"A high school cheerleader arrested on felony sexual assault charges for her relationship with a 14-year-old female classmate has been offered a plea deal on her 19th birthday. Kaitlyn Hunt is being urged to accept the new deal which would keep her out of jail and prevent her from being registered as a sex offenderÂ  - if she pleads no contest to two misdemeanor battery counts and one felony count for interference of child custody. Her case attracted a glut of publicity after her parents did multiple interviews, claiming that their daughter was only charged because she is gay. As of May, 300,000 people have signed an online petition to have the charges against the teenager dropped. Hunt, from Florida, is facing felony charges of lewd and lascivious activity. If she goes to trial, she faces 15 years in prison if convicted. Scroll down for video . Criminal? Hunt could be hauled away from an emergency hearing scheduled for August 20 in cuffs if a judge finds she violated her court orders to stay away from her 14-year-old girlfriend . Violations: Hunt allegedly smuggled an iPod to her girlfriend and the two traded messages, including naked photos and masturbation videos from Hunt . As of Wednesday, Hunt had not make it known if she would accept the deal. Under a previous plea deal in May, . Kaitlyn would have been forced to register as a sex offender as well as . remain on house arrest for two years. The latest plea deal was offered by the Florida state attorney's office in July, reported CNN, because it balances the needs of Hunt, the unidentified teenage girl and their parents. Under the deal, Hunt would be placed on probation for three years and have a curfew of 11pm for the first year. She must also agree never to contact the 14-year-old girl again. Her criminal record would later be expunged or sealed. Civil rights? Kaitlyn Hunt's parents took her case public after they claimed she was targeted because she is gay. While out on bond and barred from seeing the girl, Hunt may have had sex with her as recently as July . New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her . Hunt's parents say that the . younger girl's parents demanded that Kaitlyn be arrested because they . can't come to terms with the fact that their teenage daughter had a . relationship with another girl. Worldwide support: Thousands of people have protested against the prosecution of Hunt as a sex offender. But will they support her if she broke the terms of her bond with the aid of her mother? Hunt's . family claim that the relationship between the two girls was . consensual. However under Florida law, a person under the age of 16 is . not considered to be able to legally consent to sex. The victims' parents say that they are only protecting their daughter and it has nothing to do with her being gay. The Hunt family have tried to turn the case into a civil rights issue - claiming Kaitlyn was only charged because she is a lesbian. More than 160,000 people have signed a Change.org petition asking Assistant State Attorney Brian Workman to drop the charges. More than 44,000 people have taken up the cause on Facebook. Kaitlyn has said the legal battle has been emotionally draining. She was expelled from Sebastian River High School near central Florida's Atlantic coast. 'Every day's different. Some days I'm my happy self. Some days I'm overwhelmed, some days I'm scared,' she said. Gay rights advocates say older high . schoolers dating their younger counterparts is an innocuous, everyday . occurrence that is not prosecuted â regardless of sexual orientation â . and not a crime on par with predatory sex offenses.

"Thanksgiving could be the best day to shop all year. An analysis of sales data and store circulars by two research firms contradicts conventional wisdom that Black Friday is when shoppers can get the most and biggest sales of the year. Turns out, shoppers will find more discounted items in stores that are open on Thanksgiving. For example, there are a total of 86 laptops and tablets deeply discounted as door buster deals at Best Buy, Wal-Mart and others on the holiday compared with just nine on Black Friday, according to an analysis of promotions for The Associated Press by researcher MarketTrack. New trend: The Friday after Thanksgiving has long been the day to grab the best bargains of the holiday shopping season but new data suggests Thanksgiving is taking that crown, at least online . And on the Web, discounts will be deeper on the holiday. Online prices on Thanksgiving are expected to be about 24per cent cheaper compared with 23per cent on Black Friday and 20per cent on Cyber Monday, according to Adobe, which tracks data on 4,500 retail web sites. The data is the latest proof that retailers are slowly redefining the Black Friday tradition. It's been the biggest shopping day of the year for decades, mostly because it's traditionally when retailers pull out their best sales events. But in the last few years, retailers like the Gap, Target and Toys R Us have started opening their stores and offering holiday discounts on Thanksgiving to better compete with online rivals. 'I was surprised, but it really shifted one day,' said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst at Adobe, which is based in San Jose, California. Shoppers already are noticing the deals on Thanksgiving. Corey Grassell, 34, of Appleton, Wisconsin, said he plans to shop for deals on Thanksgiving and bypass Black Friday. That's after he grabbed bargains last year on the holiday, including a washer-dryer combination at Sears for about $800, a 50per cent discount. 'I feel guilty for going out on Thanksgiving, but the deals are so much more attractive to me than on Black Friday,' he says. Peak season: Most big retailers acknowledge that they're starting to offer deals on Thanksgiving that previously were reserved for Black Friday . But some industry watchers fear others won't shop on Thanksgiving, choosing to keep the day sacred. Those who wait instead to shop on Black Friday could wind up being disappointed with the leftover deals, they say. In fact, according to Deloitte Research's recent survey of shoppers, about two-thirds say they're not motivated to go out to stores Thanksgiving because it's important to be with family and friends. 'Shoppers could be disappointed and find that the hot items on their list are not in stock on Black Friday because of the early push by retailers,' says Traci Gregorski, MarketTrack's vice president of marketing. She says she's conducting a survey of shoppers after the holiday shopping weekend to see how retailers fared. 'We want to get shoppers' perception of these deals,' she says. Most big retailers acknowledge that they're starting to offer deals on Thanksgiving that previously were reserved for Black Friday. Jeff Haydock, a spokesman at Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, said the best deals become available Thanksgiving when its doors open at 5pm. For example, one of Best Buy's Thanksgiving specials is a $899 55-inch LED Smart TV, the lowest price it has ever offered on a Samsung ultra-high definition TV of this size.  That will be available on Friday - if supplies last. Mixed view: Some industry watchers fear others won't shop on Thanksgiving and keep the day sacred . 'Naturally, more of the deals are being pulled into Thursday because our stores are open,' says Haydock. Brian Hanover, a spokesman at Sears, which is opening at 6pm Thursday, also says Thanksgiving specials spill into Black Friday. But the quantities for the 1,000 door busters are limited. They include Nordic Track treadmills for $699.99, or an $800 discount, and a 36per cent savings on a Whirlpool laundry machine, regularly priced at $549.99. 'It probably behooves the customer to shop earlier on Thanksgiving,' he says. For its part, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, says it's spreading out discounts online and in the store. But Gregorski, of MarketTrack's says its 'evident' in Wal-Mart's circular that 'the best deals are on Thanksgiving.' To be sure, for its two sales events on Thanksgiving, Wal-Mart devotes 36 pages of its circular to discounted TVs, computers and other items. On Black Friday- Wal-Mart has four pages of deals.","New research contradicts conventional wisdom that Black Friday is when shoppers can get the most and biggest sales of the year .

"New details have emerged about the death of a promising young diplomat from Chicago who was killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. Anne Smedinghoff, 25, died on Saturday with five other Americans in the deadliest day in the war in eight months. It was initially suggested that  Smedinghoff was in armed convoy that had just left its headquarters when it was attacked. It is now being reported that the group was not only on foot, but was also lost on the way to a book-giving ceremony. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Promising: Anne Smedinghoff, 25, was working to create opportunities for women in Afghanistan . An Afghan television reporter who was with Smedinghoff but survived the attack, told McClatchy that the group were walking to what they thought was a school before the blast. Ahmad Zia Abed, who works for Shamshad TV, was wounded in the attack. He said that the party of around a dozen people was being escorted by U.S. soldiers on the 200-yard walk from the Provincial Reconstruction Team headquarters to the building. However, according to Abed, as soon as they got to the gate they were informed that it wasn't a school, but the agriculture institute instead. As reported by McClatchy, the group then began to retrace their steps and work out what they were going to do. It was then that the suicide bomb was detonated. Killed: Smedinghoff, seen here in body armor and a helmet, was killed along with five other Americans by a suicide car bomber in Afghanistan . Tribute: Friends and neighbors of diplomat Anne Smedingoff, 25, tie a ribbon on a tree in River Forest, Illinois. The young U.S. diplomat died in a suicide attack in Afghanistan . Abed explained that he was at the head of the group as they were filing back towards the base from the road. He then felt something slam into his back and saw a car wheel roll past. 'At first I thought that a car had left the road and struck me,' Abed told McClatchy. 'But then I turned around and saw it had been a bomb.' This account contradicts earlier reports that Smedinghoff's group had been traveling in an armored vehicle and raises many questions about the circumstances of this tragic day. The fact that the group was traveling by foot made it much more vulnerable and the FBI has launched investigations into the attack. Smedinghoff, 25, is the first member of the Foreign Service killed in the 12-year-old war in Afghanistan. She is also the first American . diplomat to die overseas since the consulate attacks in Benghazi, . Libya, claimed the lives of Ambassador Chris Stevens and Sean Smith. She had been working with schools and businesses to improve the lives of girls and women in the southern province of Zabul. Afghan National Army soldiers rushing to the scene moments after a car bomb exploded in front the PRT, Provincial Reconstruction Team, in Qalat, Zabul province, southern Afghanistan . 'It was a great adventure for her ... She loved it,' her father, Tom Smedinghoff, said. 'She was tailor-made for this job.' Smedinghoff, . a Johns Hopkins graduate, and the other Americans were on a mission to . donate books to Afghan students on Saturday when they were attacked. Three . Americans soldiers and a civilian Defense Department employee were . killed along with Smedinghoff. Four other diplomats were injured, one . critically. The attack appeared to aimed at a convoy carrying the . provincial governor. The governor was not injured, but an Afghan doctor . was killed. An American . civilian adviser to the Afghan military was also killed in a separate . attack in the east of the country, bringing the death toll to six. It was the deadliest day for Americans since August 16 when seven soldiers died in a pair of attacks in Kandahar. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday railed against the 'cowardly' terrorists responsible for the attack. Tragic: Anne Smedinghoff worked in Venezuela before she volunteered for Afghanistan . At a news conference with Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, Kerry described Smedinghoff as 'a selfless, idealistic woman who woke up yesterday morning and set out to bring textbooks to school children, to bring them knowledge.' 'Anne and those with her,' Kerry said, 'were attacked by the Taliban terrorists who woke up that day not with a mission to educate or to help, but with a mission to destroy. A brave American was determined to brighten the light of learning through books, written in the native tongue of the students she had never met, whom she felt it incumbent to help.' The violence - hours after the U.S. military's top officer arrived for consultations with Afghan and U.S.-led coalition officials - illustrates the instability plaguing the nation as foreign forces work to pull nearly all their combat troops out of the country by the end of 2014. The attacks came just days after insurgents stormed a courthouse, killing more than 46 people in one of the deadliest attacks of the war. Smedinghoff's father Tom told the Chicago Tribune she had met Kerry when he visited Afghanistan last month. She has helped organize the Secretary of State's trip to the country last year, he said. He said his daughter died doing what she loved and believed in. Passionate: Smedinghoff joined the Foreign Service out of college and was first posted in Venezuela. She later volunteered to go to Afghanistan . 'She was living in a compound that was heavily fortified and she was always trying to get out and do things for the population,' he said. He said family members would tease her about signing up for a less dangerous location, maybe London or Paris. 'She said, ""What would I do in London or Paris? It would be so boring,""' her father recalled. He said she would spend her free time traveling as much as possible. Mr Smedinghoff said his daughter and her colleagues knew the assignments were dangerous, though she spent most of her time at the U.S. Embassy compound. Tragedy: Six American troops and civilians and an Afghan doctor were killed in attacks on Saturday in southern and eastern Afghanistan as the U.S. military's top officer began a weekend visit . 'It's like a nightmare, you think it will go away and it's not,' he said. 'We keep saying to ourselves, we're just so proud of her, we take consolation in the fact that she was doing what she loved.' She joined the State Department immediately after finishing college at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Her first post was in Venezuela, . another nation where the U.S. is struggling diplomatically. When her . tour there ended, she volunteered to go to Afghanistan. 'She . tragically gave her young life working to give young Afghans the . opportunity to have a better future,' Kerry said in a statement. 'We . also honor the U.S. troops and Department of Defense civilian who lost . their lives, and the Afghan civilians who were killed today as they . worked to improve the nation they love.' Taliban . spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi claimed responsibility for the attack in . Zabul and said the bomber was seeking to target either a coalition . convoy or the provincial governor . 'We were waiting for one of them,' Ahmadi said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. 'It was our good luck that both appeared at the same time.' Black smoke rises from the bombing scene, where the Taliban allegedly attacked a U.S. convoy leaving a hospital compound . The deaths bring the number of foreign military troops killed this year to 30, including 22 Americans. Provincial Governor Mohammad Ashraf Nasery, who survived the attack in Qalat, said the explosion occurred in front of a hospital and a coalition base housing a provincial reconstruction team, or PRT. International civilian and military workers at the PRT train Afghan government officials and help with local development projects. Nasery said the car bomb exploded as his convoy was passing the hospital. He said the doctor was killed, and two of his bodyguards and a student from the school were wounded. 'The governor's convoy was at the gate of the school at the same time the (coalition) convoy came out from the PRT,' said provincial police chief General Ghulam Sakhi Rooghlawanay. 'The suicide bomber blew himself up between the two convoys.' Nasery said he thought his convoy was the intended target. 'I'm safe and healthy,' he told the AP in a telephone interview. Adventure: Smedingoff's family said she traveled the world and joined the Foreign Service so that he could help people across the world . Insurgents have stepped up attacks around the country in recent weeks as Afghanistan enters what could be one of the most critical periods following the U.S. invasion in late 2001 that ousted the Taliban. The majority of U.S. and coalition forces are expected to begin a significant drawdown in the latter part of this year, leaving Afghan forces in charge of security across the country within months. Afghanistan also is gearing up for a presidential election next spring, and the Taliban have not yet accepted an offer to engage in peace talks in the Gulf state of Qatar. There currently are about 100,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including 66,000 from the United States. The U.S. troop total is scheduled to drop to about 32,000 by early next year, with the bulk of the decline occurring during the winter months. While there has been no final decision on the size of the post-2014 force, U.S. and NATO leaders say they are considering a range of between 8,000 and 12,000 - most of them trainers and advisers.","Anne Smedinghoff, 25, of Chicago, died in a suicide attack in Zabul Province, Afghanistan .

"Comedians The Bondi Hipsters thought they'd caught Tony Abbott out 'buying' Facebook friends when a graph was released showing most of his 395,000 followers were based in the Indian capital of New Delhi. 'Hey Tony brah... Hahve [sic] you been buying Facebook likes?... Either thaht of you're really popular with 18-34 year olds from New Delhi,' they wrote on Facebook, in a comment that soon triggered a torrent of debate on the internet. In just the last week, the number of followers of Mr Abbott increased by a staggering 15 per cent - dwarfing any other political figure in Australia. This came at a time when the Prime Minister was struggling in the polls. Comedians The Bondi Hipsters questioned the Prime Minister's surge in popularity on their Facebook page . Tony Abbott's rise in popularity was because Indian Prime Minister Narendra ModiÂ posted a 'selfie' with Â the Prime Minister on his  Facebook page - which triggered more than 700,000 likes and saw Abbott's followers jump 15 percent . But Liberal Party supporters were quick to jump to the defence of their leader, pointing out that his increase in fans from India appeared to be because of a series of posts with the  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has more than 25 million fans on his Facebook. Mr Modi posted a 'selfie' of the pair at the Melbourne Cricket Ground last Tuesday,Â along with a caption: 'With my friend Tony Abbott at the MCG' and has received more than 700,000 'likes'. BuzzFeed reported that on the same day, Abbott's page 'exploded' with likes, especially from young people from New Delhi, with the most popular age group ranging between 18 to 34 year olds.

"The secret to everlasting life may have been found, if this 19th century âmiracle cureâ proves to be the real deal. In May, archaeologists found bottles beneath a hotel construction site in New York that once contained medicinal remedies. One of these,Â called the 'Elixir of Long Life' was once believed to be capable of cheating death, and the team are now preparing to make it and try the miracle cure for themselves. A team of archaeologists is to recreate a liquid concoction once used for medicinal purposes. Chrysalis Archaeology claim a remedy known as the Elixir of Long Life was believed to have once been stored in a glass vial (pictured), which was found beneath a construction site in New York . The find of hundreds of bottles detailing drinking and eating habits from 150 years ago was made during an excavation under the construction site in Chinatown, New York. Ingredients . Aloes -Â  0.46 ounces (13 grams) Rhubarb - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Gentian - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Zedoary (also known as white turmeric) - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Spanish saffron - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Water - four fluid ounces (114 millilitres) Grain alcohol (vodka, gin) - 12 fluid ounces (240 millilitres) Method . Squeeze out the liquid from the aloes. Crush the rhubarb, gentian and saffron together and then mix them with the aloe liquid. Then let the mixture sit for three days but shake it every so often. It will then need to be filtered before it can be served. The site had previously been a German beer garden and music hall established in 1858 called the Atlantic Garden. One of the bottles found was a small greenish bottle that, upon closer inspection, seemed to have once contained a drink intended to grant the consumer a longer life. The team behind the find at Chrysalis Archaeology decided to find out for themselves what exactly the drink was. They tracked down the recipe from a medical guide and found it contained ingredients still in use today. âWe decided to engage in our own brand of experimental archaeology,â president of Chrysalis Alyssa Loorya told DNAinfo. âWe wanted to know what this stuff actually tasted like.â The drink itself contains a few herbs and a lot of alcohol, with the team suggesting it is best to drink it one drop at a time rather than in gulps. A second drink, known as Dr Hostetters Stomach Bitters, another popular medicine used to apparently cure ailments, was also unearthed. This contains gentian root, orange peel, cinnamon, anise, coriander seed, cardamom seed, peruvian bark, gum kino, grain alcohol, water and sugar. The team are planning to recreate both drinks in the coming weeks - although theyâve also released recipes for both so that people can make the cocktails themselves.

A second bottle once containing a drink known as Dr Hostetters Stomach Bitters, another popular medicine used to apparently cure ailments, was also unearthed (pictured). It is a bit harder to make, though, with ingredients including peruvian bark and gum kino . Such miracle concoctions were apparently quite common in the 19th century and they were often found in bars. âLong before the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] was formed, doctors and chemists of the late 19th century invented a number of interesting concoctions to treat common ailments,â Chrysalis wrote on their blog. âBottled in glass and given almost comical names, they were sold at neighbourhood apothecaries. âPracticing our own brand of experimental archaeology, weâve decided to recreate the past based on medicine bottles we recently found at an archeological site. âWeâre excited that weâve tracked down actual recipes for an âElixir of Long Lifeâ and âStomach Bittersâ to match up with labels on our old bottles. âSince both formulas required copious amounts of alcohol as a medium, it may have been difficult for consumers to determine whether the âactive ingredientsâ were actually effective. â . The team also added that, perhaps surprisingly, many of the ingredients are still used today. âGentian, for example, is still used to stimulate appetite and treat gastric complaints and jaundice.â Cinnamon, meanwhile, is believed to reduce blood-sugar levels, while aloe is popular for treating burns says the team. âWeâre not expecting the results of our experiment to extend life expectancy or threaten the modern gastroenterologistâs salary range,â they add, âbut at least weâll show off our chemistry prowess and relive the meticulous work and interesting fragrances of yesteryearâs snake oil industry.â","Archaeologists are to recreate a drink once found in a 150-year-old bottle .

"They are known some of the most deadly animals in the sea - responsible for a large percentage of fatal human attacks. But these divers are unfazed as they feed tiger sharks by hand off the coast of the Bahamas. Belgian underwater photographer Ellen Cuylaerts, 44, captured the photographs in a shallow sand bank off the coast of Tiger Beach. Scroll down for video . The terrifying underwater photos capture a tiger shark being fed by expert Debra Canabal off the coast of the Bahamas . Ms Canabal claims the experience of diving with sharks is not dangerous if divers are well-informed about the situation . The spectacular action shots were captured by Belgian underwater photographerÂ Ellen Cuylaerts . The shark diver in the photos is Debra Canabal, a specialist who runs diving workshops, allowing holidaymakers to get up-close with the 'misunderstood' animals. Ellen, now living in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, explains: 'In these photographs you see a tiger shark coming to feed at the bait crate for the first time. 'The bait crate is used to establish a connection between divers and sharks. 'In this case it was used to gain trust in order to remove hooks from their mouths, which had been put there by hunters. The tiger shark, among the most dangerous shark species for human fatalities, is not afraid to show its teeth as it prepares to be fed . The shark proves it is impatient as it tries to get at the food being held under the basket by Ms Canabal . Ms Cuylaerts says the situation isn't dangerous if you accept you are entering the shark's realm when you head underwater . The dramatic images were taken off the coast of the aptly-named Tiger Beach in the Bahamas . 'The shark handler was Debra Canabal. She's a delicate 5ft tall, fragile looking mother-of-one, and she runs a shark diving operation with her husband Vincent Canabal. 'When I saw Debra handling the shark and gaining its trust, I, as a woman, felt proud. 'The shark diving world is still dominated by men, where lots of adrenaline and action can be found, but it does not have to be like this. 'More and more women are proving that peaceful encounters can be just as fulfilling.' Spending a total of eight hours with the sharks, Ellen was able to photograph the creatures 23ft deep underwater and watch as the instructors fed them. Ms Canabal offers diving trips for holidaymakers to get up-close to the sharks that swim in the waters off various different beaches . MsÂ Cuylaerts spent eight hours with the sharks in total in order to capture the spectacular images . The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter, and is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, consuming a variety of prey ranging from fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, dolphins and even other smaller sharks. Although shark attacks are a relatively rare phenomenon, the tiger shark is responsible for a large percentage of fatal attacks and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species. Ms Cuylaerts says: 'It's not dangerous if you are well informed and know what to do. The tiger shark seems unfazed by the scuba divers who gathered to capture images and footage of the dangerous animals . 'In my opinion descending and ascending is the trickiest part of those shark dives, not because of the sharks but because of the current and your position and place in the water. 'If you enter the water with sharks you have to be aware that you enter their realm and you have to adapt. 'Having an eye on all sharks at any time and knowing how to react when they come too close for comfort is the key! 'While a lot of people don't like the idea of feeding marine life, we have to admit that this allows us to come in close contact with sharks and capture images of them that can educate people that sharks are no man-eaters or mindless killers, and that we need to protect them.'","The close-up shots were taken by Belgian photographer Ellen Cuylaerts in the Bahamas .

"Elizabeth Hurley said hardly anything was written about breast cancer when her grandmother died of the disease in 1992 . Elizabeth Hurley has described her anger at being unable to help her grandmother battle breast cancer. The actress said her grandmother showed her scars from a double mastectomy but then quickly changed the subject. In 1992, she passed away from the disease. Now, Ms Hurley says speaking honestly and openly about the disease could help save women like her grandmother. She told Sky News this morning: 'My grandmother didnât really speak about it at all, when she found her lump she was too scared to tell the doctor, she didnât know anything about breast cancer. 'She assumed it was a death sentence, and unfortunately it was for her.â Later, appearing on ITVâs This Morning, she called the time when her grandmother was diagnosed the 'dark ages' of breast cancer, as it was still a taboo subject. She said: âThey were talking about how at that time, there was no pink ribbon, nobody talked about breast cancer, magazines didnât have pink months, nobody was selling products to raise money for research.â This month she jetted to the U.S. and Canada carrying out her role as a global ambassador for the Estee Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign. The campaign urges women diagnosed with breast cancer to tell their stories. The people who have cared for a loved one with breast cancer are also encouraged to share their experiences. Ms Hurley said: âWhen a trauma comes into someoneâs life, itâs not only the person thatâs diagnosed, itâs the caretakers - the people that are with them - Â whose lives are spiralled into a horror scenario when they help their loved one get through this challenging time.' In an interview with The Times, she said she was angry a lack of awareness meant she didnât have more time with her grandmother before she died. She said: 'At that time, there was so little written about breast cancer. 'It wasn't until I started to learn about breast cancer through Evelyn Lauder that I began to feel so angry that I hadn't known more at the time, when perhaps I could have helped her. 'We know that if a cancer is found and treated early, there is a 95 per cent chance of recovery. 'If only my grandmother and countless other scared women could have known this.' Ms Hurley was speaking at the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Last week the star lit up the Empire State Building in New York as part of the company's We're Stronger Together campaign. The Eiffel Tower in Paris, The Colosseum in Rome, The Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai, The Burj Al Arab in Dubai and The Peninsula in Hong Kong are all due to be lit up in pink over the coming weeks. Earlier this year Ms Hurley posted a picture of herself on Twitter after undergoing a mammogram check. She said: 'After 40 you should have an annual mammogram. Had mine this morning.' Ms Hurley's awareness campaign comes as television presenter Michaela Strachan revealed she was diagnosed with the disease. The Springwatch host said she was forced to have both breasts removed after the cancer was discovered in a mammogram at the start of the year. She told the Mail on Sunday's You magazine: 'The tears started to roll as my doctor tried to tell me what would happen next, but I only took in every fifth word or so. 'The one word that registered was ""cancer"".' Medics advised her to have a double mastectomy. Ms Hurley told ITV's This Morning that her grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer in the 'dark ages' when nobody talked about the disease . The star said: 'I couldn't get my head around the fact that on Monday morning I'd been apparently healthy, by Tuesday I had cancer, and by Wednesday I was talking about a double mastectomy.' The 48-year-old, who is set to undergo reconstructive surgery, stressed her experience showed the importance of regular check-ups. 'If I'd put mine off, my story could have been a very different one,' she said. Last year, actress Angelina Jolie revealed to the world that she had undergone a double mastectomy to prevent her getting breast cancer. She took the decision after testing positive for the BRCA1 gene mutation that greatly increases the risk of developing the disease. Television presenter Michaela Strachan said she was forced to have both breasts removed after doctors discovered she had breast cancer earlier this year .","Ms Hurley says her grandmother died in 1992 from breast cancer .

"A congressman and his wife have reunited two-year-old twin girls who were living in separate homes by adopting them into their own family. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin told NewsOK that he was hesitant at first to expand his brood of three to five, but his wife convinced him otherwise. Now, little Ivy and Lynette - who were born into 'kind of a bad situation' - are fully integrated into the Mullin family and they 'could not be happier,' says the congressman. Happy family: Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin and his wife Christie have reunited two-year-old twin girls who were living in separate homes (bottom right) by adopting them into their own family . Grinning girls: Ivy (left) and Lynette (right) were living with distant, elderly relations of Mrs Mullin, in separate homes, before they were adopted on August 21 . Before the adoption was approved on August 21, the blonde twins were living with distant relations of Mr Mullin's wife Christie, in separate but 'very loving' homes. But the relatives, a grandmother and great aunt, had told Mrs Mullin that they hoped they'd live long enough to see the girls graduate. The congressman's wife approached him several times about adopting the girls, but he told her it was a huge time commitment, and they already had their hands full with two sons, nine and eight, and a five-year-old girl. He suggested he write a check, telling her 'it's easier sometimes to give money than it is to give time.' Seeking guidance: The congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, said: '[God] opened our hearts to the idea of adoption' (pictured with wife Christie, sons Jim and Andrew, and daughter Larra) But then Mrs Mullin pulled what her husband calls the 'trump card'. She asked him: 'Would you pray about it?' 'How do you pray about that?' said Congressman Mullin at a town meeting in Henryetta, Oklahoma, last week. Politician parent: Republican Markwayne Mullin, 36, is the U.S. Representative for Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district . 'I mean, really. ""Hey Lord, would you please, please make her heart as selfish as mine""?' So instead he prayed that God would change his own mind, 'And man did He ever,' he says. The Congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, told TheHill: 'Our family prayed for God's will and He opened our hearts to the idea of adoption. 'We were unsure about whether, at this time, we could handle the extra responsibility,' he added. 'But God's timing is always perfect.' Now the congressman - who is part of the Cherokee nation, just like his twin girls - says Lynette and Ivy have taught him more than he ever expected. 'People say, ""Man, you're going to be . such a blessing to those girls,""' he said at the town meeting. 'And I'm going to tell you right now - if you're someone . who's thinking about adoption - you're going to be blessed more by them . than you will ever be a blessing to them.' As for the girls themselves, they have apparently been doing well since being reunited. 'If you talk to anybody, they say twins . need to be together. The bond between them is just amazing,' said Congressman Mullin. 'They can . have a conversation with each other for hours and nobody else can . understand it,' he added.

"The deadly Ebola virus could spread across the world infecting people from the U.S. to China within three weeks, scientists have warned. There is a 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the UK by October 24, a team of U.S. researchers have predicted. Using Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world. They estimate there is a 75 per cent chance Ebola will reach French shores by October 24. And Belgium has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14 per cent each. The virus is spreading rapidly across West Africa, with more than 3,400 people known to have died and 7,500 infected. Scroll down for videos . A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks . Scientists  predicted there is a 50 per cent chance the Ebola virus will reach the UK and a 75 per cent chance it will reach France by October 24 . The disease is spreading rapidly across West Africa, with more than 3,400 people known to have died and 7,500 infected . UsingÂ Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data a team of U.S. scientists have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world. Volunteers in Monrovia, Liberia are pictured carrying a man, suspected of having the virus, to a health centre in the capital . The numbers are based on air travel remaining at full capacity, and are being constantly updated by the researchers, who last reviewed the figures based on data from October 1. But assuming there is an 80 per cent reduction in travel to reflect that many airlines are halting flights to affected regions, the scientists predict France's risk is still 25 per cent, and the UK's is 15 per cent. But the researchers, whose work is published in the journal PLOS, said the risks change every day the epidemic continues. Professor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research, said: 'This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities â but those probabilities are growing for everyone. 'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky. 'Air traffic is the driver. 'But there are also differences in connections with the affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), as well as different numbers of cases in these three countries - so depending on that, the probability numbers change.' Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, an expert in viruses who has been tracking the epidemic,Â said: 'It's really a lottery. 'If this thing continues to rage on in West Africa and indeed gets worse, as some people have predicted, then it's only a matter of time before one of these cases ends up on a plane to Europe.' Nigeria, Senegal and the U.S. - where the first case was diagnosed on Tuesday - have all seen people carrying the haemorrhagic fever virus, apparently unwittingly, arrive on their shores. Experts warn the virus could also reach Belgium, Spain and Switzerland within the next three weeks . France is among the countries deemed most likely to be hit next, because the worst affected countries include Guinea, a French-speaking country with busy travel links back. Britain lies dangerously in the path of the virus, due to Heathrow's status as one of the world's biggest travel hubs, with frequent links to Nigeria. The researchers at Northeastern University, in Boston, calculated the countries most at risk in the short term, are: . France and Britain have each treated one national who was brought home with the disease and then cured. The scientists' study suggests that more may bring it to Europe not knowing they are infected. The World Health Organisation has not placed any restrictions on air travel and has encouraged airlines to keep flying to the worst-hit countries. British Airways and Emirates have suspended some flights but other airlines continue to fly to the region. Patients diagnosed with Ebola, which is transmitted via bodily fluids, are most contagious when they reach the terminal stage. In its final attack on the body, the virus causes both internal and external bleeding, profuse vomiting and diarrhoea, all of which can contain high concentrations of the infectious virus. There is still a high risk of the virus being passed on in earlier stages, especially since people may not know they are infected, with symptoms taking between two and 21 days to emerge. It is therefore feared a sufferer could travel to Britain without knowing they had the disease and infect others. Last week Thomas Eric Duncan became the first patient to fly into America without knowing he had Ebola and 114 people came into contact with him before he was diagnosed. Study author and expert in viruses who has been tracking the epidemic, Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said: 'It's really a lottery.' Volunteers are pictured pushing a cart through the streets of Monrovia, Liberia, carrying a suspected victim of the deadly virus to a local health centre . Nigeria, Senegal and the U.S. - where the first case was diagnosed on Tuesday - have all seen people carrying the haemorrhagic fever virus, apparently unwittingly, arrive on their shores. A man suspected of having Ebola waits to be admitted to the Island Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia - one of the worst hit nations . They were tracked down by health authorities and ten remain under surveillance. Within the European Union, free movement of people means someone unknowingly infected with Ebola could easily drive through several neighbouring countries before feeling ill and seeking help, and spend weeks in contact with friends or strangers before becoming sick enough to show up on airport scanners. Vital supplies destined to help in the fight against Ebola raging through Sierra Leone have been sitting idly on a dock side for nearly two months. A shipping container packed with medical supplies has been locked at Freetown port in the country since August 9, the New York Times reported. It contains 100 bags and boxes of hospital linens, 100 cases of protective suits, 80 of face masks, as well as gloves, stretchers, mattresses and other supplies vital to helping fight the epidemic. The items were donated by individuals and hospitals in the U.S., according to Chernoh Alpha Bah, who organised the shipment. Mr Bah is an opposition politican from President Ernest Bai Koroma's hometown of Makeni - a region hit by the epidemic. A government official, told the NY Times, he believes political tensions may have caused the delay in releasing the supplies, to prevent the opposition benefiting from being seen to bring in the donations. Mr Bah said he expected the shipment to be welcomed by the authorities, and said he he expected the shipping fee of $6,500 would be a small price to pay. He said: 'They are blaming us for shipping in without authorisation. 'It appears all they are interested in is cash donations. And all we have are supplies.' Professor Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said many cases 'can slip through the net' despite screening at West African airports. He added: 'Whilst the risk of imported ebola virus remains small, it's still a very real risk and one that won't go away until this outbreak is stopped. Ebola virus isn't just an African problem.' However, the chance of the disease spreading widely or developing into an epidemic in a wealthy, developed country is extremely low, healthcare specialists say. According to the latest Ebola risk assessment from the European Centres of Disease Prevention and Control, which monitors health and disease in the region, 'the capacity to detect and confirm cases...is considered to be sufficient to interrupt any possible local transmission of the disease early'. Dr Gatherer cited Nigeria as an example of how Ebola can be halted with swift and detailed action. Despite being in West Africa and being home to one of the world's most crowded, chaotic cities, Nigeria has managed to contain Ebola's spread to a total of 20 cases and eight deaths, and looks likely to be declared free of the virus in coming weeks. 'Even if we have a worse case scenario where someone doesn't present for medical treatment, or..it's not correctly identified as Ebola, and we get secondary transmission, it's not likely to be a very long secondary transmission chain,' he said. 'People aren't living in very crowded conditions (in Europe), so the disease doesn't have the same environment it has in a shanty town in Monrovia, where the environment is perfect for it to spread. 'It's a different matter in modern western cities with the very sanitised, sterile lives that we live.' So far one Briton, 29-year-old nurse William Pooley, has contracted ebola, but he was diagnosed while volunteering in Sierra Leone and was transported to Britain in an isolation tent. Mr Pooley recovered and was discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in north London 10 days after he landed.","Disease spreading rapidly across West Africa; more than 3,400 people dead and 7,500 infected .
The first case was confirmed in the United States last week .
114 people came into contact with him before he was diagnosed .
Scientists believe an infected person will arrive in the UK before October 24 .
Estimate a 75% chance of the virus reaching France in that time .
Belgium has a 40% chance of the disease reaching its shores, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks, at 14% each ."
"Meet the 'insanely cute' ball of fluff named Blossom that can fit in the palm of your hand. This baby yellow-bellied glider is the newest addition to Sydney's Taronga Zoo and ever since she was born in July her keepers have been smitten with her.

Blossom is the 14th yellow-bellied glider to be born at Taronga, which maintains the world's only successful breeding program for the species . 'She's absolutely beautiful and she's quite vocal... which is really sweet.' Blossom is the 14th yellow-bellied glider to be born at Taronga, which maintains the world's only successful breeding program for the species. 'We're tracking her developing since birth, which is the first time we've done that,' Wendy said. 'We've been keeping an eye on her milestones - what age they leave the pouch and what age they are when they open their eyes.' 'When they first emerge from the nest, itâs a bit of a milestone... Blossom is pretty much at that stage now.' Blossom is the first joey that keepers have been monitoring since birth, which has allowed them to learn about a glider's development for the first time . There's even a camera set up near Blossom to see when she first leaves her nest box as her parents go out and forage like they would in the wild .

There's even a camera set up near Blossom to see when she first leaves her nest box as her parents go out and forage like they would in the wild. Yellow-bellied gliders are under threat due to local bushland being broken up by development along the eastern seaboard where they're found. Wendy said people can help preserve the population by planting trees and shrubs that are found locally in backyards to create wildlife corridors and by getting involved with local bush regeneration groups.

"Miss Cain said she is furious after he ex-boyfriend Peter Atkinson was released from prison four months into a 40 week sentence for harassing her . A woman stalked by her ex-boyfriend during a five month campaign of harassment today said she is 'furious' he has been released from prison after just four months. Rebecca Cain, 24, said she doesn't believe the 40 week sentence given to her former partner Peter Atkinson was long enough what he subjected her to. Atkinson bombarded Miss Cain,with up to 200 messages a day after she split up with him and also posted naked pictures of her online in revenge. He also managed to cancel Miss Cain's place at university without her knowledge, leaving her without a spot on her course. The 21-year-old has just been released from prison after being jailed for 40 weeks for harassment in July. Miss Cain, a healthcare assistant, said at one stage she was so terrified she could not look out of the window as Atkinson continued to stalk her. She said: 'Peter's sentence wasn't long enough - I couldn't be more disappointed. 'The time he spent in jail is less than the time he spent harassing me. I'm furious.' The judge at the time described the case as 'among the worst I have ever seen.' Miss Cain and Atkinson met on dating website Plenty of Fish in February 2013 and started dating in July. Atkinson, 21, moved 200 miles from his home in Cannock, Staffordshire to live with Miss Cain at her family home in Devon. But the relationship started to go sour after he got possessive and started checking her phone everyday. The healthcare assistant said: 'The seven-month relationship ended in January when I discovered he had been lying to me about having a driving licence, even though he had been borrowing my car.' However Atkinson did not accept the break-up and bombarded Miss CainÂ with up to 200 texts and phone calls a day, begging her to take him back. He also organised for a female friend to impersonate Miss CainÂ and telephone admissions at Plymouth University - to cancel her application to study paramedic science. By the time Miss Cain realised, it was too late and places had been filled. Atkinson initially moved out of Miss Cain's home in Devon and returned to the Midlands. But he then continued to harass her, sending her pictures of her car to prove he was watching her and had returned. He followed her to the homes of her patients and also turned up at her brother's home. On one occasion Atkinson got into the passenger side of her car and stole her mobile phone and shoes. Atkinson and Miss Cain met on dating website Plenty of Fish but split up after Atkinson became possessive . Atkinson bombarded his former girlfriend with up to 200 messages a day begging that she take him back . He rang her to demand she met him to get the items back and Miss Cain arranged to meet Atkinson at her home, and arranged for police to be there. However this also failed as when she secretly dialled 999 Atkinson fled upstairs and jumped from the window - breaking both his legs and one arm. Police arrested Atkinson and took him to Torbay Hospital so his injuries could be treated. This still did not stop Atkinson who threatened to kill Miss Cain's parents if she did not visit him in prison. He also used spyware he had installed on her phone when he stole it to arrive at her brother's home when she was there. Miss Cain said:Â He took over my life. I became reclusive because I was too scared to leave the house alone and I didn't see my friends for weeks. Miss Cain said she has been forced to change her name, job and move house because of the harassment she endured at the hands of Atkinson . 'I couldn't even look out of the window and I refused to answer my phone. 'Throughout my ordeal, I changed my number 10 times and yet he tracked me down every time. 'One day, I left a patient's house to find my work shoes - the same pair Peter had taken - waiting for me on top of my car. I felt physically sick from fear, and took the next day off work.' Miss Cain changed jobs to work in a hospital so she would not have to work in patients' homes alone. After she spotted Atkinson driving in her home town Miss Cain contacted police who banned him from entering Devon but released him again. The 21-year-old then acted out more revenge on his former partner, creating an account  while she was on holiday with a friend, and posting naked pictures to it. Miss Cain said: 'Peter had made a Facebook account called 'Becky's nude pics' which was full of my private pictures - and he'd even added my friends and work colleagues to the account. 'I was so distraught and humiliated. 'I trusted Peter and never imagined he'd betray me in that way.' He also attempted to mow her friend down after believing he was her new boyfriend. In July Atkinson pleaded guilty toÂ harassment, dangerous driving and handling a stolen car at Exeter Crown Court. At the hearing Judge Gilbert QC said: 'It seems to me the offences of harassment are among the worst I have ever seen. It went on for ages. He bombarded the poor girl with texts and went to her address.' Miss Cain has changed her name by deed poll and moved house in a bid to avoid any more harassment at the hands of Atkinson. Rachel Griffin, director of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the charity that runs the National Stalking Helpline said: 'The perpetrators of this crime are often people that have an obsessive fixation on their victim. 'Sentences need to be long enough to allow enough time for treatment of the obsessive fixation that drives stalking behaviour; in many cases it is unrealistic to expect this behaviour simply to stop without specialist intervention.'","Peter Atkinson was jailed for 40 weeks in July for harassing ex-girlfriend .

"'@natsecwonk': Under an anonymous Twitter account Jofi Joseph bashed his bosses and other Washington elites . A White House national security adviser is out of the job after it was revealed he was behind a Twitter page popular amongst Washington D.C.'s foreign policy community that he often used to anonymously insult many of his bosses and other powerful D.C. insiders. Additionally, Jofi Joseph, a director in the non-proliferation section of the National Security Staff at the White House, used the account - with the moniker @natsecwonk - to reveal internal information about the Obama White House for more than two years. At times, Joseph even used the page to take shots at Jews. 'Is it just me, or with the Jews celebrating Rosh Hashanah tonight, is Twitter much quieter?' he posted on September 4.

"Coca Cola is to to produce its own brand of milk as it expands from carbonated sugary drinks. The American drinks giant is making a daily pint called Fairlife which it predicts will ârain moneyâ for the firm. The new product will cost double the price of traditional versions containing higher protein, less sugar and it will be lactose free. Fairlife will contain 50 per cent more protein, 50 per cent less sugar than normal milk, and 30 per cent more calcium. Coca Cola is to to produce its own brand of milk as it expands from carbonated sugary drinks . Cokeâs move into the dairy business follows a shift into water and its Simply juices as profits fall from its main range of fizzy drinks. The milk claims it has a longer shelf life than ordinary pasteurised milk - as âwe pasteurise our milk at an even higher temperature for less timeâ. Consumers are increasingly drinking healthier products containing less fat and sugar. Speaking at a consumer conference Cokeâs global chief customer officer Sandy Douglas said: âWeâre going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand so it wonât rain money in the early couple of years. But like Simply, when you do it well it rains money later.â Douglas said that the milk which has been tested in Minnesota in America will âtaste better and weâll charge twice as much for it as the milk we are used to buying in a jug.â Consumers are increasingly drinking healthier products containing less fat and sugar . Fairlife will cost double the price of normal milk but will contain higher protein, less sugar and is lactose free . The product is specially filtered to extract elements of fat and sugar and Coke hopes that it will compete in the rapid growth sports and energy drinks market. It comes at a time when milk sales in America have been tumbling as consumers moved to orange juice and other drinks. A spokesman said Fairlife is only available in America at present. The firm has a chequered history in terms of launching new products in the UK. In 2004 it was discovered that the main ingredient to its Dasani water brand which was priced at 95p a bottle was tap water. Bottled in south-east London, wags pointed out that Cokeâs venture into water was remarkably similar to Del Boyâs attempts to sell Peckham water in Only Fools and Horses. Later 500,000 of its bottles in the UK eventually had to be withdrawn after it was discovered the drink had been potentially contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals. The brand was never reintroduced to the UK. The product is already available in the United States where it has a racy advertising campaign in place .","Company to produce brand of milk as it moves away from sugary drinks .

"Winter is a little less than a month away but ice is forming on three of Michigan's Great Lakes, the earliest it has in at least 40 years. While Michigan's monumental waters don't normally begin freezing over until the middle of December, three of Michigan's Great Lakes have already begun forming ice, according to a report by theÂ Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. By November 20 Lake Michigan and Lake Superior were half a per cent covered in ice and Lake Huron was one per cent covered in ice. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Freezing over: This satellite image shows the ice that's already begun forming on Michigan's Great Lakes . Lake Superior was the first lake to show signs of hardening and began freezing on November 15, almost a month before it typically begins to glaciate. Lake Erie still shows no signs of icing over. Mlive.com reports that coverage of early freezing dates back to 1973 but that last Friday was the earliest that all three Great Lakes began to show signs of ice for at least four decades. ABC reports that last winterâs cold temperatures, a cooler than normal summer, and a blast of arctic air allowed for the ice to form on the lakes early for the second year in a row. Last winterâs frigid temperatures lead to the second highest ice coverage for the Great Lakes as a whole. Lake Superior was also covered in ice for the longest time it ever has been and last year showed the second largest ever ice coverage. In 2013, ice appeared on the lake on November 25 and didn't melt until June of 2014 meaning Lake Superior only went five and a half months without any ice on the water. Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron showed ice 10 days earlier this year than last year. Temperatures over the next few months will determine whether or not the lakes will remain frozen for as long as they did last year. ABC reports that the next few days show lower than normal temperatures in the Great Lakes region which will only contribute more to the ice.

The TeleBot will not require a human inside, like Robocop . 'We want to use telebots to give disabled military and police veterans an opportunity to serve in law enforcement,' explained Jeremy Robins, who is funding the project. 'With TeleBots, a disabled police officer will be capable of performing many, if not most, of the functions of a normal patrol officer - interacting with the community, patrolling, responding to 911 calls, issuing citations.' The robot, which is about six feet tall, gets around on wheels and has three HD cameras, giving it full 360 degree vision. It also boasts cameras that point at the ground, which stops it from running into people, and its face will have an 'emotive display' which will allow it to express 'simple emotions'.

"From her outrageously tiny waist to her unfeasibly long legs, the world's most famous doll has long been the target of criticism from feminists and other women's groups who say it promotes an unhealthy idea of body image in girls. And now it appears that their claims have been proven. Scaled up to human size, Barbie dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33. The average woman, meanwhile, has 38 inch back, a 34 inch waist and hips that measure 40 inches around. Scaled up to human size, Barbie dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33 . Interestingly, although originally based on 1950s pin-ups such as Betty Grable, Barbie is far thinner and more unrealistic, with Grable herself reported to have had measurements of 36-24-35. Thanks to her ultra-slender measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone, 8lbs - and would have a BMI of 16.24. This would fit the weight criteria for anorexia. By comparison, the average fashion model has a waist measuring 24 inches, 34-inch hips and a 34-inch bust. To illustrate the point, illustrator Nickolay Lamm created computer generated images of a scaled up Barbie and compared them with a model that reflected the proportions of an average 19-year-old woman. Thanks to her ultra-slender measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone . 'If a woman existed with Barbie proportions, what would she look like compared to a normal woman with average body proportions?' asked Lamm on his blog at MyVoucherCodes.co.uk. Along with Barbie's ridiculously nipped in waist, the computer model revealed that a real Barbie would have a neck too thin to hold up her head - just 9 inches, compared with the teenager's 15. What's more, while the average 19-year-old is a modest 5ft 4"" tall, Barbie would have a supermodel stature and would be a relatively lofty 5ft 8"". Along with Barbie's ridiculously nipped in waist, the computer model revealed that a real Barbie would have a neck too thin to hold up her head - just 9 inches, compared with the teenager's 15 . Certainly realistic proportions were not at the top of maker Mattel's agenda when the doll first made an appearance in the 1950s . 'Some people say that Barbie is just a toy and that we shouldn't pay so much attention to her body proportions,' Lamm told the Huffington Post. 'However, if skinny models in advertisements get so much scrutiny, I feel Barbie, a doll which million of girls play with, should be open to critique as well. 'Yes, Barbie is just a toy. At the same time, itâs a toy which young girls play with and want to be like. 'If we assume that Barbie is 19 years old, shouldnât girls have access to toys which resemble realistic proportions?' Certainly realistic proportions were not at the top of maker Mattel's agenda when the doll first made an appearance in the 1950s. A particularly troubling example from 1965 was Slumber Party Barbie who came with a set of pink bathroom scales, permanently set to a rather scrawny 110lbs (50kg), and a diet book containing a single instruction on how to lose weight that read: 'DON'T EAT!' if skinny models in advertisements get so much scrutiny, I feel Barbie, a doll which million of girls play with, should be open to critique as well, says Lamm . To illustrate the point, illustrator Nickolay Lamm created computer generated images of a scaled up Barbie and compared them with a model that reflected the proportions of an average 19-year-old woman . More recently, artist Jason Freeny created a model of the doll that revealed how her unnatural proportions would result in painful deformities, including squashed and misshaped organs because of her unlikely shape. Lamm, meanwhile, has also created images of Barbie without her customary layers of make-up, which he says look better than the original. 'I decided to see what Barbie (and other dolls) really looked like without makeup. [The original picture] got me thinking: is this what Barbie would really look like without make-up? 'Ken is a pretty good looking doll. So, surely Barbie without make-up can't be too different. Sure enough, Barbie still looks pretty, even au naturel.' 'The real Barbie without make-up brings up a new point: if Barbie can look good without makeup, why doesn't Mattel make dolls with a more natural look?' Lamm has also created images of Barbie without her customary layers of make-up, which he says look better than the original .

"An inquest has begun into the death of a 28-year-old Perth woman who died 24 hours after seeing a doctor for shortness of breath. Croatian born Petra Zele died from a blood clot in her lungs in May of 2010, only five months after she married her partner. The professional dancer, who also worked as a sustainability officer in the western suburb of Cottesloe, died despite various test results showing abnormalities, the ABC reports. Croatian born Petra Zele died from a blood clot in her lungs in May of 2010. She had visited a hospital two weeks before her death and a family doctor the day before, but was not told of her abnormal test results . The inquest into the facts and circumstances surrounding Mrs Zele's death was launched by her mother, Jackie Zele, who was concerned about how her daughter was treated. A fortnight before her death, Mrs Zele had visited Fremantle Hospital after experiencing chest pain, according to the West Australian. Doctors diagnosed her with musculoskeletal pain before sending her home with pain killers, but the results from an electrocardiogram had recorded abnormalities. Within 24 hours, Mrs Zele had collapsed en route to the hospital. She died shortly afterwards. She then visited her family doctor with shortness of breath, but was again sent home despite another test concluding that she had severe pulmonary hypertension â a result which she was never informed of. The professional dancer, who also worked as a sustainability officer in Cottesloe, died only five months after marrying her partner . Within 24 hours, Mrs Zele, had collapsed on her way to hospital. She died shortly afterwards. On the first day of the coronial inquiry, a letter from Mrs Zele's mother was read out which paid tribute to 'a beautiful soul' who had only just married the love of her life. 'She was always the life of the party, so full of life and high on life itself,' the letter said. 'She was a beautiful soul, and her beauty touched everyone she met. We believe her tragic death was preventable.' The inquest into Mrs Zele's death will run until November 28 and will examine whether the actions of the medical staff involved were appropriate.

"The Cowardly Lion costume worn by Bert Lahr in The Wizard Of Oz has sold for more than $3 million at an auction in New York City. New York auction house Bonhams said the big cat outfit worn by Lahr throughout the 1939 classic was fashioned from actual lion hides and its face is a sculpted likeness of the late actor. Weighing more than four stone in total, it would have been unbearably hot and heavy under the bright studio lights, and featured a hidden front zipper and attached tail. Scroll down for video . The Cowardly Lion costume worn by Bert Lahr in The Wizard Of Oz sold for more than $3 million at auction . The unidentified buyer bid $2.6 million plus a premium to the auction house of $477,000, bringing the total to $3,077,000 - three times what the costume was expected to sell for. A spokesman for costume owner James Comisar says a secondary costume used in the film - thought to be worn by a stuntman on set - was sold in recent years for close to $1 million. Comisar has a trove of TV memorabilia from shows including ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Lost."" He has said he plans to use money from the Cowardly Lion costume sale to exhibit his collection. In addition to the Cowardly Lion costume, the auction featured Wizard of Oz memorabilia such as an original script, the Witch Remover prop wielded by the Cowardly Lion in pursuit of the Wicked Witch and an assortment of memorable Emerald City costumes. As well as the lion costume (right) the sale also included a blue gingham 'test' dress and pinafore (left) worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy during the essential pre-production period . The 1939 film, starring (from left to right) Jack Haley as the Tin Man, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, Judy Garland as Dorothy and Lahr as the Lion, lost out to Gone With The Wind as Best Film in the Oscars . The sale also included a blue gingham 'test' dress and pinafore worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy during the essential pre-production period, when costumes, hairstyles and all artistic aspects of moviemaking are refined prior to filming. Other items  in the Hollywood auction included costumes from Gone With The Wind, North By Northwest and Rosemary's Baby. The most iconic piano in Hollywood history â the one played by Sam in the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman classic Casablanca â also went under the hammer, fetching $3.4 million .

"We are a nation obsessed with food programmes such as The Great British Bake Off, Masterchef and Saturday Kitchen . And we have bookshelves bursting with cookery tomes by Jamie Oliver, Raymond Blanc and Nigella Lawson. But overworked Britons are so busy and tired that we can't be bothered to cook, opting instead forÂ eveningÂ meals of quick-fix dinners eaten straight out of the packet whilst standing up in front of the fridge. Scroll down for video . Considered a breakfast staple, toast is a dinnertime meal at least twice a week for half of survey respondents . In a typical week, 60 per cent turn to make-shift meals such as cheese and crackers, ham sandwiches and packets of powdered soup, a study of 2,000 adults revealed. 1. Toast (49%) 2. Cereal (33%) 3. Ham sandwich (33%) 4. Crisps or nachos (27%) 5. Packet or tinned soup (26%) 6. Cheese and crackers (26%) 7. Instant rice/noodles/pasta (22%) 8. Crumpets (21%) 9. Chip butty (19%) 10. Sausage roll or pasty (18%) Getting home late, making do with what's in the house and being too tired or busy to cook were just some of the reasons overworked Brits gave for scrabbling mismatched food together on week nights. Toast, cereal or a similar snack is on the menu at least twice a week. While the average adult eats a hot meal cooked from scratch four times a week, nearly a third said they often eat their dinner straight out of the packet, rather than serving it on a plate. A quarter (25 per cent) claim they are so hungry when they get home from work that on occasion they rush straight to the fridge and eat their evening meal standing up. The survey also found four in ten Brits regularly have a bowl of cereal in place of a hearty evening meal. But 41 per cent said it was because they fill themselves up on bigger meals at lunchtime to justify having a light bite in the evening. The average adult eats a hot meal cooked from scratch four times a week but nearly a third said they often eat their dinner straight out of the packet, rather than serving it on a plate . The poll found one in four adults lie about what they eat because they are embarrassed about what they have eaten or are planning to eat. One in two think having an easy meal makes them look lazy and 29 per cent feel like they have a limited repertoire if they snack on sandwiches and cereal. And 23 per cent say they lie about their meals because the basic food they eat makes them appear uncultured. One in five lie because they do have time to cook proper meals but can't be bothered, and a third lie because they know what they are eating is unhealthy. Not surprisingly, 36 per cent of respondents said they do worry about their nutritional intake because of the food they eat. The poll was conduced by Pukka Pies. Rob Dixon of Pukka Pies said: 'We can all relate to the feeling of being too exhausted to cook when we get in after a long day, and try as we might, we can't bear the thought of peeling, chopping and cooking the traditional meat, vegetables and gravy from scratch. 'The vast majority of workers want something quick and tasty before they dash off out again or collapse in front of the TV. 'Every now and then, we can get by on a quick fix like cereal or toast, but most of the meals in the list are not even hot. 'During the winter months especially, it's important to eat a hot evening meal, rather than eating the first thing we find in the fridge.'","Study reveals 60% of Brits eat makeshift meals for dinner .

"Concerns: Al-Qaida is believed to be targeting flights out of London with explosive breast implants (file picture),  which security staff are checking for, experts say . Heathrow Airport is on high terror alert amid fears female terrorists might use breast implants as bombs, it emerged today. Experts believe there is a 'credible' threat that al-Qaida could target flights out of London using explosives hidden in the chests of its operatives. Specialists believe women could have had breast surgery with implants which, if injected with another liquid, will cause a large enough explosion to take down a plane. Sources have said that security at Heathrow is taking longer as they check busts. 'There are genuine fears over this,' a member of staff told the Daily Mirror. 'We have been told to pay particular attention to females who may have concealed hidden explosives in their breasts. 'This is particularly difficult for us to pick up but we are on a very high state of alert. Itâs led to long queues here at Heathrow â much longer than usual at this time of the year.' Terrorism expert Andy Oppenheimer added: 'There is a great fear that al-Qaeda are planning on using internal devices to try to get through airport scanners. These explosives could be in breast implants.' Government sources have admitted they are aware of the breast implant threat but Heathrow and the Department for Transport said they would not comment on specifics. A spokesman for the DfT said:Â  'The safety of the travelling public is paramount, which is why the UK combines technology, intelligence and other measures to provide one of the strictest aviation security regimes in the world. 'We have a regular monitoring programme in place to ensure compliance with this regime, but do not comment on the specifics or outcomes for obvious reasons.' Procedures: Staff at Heathrow, pictured, say that there is a 'genuine fear' over the issue, so staff are taking extra care to check . Theory: By using explosive breast implants specialists say they could be set off if they are injected with another liquid . Meanwhile a Merseyside MP is demanding answers after claims two improvised explosive devices and two knives were missed in security tests at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. A whistle-blower at the airport has claimed that security tests - known as 'coverts' - were taking place on August 7 when the two IEDs and the blades passed through hand-baggage screening without being discovered. It meant they would have been able to be taken onto a plane at JLA without further discovery.Management at the airport today remained tight-lipped about the alleged incidents and would neither confirm or deny they had taken place. Maria Eagle, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Transport and within whose Garston and Halewood constituency the airport is sited, said she was deeply concerned by the claims. She said: 'As local MP and in my other role, this allegation is extremely worrying, and I will be asking the aviation minister to look at this and give me some assurances about what is going on.'","'Itâs led to long queues here at Heathrow - much longer than usual,' staff said .

"A volcanic eruption caused by the millions of tons of lava resting below Yellowstone National Park would cover cities across the country with ash and shut down air travel and communications, a study has concluded. But it would not herald the end of the United States as we know it, as previous reports have claimed. The National Park in Wyoming and Montana sits atop a huge reserve of molten rock that has lain dormant for more than 70,000 years. Scroll down for video . Catastrophic: A new USGS graphic shows how a 'super eruption' of the molten lava under Yellowstone National Park would spread ash across the United States . And experts had previously predicted that any new eruption would be one thousand times as powerful as the 1980 Mount St Helens eruption. They said that cities as far as 1,000 miles away from the park would be covered in a layer of ash up to 10ft deep, killing off all wildlife and making up to two thirds of the country uninhabitable. However a new studyÂ by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that such an apocalyptic scenario would not come to pass. The scientists used the program called Ash 3D to model the effects of a Yellowstone 'super eruption' and found that cities up to 300 miles from the park would be covered by up to three feet of ash, cities further afield in the Midwest would be covered by a few inches and coastal cities such as New York and California would get only a Â fraction of an inch. An eruption at Yellowstone would create an 'umbrella cloud' of ash which would expand evenly in all directions driven by the force of the seismic event. Dormant: The last volcanic eruption at Yellowstone was 70,000 years ago . âIn essence, the eruption makes its own winds that can overcome the prevailing westerlies, which normally dominate weather patterns in the United States,â Larry Mastin, the lead author of the new paper, said in a press release. Even these smaller levels of ash would be a disaster for the US. The USGS study says that electronic communication and air travel throughout the country would be shut down by an eruption. A huge cloud of ash thousands of miles across would also likely cause a year-long winter, say the study authors. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Pacific produced an ash cloud tens of miles across caused 'a year without a summer' across the globe with snowfall in the North Eastern United States in June. Areas covered in feet of ash would see buildings at risk of collapse and sewer and water lines blocked, and winds would form large dunes of ash that would cover roads and buildings. Farming in the Midwest would be devastated by the cloud of ash, and highways across the country would become slippy and treacherous. The Yellowstone volcano has had three super eruptions - which produce more than 240 cubic miles of ash' in the past. One was 2.1 million years ago, another 1.3 million years ago and a third 640,000 years ago. Ash from these eruptions has been found across the US on the east and west coasts. The last volcanic activity at Yellowstone was 70,000 years ago which produced a lava flow in the south of the park.","An eruption of the millions of tons of molten rock under Yellowstone would dump three feet of ash on Montana, inches on the Midwest and fractions of inches on the coasts .

"The mom of a gay detective has been kicked out of a church in Collegedale, Tennessee, she has attended for six decades because she refused to condemn her daughter. Linda Cooper was informed by elders at Ridgedale Church of Christ on Sunday that her recent public support for Kat Cooper goes against the church's teachings. She, together with her brother and sister, were given an ultimatum: They could repent for their sins and ask forgiveness in front of the congregation or leave the church. Linda Cooper, center, has been forced to leave her church after elders were displeased with her public support for daughter Kat, far left, and her same-sex spouse, Krista, left . Linda Cooper, left, is said to be distraught after being forced from the church she has been a member of for six decades because of her support for daughter Kat and her same-sex spouse, Krista, right . The siblings decided to go, leaving an organization that theyâve been connected with since they were born. Their sin was Lindaâs public show of support for daughter Kat, a detective with the Collegedale Police Department. Earlier this month Kat successfully fought for health benefits for her same-sex spouse, Krista, from the town. The landmark victory generated substantial media interest in the state as Collegedale became the first city in Tennessee to introduce same-sex partner benefits. Throughout the process, Linda Cooper stood by her daughter's side. She held her daughter's hand at a July meeting over the issue and mother and daughter embraced after the City Council's 4-1 vote on August 5. Elders at Ridgedale Church of Christ in Tennessee gave Linda Cooper an ultimatum - repent and ask for forgiveness or leave . Kat and Krista's landmark victory secured earlier this month means that Collegedale has become the first city in Tennessee to introduce same-sex partner benefits . But those public acts of support didn't impress church elders who have decreed that the Coopers aren't welcome in the church that they've been a part of for more than 60 years. âMy mother was up here and she sat beside me. That's it,â Kat Cooper told the Times Free Press. âLiterally, they're exiling members for unconditionally loving their children - and even extended family members.â Speaking on behalf of his wife, Hunt Cooper said she feels she has committed no sin. âThere was nothing to repent about. They . certainly couldn't judge her on that because that was between her and . her God, and it was not their place to judge her for that,â he told CNN. Kat Cooper says her mom has been exiled by the church for showing her daughter unconditional love, while Hunt Cooper says his wife is traumatized over how she has been treated . Proud mom: Linda Cooper, center, with daughter Kat, left, and her spouse Krista . Hunt Cooper said his wife is devastated at being forced out of the church she loves. 'She is just so traumatized and so upset,' he said. 'It has been days and she's still crying. It's almost like losing a family member.' Linda Cooper's father was once an elder at the church, his picture still hangs on the wall, and Kat Cooper grew up helping her grandfather clean the pews. Church minister Ken Willis has admitted the news is 'getting mixed reviews,' but said he didn't wish to speak further as 'this is an in-church private issue.' 'The church is overseen by elders. I am a minister, not a pastor and therefore, do not have the authority to speak further on this,' he said.

"An underground website that was dealing cocaine and other illegal drugs has been shut down, federal authorities said today. U.S. law enforcement shut down Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire, and arrested its alleged owner. Silk Road owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' was arrested in San Francisco on Tuesday, according to court filings. Criminal network: Ross William Ulbricht, 29, has been arrested in San Francisco over the alleged drug-dealing activities of his website Silk Road . Ulbricht, who holds an advanced degree in chemical engineering, appeared in federal court on Wednesday and a bail hearing was set for Friday. His lawyer Brandon LeBlanc, a public defender, declined to comment. A Google+ account for Ulbricht had this post on April 9 last year: 'Anybody know someone that works for UPS, FedEX, or DHL?' Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, the filing said. 'Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today,' FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint. The site was used by 'several thousand drug dealers' to sell 'hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs,' he said. The site, which has operated since early 2011, also offered tutorials on hacking ATM machines, contact lists for black market connections and counterfeiters, and guns and hit men for sale, according to the charges. More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using the digital currency Bitcoin. Time's up: The FBI has shut down Silk Road, an anonymous Internet marketplace for illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine and criminal activities such as murder for hire . In recent media reports about the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the Silk Road website has emerged as part of a darker side to the use of digital currencies. Through the site, according to the charges, users could buy drugs and have them shipped to an address. Investigators, posing as regular users on Silk Road, made more than 100 purchases of drugs, which were shipped to the New York area. According to the complaint, Ulbricht, who shortened his alias from Dread Pirate Roberts to DPR when posting on Silk Road's forums, operated the site from San Francisco. It's a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation. Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. Famous fans include the Winklevoss twins - famous rivals of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - who own around 1 per cent of Bitcoins - currently worth around $11million. It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers. There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. They were introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay. At times, he used computers at Internet cafes to access the servers running the website, which employed several technological tools to mask the location of its servers and the identities of its administrators and users. The complaint described other aspects of Ulbricht's online presence: In a Google+ profile, he described himself as a fan of libertarian economic philosophy and posted videos from the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an Auburn, Alabama-based economics institute. Reached by phone in Austin, Texas, Ubricht's parents said they had not known what their son was doing in San Francisco. 'He is a really stellar, good person and very idealistic,' said Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Lacava. 'I know he never meant to hurt anyone.' Ulbricht's father Kirk confirmed his son had received a master's in material sciences from Pennsylvania State University. His thesis was titled: Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy. 'He did amazing research on crystals and exotic materials they hoped would have some use for humans, Ulbricht said. 'But it was very theoretical stuff.' The complaint against Ulbricht describes a darker side. During one correspondence with a Silk Road user, Ulbricht tried to call out a hit on another user with whom he had a dispute. That user, known online as FriendlyChemist, was threatening to expose the identities of thousands of Silk Road users unless Ulbricht sent him money. 'I wouldn't mind if he was executed,' Ulbricht wrote, offering personal details about his foe, including the fact that he was a married father of three, and the names of the city and province where he lived. In a later post, Ulbricht wrote: 'He is threatening to expose the identities of thousands of my clients.' 'This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me. Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.' During the raid, authorities seized $3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road. Facing charges: Ulbricht, 29, is due in court on Friday. He has an advanced chemisty degree and 'very idealistic', according to his parents . The charges against Ulbricht said his website generated sales of more than 9.5 million bitcoin, roughly equivalent to $1.2 billion. Authorities seized the currency by taking control of the digital 'wallets' Silk Road used to store bitcoin. In a corresponding civil asset forfeiture action, prosecutors claimed Silk Road and Ulbricht were liable to the government for the value of all transactions involving drug tracking and computer hacking, as well as for money laundering penalties, and a final amount would be determined at trial. The raid on Wednesday was not the first time the U.S. government has made arrests related to Silk Road. Earlier this year, authorities in South Carolina arrested Eric Daniel Hughes, known on Silk Road as 'Casey Jones', and charged him in state court with drug possession. The Drug Enforcement Agency seized units of bitcoin, which Hughes allegedly used to purchase drugs from the online market. Bitcoin, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking the digital currency to Silk Road.","Silk Road owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' was arrested in San Francisco on Tuesday .

"Republicans' plan for a special 'select committee' charged with investigating the 2012 Benghazi terror attack reached new levels of controversy on Wednesday when the congressman who will chair the new panel said he can foresee its work stretching well into the 2016 election season. Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former South Carolina prosecutor, acknowledged on MSNBC that the timetable would largely be dictated by how much â or how little â the Obama administration cooperates with subpoenas. 'It would be shame on us if we intentionally dragged this out for political expediency,' said Gowdy, 'On the other hand, if an administration is slow-walking document production, I canât end a trial simply because the defense wonât cooperate.' Continuing the high-powered spectacle of a no-holds-barred congressional probe into the presidential race could bring new levels of public scrutiny to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democrats' current front-runner in the White House contest. Scroll down for video . Man of the hour: Rep. Trey Gowdy (C), flanked by Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (L) and Bob Latta (R), is gearing up to gavel in a select committee on Benghazi as the terror attack and its still-unanswered questions become a deafening rally cry on the right . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's expected Democratic presidential campaign could suffer if the GOP-led Benghazi select committee drags its work into 2016 . Clinton has not yet committed to running. It was on her watch that the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other U.S. personnel died on September 11, 2012 when heavily armed members of an Islamist group linked with al-Qaeda launched an all-out assault on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, an eastern port city in Libya. Republicans began pushing last week for a more powerful House committee that would take over from the four standing committees that have investigated the terror attack with limited results. The new body will have subpoena power and promises to consolidate congressional investigations so that the same group of lawmakers can interrogate witnesses who would normally be under the jurisdiction of different committees. Unlike with the Oversight and Ways & Means committees, which have done the lion's share of the heavy lifting so far, select committee members can question witnesses as long as they like â ditching the customary five-minute timer and removing the incentive for stalling. With the threat of a 7-5 disadvantage in committee membership hanging over their heads, some Democrats are urging a boycott. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chief Rep. Steve Israel reportedly told a closed-door Democratic Caucus meeting Wednesday morning that his party's members should sit out the committee completely, turning it into a partisan exercise. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer wrote to Speaker John Boehner Tuesday night urging him to split the committee down the middle. 'If you truly want this new select committee to be bipartisan and fair â and to be taken seriously by the American people â we call on you to reconsider this approach before bringing this measure to the House floor for a vote,' they wrote. Boehner responded Wednesday by insisting that he wouldn't let the process devolve into a 'sideshow' or a 'circus.' 'This is all about getting to the truth,' he told reporters. 'This is a serious investigation. Our system of government depends on transparency and accountability.' The 2012 Benghazi terror attack cost the lives of four Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and latter-day White House disclosures are only now beginning to provide investigators with a full picture of what happened and how the Obama administration reacted . No circus, no sideshow: House Speaker John Boehner green-lighted a special 'select' committee with sweeping powers and is insisting on a 7-5 GOP majority among its members . As the marathon House Rules Committee hearing dragged on into the dinner hour Wednesday, Republicans insisted their majority status in the House would be mirrored in the new Benghazi committee's roster. Georgia GOP Rep. Rob Woodall noted that Congress had launched seven select committees during his lifetime, and 'all have had a slant toward the majority.' Rep. Daniel Webster, another Republican, fought back Democrats' arguments by saying, 'I became speaker of the Florida House by one vote, but that's the majority that puts you there.' Boehner green-lighted the select committee following the emergence of documents â 20 months after Congress began demanding them â showing that the White House knew almost instantly who was attacking American diplomats and why. President Barack Obama, then-Secretary Clinton, then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice and other administration officials initially argued that the devastation and casualties resulted from a spontaneous protest sparked by a crude anti-Islam video produced in California. The latest email, sent to West Wing staffers by Deputy National Security Adviser Benjamin Rhodes, suggests an organized strategy to deflect criticism in the months preceding Election Day by intentionally clinging to the false story about the video. 'The memo, I think, is evidence of a cover-up,' Gowdy said Wednesday morning. Michael Morell, a former CIA official, has testified that he personally edited a set of talking points provided to Rice and members of Congress in the days after the Benghazi attack, removing references to terrorist groups because he believed that information was considered classified. Gowdy also raised the hackles of some Republicans by upbraiding his own party for turning Benghazi into a fundraising issue. The Republican National Congressional Committee launched a fundraising campaign Tuesday night asking for money to 'fight liberals' on Benghazi, and bringing a stern rebuke from select committee chair Rep. Trey Gowdy . The National Republican Congressional Committee launched a website Tuesday night designed to collect funds from outraged conservative 'Benghazi watchdogs' who have lost patience with what they see as blatant obstructionism and are prepared to donate money. 'House Republicans will make sure that no one will get away from Gowdy and the Select Committee,' the online pitch reads. 'This is going to be a national effort for a national investigation. ... Help fight liberals by donating today.' Asked Wednesday morning if the GOP should avoid bulking up its campaign purse from Benghazi-related appeals, he said, ""Yes, and I will cite myself as an example.' 'I have never sought to raise a single penny on the backs of four murdered Americans,' Gowdy insisted. Democrats, too, have begun to politicize Benghazi in the context of electoral politics. Trish Causey, a Democrat running for Congress in Mississippi, tweeted Wednesday that '[t]he only reason the GOP is still harping [about] Benghazi is because they fear Hillary actually has a chance at becoming POTUS.' 'As part of National Masturbation Month,' she tweeted on Sunday, 'Republicans like screaming the name of their fluffer, Ben Ghazi, when they orgasm.'","House Rules Committee spent Wednesday debating how to constitute the new Benghazi committee, with Republicans holding out for a 7-5 advantage .

"One in 10 employees wants to work more hours every week, a new study revealed today. But a similar number would like to put in fewer hours for less pay. Around three million people are classed as under-employed, wanting to work an extra 11 hours a week on average, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This year, underemployed workers would like to work an extra 33.5million hours, compared to 21.2million in 2008. There are almost 3million people who would like to more work, up from just over 2million six hours ago. At the same time 9.7 per cent of workers, a total of 2.9 million people, would like to work fewer hours. The average number of hours less that each overemployed worker wanted to work was 11.2 hours per week, which equates to 32.6 million hours per week for all those overemployed in the UK. The North East has the highest percentage of under-employed workers in Britain. One in five part-timers is under-employed compared with one in 20 in a full-time job. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: 'As expected, the number of under-employed workers fell by 116,000 in the year to Q2 . 2014 but the figure remains staggeringly high, marking the sixth successive year in which the under-employment rate has been above 9.5 per cent. 'Such a prolonged period of mass under-employment demonstrates the extent to which the very good headline employment and unemployment figures of recent years mask a substantial underlying shortage of work, the persistence of which takes some gloss off the UK's supposed 'jobs miracle'. 'With almost three million people under-employed alongside still almost two million unemployed the pain of work shortage and associated pay weakness is likely to continue well into 2015.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Under-employment is still much higher than it was before the recession, which is a clear sign that the UK isn't creating enough of the right kind of jobs. 'There is a big shortfall in the supply of full-time employee jobs, and that's making it harder for families to earn enough for a decent standard of living. 'It makes no sense that there are so many people wanting more work, while others complain of being overworked and want fewer hours. The Government should strengthen flexible working rights, which could help solve both problems.","Office for National Statistics finds 3million in the UK are 'under-employed'

"The shop assistant who allegedly refused to show Oprah Winfrey a handbag said the billionaire is a liar . The sales assistant who refused to show U.S. talkshow billionaire Oprah Winfrey a luxury handbag costing nearly Â£25,000 claims the superstar lied about what happened in the luxury Swiss boutique where she works. Speaking anonymously to Sunday newspaper SonntagsBlick, the Italian bag lady said she felt 'powerless' and in the grip of a 'cyclone' after Winfrey went on TV in America to claim she had been the victim of racism. Winfrey was in Switzerland in July when she walked into the Trois Pommes boutique in Zurich looking for a handbag to match the outfit she was going to wear to old friend Tina Turner's wedding. She claims the sales assistant refused to show her the black crocodile leather bag because - seeing a black woman - she automatically assumed she would not be able to afford it. Now the saleslady has hit back, stating: 'I wasn't sure what I should present to her when she came in on the afternoon of Saturday July 20 so I showed her some bags from the Jennifer Aniston collection. 'I explained to her the bags came in different sizes and materials, like I always do. 'She looked at a frame behind me. Far above there was the 35,000 Swiss franc crocodile leather bag. 'I simply told her that it was like the one I held in my hand, only much more expensive, and that I could show her similar bags. 'It is absolutely not true that I declined to show her the bag on racist grounds. I even asked her if she wanted to look at the bag. 'She looked around the store again but didn't say anything else. Then she went with her companion to the lower floor. My colleague saw them to the door. They were not even in the store for five minutes.' She emphatically denied ever saying to Winfrey: 'You don't want to see this bag. It is too expensive.Â  You cannot afford it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

This is absurd. I would never say something like that to a customer. Really never. Good manners and politeness are the Alpha and the Omega in this business. 'I don't know why she is making these accusations. She is so powerful and I am just a shop girl. 'I didn't hurt anyone. I don't know why someone as great as her must cannibalize me on TV. 'If it had all taken place as she claimed, why has she not complained the next day at the wedding of Tina Turner with Trudie Goetz, my boss? She was there also at the Turner wedding as a guest. I don't understand it. 'I spoke to Oprah Winfrey in English. My English is okay but not excellent, unfortunately. 'I didn't know who she was when she came into the store. That wouldn't have made any difference if I had. Miss Winfrey said of the encounter: 'I could have had the big blow-up thing and thrown down the black card and all that stuff. But why do that?'

She has worked in the store for five years, says 50 per cent of the clientele come from abroad and that a bag costing nearly Â£25,000 is sold 'only a few times a year.'

"This is the incredible moment hero workmen rescued a 98-year-old driver by LIFTING her car from tram tracks. Left cold and shivering, the driver of the gold Renault Clio, more than half-an-hour for help after a wrong turn left her trapped on tracks. The pensioner turned left onto the new tram tracks, instead of continuing a few yards further to the main road and getting stuck on the tracks. The 98-year-old woman accidentally turned left onto the tram tracks instead of the main road and got stuck . Passing workmen were able to remove her car from the tracks, manhandling it off the rails . The Renault Clio, pictured, became marooned on the tram tracks after the lady took the wrong turn . The lady was stuck in her car, unable to go forward or backward until help arrived. Removal man Stephen Brookbanks was passing the scene in Baguley, Wythenshawe, when he spotted the gold Renault Clio stuck on the tracks on Tuesday morning, shortly before 9am. Bystanders called Metrolink, who run the Manchester tram service, but after 30 minutes they decided to act themselves. Mr Brookbanks, with the help of a few of his employees and a couple of bystanders, rocked the car over the tracks to safety. He said: 'Me and two of the guys were passing by and saw her, she was old and frail and looked really bewildered. 'Two other guys, truck drivers, saw us struggling and came to help. The lady was very cold and she was walking with a stick.' He added: 'It was heavy - the heaviest thing we've had to lift even in our job but we are used to it. 'You see an old lady on a track and you help. I haven't got a clue where the authorities were. She was there at least 30 minutes. 'She thanked us and was quite jolly by the time we left.' The elderly woman was on her way to mass at the Sacred Heart Church on Floatshall Road, Manchester . The woman turned left from Royal Oak Road onto the tramline which runs along the side of the main road . Sandra Lynch, a resident who waited with the woman and got her a warm cup of tea, said: 'I was shocked and disgusted by how long she had been there. 'When we called Metrolink and the police we told them how old she was so I would have thought they would have got out to help much more quickly. 'It also obviously held up the trams during rush hour so I was surprised by that.' Along with two other residents, Ms Lynch, who was walking her dog, waited with the woman. She added: 'She was freezing cold, bless her - and all she was worried about was getting to mass.' It was the second such incident in four days - after a car found its way on to the airport line on Saturday night. Mother-of-two, Ms Lynch added: 'A huge thank you too all these people who were just passing in their vans - well done boys.' 'At no time did I see anyone either from Metrolink or the police, nobody official arrived.' Ms Lynch, who said the woman had been on her way to mass at the Sacred Heart church on Floatshall Road, added: 'I walked her into church in the end and she made the last few minutes of mass.' The incident meant trams from Manchester Airport could only get as far as Roundthorn for 40 minutes while Baguley stop was out of action. A spokeswoman from RATP Dev Ltd, which operates Metrolink, said their safety team took 30 minutes to arrive from the Trafford depot. She said they left immediately but the journey took that long.

"The heart of Richard I was buried in the Cathedral of Rouen, France, with mint, frankincense, mercury, creosote and daisies . Richard the Lionheart ended up with a heart full of daisies, mint and frankincense, a French study of his mummified heart has discovered. The analysis also uncovered elements like creosote, mercury and perhaps lime in the heart, which has been in the western French city of Rouen since his death in 1199. The studyâs leader, Philippe Charlier, suggests the flowers and spices were to give the king the âodour of sanctityâ. The study came out less than a month . after a team of British archeologists uncovered the long-lost remains of . 15th-century King Richard III - a relative but not a direct descendant . of Richard I - under a car park in Leicester. Unlike that crude ending, Richard the Lionheart, leader of the Third Crusade, was ceremoniously laid to rest in three places. His . entrails were interred in the central French town of Chalus, where he . died in a skirmish with a rebellious baron; his body reposes at the . Fontevraud Abbey, beside his father Henry II and later his mother . Eleanor of Aquitaine; and his heart, wrapped in linen, pickled for . posterity and placed in a lead box, was sent on to the Cathedral of . Rouen. In 1838, the heart, already turned to powder, was rediscovered, transferred to a glass box and placed in Rouenâs Departmental Museum of Antiquities. Charlier, a forensic medical examiner, and his 11-member team used the latest biomedical techniques to decipher the composition of The Lionheartâs heart. Philippe Charlier, a forensic medical examiner, shows the remains of King Richard I's heart, which has undergone analysis more than 810 years after he died . Born on 8 September 1157 in Oxford, son of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard I is one of the most popular kings in England history after leadingÂ  the Third Christian Crusade against Muslims who had captured Jerusalem in the 12th century. He failed to take the city because of inner-feuds between his Crusader allies, but scored numerous victories against Saladin, his Muslim counterpart. Despite his reputation in England, Richard spent most of his time in his lands in France, and mainly conversed in French dialects. Richard died after a crossbow bolt pierced his shoulder during a siege of the castle of Chalus-Chabrol in the Limousin region of France. He claims it is the oldest embalmed heart ever studied and, belonging to a king, certainly the most prestigious. The study was published in Scientific Reports, part of the Nature Publishing Group. The aim of the study was to discover how hearts were embalmed in the 12th century, Charlier said. The presence of incense in the potpourri was the most striking because, Charlier said, it had not been found in previous embalmings, even in corpses dating from the Middle Ages. Charlier speculates that the incense, among the gifts offered to the infant Jesus by the three kings and reportedly used on the outside of his body at death, was meant to give The Lionheart a direct line to God.

There is also a suggestion that lime may have been used as a disinfectant. How bodies were preserved back then . 'is a field of much speculation and, thus, such a study provides some . decent evidence,' said Frank Ruhli, a professor at the University of . Zurich's Center for Evolutionary Medicine.

"Traditional British rituals like eating a takeaway in front of the TV, or driving the short distance to work are killing us and need to be challenged. Greater public health interventions, similar to the smoking ban, are vital if society is to wage war on rising obesity levels, and combat related diseases including cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Smoking and drinking alcohol are social habits that must be tackled by public health officials. A team of social scientists believe, only by making certain unhealthy lifestyle choices socially unacceptable, will progress be made. Dr Stanley Blue, a lecturer in social sciences at Manchester University said some social practices reinforce each other, such as getting a takeaway and watching TV on a Friday night. Scroll down for video . Traditional British rituals like eating a takeaway in front of the telly need to be made socially unacceptable in order to tackle 'lifestyle' diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes, social scientists argue . Others - such as drinking a bottle of wine at home or going to the gym - compete for time in our busy days. Legislation outlawing smoking in public places means a packet of cigarettes no longer goes hand in hand with a visit to a pub or restaurant. A similar approach, with social practice at the heart of public health policy, could be taken to eating and exercise, he said. This is instead of traditional methods which rely on persuading people to make the 'right' decision by going to the gym or eating their five-a-day. These treat such decisions as matters of personal choice, ignoring the fact social habits and practices are blindly leading us into bad health. Dr Blue said: 'Smoking, exercise and eating are fundamentally social practices, therefore we need to reshape what is deemed socially acceptable and normal in order to change them. 'It is about shifting the emphasis. An example is the way having a Friday night takeaway watching the TV has become the social norm, whereas encouraging people to acquire the skills to cook fresh food themselves may dissuade them from this regular routine. 'Also, some people find cooking very enjoyable and it becomes part of the family evening and entertainment, rather than a chore, making fast food less socially acceptable. 'With cycling initiatives the Government can also persuade people that getting on their bike to work is actually a better and safer way to travel, rather than driving through cities. 'The smoking legislation is a good example where attitudes and behaviour have changed, without the product actually being banned.' Research last year found the average British person now forks out Â£110 a month on takeaway meals - a staggering Â£1,320 a year. Schemes encouraging cycling to work instead of driving, or cooking at home instead of getting a takeaway may be more effective than assuming people will make the 'right' decision about their health, they said . Men have the biggest taste for fast food. They get through an extraordinary 151 takeaways a year, while the figure for women is 126. Writing in the journal Critical Public Health, Dr Blue and colleagues said new ideas are needed to tackle non communicable, or 'lifestyle', diseases. They cite the smoking ban as an example of a measure that effectively decoupled the relationship between going out for a meal or a drink and having a cigarette. Dr Blue added: 'Current public health policy is dominated by the presumption that individuals are capable of making 'better' choices for themselves on the basis of information given to them by the government or other agencies. 'This does not account for the fact that practices like those of smoking and eating have histories of their own. 'Trying to get individuals to stop smoking or eat healthily overlooks the fact that these are fundamentally social practices. 'Public health policy will have to find the courage to break away from its traditional mould if it is to stand a chance of confronting the grim reaper of lifestyle diseases.'","Dr Stanley Blue is a lecturer in social sciences at Manchester University .

"Russian president Vladimir Putin has long been at war with his country's plummetting birth rate, with a concert of measures designed to boost his compatriots' ailing sex drive. But it seems he has added a new secret weapon to his arsenal: a weapon known as Boyz II Men. Putin apparently hopes to harness the all-American boyband's raw romantic charm through a gig in Moscow to encourage their legions of Russian fans to reproduce ahead of Valentine's Day to songs such as I'll Make Love To You and On Bended Knee. All American: The boyband, made up of baritone Nathan Morris (right) and tenors Wanya Morris (left) and Shawn Stockman (centre), will serenade Russians in a series of concerts as part of Putin's continuing PR campaign to persuade the population to have more children . As Russia's population continues to fall to record lows, Putin's continuing PR campaign to persuade the population to have more children appears to have stalled. Until now. Band members Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman and Nathan Morris will take a break from their Las Vegas hotel residency and rehearsals for their upcoming tour with New Kids on the Block and 98 Degrees to perform in Moscow on February 6. The band told the Moscow Times: . 'Russian audiences have always shown us a lot of love. It's amazing for . us to see fans across the world who know every lyric to our songs. We . really appreciate all the support they have given us over the years.' Putin PR: The Russian President hopes to harness the all-American boyband's raw romantic charm through a gig in Moscow . Boyz II Men are one of America's most successful and long-standing R&B groups, known for their emotional ballads reflecting the vicissitudes of love, romance and heartbreak. They burst onto the international music scene in the early 1990s with the 1992 smash hit End Of The Road which stayed Number One on the Billboard Hot 100 for 13 weeks, breaking a decades-old record held by Elvis Presley. They subsequently broke that record with One Sweet Day, which stayed at the top of the Hot 100 for 16 weeks, consolidating their reputation as international sex symbols and garnering a worldwide following of adoring female fans. In 2011 Putin announced plans to invest $53billion (Â£46.9billion) to help raise reproduction rates in the country by 2015. At the time he warned that Russia's population will plummet by 30 per cent in the next four decades due to a falling birth rate. Despite being the worlds largest country at over 6.5million square miles, high rates of smoking, alcoholism, pollution and poverty, together with falling rates, mean Russia's population will shrink to 116 million by 2050 from 142million last year. Russia also has the world's third-largest heroin abuse rate and accounts for a third of all heroin deaths worldwide. President Putin wants to boost the nation's birth rate by 25 per cent in the next three years to counteract the predicted decline. Experts believe the country's impending demography disaster will drain one million people from its workforce every year until 2017. Russia's population peaked at over 146 million in 1991, shortly after the break-up of the Soviet Union, but declined by nearly 800,000 a year until the mid 2000s.

"Apple is investigating its supply chain after the discovery of a disturbing cluster of leukaemia deaths among young workers at a factory in China where millions of its iPhones are made, The Mail on Sunday has learnt. At least 13 workers in their late teens and early 20s have been diagnosed with leukaemia after falling sick at the massive factory in Shenzhen since 2010. Five have died â and at ages when doctors say cases of the blood cancer are rare. Families and a labour welfare group believe the leukaemia was caused by exposure to chemicals used to clean electrical panels and say many more workers could have been affected. They add that young workers who fall sick with leukaemia are dismissed and denied continuing medical coverage, bankrupting families as they desperately pay for treatment. Scroll down for video . CONCERNS: Workers at the Foxconn factory in Shenzhen, where iPhones are made . Apple says it is taking the allegations âvery seriouslyâ and is looking into the issue at the Shenzhen factory . Apple â whose launch celebrations for the iPhone 6 last week included a performance by Irish rock band U2 â says it is taking the allegations âvery seriouslyâ and is looking into the issue at the Shenzhen factory, where about two million iPhones a week are made by an army of 230,000 migrant workers from across China. The factory is used for manufacturing by other electronics giants but has been the main production base for Appleâs iPhones since the first model in 2007. Details of the leukaemia cluster emerged after Apple last month announced it was banning the use of two potentially toxic chemicals, benzene and n-hexane, in the final assembly of iPhones and iPads. Foxconn, owner of the Shenzhen factory, is sending officials to meet the Hong Kong-based labour welfare group to find out more about the leukaemia cases, the labour group said. However, the Taiwan-based company, which also makes products for other electronics giants, insisted there was no evidence to link the leukaemia cases to the victimsâ work and said it had not used benzene and n-hexane âfor many yearsâ. It also claimed the rate of leukaemia at its plants across China was âsignificantly lower than the reported annual rateâ. Leukaemia affects about three people in 100,000 globally, but the majority of its victims are children and elderly people. All 13 identified victims were aged between 19 and 24 when their cancer was diagnosed and were working on or near production lines mostly for iPhones and Apple products at the Longhua and Ganglan plants at Foxconn in Shenzhen, Labour Action China said. Families of the victims said workers regularly used chemicals with only disposable plastic gloves and face masks for protection, were given little or no information about the potential dangers, and were not told which substances they were handling. After falling sick at work and being diagnosed with leukaemia, the families of two workers said they were dismissed and paid off by Foxconn within three months, denying them medical cover to pay for hospital treatment. The leukaemia cluster emerged when families visiting sick relatives in the cancer ward of the Number Two Peopleâs Hospital in Shenzhen noticed how many other Foxconn workers were being treated. Cheng Fuying, whose son Yi Long is now in the advanced stages of leukaemia, said seven to eight workers a year from the same factory were diagnosed and admitted. Yi Long, now 26, from a village in Chinaâs Hubei province, was 22 when he began at Foxconn in March 2010, on a basic salary of Â£150 a month. Speaking at her sonâs hospital bedside, Ms Cheng said: âFor the first month, he was cleaning all the machines with chemicals. He never knew what chemicals he was handling because they were given to him by the distributor up the line. He said he was just given a bucket of liquid to clean the machines. 'After that, he changed jobs every month or two within the factory but he was on a production line when he fell ill. He started non-stop bleeding from his gums so co-workers helped him go to hospital.â He was diagnosed with leukaemia. âI was shocked,â said Ms Cheng, who has given up work to care for her son, sleeping on a mattress on the floor of his ward. âI had never even heard of that disease in my home town. I thought, âHow could this happen?ââ A doctor treating Yi Long told Ms Cheng that chemicals at Foxconn might be to blame. âHe told me Foxconn has a high incidence of this disease,â she said, adding that the doctor had rounded angrily on Foxconn managers when they visited. âThe doctor told them, âYou know why this is happening. Even your boss [Foxconnâs billionaire founder] Terry Gouâs brother died of leukaemia. You have so many patients in our hospital already. Do you really need to ask how he is?ââ Yi Long began a course of chemotherapy. Factory bosses told him he would have his wages paid to April and would then be dismissed. Fellow workers collected about Â£6,000 towards Yi Longâs medical bills, while Foxconn paid him Â£3,000 for his termination, equivalent to a yearâs wages with overtime. By August 2012, Yi Longâs family could no longer afford his medical bills. âWe asked for help from the factory but they said, âItâs not our fault, itâs your disease,â â Ms Cheng said. By then, she had discovered there were many other workers from Foxconn being treated for leukaemia at the same hospital. âThere were seven or eight people from Foxconn who got leukaemia that year alone,â she said. A group of them protested outside the factory gates, demanding to see management, but were threatened with arrest unless they left. When their money ran out, Yi Longâs mother took him home to Hubei where they tried treating him with Chinese traditional medicine. He returned to Shenzhen in August last year as his condition worsened. âThe doctors say he needs a bone-marrow transplant and they have found a donor but we have no money for the transplant,â his mother said. The identity card belonged to Feng Honggan, who died of leukaemia last year aged just 20. He had been working at Foxconnâs Shenzhen plant for four months when he began to suffer heavy nose bleeds . Celebrating: Apple CEO Tim Cook with U2 at the iPhone 6 launch last week . Another worker, Feng Honggan, had been working at the factory for only four months when he was taken to hospital after suffering heavy nose bleeds in June 2011. He was diagnosed with leukaemia and died in November 2013, aged 20. His parents Feng Huifeng and Qin Quixia, both 50, rented out their farm in Gansu, north-west China, and now work as street-cleaners in Shenzhen to try to pay off Â£80,000 of debt from paying for his treatment. Honggan worked in the inventory of the factory, handing out materials and chemicals to workers. He wore disposable gloves and a face mask but was told by his bosses the chemicals were safe, his father said. âI talked to other patients and families in hospital and I found many of the patients had worked in Foxconn â a dozen or more,â Mr Feng said. A delegation of factory managers came to see Honggan in hospital. âFirst they came to see how he was doing. Then they brought him 21,000 renminbi [Â£2,100] and said, âThis is a donation from the factory towards your illness.â They never came again and that was all he got. âThree months after he fell ill, they stopped paying him his wages, including his social insurance.â Mr Feng went to the local government in Shenzhen to seek a ruling that his sonâs death was the result of industrial disease, but he received a written reply saying Foxconn was a clean working environment that satisfied government requirements on chemical safety. Suki Chung, executive director of Labour Action China, said she believed the 13 known cases in Shenzhen were âthe tip of the icebergâ and that many more Foxconn workers had succumbed to the disease. In most cases, workers had returned to their home provinces where they were entitled to free medical help after being dismissed, despite the fact that many rural hospitals lack facilities to treat them. The factory, in Shenzhen, China, is used for manufacturing by other electronics giants but has been the main production base for Appleâs iPhones since the first model in 2007 . In an email to Labour Action China about the leukaemia cases, Appleâs senior director for supplier responsibility, Jacky Haynes, said Apple took the concerns âvery seriouslyâ, adding: âWe are working closely with Foxconn on this matter.â Before announcing its ban on benzene and n-hexane last month, Apple said it had conducted a four-month investigation into 22 factories and said it found no evidence that the chemicals endangered the 500,000 people working there. An Apple spokesman said in a statement it had discovered âa few casesâ in which suppliers were using benzene or n-hexane before it banned the two chemicals from its final assembly lines. However, the statement said use of the two chemicals âwas in low concentrations and each use complied with our Regulated Substances Specificationâ. A spokesman for Foxconn said he could not comment on individual former employees but added in a statement: âThe incidence of leukaemia among the over one million employees in our campuses across China is significantly lower than the reported national annual rate of incidence of leukaemia. âWe can also confirm that the employees who were diagnosed with leukaemia held different positions and job functions while working at our company across different product lines and customers, as the majority of our campuses in China serve multiple customers and manufacture a variety of products â there is no commonality, including links with any chemical agents, associated with the work they were doing. âFoxconn does not allow any entity within our company to use benzene or n-hexane, and has not procured or used these chemicals in any aspect of our operations for many years.â Ms Cheng told The Mail on Sunday she had a message for Apple CEO Tim Cook. âIf you have a conscience, Apple should at least make sure my sonâs disease is treated. I donât want compensation. I just want his medical bills to be covered so that his disease can be treated to give him a chance to live,â she said. âI know that without a bone- marrow transplant my son will probably die. But we donât have the money to pay for it.â","Five staff at iPhone factory in Shenzhen, China have died from leukaemia .

"Taxpayers will have to find another Â£12billion by the end of the decade to pay for benefits for pensioners, a leading think tank has warned. Workers face the prospect of paying more to sustain perks like the winter fuel allowance, more generous pensions and tax breaks on retirement pots. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warned the rising bill of an ageing population comes at a time when 'pensioners as a group have stopped being poor'. Scroll down for video . Britain will be spending Â£12billion more on benefits for pensioners in 2018-19 than in 2010-11, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies . David Cameron has repeatedly rejected calls to cut the benefits given to pensioners, including the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes. The IFS also warns that spending on public sector pensions is set to top Â£36billio this year, life expectancy has risen much faster than the state pension age and tax breaks costing billions have 'benefitted pensioners at the expense of workers'. In six years' time there will be two million more people aged over 65 than there were in 2010. To deal with the increasing costs Mr Johnson said society has three choices - cutting benefits and services for older people, increasing taxes, or making cuts elsewhere. Mr Johnson said the choice made by the current Government is 'pretty clear' in focusing cuts on people of working age. Writing in The Times, he said: 'Cutting benefits for those over the state pension age is obviously difficult. People retire with a set of expectations about what the state will provide and may find it hard to adjust if that support is reduced. More prosaically, pensioners vote. 'But in thinking about the shape of support for the older population it is important to be aware of one rather important fact. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, claimed pensioners as a group 'have stopped being poor' 'Pensioners as a group have stopped being poor. Or rather we have moved from a world only 30 years ago in which pensioners were much more likely to be poor than their younger counterparts to one in which they are less likely to be poor.' While he hailed that fact as 'probably the greatest triumph of social policy during my lifetime', Mr Johnson warned of the costs associated with it. He cited generous public sector pensions and also said 'plans to raise it (the state pension age) by a couple of years by the mid-2020s don't look so radical' when the 10-year rise in male life expectancy is considered. 'Despite increases in the state pension age for women, we are likely to be spending about Â£12billion more on benefits for pensioners in 2018-19 than in 2010-11,' he warned. Research published yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found pensioner poverty has fallen over the past decade, but showed there has been a big increase in the number of younger people living in poverty. Pensioner poverty is now at the lowest level on record and the UK's employment rate is close to a historic high, but incomes are lower than 10 years ago, and average wages for full-time male workers have fallen by Â£1 an hour to Â£12.90. The large-scale study carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found the fall of working families into poverty does not date from the beginning of the recession in 2008. Instead, it reported that the remorseless rise of poverty among people who work for a living began in 2004. Although the report does not attribute this to migration, the figure began to rise in the same year Tony Blairâs government opened the gates to allow migrants from Eastern European countries the right to work freely in Britain. Since then the Eastern European population has shot up to around a million people, while high numbers of immigrants have continued to arrive from outside Europe. Many of the new arrivals have been competing with lower-skilled workers in the existing population for low-paid jobs.","Rising cost of winter fuel allowance, generous pensions and tax breaks .

"A mile-long rubbish heap which 'appeared overnight' on a site travellers left just last month could leave taxpayers with a bill of Â£1million to clean up. Discarded old sofas, wooden pallets and industrial waste have all been dumped on a stretch of council-owned land opposite Purfleet Railway Station in Thurrock, Essex. The site has been occupied by travellers on three separate occasions since July, with the latest camp being moved on by the Essex Countywide Traveller Unit in October. Scroll down for video . The mile-long fly tipping site on council-owned land which stretches towards the Dartford Crossing in Purfleet, Essex . The stretch of land near to the railway line in Purfleet where the old rubbish 'appeared overnight after being dumped . The site had been occupied by travellers on three separate occasions with the latest encampment being moved on from the area last month . The dump takes 20 minutes to walk from end to end, and stretches along the railway line towards the Dartford Crossing . Thurrock Council, who believe that the site was broken into by fly-tippers, say they are unable to clean up the rubbish until it is assessed by the Environment Agency. The agency has been called in  amid fears it could contain toxic waste, including deadly asbestos among the dumped clothes, kitchen cupboards, office chairs and fridges. The dump, which takes 20 minutes to walk from end to end, is next to the railway line opposite Purfleet station on a public footpath close to an empty industrial estate. Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price says she believes the fly-tipping has been caused by illegal travellers and has slammed the delays in the clean up process. The Conservative MP tweeted: 'See what travellers left behind at Cory's Wharf - bit more than household waste. 'Council taxpayers will be footing the bill to clean this up. 'All agencies failing to take prompt action.' Thurrock CouncilÂ claim the site was securely locked and was broken into by fly-tippers who dumped the rubbish .

Clothes can also been seen strewn across the mile-long rubbish heap. The Environment Agency are now assessing the site for toxic waste . Meanwhile Oliver Gerrish, a local Labour councillor, described the fly-tipping as âdumping on an industrial scaleâ. He added: 'Itâs certainly something I would like to see the council deal with, but itâs horrendous weâre in this situation in the first place. 'Itâs absolutely disgraceful that people would dump that much. 'This mess sends out an important message to landowners to keep their land secure.'

"The scientist who developed the most widely accepted theory on aging that's used to study cancer and other diseases has died in Nebraska. Dr. Denham Harman, 98, developed the 'Free Radical Theory of Aging' in 1954, though it took years for additional research to prove its importance.

"Exchanging sexual images between children has become commonplace in many schools, campaigners warn . Teachers have been given powers to delete sexting images from pupils' phones which could be covering up the scale of the indecent images circulating in schools and online. Former culture secretary Maria Miller told MailOnline that children must be taught that sharing explicit images is a sexual offence: 'The worst sort of crime'. The government admits it does not collect data on the number of incidents of sexting in schools or how many cases are referred to police or prosecutors. Sharing explicit images of under-18s is an offence even if they are taken by the youngsters themselves. Search powers introduced by the coalition to help schools impose discipline give teachers the power to search for and delete, inappropriate images from pupils' phones. There are concerns that schools are deleting the photographs from one mobile handset and disciplining pupils discreetly, without investigating how fare the images have spread. It is also suggested that criminal gangs could try to infiltrate school networks to obtain images of children under the age of 16. Mrs Miller, who resigned as Culture Secretary earlier this year, warned: 'Simply deleting that image on the camera that took the photo ignores the very real problem that they have been distributed far more widely.' Some charities, including the NSPCC, have suggested that exchanging sexting images is not a normal part of school life for many teenagers. But Mrs Miller insisted: 'The idea of sending illegal sex abuse images is not part of teenage life. It is often something that happens at the start of a relationship before emotional ties are formed. 'These illegal, indecent images are often circulated far more widely than the original personal who took the photograph intended.' She added: 'It is a sexual offence, it is the worst sort of crime. It is storing up a real problem for those young people. Those images are going to stay with them forever. That is what young people are not aware of.' Mrs Miller raised concerns that by allowing schools to delete images off young people's phones headteachers might not be 'addressing the scale of the problem'. 'There is no statutory duty for schools to report sexting but they do have a duty to report criminal offences. 'But the Home Office doesn't seem to have the records which will set out how many offences have been reported.' Former Culture Secretary Maria Miller told MailOnline she was concerned schools are deleting images and not dealing with how far they have spread or teaching pupils about the serious nature of committing a sex offence . Criminal gangs could be encouraging schoolchildren to engage in sexting to generate images for child porn websites, Maria Miller warned. She questioned whether 'there is the involvement of third parties asking for those images to be generated in the first place'. The Home Office does not collect data on the number of incidents of sexting in schools . But Mrs Miller said: 'You cannot underestimate the cunning nature of those involved in this industry. 'The police have not been able to pick up trends that might imply the involvement of organised crime in sexting.' A recent survey by ChildLine of 13-18 year-olds found that 60 per cent said they had been asked for a sexual image or video of themselves. And four in ten said they had taken an image and a quarter had sent the image or video on to someone else. One in five reports to theÂ Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) relates to self-generated indecent images. A survey of calls fo Childline last year found 28 per cent mentioned secting. In a series of parliamentary questions, ministers have admitted that statistics are not kept on the scale of sexting in schools. Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'The Department does not hold information on the number of cases of indecent images of children either self-taken, or possessed, by an under-18 reported to the police or referred to the Crown Prosecution Service.' She added: We have a responsibility to educate young people to use technology safely and strongly discourage them from sharing self-taken indecent photographs.' Ceop has developed a 'specific educational resource' to tackle sexting to be used by teachers. And schools minister Nick Gibb said: 'The Department for Education does not collect data on incidents of sexting among pupils. 'Schools can help to contain cyber-bullying and sexting during the school day by banning or limiting the use of mobile phones and other electronic devices. 'Search powers included in the Education Act 2011 have given teachers the power to search for, and if necessary delete, inappropriate images (or files) on electronic devices, including mobile phones.' Mrs Miller, who has recently held talks with child abuse law experts in the US about how to tackle the problem, said: 'Schools have been left in a really invidious position. They have the authority to delete images. 'They are undoubtedly doing a great deal to support teachers and young people who are affected by sexting, but I am concerned that there seems to be a lack of information about how many of these incidents are reported to police.' She stressed that she did not want to criminalise every young person but to 'ensure those images are removed and to make sure we are fully aware of whether there is the involvement of third parties asking for those images to be generated in the first place'. The NSPCC said sexting' is playing an increasingly insidious role in young people's relationships [file picture] . Revenge porn - when people publish sexually explicit pictures of former partners - is to be made a new offence punishable by up to two years in jail. Distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress will be made a specific offence in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill. It has already passed the House of Lords and is due to reach the Commons next week. Latest figures showÂ children as young as 11 had been victims, while pop stars Tulisa and Rihanna have also been targeted. Claire Lilley, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said: 'NSPCC research shows 'sexting' is playing an increasingly insidious role in young people's relationships. 'Children may take these images to please a boyfriend or girlfriend but things can quickly spiral out of control. 'Relationships break down and in a moment of spite images can be shared widely. Sometimes a boyfriend sends an image or video to a mate to show off, who in turn may post it online. 'With a few clicks, what is meant to be private is being seen on hundreds of websites, potentially ending up in sex offender collections. 'While we wouldn't want children who do this to be prosecuted apart from in the most extreme and exceptional cases, it's important to remember that taking and sharing any indecent image of a child, even when it was taken with their consent, is a serious offence.' Child protection chief Dr Zoe Hilton warned last week that celebrities could be fuelling the trend in children exchanging explicit images. She told the Commons Education Committee said: 'Obviously children and particularly older children are looking at celebrities and are looking at what the adult population are doing. She added: 'I think we've got to the point with older teenagers where sexting is a normative behaviour. 'What we need to do is get them to recognise when it's abusive, when it's harmful, when it's linked to exploitation, when it's linked to the beginning point of an exploitative relationship.' Meanwhile GPs have been told to ask teenagers if they have been victims of revenge porn. New guidelines have been drawn up to spot youngsters being made ill as a result of anxiety caused by sexting, cyber-bullying and radicalisation online. The pressures of young people's lives played out online means they could be the trigger for headaches and stomach pains, or the reason while children start to play truant, the Royal College of GPs warned last month.","EXCLUSIVE: Maria Miller warns schools risk hiding the scale of problem .

"A new 'anti-lout' law to stop large mobs of people gathering has been used for the first time to ban 500 boy racers from meeting at a retail park. The Public Spaces Protection Order, which became law on 20 October, gives town halls sweeping new powers to outlaw any activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life. Initially intended to clamp down on antisocial behaviour such as begging and spitting, council officers can put up signs banning an activity in a specified area, either round the clock or during specific hours. A new 'anti-lout' law to stop large mobs of people gathering has been used for the first time to ban 500 boy racers from meeting at a retail park in Colchester . Anybody flouting the order will be liable for an on-the-spot fine, normally ranging from Â£70 to Â£100, issued by a police officer, PCSO, council worker or private security guard employed by the local Town Hall. Colchester Council, in Essex, plans to become the first to use the law to make the car park at Turner Rise Retail Park in Colchester the subject of the Public Spaces Protection Order. It will be the first time the new order has been imposed, and itÂ will outlaw non-customers from the car park between 6pm and 6am. It also requires them to leave within 20 minutes. The move comes after 500 car buffs used the retail park as a meeting place twice in the last seven months, and were accused of revving their engines noisily, playing loud music and doing 'doughnuts'. Sgt Lou Middleton, of Colchester Police, said: 'This will make life better for businesses and residents. Colchester Council, in Essex, plans to become the first to use the law to make the car park at Turner Rise Retail Park in Colchester the subject of the Public Spaces Protection Order . 'We have lots of residents living behind the retail park complaining they are constantly being disturbed by vehicle noise, screeching brakes, loud music and there is always the issue of litter. 'That is happening periodically and we know they are young people congregating there in cars. 'When police patrols go we are not finding them doing anything but it is quite clear from the residents it is causing them a disturbance. 'Those people are not going there to use the businesses, they are going there to socialise.' The Public Spaces Protection Order, a form of Asbo, bans motorists from entering the car park between 6pm and 6am if the driver or passengers are not customers of the shops or restaurants. Customers who use a shop or restaurant between 6pm and 6am will have to leave within 20 minutes. The order also bans burger vans turning up and selling food without permission, which has happened in the past. Anyone breaching the order will be fined Â£100. The Public Spaces Protection Order, which became law on 20 October, gives town halls sweeping new powers to outlaw any activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life . Ministers insist the controversial orders  are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and aggressive begging. But the rules have been so widely drawn that councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of 'nuisance parking', children playing ball games and parents parking outside schools. The order is set to come into force in Colchester next month and will be in place for a year.Â Martin Goss, borough councillor for Colchester's Mile End ward, said: 'This gives the police much more power to disperse people. 'It has been a real collaboration between police, the retail park, ward councillors and the council to take up what has been a real concern for a long time. 'This is really good news.' Pizza Hut on Turner Rise Retail Park Â opens until 10pm or 11pm, seven nights week. Manager Stephen Hughes said: 'It has been a long time coming. 'The first time the boy racers came here was okay to an extent but after that it started to happen more regularly and the events got bigger and bigger. 'The other stores mainly close around 6pm but we are open when the cars are here. 'The takeaway sales to them are welcome but then no one else can park. 'We get the loud music and they come in to use the toilet.' Mr Hughes said when staff had asked the boy racers not to use the toilet if they were not Pizza Hut customers some had become aggressive. He said: 'They have even used the back of our building as a toilet. A few of the female staff members have gone out there to have a cigarette and they have been urinating.'","Public Spaces Protection Order designed to ban activity which may have a 'detrimental effect' on the quality of local life .

"A scientist has 'remixed' his version of the sound of the big bang in light of detailed new data gathered by a multi-million pound space probe. Information beamed back from the European Space Agency's Â£515m Planck space telescope has already seen physicists revise their estimates of the age of the universe. Now one professor has used the Planck data to create an updated, 'high fidelity' rendition of the sound of the early development of the universe more than 13billion years ago. Scroll down for audio . Imprint: This image shows the afterglow created by the Big Bang - and now a professor has come up with a version of how it sounded . John Cramer, a professor emeritus of the University of Washington, first created an audio version of the big bang using data from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy ten years ago. Professor Cramer has now used the better quality Planck readings to create a new rendition. 'The new frequency spectrum goes to much higher frequencies than did the WMAP analysis, and therefore offers a more 'high-fidelity' rendition of the sound of the Big Bang,' the professor explained on his website. The physicist used the Planck mission analysis of the cosmic microwave background - radiation from around 400,000 years after the start of the universe - which turns the temperature variations of the CMB into angular frequency components or 'multipoles'. Professor Cramer pointed out that the actual big bang frequencies were far too low to have been heard by the human ear, so he scaled them up by a 'huge factor' for his simulation, which represents the first 760,000 years of the universe. Last month the European Space Agency unveiled a portrait of the infant universe based upon the first 15 and a half months of data from the Planck space telescope. The data also set a new value for the rate at which the universe is expanding today, indicating that the age of the universe is 13.82billion years - 80million years older than previously thought. 'High-fidelity': The Planck data goes to much higher frequencies than the old WMAP analysis, the professor said .

"One university student with a sweet tooth for doughnuts camped outside a Krispy Kreme store for four days ahead of the official opening. Not only was he the first to set foot in the doors of the first Western Australian store, but Favian Lin took out the 'first in queue' prize to win a year's supply of doughnuts. The global doughnut company and coffee house chain opened at Whitfords City, north-west of Perth on Wednesday morning. Scroll down for video . Favian Lin took out the first prize to win a year's supply of doughnuts after camping for four days . The 19-year-old, from Hillarys, waited in line from 5pm on Sunday but his family and friends made sure he didn't forfeit his place and brought along supplies to keep him entertained. 'My friends came to visit and got me a stretcher bed and food and my mum even brought my laptop and some change of clothes for me,' Mr Lin told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was quite exhausting waiting for so long but the store had a giant tent set up so I was undercover the whole time - so that was good.' The 19-year-old marketing student queued in line since 5pm Sunday but his family and friends kept him busy . Favian Lin took out the first prize to win a year's supply of doughnuts after camping for four days . The unemployed marketing student said he was the only person who camped on Sunday but it started to pick up leading up to the opening. 'The idea was actually suggested by some friends and I thought I might as well do it because I had a lot of free time on my hands and who can refuse free doughnuts?' he said. 'There was another guy who waited on Sunday but he ended up leaving not long after but a lot of people started rocking up on Tuesday night.' The marketing student queued in line since 5pm on Sunday and made some new friends along the way . The marketing student was the first to set foot in the doors of the first Western Australian store . Mr Lin has been rewarded for his patience with a dozen doughnuts a week over the next 12 months, meaning if he doesn't share them out he will consume 156 grams of fat and 2616 calories every seven days. 'I don't regret the long wait - it was quite entertaining and I'm surprised myself that I won,' he said. 'I was actually quite shocked because I've never won anything before - especially in first place.' Other prizes included a six-month supply of doughnuts to the second person in queue, three months supply to the third person and the first 100 customers got a 'special Krispy Kreme limited edition pack'. The store is expecting to sell 5000 boxes per day, which means more than a tonne of icing sugar, half a tonne of casting sugar and 44 kilograms of strawberry jam will be used every 24 hours. The global doughnut chain opened at Whitfords City, north-west of Perth on Wednesday morning . The 19-year-old said he was the only person who camped on Sunday but it started to pick up over the days . Security guards and traffic management have been operating in the area since Wednesday, as thousands are expected to rush through the doors throughout the day. It comes just months after the first store opened in South Australia but the Krispy Kreme opening got out of hand when the long queues caused fights between doughnut-mad customers. Police were called to the outlet more than 20 times within the week of opening, after brawls between impatient customers  and two teenagers were robbed of their doughnuts at knifepoint. And about 145 parking fines totalling $21,000 were issued to drivers who parked illegally, which also caused a traffic chaos in the area.

"A sad little dog that waits in vain at a hospital for her beloved owner who has long since passed away has become Russia's answer to Scotland's 'Greyfriars Bobby'. Masha has been turning up looking for her master since he passed away at the Siberian hospital last year. The case mirrors that of the loyal Skye terrier who became known as Greyfriars Bobby  for refusing to leave his owner's Scottish grave for 14 years. Scroll down for video . Masha waits in vain for her beloved owner who has long since passed away in Siberia . Masha has been turning up looking for her master since he passed away at the Siberian hospital last year . Masha has become a well-known, and much loved, figure at the Novosibirsk District Hospital Number One, where patients and staff ensure she has a warm bed and food to eat. Doctors are hoping someone will take pity on the dog and offer her a new home. 'You see her eyes, how sad they are - it's not the usual shiny eyes for when a dog is happy. You can see this in animals in the same way as with people,' chief doctor Vladimir Bespalov told The Siberian Times. He said: 'There is nothing medicine can do for her here, but we are still hoping that Masha will be able to find another owner. 'One day, and we very much want this day to come soon, our Masha will trust somebody.' The dog turned up at the hospital two years ago with her sick owner; she was his only visitor and at night returned to their home to guard it, before returning to the hospital in the morning . Masha - who looks like a dachshund although staff do not know what breed she is - has been coming into the hospital's reception every day since her owner was admitted almost two years ago. The elderly man, from the village of Dvurechie, had fallen ill and came to the hospital with his pet. Whilst he was staying on the ward, Masha was his only visitor. At night she returned to their home to guard it against intruders, before returning to the hospital in the morning. Something she has done ever since. Nurse Alla Vorontsova said a family recently tried to adopt Masha. She was taken to their home on a Friday evening, but was back at the hospital by 3am the following day. She said: 'I don't think she will ever leave here.' A granite fountain and a statue were commissioned by a countess and erected a year later in honour of Greyfriars Bobby, who visited his owner's grave every day for 14 years . The dog's story became a Walt Disney movie in 1961; Â the dog who played Greyfriars Bobby in the film is pictured above with the filmmaker . When Greyfriars Bobby's owner, police night watchman Constable John Gray, died in 1858 he was buried without a gravestone in Greyfriars Kirk, yet his devoted pet managed to find the spot and stayed there, guarding it and only leaving for food. He was seen there every day by people in the Old Town of Edinburgh until his death in 1872. A granite fountain and a statue were commissioned by a countess and erected a year later in his honour, and there have been a number of books and movies about his life, including one made by Walt Disney in 1961. His own burial plot in the churchyard was eventually marked with a headstone in 1981. There are also similarities to the story of the Japanese dog Hachiko, who kept turning up at a train station in Tokyo 10 years after his master's 1925 death. In 1935 the dog's body was found in a Tokyo street and his remains were stuffed, mounted and put on display in Japan's National Science Museum, while a bronze statue was erected outside Shibuya. A Hollywood movie of the sad story, starring Richard Gere, was released in cinemas in 2010.","Masha turned up at the Siberian hospital with her owner two years ago .

"Russian millionaires now buy one in five of Londonâs most expensive properties, figures show. A study by Knight Frank found that 21 per cent of the properties it had sold for over Â£10million in the last six months had gone to Russian buyers. This compares to just 13 per cent in the previous six months. It means Russian buyers are fast catching up on UK millionaires, who bought 36 per cent of the capitalâs âsuper-primeâ property over the same period. Russian millionaires now buy one in five of Londonâs most expensive properties, figures show, including those in Belgravia (stock picture) The estate agent said Russian buyers were âre-emerging after a period of uncertaintyâ, including the conflict between pro-Russian separatists and Ukraine's military. Russian oligarchs have bought swathes of mansions in the exclusive boroughs of Kensington, Mayfair and Belgravia in recent years. In 2011, billionaire Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, bought a Â£90million mansion on the countryâs most expensive street, a stoneâs throw from Kensington Palace. His home in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London â known as Billionaires Row â has more than 15 bedrooms and extensive gardens. Roman Abramovich's London's home, not far from Chelsea's home ground Stamford Bridge, is worth Â£88million . Tim Wright, of Knight Frank, said yesterday: âThe Russians are back. âAfter a period of uncertainty and instability, they appear to have more clarity on where they stand, which has given them the confidence to get back into the market.â The report showed a marked rise in the number of Chinese buyers also purchasing homes over Â£10million in the capital in the last six months â rising from ânegligible numbersâ to four per cent. Mr Wright said: âWe are beginning to see some serious interest from ultra-high net worth mainland Chinese buyers.â He said signs of weakness in the Chinese economy meant the UK was seen as a âsafe havenâ for their money. Russian oligarchs have bought swathes of mansions in the exclusive boroughs of Kensington, Mayfair (pictured) and Belgravia in recent years . Knight Frank also found Middle Eastern and American buyers bought six per cent of âsuper-primeâ properties in the six months to October, while Indian buyers snapped up four per cent. It follows fears that foreign investment is pushing up property prices because some are willing to pay above-market value for the chance to put their money in the British housing industry. Last month it emerged that family homes in South Wales and Bristol and flats in Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the houses being offered at foreign property shows and on estate agent websites in China and Russia. Until recently, foreign investors have largely focused on mansions and exclusive riverside flats in London. But overseas investors keen to make a profit from the booming UK property market are now buying up family homes around the country. In some cases Chinese investors armed with cash and cheap bank loans are touring northern towns in order to find the right investments.","Russian oligarchs bought swathes of mansions in exclusive boroughs .

"The former boss of the Food Standards Agency who walked straight into a job at Tesco has lobbied against the naming and shaming of supermarkets selling âdirty chickenâ, it has been claimed. The agency is set to publish figures this week showing the number of birds sold by individual stores that carry potentially lethal bacteria. But Smith allegedly met with Government departments to warn them that publishing the figures would create a food scare. Campylobacter, a common group of dangerous bacteria found on raw chicken, is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the UK. Mr Smith lobbied ministers to keep data on 'dirty chicken' - poultry infected with potentially deadly campylobacter - a secret, potentially breaching the terms of his contract at Tesco . It is linked to 280,000 food poisoning cases every year, as well as up to 100 deaths, and is estimated to cost the British economy Â£900million due to illness suffered by workers. According to a report in the Guardian, he told a senior civil servant at the Department of Health that the move would also harm the industry, potentially breaching the terms of his new job. Smith moved directly from his role as head of the regulator to the leading supermarket, where he became technical director, in October 2012. But his new job, which was given the seal of approval by the Prime Minister, came with the caveat that he could not lobby ministers or civil servants on behalf of the company for two years. It is not yet clear when Smith allegedly lobbied figures linked to the FSA report, but the timing of his intervention could see him in breach of the conditions. An FSA report to be published later this week is expected to be highly critical of the major supermarkets over the number of infected birds they sell, with previous studies finding six in ten birds carrying the bacteria. The  Food Standards Agency is preparing to publish the data this week. Campylobacter is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the UK . It is expected to highlight the inability of both supermarkets and farmers to tackle the problem and the agency is expected to warn shoppers to double bag chicken due to bacteria on packaging. The agency has fought for supermarkets to take the problem more seriosuly for years, including when Smith was at its helm, making his intervention more bizarre. Huw Irranca-Davies, shadow food and farming minister, wrote to Jeremy Hunt earlier this month demanding assurances that Smith did not lobby the Department of Health but has not yet had a reply. It is claimed that Smith met a senior civil servant on the Department of Healthâs public health division, raising his concerns about publishing Campylobacter results. The agency has also been subjected to intense lobbying from the Business Retail Consortium, which represents the supermarkets, in an attempt to force them to drop plans to individually name and shame. Several Government departments have also raised their concerns to the FSA. Tesco did not comment on whether Smith had lobbied in breach of his employment conditions. In a statement the supermarket said: âWe work in close collaboration with our suppliers, other retailers and relevant food and health authorities to address the issue at all stages of the supply chain.â It added that the company is âcommitted to the reduction of the industry-wide issue of campylobacter in poultryâ. A preliminary study by the FSA in August found that the potentially lethal bacteria was on the outside of chicken packaging in 4 per cent of cases. Agency officials were so concerned about campylobacter contamination of chicken that it launched a survey of the meat on sale in supermarkets with the intention of regularly publishing a âname and shameâ list.","Tim Smith moved from head of Food Standards Agency directly to Tesco .

James Kingston who scaled the 12 storey thin metal crane in Southampton without the use of a harness or any safety gear . On reaching the top of the crane, the 24-year-old balances at the top, knowing a gust of wind or a slight wobble would send him plummeting to the ground . Once steadying himself, Mr Kingston stands tall and looks down to the street below with the footage captured on his head camera . The video of his exploits was captured on a head camera and after being posted to Youtube has already racked up 50,000 views. The 24-year-old started free-running seven years ago after being inspired by a documentary on the past time. He said: 'I get a huge sense of freedom, it's super peaceful as I do most stuff at around 5am and I just have this massive appreciation for life. The footage, which was posted on Youtube, shows Mr Kingston approaching the building site before running over to scaffolding and beginning to climb up it . Mr Kingston has climbed many tall buildings and began the dangerous past time after being impressed by seeing a documentary on free-running . The free-runner says he doesn't consider himself to be reckless when climbing the buildings and says he is careful no to damage them . 'People assume I run off adrenaline and get some kind of 'rush' from it but it's not like that at all. 'Some people can't understand it and therefore are afraid of it and want to get rid of it as soon as they can. 'I'm not reckless, I care about what I'm doing and we're careful not to damage the buildings we're on.' Mr Kingston, who is from Southampton, has scaled many high buildings and says dangling hundreds of feet above cities allows him to fulfil his creative potential. It's not the first time Mr Kingston has climbed a crane in his home city as last year he hung from a 250ft structure with just one hand as he captured the terrifying challenge on camera. It took him twenty minutes to climb to the dizzying heights and the video was subsequently viewed by over three million people. He added: 'I wasn't scared. You can't afford to be scared when you're hanging by your fingertips. I did it for the adventure.' 'I didn't go up there to die. I went up there to live.' Last week, he was in Dubai where he climbed the city's second tallest building, The Princess Tower, a 101-storey residential building in the Marina district. The video of Mr Kingston scaling the crane has been posted to Youtube and has already had nearly 50,000 views in just four days . Just last week, Mr Kingston was spotted in Dubai, where he climbed the city's second tallest building, The Princess Tower, a 101-storey residential building .

But the authorities in the city were unimpressed by his stunt and he was arrested, although he was eventually freed without charge. He was also detained by authorities in Ukraine in April after climbing to the top of the Moscow Bridge in Kiev, and performing a back flip.

"A couple on a romantic stroll were left shocked after they stumbled upon an outdoor cannabis farm in an area of suburban woodland. Oscar Lerin, 35, was out for a walk with his girlfriend in Epping Forest when he strayed a few metres off the path in search of mushrooms. The couple couldn't believe their eyes when they found themselves surrounded by around 70 professionally-cultivated adult marijuana plants. Oscar Lerin and his girlfriend were walking in Epping Forest north of London when they stumbled upon up to 70 cannabis plants growing not far from a busy path . The couple made the discovery on Saturday morning in a patch of woodland close to a school in Woodford Green, Essex.

We couldn't believe it. We were like ""really? Is this real?"" We never expected to see something like that in a public forest. 'We like nature and we went to Epping Forest to have a walk and have a look at mushrooms and identify them. 'We were just walking and walking and I looked around and I thought this looks like a marijuana plantation.' Mr Lerin and his girlfriend, who asked not to be identified, posed with the plants before continuing their walk . Mr Lerin added: 'The smell was really strong so I knew it could be nothing else. It was very close to the path, behind a big bush. 'I think there was around 60 or 70 plants and it covered quite a large area - about 15 or 20 square metres. 'The soil was different. We had a look and there was a sheet of plastic on the ground and the different soil was on top and the plants were in there.' The park is a former royal forest on the border between north-east Greater London and Essex and managed by City of London Corporation.

"Arsenal target William Carvalho has revealed he is desperate to move to the Premier League. The Gunners failed with an initial offer Â£15m last summer for the midfielder after Sporting slapped a Â£30m price tag on his head. The Portuguese club are ready to reopen talks with Arsenal willing to pay Â£20m and his agent Jorge Mendes is trying to broker a deal. VIDEO Scroll down to see Carvalho take out two players in one tackle . William Carvalho (left) is a Â£20million target for Arsenal in January . Carvalho (left) was wanted by Wenger in the past but the clubs were unable to agree a fee . Carvalho told Portuguese publication Record: 'My dream is to play in England. I know some clubs are interested but my agent Jorge is looking after it and I am relaxed. 'Now my mission is to work in Sporting and they will be in charge of any transfer and my future. That is very important.' Talks between the two clubs broke down in the autumn after Carvalho was valued at Â£30m by his Portuguese team. Arsene Wenger is open to buying reinforcements in the January window . But with Arsene Wenger taking Arsenal through to the Champions League knockout stages, where they face Monaco, the importance of solving their well-documented defensive problems have increased. Carvalho, 22, is one of the very few top international-class players who will probably be available in January. Sporting were eliminated from the Champions League by losing their final group game against Chelsea on December 10 and though they will be in the Europa League, they are willing to cash in on their biggest asset. Arsenal's initial offer of Â£15m two months ago was dismissed but the negotiations ended on friendly terms. Arsenal have been playing Mathieu Flamini in front of the back four with Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta out injured. Carvalho can also play at centre back. The youngster played in two of Portugal's three games at the World Cup and was also linked with Manchester United, although they have since signed Daley Blind.","Arsene Wenger ready to make fresh Â£20m bid forÂ William Carvalho .

"Disney is in trouble. No sooner had their Habit Heroes attraction - which tackles childhood obesity - opened at the popular Florida resort than it was abruptly closed 'for retooling'. Epcot's new interactive exhibit has been blamed for stigmatizing and singling out fat children. Some parents called it 'horrifying and insensitive' The official opening date was set to be March 5 and this has now been 'indefinitely postponed'. Scroll down for video . Villains: Lead Bottom, left, and Insecura, right, are two of the characters featured . Web: The interactive exhibit, Habit Heroes, featured animated fitness superheros Will Power and Callie Stenics and super-sized villains Snacker and Lead Bottom . Orlando Epcot Centre where the Habit Heroes exhibition was open for three weeks before being closed for 'retooling' A spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the health insurer which partnered with Disney to create the exhibit, said: 'Habit Heroes is currently in a . soft-opening period, which gives us a chance to collect guest feedback . and test and adjust the attraction prior to its opening.' Inside the park's Innovations section, Habit Heroes features characters Will Buff and Callie Stenics. The animated fitness gurus take groups through each room where they teach about bad habits like watching too much television and eating junk food. Cartoon villains include the super-sized Snacker, Sweet Tooth and Lead Bottom. The heroes encourage children to destroy the 'baddies' using weapons such as fruit and vegetables to destroy unhealthy food. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance said: 'It appears that Disney now believes . that using the tool of shame, favored so much by today's healthcare . corporations, is the best way to communicate with children. Fitness heroes: Will Buff and Callie Stenics teach Lead Bottom how to break his bad habits . Bad habits: Drama Queen and Control Freak are other habits which are discouraged . 'Disney, in partnering with Blue Cross/Blue . Shield, has taken the side of the bullies.' John W. Herbkersman from Blue Cross/Blue Shield told the Orlando Sentinel: 'Our goal is to ensure that the . attraction conveys a positive message about healthy lifestyles in a fun . and empowering way. 'To work on further improving and . refining the experience, the attraction is closed for the time being. We look forward to officially opening it soon.' A message on the exhibits corresponding website says it is also closed for maintenance. The founder of the Bariatric Medical Institute in Ottawa and family doctor Yoni Freedhoff, raised concerns about the new exhibit, posting on his blog: 'So thanks for being so helpful Disney. I mean if your kid is not overweight or obese, hereâs to Disney reinforcing societyâs most hateful negative obesity stereotyping, and if they are overweight or obese. 'What kid doesnât want to be made to feel like a personal failure while on a Disney family vacation. 'A little Dance, Dance Revolution and . some broccoli spears ought to clear everything up, right? 'Here's to Disney's reinforcing society's most hateful negative obesity . stereotyping.' Peggy Howell, also with the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, said: 'I was really disturbed to see the most negative habits were attached to really fat bodies. 'These pictures further the stigma against people of higher body weight.' Disney spokeswoman Kathleen Prihoda said: 'Thatâs why we have a soft opening. So we can open it up to others and listen. Weâve heard the feedback.'","Characters like Drama Queen, Insecura and Lead Bottom are the villains at Habit Heroes .

"If humans worked together as well as ants, we might be more productive. The creatures have long been known to work collectively to protect nests from predators and even to form life rafts in the event of a flood. But now they have been caught on camera forming 'daisy chains' to pull a large dead millipede to their colony. The behaviour has never been seen before and scientists are struggling to explain it. Scroll down for video . With a little help from their friends: Ants have been caught on camera forming chains to pull a large dead millipede along (pictured). The behaviour has never been seen before and scientists are struggling to explain it . Video footage shows a species of ants called Leptogenys making a chain to transport the heavy burden, somewhere in south east Asia. Leptogenys is a very common type of ant that can be found in tropical and sub-tropical climates around the world. Terry McGlynn, an entomologist at California State University at Dominguez Hills told The Atlantic that the daisy-chain strategy used by the ants has not been seen before. Helen McCreery, a PhD student at the University of Colorado, is an expert in cooperative transport strategies in ants and has recently published a paper detailing 40 genera of the creatures that work together to bring food back to their nests. Strategies range from two ants carrying a leaf together, to weaver ant workers banding together to carry bats and even snakes up tree trunks. Unique? Helen McCreery, a PhD student at the University of Colorado, is an expert in cooperative transport strategies in ants said the ant's daisy chain technique is special because they are grabbing on to one another instead of food, as seen here with leaf cutters carrying pieces of greenery . Woodland ants work together to jointly squirt foul-smelling liquid when they sense a threat overhead â such as a hungry bird. The formic acid is not harmful to humans and has the same odour as vinegar. However, it is enough to scare off larger predators such as woodpeckers and jay birds, who could wreak havoc on an ant nest â but the attack must be launched cohesively to have the desired effect. In the event of flooding, fire ants self-assemble into life-preserving raft using different body parts, including their claws and mandibles. Engineers and mathematicians at Georgia Tech found the tiny creatures linked their bodies together in a similar way to how waterproof fabric is woven. An individual antâs exoskeleton is moderately hydrophobic so it can shrug off water, but the ants enhance their water repellence by linking their bodies together. âTo me, this behaviour seems to be different from what's been observed in other ants (including the weaver ants) in an important way,âshe told the publication. âThese Leptogenys are moving their prey by grasping onto ants, instead of all grasping onto the prey itself. 'One could argue that the chains occur because ants just grab onto anything attached to the prey they are trying to move, but I don't think that's what's going on here.' Ms McCreery pointed out that ants are very good at telling the difference between their own species and anything else, so it would not be a mistake. Individual ants may not be intelligent, but when the creatures work together as a colony, they can achieve herculean feats, whether that is launching a coordinated acid attack on a threatening bird, or manoeuvring a hefty piece of food into a small hole. Biologists sometimes refer to the animals as a superorganism â a species that can only be appreciated in a group rather than as individuals. For example, Woodland ants work together to jointly squirt foul-smelling liquid when they sense a threat overhead â such as a hungry bird. The formic acid is not harmful to humans and has the same odour as vinegar. However, it is enough to scare off larger predators such as woodpeckers and jay birds, who could wreak havoc on an ant nest â but the attack must be launched cohesively to have the desired effect. Ants work together to survive in more peaceful ways too. In the event of flooding, fire ants self-assemble into life-preserving raft using different body parts, including their claws and mandibles. Dead useful: The video footage shows a species of ants called Leptogenys making a chain to transport the heavy burden, somewhere in south east Asia. Other species of ants collect dead insects ad transport them - but they don;t use daisy chains. Here, ants transport a piece of a dead bristle worm in India . Engineers and mathematicians at Georgia Tech found the tiny creatures linked their bodies together in a similar way to how waterproof fabric is woven. An antâs exoskeleton is moderately hydrophobic so it can shrug off water, but the ants enhance their water repellence by linking their bodies together. The researchers froze the fire ants to observe that they construct rafts when placed in water by gripping each other with mandibles, claw and adhesive pads at a force 400 times their body weight. The result was a viscous and elastic material that is almost like a fluid composed of ant âmolecules,â they said. The ants spread out from a sphere into a pancake-shaped raft that resisted submerging them in water. Itâs a real thrill unravelling what at first looks like chaos,â Professor Tovey from the university said. âTo understand what the individual behaviours are and how they combine in order to achieve the function of the group is the central puzzle one encounters when studying social insects.â","BehaviourÂ has not been seen before and experts are struggling to explain it .

"The family of an Ohio biker has fulfilled his dying wish by burying him astride his beloved Harley-Davidson in a see-through casket. Dressed in his leathers and sunglasses, and sitting on top of his 1967 Electra Glide cruiser, Billy Standley, who died on Sunday, was taken for one last ride. The body of the 82-year-old, who died of lung cancer, was visible through the transparent Plexiglas coffin that his bike has been placed in. Billy Standley, of Mechanicsburg, Ohio, carried out his wish to be buried on his 1967 Harley Davidson motorcycle on Friday. He was placed upright in a large Plexiglas casket . Nothing to hide: The man of the hour was front and center during his funeral service in Mechanicsburg, Ohio . For years the Mechanicsburg man had told family and friends that he didn't just want to ride off to heave, he wanted the world to see him do it in a big see-through box. He started the funeral preparations himself, buying three large burial plots next to his wife, Lorna so the hole would be big enough to accommodate his unique casket. His sons Pete and Roy fashioned a casket out of Plexiglas and reinfornced the bottom with wood and metal. Theresa Adams, Bill Standley's daughter, says goodbye to her dad . Standley told people he didn't just want to ride off to heaven, he wanted the world to see him do it in the big see-through box. His extra large plot will leave him next to his wife for all time . To ensure Mr Standley didn't become unseated on his final journey, embalmers prepared his body with a metal back brace and straps. 'Weâve done personalization â¦ but nothing this extreme,' Tammy Vernon, who works at the funeral home, told the Dayton Daily News. 'He was the one who kept throwing this idea out there, to be buried on his bike. We were glad to assist him.' The family man was pleased with his funeral plans and would show off the casket, which was stored for five years in a garage, to visitors. Throwback: Billy Standley riding his prized motorcycle many years ago . Hog heaven: Standley had spoken about being buried on his Harley for years.

Upright til eternity:  Five embalmers worked to prepare Standley's body with a metal back brace and straps to ensure he'll never lose his seat . 'He was proud of it,' Roy Standley said. While his family agreed that the procession to the cemetery, during which the body was on display, may be shocking, they wanted to honor their father's last wish. 'He'd done right by us all these years, and at least we could see he goes out the way he wanted to,' Pete Standley said. His daughter, Dorothy, added that he was 'a quirky man'. Mr Standley, who used to work as a bareback rodeo rider, was be escorted to the ceremony by a procession of bikers. Some of the mourners at his graveside donned motorcycle jackets for the occasion as they watched the extra large coffin be lowered into its massive plot.","Billy Standley and his sons spent years preparing for unique burial .

"Politicians use gestures to strengthen the delivery of speeches, while many people shrug or move their hands wildly to make a point. Now, scientists have shown that gesticulating while talking is part of language and affects how the meaning of words is interpreted. Researchers believe that gestures form part of a communication system deeply ingrained in humans, which allow us to be understood. Scroll down for video . Politicians such as David Cameron (pictured) use gestures to strengthen the delivery of speeches, while many people shrug or move their hands wildly to make a point. Now, scientists have shown that gesticulating while talking is part of language and affects how the meaning of words is interpreted . This might explain why many of us gesture while talking on the phone, where our actions can't be seen. Dr Marina Nespor, a neuroscientist at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) of Trieste, Italy, who carried out the research set out to explore why humans find it difficult to keep still while speaking. She thinks itâs because gestures and words âvery probablyâ form a single communication system, which serves to enhance expression and help us to make ourselves understood. âIn human communication, voice is not sufficient: even the torso and in particular hand movements are involved, as are facial expressions,â she said. Researchers believe that gestures (pictured) form part of a communication system deeply ingrained in humans, which allow us to be understood . Together with research fellow Dr Alan Langus, she studied prosody, which is what makes a sentence understood in a specific way and usually relies on intonation and the rhythm of language. For example, without prosody, nothing would distinguish the spoken statement âthis is an appleâ from the âthis is an apple?â If gestures are ingrained in humans, it might explain why many of us gesture while talking on the phone, (stock image) where our actions can't be seen . in their study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, the experts say that prosody should include gestures. Dr Langus explained: âProsodic information, for the person receiving the message, is a combination of auditory and visual cues. âThe âsuperiorâ aspects at the cognitive processing level of spoken language are mapped to the motor-programmes responsible for the production of both speech sounds and accompanying hand gesturesâ. To come to their conclusion, the researchers asked 20 Italian speakers to listen to various sentences with ambiguous meanings and watch videos of people saying the sentences. In the videos, the sentences could be âmatchedâ â when gestures corresponded to the meaning of the spoken words â or âmismatchedâ when the gestures matched an alternative meaning. âIn the matched conditions there was no improvement ascribable to gestures,â Dr Langus said. âThe participantsâ performance was very good both in the video and in the audio only sessions.â He said that it is in the mismatched experiment that the effect of hand gestures became clear. âWith these stimuli the subjects were much more likely to make the wrong choice - that is, theyâd choose the meaning indicated in the gestures rather than in the speech - compared to matched or audio-only conditions. âThis means that gestures affect how meaning is interpreted and we believe this points to the existence of a common cognitive system for gestures, intonation and rhythm of spoken language.â Spontaneously moving your hands to illustrate a point can help boost a child's language development, researchers say. Gesture-plus-word combinations can make it easier for children to grasp what certain words and phrases mean - even during sign language. The findings back up previous research which found gesticulating helps youngsters develop their language, learning and cognitive skills. The study, released in August by Dr Susan Goldin-Meadow, from the University of Chicago, examined how gesturing contributes to language learning in hearing and in deaf children. She concluded that gesture is a flexible way of communicating, one that can work with language to communicate or, if necessary, can itself become language.","Scientists at the International School for Advanced Studies of Trieste, Italy, believe gestures as means of communication are deeply ingrained in humans .

"Sent to clear up some unwanted graffiti, this workerman couldn't have imagined he would be the inspiration for the next work on the very same wall. But this is the moment an artist decided to turn an image of the man sent to remove his artwork into art. Stencil artist - who is known only as âDSâ - created his first piece âBad Kittyâ on a wall in London as an amusing comment on the âsqueaky clean imageâ of the Hello Kitty character. DS, who is 28, and from London, created his artwork in May but eight hours later he was surprised to see someone already in the process of removing it. Clear up: The unnamed workerman started removing the graffiti - unaware he has become a model for the next artwork to appear on the same wall . Deciding to document the act of erasing his work, DS took photos of the moment and then used one to show the man that removed it. Amazingly the artwork featuring the mystery man has not been removed and is still on the wall in Essex Road, Islington, today. DS said: 'I did the first piece âBad Kittyâ late last year with the second May this year. 'The first piece isnât my style but I have a bit of a dislike of Hello Kittys squeaky clean image so I wanted to use her and Miffy. Centre of attention: A stenciled representation of the workerman, pictured removing the Hello Kitty work, left, is now featured on the same wall, right, which he was sent to clean up . Exhibition: The new work is becoming a local fixture having been left on the wall of the shop on Essex Road, Islington . 'My reaction to it being removed was a little different than normally. Knowing a piece as been removed or painted over doesnât bother me, itâs the name of the game in graffiti but this time was a little different as it only lasted eight hours. In action: Stencil artist - who is known only as DS - decided to make the removal of his first piece of graffiti the basis for his second work . 'So you can imagine my frustration when coming back I found the council (or private company Iâm not sure) starting the process of erasing it from the wall - which I documented. 'Looking through the images I took I saw a great one of the removals man so I wanted to put him up in the same space. 'Having known they were mighty quick to respond to graffiti there I was up early the next day in hope to get a photo of him, removing a stencil of him, removing a stencil. 'I thought it would rip a hole in the space-time continuum or something. He came when I was across the road having breakfast, after a while and having his photo taken next to it lots of times he left it.' DS said it was a strange time for street art at the moment. He said: 'Banksy does a piece and it gets protected by the council with perspex and another piece from a just as edgy artist with better technical skills gets taken down. 'I donât think the council should decide on the legitimacy or worthiness of a piece but rather let graffiti run itâs natural course even if that means great art being painted over - another one will takes its place. Islington Council said it was not aware of the graffiti and that it was not one of their employees who had removed the work from the wall. A spokesman said: 'There are three reasons we would clean off graffiti: If it is offensive, if it is on council property, or if it is on private property and the owner wants it removed.'","Original work by stencil artist DS was removed within hours .

'There's no question as to what happened to my daughter and when it happened. I saw it. I heard her crying.' Hi ex-wife and the mother, Danielle Rowe, does not dispute what happened. After the incident, the young boy was not charged but underwent psychiatric evaluation and spent subsequent years in group homes. Now, Rowe says she just wants her family to heal while she believes Sumner is trying to destroy them. 'He [Sumner] wanted my son charged for attempted murder and put on death row,' Rowe said. 'He wants to destroy a 12-year-old who made a mistake.' Vanessa Prieto, who is Rowe's attorney, says the mother is following all the necessary safety measures and precautions when her son does visit, making sure that he and his stepsister are never alone. That, however, is still not enough for Sumner, who has been vigilant and maybe even gone too far in order to try and protect his children. Prieto claims Sumner filed 'numerous false domestic violence claims about my client which have all been dismissed' and sent 'indecent and improper threats' to Rowe. Full custody: Rowe (above) was granted full custody of her daughter after he ex-husband, Carl Sumner, took her and her brother to North Carolina for nine months, keeping them out of school . He also took his two children, his now eight-year-old daughter and her twin brother into hiding in North Carolina for nine months, during which time they did not attend school. Following this incident, Rowe was granted full custody, though she did allow Sumner to visit with his children, even unsupervised, until the court stepped in Â and said he should not be around the children. A court-appointed guardian testified that Sumner was 'a danger, possibly physically and definitely mentally, and a flight risk,' according to Prieto. At one point he wrote a messageÂ calling his stepson a future 'serial killer' and saying that the boy wanted to turn his 'little daughter into his ""superslut.""' A page seeking justice for his young daughterÂ was also created at one point as well that called his estranged wife a 'pedophile' and a 'psychopath.' 'Itâs very sad,' says Sumner's former attorney, Katherine Corrigan. 'Heâs a good dad. He absolutely loves his kids and will do anything to protect them.'","Carl Sumner is trying to stop his 17-year-old stepson from being near his daughter after he allegedly assaulted her four years ago .

"Nasaâs Cassini spacecraft, which has been in orbit around Saturn since 30 June 2004, has returned stunning new images of the gas giant and its various moons. Close-up views of Saturnâs clouds, an amazing sunrise as well as several of its moons are revealed in unprecedented detail. The pictures were released by the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (Ciclops). Nasaâs Cassini spacecraft has returned stunning new images of Saturn and its moons. Here the planet is seen circled by its rings nearly edge-on. The object lower right is the moon Tethys, while Mimas is a bit further up at the 4 o'clock position if you follow the rings . In one stunning image Saturn is seen lit up by the sun with its rings nearly edge-on. The shadow of the rings is also clearly seen near the south pole of the gas giant. Another image showcases a close-up of Saturnâs north pole, showing swirling clouds making their way around the planet. And elsewhere, a new day on the planet is seen dawning as it emerges into light. The planet rotates in 10 hours and 40 minutes, meaning its days and nights are much shorter than on Earth. Equally remarkable are the colour mosaics of various moons released by the Cassini team.The global mosaics were produced using images taken by the Cassini spacecraft in its first ten years exploring the Saturnian system. This view is looking towards the sunlit side of Saturnâs rings from about 25 degrees above the ringplane. It too was taken at a distance of 1.1 million miles (1.8 million km), with the scale in the image being 67 miles (108km) per pixel . The fascinating moon Titan is seen in the background at the top right here, partially lit by the sun as small particles high in its atmosphere scatter the light of the distant Sun. In the foreground is Saturn from a distance of 1.1 million miles (1.8 million km) This image shows the cloud dynamics on Saturn, which astronomers study to better understand fluid flows. This is useful for studying our own atmosphere, and possibly that of other planetary bodies as well. This view was taken from a distance of 1.1 million miles (1.8 million km) Launch: 15 October 1997 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida . Dimensions: 22 feet (6.7 metres) high; 13.1 feet (4 meters) wide . Total weight: 5,712 kilograms (12,593 pounds) with fuel, Huygens probe, adapter, etc . Orbiter weight (unfueled): 2,125 kilograms (4,685 pounds) Power: 885 watts (633 watts at end of mission) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators . Distance traveled to reach Saturn: 2.2 billion miles (3.5 billion kilometres) Key instruments: Imaging radar, cosmic dust analyser, infrared mapping spectrometer . Earlier this year, Cassini celebrated its tenth year in orbit around Saturn - the first and only spacecraft to circle the planet. Since then it has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including lakes on the moon Titan and giant storms on Saturn. The mission is jointly run by Nasa, Esa and the Italian Space Agency (Asi). Its total cost is about Â£1.9 billion ($3.26 billion), of which the U.S. supplied 80 per cent, Europe 15 per cent and Italy 5 per cent. It was launched on 18 October 1997 and, during its seven-year trip to Saturn, it flew by Venus, the Moon and Jupiter. The highlight of its initial year at Saturn was arguably the release of the Huygens probe onto the surface of Titan. On Christmas day 2004 this probe, 4.3 ft (1.3 metres) across, was released and, on 14 January 2005, it entered the atmosphere of Saturnâs largest moon Titan. That same day it became the first spacecraft ever to touch down on a body in the outer solar system and, in the process, spotted surface features that indicated the presence of liquids. Since then Titan has been studied in depth by Cassini, and in so doing it has revealed lakes and seas on its surface, in addition to its thick atmosphere. It has also studied in depth many of Saturnâs dozens of other moons. Here we see a global, colour mosaic of Saturnâs icy moon Enceladus. The yellow and magenta tones show the difference in thickness of surface deposits. The moon is covered in ice and might harbour a liquid ocean underground . This image shows the amazing world of Iapetus with a resolution of 400 metres per pixel. Iapetus is fascinating as it has a bizarre âtwo-toneâ colouration, in addition to a giant crater and a giant equatorial ridge that runs three quarters of the way around the moon . Cassini has sent back hundreds of gigabytes of scientific data, enabling the publication of more than 3,000 scientific reports. The mission will come to a conclusion in 2017, when the spacecraft will no longer have enough fuel to maintain its orbit around Saturn. To prevent it accidentally crashing on and contaminating one of the moons, Nasa will send the spacecraft diving into the atmosphere of Saturn. In the process the spacecraft will be crushed and destroyed, but not before it returns fascinating information about the gas giantâs cloud tops. This last task will also mark the end of an era; currently there is no future spacecraft planned to visit Saturn. With interest instead focusing on Mars, Jupiter and other moons like Europa, it may be some time before Saturn gets another mission of its own. Some areas of the scientific community, though, are hoping form a mission to Titan. And they may just get their wish if, before its plunge into Saturnâs atmosphere, Cassini spots something on the surface that piques the interest of the whole world. The Cassini spacecraft (illustration shown) has been in orbit around Saturn since 30 June 2004. In 2017, when it runs out of fuel, it will be sent on a daring dive into the atmosphere of Saturn to gather data about the planet's atmosphere .","Nasa scientists in California have revealed stunning images of Saturn and its various moons .

"A 58-year-old motorist was callously run down from behind after confronting a driver who was tailing him. The unnamed man, who was driving a Nissan Almera through Moscow in Russia, got out of his car at a red light to ask the driver behind him why he was being followed. But rather than answer his question, the driver, who has been named as Igor Kalmykov, waits for the man to turn his back then accelerates into him. Scroll down for video . Crush: The BMW driver rams into the 58-year-old man, crushing him against the body of his own Nissan . Looking on: The driver, named as Igor Kalmykov, gets out of his car and spends a second looking at the hurt man before inspecting his own car for damage and driving off . The victim, who was climbing back into his own car at the time, was dragged along the road by the car before it comes to a stop just a few feet in front of him. While the injured man was writhing in agony on the floor, clutching his hip, Kalmykov gets out, inspects his own vehicle, and drives off. The incident was captured by another driver on a 'dashcam' recorder, which are commonly used by Russian drivers for insurance reasons. The footage shows Moments later, Kalmykov drives away when the light turns green as other drivers and passers-by rush to help the stricken man, who was later admitted to hospital. The injured driver later described his ordeal,explaining that the driver had been tailing him for some time. Help at last: Members of the public eventually come to the aid of the man, who had been writhing on the road . He told the Life News website: 'I just moved along the road and beeped to this BMW to make him take left or right, so I could overtake him. 'He began to drive close behind me. As we stopped at the traffic light, I went out and asked him: ""Why are you chasing me? Did I offend you?"" 'Then I went back to my car and as I was opening the door he just hit me at great speed.' The man was speaking from hospital but his injuries are unknown. Kalmykov is believed to have been detained by police for questioning pending expected criminal charges. He had recently bought the BMW from a car hire company whose spokesman said: 'We have assisted the police and the offender was taken for investigation.' Many Rusisan drivers now use 'dashcams' for their own protection in potential insurance claims, which have brought to light a host of road rage incidents that might otherwise go unnoticed by police.","The Nissan driver was rammed into at traffic lights in Moscow .

"Just a week after rumours claimed Facebook is working on a professional version of its social network, reports now suggest we could see it as soon as January. Sources told the Wall Street Journal the tech giant is developing a site that will let users chat with colleagues, as well as collaborate on documents. Dubbed Facebook at Work, it would directly compete with LinkedIn and is expected to be released without adverts. Sources told the Wall Street Journal the California-based tech giant is developing a site designed to let users chat with colleagues and it may begin rolling out 'in early January.'Â Facebook staff are said to have been testing a beta version of the site, and a select number of users will be given access to it after the holidays . Facebook staff are said to have been testing a beta version of the ad-free Facebook at Work, and a select number of users will be given access to the site after the holidays. A study last year found that more than 54 per cent of offices currently block Facebook on work computers to stop it distracting users. 'Facebook is secretly working on a new website called ""Facebook at Work""', claimedÂ reports in the Financial Times last week. '[It] would allow users to ""chat with colleagues, connect with professional contacts and collaborate over documents.' The  site is said to look similar to Facebook, including its blue and white design, news feed and group pages. Facebook has been looking to expand its services for year. Recently, it unveiled an app called Room that lets people chat anonymously in virtual 'rooms,' evoking the chat services from the early days of the web. It is also testing a feature that lets users of the leading social network make purchases by simply pressing an on-screen 'Buy' button. Meanwhile, Facebook completed its multibillion-dollar deal for mobile messaging application WhatsApp last month. Last week, it revamped is privacy policy to make it easier to understand, after years of criticism. It has also introduced tools to help people manage what they share on the site. The site's security was heightened at the end of last year when it rolled out default encryption, too. Last month,Â Facebook  reported its quarterly profit nearly doubled to Â£511 million ($802 million), but saw its stock hit hard after outlining a plan to invest heavily in the future instead of using its short-term riches. 'We are going to continue preparing for the future by investing aggressively, connecting everyone, understanding the world, and building the next-generation in computing platforms,' said boss Mark Zuckerberg at the time. 'We have a long journey ahead.' The 10-year-old site currently has 1.35 billion monthly active users worldwide, while LinkedIn has more than 332 million members in over 200 countries and territories. According to the professional site, users sign up to join LinkedIn at a rate of more than two new members per second. The site lets professionals 'connect' with each other to form networks.

"A tiny typographical error may have been what led to a plutonium waste barrel packed atÂ Los Alamos National Laboratory to explode, leak through the ground and contaminate 22 workers early this year, says a new report. An order to use the wrong type of kitty litter in the barrels is the likely culprit and thousands of other barrels were packed with it. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported last week the unbelievable bumbling that made a minor mixup into a massive problem at America's only permanent nuclear waste dump. Oops: The Wast Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico was the site of a radiation leak that contaminated 22 employees--all thanks to typo that led toÂ Los Alamos National Laboratory to pack thousands of nuclear waste barrels with the wrong kitty litter . An investigation into the weeks and months leading up to the February 14 rupture outside Santa Fe revealed a man in charge of ensuring the waste atÂ Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is safe chalked the whole thing up to two little letters. 'General consensus is that the ""organic"" designation was a typo that wasnât caught,' Mark Pearcy wrote to his chief nuclear engineer David Freeman back in May. However, those letters meant that up to 5,565 barrels would be mistakenly packed with a wheat-based kitty litter instead of a clay-based one. According to the Santa Fe New Mexican: . 'LANL has never publicly acknowledged the reason why it switched from clay-based litter to the organic variety...' That's a lot of barrels: Up to 5,565 barrels were packed with the wrong kitty litter and sent to the dump a half-mile underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (pictured) Previous findings by government regulators suggest the waste drum--along with 15 others--contained a volatile mix of nitrate salts and organic matter that ruptured the barrel after it was placed in a vault half a mile underground at the plant. Such a mix was shown to be 'inherently hazardous' in a 2000 study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But flawed procedures at Los Alamos fostered a culture 'that permitted the introduction of potentially incompatible materials' in waste drums there, according to the report by the U.S. Energy Department's Office of Inspector General. The lab's 'waste processing and safety-related control procedures should have prevented the addition of these potentially incompatible materials. However, the process failed in this matter,"" federal inspectors said in the report. At the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, officials are working on a plan to decontaminate the mine and seal off the rooms with the suspect waste. Moniz has said it could take up to three years to reopen the multi-billion-dollar site. Officials at the Los Alamos national Lab (pictured) have not said what led to the dangerous mistake. Sixteen of the barrels are believed to contain the chemical elements that led to the explosion at WIPP in February .","The New Mexico facility switched from a clay-based to a plant-based litter, which caused a drum to leak in February .

"Christmas is just around the corner, and for many of us that means spending days lounging about with bloated stomachs and nursing hangovers after one too many. But whatâs the science behind such over-indulging and why do our bodies feel so full after eating too much? The answer is revealed in a video that explains why too much turkey during the festive period can leave you unable to swallow another morsel of food. Scroll down for video . The American Chemical Society has explained the chemistry of eating too much. In the video on their Reactions page they detail the processes taking place (illustrated) when we over-indulge in certain foods. Our stomach has a finite size and squeezes other organs when it's full . The video was created by the American Chemical Societyâs YouTube channel Reactions. They explain that, when you eat a big meal, part of the reason you can feel full is down to the size of your stomach. âYour stomach can stretch the volume of about one litre; thatâs about the size of a burrito,â the narrator says. In 2012, Robert Lustig, a professor of clinical paediatrics at the University of California, explained a new scientific theory on why people eat too much. He argues that the urge to overeat and lounge around doing nothing is not a sign of weakness. It is, he says, a hormonal issue, triggered by eating too much sugar. He points the finger of blame at the hormone leptin, which acts like an appetite thermostat. As one of two âhunger hormonesâ in the body, leptin works to decrease the appetite (its partner, ghrelin, increases appetite). When you have had enough to eat, your fat cells release leptin, which effectively dulls the appetite by instructing the brain that itâs time to stop eating. But Professor Lustig warns that our sweet tooth can send this process haywire and,Â if you are leptin-resistant, food never stops tasting delicious, no matter how much of it you choose to eat. âWhen you eat a big meal you fill your stomach to its limits, squeezing against your other organs and making your abdomen feel, well, full.â When eating your stomach and intestines also fill with gases, not only from food and drink but also gulps of air when you swallow anything. This additional air adds to the swollen sensation you get after eating. Fizzy drinks can make you feel especially full, as the gas that makes them fizzy - namely carbon dioxide - can fill more space than the liquid it came in. Your body can get rid of this gas though - in the form of burps and other methods that donât need to be explained. âFor some people another uncomfortable result of a big meal is heartburn,â the video continues. âThe stomach produces hydrochloric acid to break down food. More food to break down means more acid, which can creep into the oesophagus, leading to that burning feeling.â Antacid tablets can alleviate this pain using bases, which are at the opposite end of the pH scale, to neutralise the acids. Doing this, however, can release more carbon dioxide and increase the feeling of being full. Ingesting air and gas can also lead to people feeling more bloated, while our brain also sends out hormones to warn us to stop eating when it detects we've got too much fat in our bodies. The bloated feeling will be felt by many come Christmas time (stock image shown) But itâs not just on a physical level that you can feel full; your brain also sends signals to stop you eating when it thinks youâve had enough. It releases a hormone called leptin when the amount of fat in your body reaches a certain level, which inhibits hunger. In addition, the video says: âWhen you eat a high-calorie meal, cells in your intestines secrete a hormone called peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, or PYY. âWhen PYY reaches the brain, it binds with receptors that give you the feeling that youâre full. Maybe even a little queasy.â Other hormones also have a similar purpose, to get you to stop eating when youâve had too much. But for some, come Christmas time, thereâs simply too much delicious food available for any notice to be given to these hormones. And instead, theyâll be left to deal with the biological repercussions of over-eating.

"It started out like any other boating trip until she stepped into the water to launch her boat and her legs were attacked by flesh eating creatures. Adele Shrimpton has no idea what left her legs covered in bloody marks this week - and the experts don't either. While standing in just centimetres of water on the Tweed River, an estuary situated in the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, Ms Shrimpton noticed she was being bitten. 'It was like stinging. I thought it was just sea lice, and wasn't worried about it until I got back to my boat,' she told the Tweed Daily News. Adele Shrimpton has no idea what left her legs covered in bloody marks . The marks left from the mystery blood sucking creatures are still clear on Ms Shrimpton's legs . Recalling the moment she discovered her legs had been chewed by an unknown species, she said: 'I went ""holy crap"" - there was all this blood!' Her legs still bear the red marks and scabs of the unexpected attack but local authorities have  been unable to identify what caused the bites, the local newspaper claims. Ms Shrimpton told the paper she is worried about what could happen if the creatures bit the children that swim in the area. A worker at a local Tweed River fishing shop told Daily Mail Australia: 'I've never come across anything like. That sort of baffles me. 'Unless it was a stringer or something but she didn't describe it like that,' she said. The Tweed River is based on volcanic soils and locals say it just boasts normal fish . The local said they just have the normal estuary fish such as Mangrove Jacks, Whiting, Flatheads and Bream in the water. A local council source explained they had not been contacted by Ms Shrimpton and that they would need to receive a report from her before it could be investigated. They said they were unable to 'shed any light' on what happened. The Tweed River, which was originally covered by rainforest, has a fine subtropical climate and is based on volcanic soils. Named after the River Tweed in Britain, it is located at the border of New South Wales and Queensland. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Fisheries  for comment.

"A heartbroken mother has been ordered to get a DNA test carried out on her dead partner - so his name can be put on their baby daughter's birth certificate. Sarah Dixon, from Little Hulton, Salford, lost her partner David Broome in a car smash last month, just weeks after their baby Shenayah was born. But, because the couple were not married, she has been told that his name cannot be added to their nine-week-old baby's birth certificate unless she pays for a DNA test to prove that he was the father. David Broome (pictured with his newborn daughter Shenayah) was fatally injured in a car accident in north Wales in October before he was able to sign his baby's birth certificate . The couple had planned to register the birth together just days before David's tragic death . The law states that unmarried parents need to sign the birth register together or get a court order proving you a parent. Sarah will now have to pay in the region of Â£4,000 to take the fight to court and to pay for DNA to be analysed by a court appointed testing service. Sarah, 25, said: 'We planned to register her together on the Monday and he died on the Wednesday before. I went to Salford register office and they said 'we need the father here to register the birth.' It broke my heart. They told me they couldn't register the birth because we were not married.' A happy family: David Broome with Sarah Dixon and Shenayah before the tragic car crash . Sarah will now have to pay in the region of Â£4,000 to take the fight to court and to pay for DNA to be analysed by a court appointed testing service . David's family have asked for toenail clippings and tissue samples to be taken from the coroner in north Wales, where the accident happened, as evidence that 26-year-old David was the father. A petition signed by more than 1,500 people and a Facebook page Give Shenayah Broome Her Father's Name On Her Birth Certificate has now been launched. Sarah added: 'We were together for three years so it was like we were married. 'He was at the birth, he went to all the scans and we were together for three years. He even cut the cord following the birth. Sarah, 25, said it 'broke her heart' when she was told by Salford registery office that they would need the father present to register the birth . The loving father, from Salford, also leaves two sons Cayden, six, and Harley, five . 'I feel that this is punishing our baby.' David died following the crash which also left his 18-year-old nephew Norman Gregory with leg and chest injuries. The postman and DJ, from Irlams o' th' Height, Salford, also leaves two sons Cayden, six, and Harley, five. David, a former pupil at Buile Hill Visual Arts College, was a passenger in a Ford Ka driven by his nephew when it was in collision with a Skoda Octavia on the Nant Y Garth pass near Felinheli, in Gwynedd. His funeral was held at St Thomas' Church, Pendleton and Agecroft Cemetery last Monday. Sarah was told she needs a DNA test to register her deceased partner David on their daughter's birth certificate as they were unmarried . All births in England must be registered at the local registry office or hospital within 42 days of the child being born. Within married couples, just one parent is able to register the birth and include both mother's and father's details. But for unmarried couples, the law demands that mothers must provide proof of parentage unless both parents are present. This can be in the form of a signed declaration of parentage form, or a court document, such as an order giving the father parental responsibility, or court ordered DNA test. If these cannot be provided, the father's details won't be included on the birth certificate. It can be possible to add the father's details at a later date by completing an application for the re-registration of a child's birth. Where neither parents are able register the birth, a member of the administrative staff at the hospital where the child was born or someone present at the birth, are allowed to register on their behalf.","David Broome was killed in a car smash inÂ Gwynedd, Wales last month .

Taunton Crown Court, in Somerset, heard Onamade's deception began in 1991 when he acquired the birth certificate of the real David Onamade. It is not known how he came across the certificate, only that it was bought in Nigeria, it was said. Despite maintaining he was the 'real' man, Onamade was found guilty of five counts of fraud. The jury convicted him of three charges of fraudulently trying to claim benefits, and two of possessing documents - a birth certificate and a driving licence - for use in the fraud. Sentencing him to nine months behind bars, Judge Jeffrey Mercer said his status in the UK was 'uncertain'. He said: 'You have used copies of the birth certificate belonging to another person. 'Your future in this country has to be uncertain but that is not a matter for this court. Your status here is not part of my remit.' He was handed nine months behind bars for his crimes, but because he had served 13 on remand, was allowed to walk free from court. Taunton Crown Court, in Somerset, heard Onamade's deception began in 1991 when he acquired the birth certificate of the real David Onamade. During the deceit David Onamade, 52, was made chief executive of Somerset's Racial Equality Council, meeting MPs, chief constables and even meeting with the then Prime Minister . The severely autistic man lives in London where he is looked after by his mother. During the week-long trial, Helen Everett, the mother of Onamade's children, told the court the pair had met in a Bristol nightclub in the early 1990s. There he introduced himself as Steven Douglas. When he moved in with her in 1992 Helen found a birth certificate in a different name - David Onamade. She told the court he said this was his family name, which he never used because his father tried to control him and he wanted to live independently. The pair lived together in the West Country for 10 years before they split. In 2003 Onamade was made chief executive of Somerset Racial Equality Council. He held the privileged position until the group was disbanded in 2012. It was then that Onamade, from Wells, Somerset, attempted to claim Jobseeker's Allowance, sparking an investigation by authorities. After his arrest, on October 17 last year, Onamade told police his parents, both Nigerian, had given birth to him in London on December 12 1961. He said he grew up in Greenwich before moving to Nigeria with his parents between the ages of 3 and 8. He told the investigator: 'I am not very clear about dates - my memory is not the best.' He could not say where he went to school but said he had two degrees - a masters in literature and a second degree in creative writing - and that he trained to be a lawyer but did not complete his internship. When he returned to Britain with his parents they 'moved on' to the USA or Nigeria, but he said, he did not go with them and ran away from home. Around the age of 18 he began using the name Stephen Douglas. But the court heard Onamade firmly believed he was the real man, it was said, and refused to acknowledge anything different. 'I never thought it was anyone else, other than me. It's my birth certificate and my driving licence - I am David Onamade.' He denied withholding any information, as that could be checked. He also denied being given or buying an identity in Nigeria or England and that he had been living a lie. He told the court: 'It would be easier for me to put my hand up, but that would not be telling the truth.' The court heard other people in Nigeria are also believed to be using the identity, with one or two applying for passports. Patrick Mason, defending, said: 'There may be six David Onamades we know of. 'In many respects he's done nothing wrong. He absolutely, 100 per cent believed he was the person he said he was.'","David Onamade was chief executive of Somerset's Racial Equality Council .

"TV production companies will be offered tax breaks to make children's programmes in the UK under plans being studied by George Osborne. The Chancellor revealed he is looking 'very seriously' at the idea, which would aim to ensure a new generation of hit shows are British-made, to follow in the oddly-shaped footsteps of the Teletubbies and the Tweenies. There are fears that other countries are more attractive to make children's programming, seeing British talent move overseas. The industry argues that tax breaks are needed for children's TV to ensure a new generation of hit shows are British-made, to follow in the oddly-shaped footsteps of the Teletubbies . Mr Osborne used his 2012 Budget to announce a major boost for British drama, unveiling what was quickly dubbed a 'Downton Abbey tax break'. Homegrown TV productions were given discounts of between 20 and 25 per cent on their corporation tax bill, to encourage more high-end drama to be made in the UK. Now Mr Osborne has revealed he could extend it to children's TV as well. Speaking at the launch for the Creative Industries Federation, the chancellor said: 'I am looking very seriously to see if I can look to expand tax credits to children's television and also look at it for orchestras. 'It's not the pounds and pence you deliver. What you do is express who we are as a society, as a community and you give voice to the people within those communities . . . all of this is an expression of who we are as human beings,' he added, according to the FT. 'It is a human endeavour in its own right.' Chancellor George Osborne revealed he is looking 'very seriously' at offering tax credits to children's TV and orchestras . An announcement on new tax breaks for the arts could be announced next week in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement. It follows a campaign by Pact, the trade association for the UK's independent TV production companies, calling for tax credits offered to film, high-end television and animation to be given to children's TV. John McVay, Chief Executive at Pact, has said: 'Nowhere in the world does better kids' TV than the UK. Time and time again, British TV producers have created the most successful, innovative and creative programmes for children. 'From a commercial perspective, it is time that children's TV was recognised in the same echelon of television production as our finest drama.'","Chancellor is preparing to announce Â extra tax breaks in Autumn Statement .

"Savers could soon be able to switch current accounts within five days instead of seven. Last year ministers cut the time limit from 30 days to a week. More than 1.2million people, frustrated with rock-bottom interest rates, switched banks as a result. Now the Chancellor may reduce the time limit to five days in his Autumn Statement next Wednesday, according to Sky News. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured, is believed to be considering reducing the length of time it takes to swap a bank account from seven days to just five in a bid to encourage competition for savers . The Treasury could also extend its âswitching guaranteeâ to small businesses with a turnover of up to Â£6.5million. The guarantee is currently restricted to firms taking less than Â£2million. A lower time limit is aimed at increasing competition between banks and building societies, in the hope that they will increase interest rates to attract customers. Rates on instant-access current accounts have been at a record low since July, and show no signs of improving. The average is now just 0.42 per cent, below the Bank of Englandâs base rate of 0.5 per cent. One of the biggest beneficiaries of seven-day switching has been Nationwide. However, last night its chief executive Graham Beale said: âMy personal view is [reducing the time limit] will not make much difference. I donât think customers will be any more likely to switch if it takes five days than if it takes seven.â During the first three months of the year, 22,771 savers switched to Nationwide and 11,091 left, for a ânet gainâ of 11,680. Only Halifax and Santander did better, with Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Lloyds all haemorrhaging customers. The Treasury and the Payments Council, which oversees the switching guarantee service, declined to comment on claims that Mr Osborne would make five days the new limit. Graham Beale of Nationwide, pictured, said cutting two days off the time it takes to change bank accounts Â will not make any difference among savers. Last year the time was slashed from 30 days to seven . However, it is understood that the mooted changes have met with resistance from several banks, which say there is little evidence to suggest a lower limit would lead more customers to switch. Anna Bowes, of advice website Savings Champion, said the publicity surrounding the switching service âseems to have had a positive effect on the competition between key providersâ. However, she agreed that âreducing the time taken from seven to five days seems rather pointlessâ. The Financial Conduct Authority is already reviewing the current switching service, and will examine whether banks could let customers keep their account number when they move. It is expected to report back next year. Low interest rates for savers have been blamed on the Bank of Englandâs base rate â which has stood at 0.5 per cent for six years â and the Governmentâs Funding for Lending Scheme. Under FLS, the Government allowed banks and building societies to borrow Â£80billion at cheap rates if they helped homebuyers and businesses. Launched in 2012, the policy was designed to reinvigorate the economy after the financial crisis â but savings rates collapsed, as banks no longer needed new current account customers to fund loans.","Chancellor George Osborne is considering making the change next week .

"A man who collected almost every National Lottery scratchcard since they . first went on sale in 1994 could have missed out on millions of pounds as he refuses to scratch off the silver films to find out if he has won. Dave Mannix, 42, boasts the world's biggest scratchcard . collection, but thousands of his 100,000-strong hoard remain unscratched, much . to the annoyance of his partner Sue. Dave, who has spent Â£80,000 over the last 20 years on buying both used and unscratched cards, has left 10,000 with the silver film still intact - and almost all of them have now expired. Dave Mannix with some examples from his 100,000-strong collection of scratchcards . The hoarder has dedicated an entire room in his Cheshire . home to storing the cards. He said: 'Iâve got a designated room in my house where I . keep them all in boxes so I know exactly which ones are where'. Dave, whose severe arthritis prevents him from working, has an extensive collection which includes complete sets of special . edition cards from Indiana Jones to James Bond, Lord of the Rings and Star . Wars. But the collector now plans to call time on his hoarding and . is putting his cards up for sale for Â£500,000. Dave Mannix and his partner Sue with one of Dave's special edition Star Wars scratchcards . He said: 'I want to give someone else the chance to own this . unique gathering. 'Itâs taken half my life to build up and I want it to go to . a good home.' Dave, who has always been an avid collector, began the hobby . in the 1980s when he used to gather phone cards. But this particular collection was brought to an end with . the rise of mobile phones towards the end of the decade. His obsession turned to scratchcards when a friend gave him . a batch of 400 in 1994. Dave (right) has an extensive collection which is only missing one card - the 1994 Christmas special edition . He said: 'I was given around 400 from a close friend when . they were first released by the National Lottery in 1994. 'After that I went into a shop and I saw a container that . was bulging with used scratch cards so I asked the woman behind the counter if . I could have them. 'From there I asked a few different retailers if they could . keep the used cards for me and all of a sudden my collection became enormous. Dave bought around 90,000 of the cards in his collection after they had already been used. But there are also 10,000 fresh cards which remain unscratched, much to the frustration of Dave's partner Sue, as the six-month limit on the cards means they are now all out of date. Dave Mannix stands in front of his 100,000-strong collection of scratchcards, accumulated over 20 years . Despite his best efforts, the collection is incomplete, . as, he said, there is one card that has evaded him - he has been unable . to get hold of the first Christmas scratchcard from 1994. 'Apart from one I know of, Iâm pretty sure Iâve managed to . get hold of all of the cards ever made and Iâve spent around Â£80,000 in doing . so.' But Dave's partner Sue has had enough of his hobby, which has proved fruitless due to his refusal to tarnish the cards by scratching them. Dave Mannix and his partner Sue, who has put up with his collection taking over an entire room in their Cheshire home . He said: 'Every so often Sue looks at me angrily and asks me . when am I going to get rid of them but she knows Iâve had a lot of fun . collecting them. 'I still have just under 10,000 that have not been touched - . but sadly they wouldnât be valid anymore even if they were winners because . thereâs a six-month expiry date on them. 'Now I wonât be sitting on a pile of money.' Dave now plans to sell his collection intact, but hopes the . next owner will scratch the cards so he can find out how much he could have won . over the last 20 years. He said: 'Iâve been told it could be worth up to Â£5million, . but Iâm only asking for around Â£500,000.","Dave Mannix has 100,000-strong hoard of National Lottery scratchcards .

"It is set to be the first advert on the moon - and the first time a soft drink can has been abandoned on the lunar surface. The Japanese makers of the Pocari Sweat drink today announced plans to send a specially designed can made of titanium and engraved with messages to the lunar surface in 2015. The handwritten messages, gathered from Japanese children and internet users, will be stored as data in 120 titanium plates to be packaged in the lander, called a 'dream capsule'. Scroll down for video . The Japanese makers of the Pocari sweat drink plan to send a specially designed can made of titanium and engraved with messages to the lunar surface in 2015. The can will launch on a Falcon 9, designed to be a potentially reusable means of space travel by Elon Musk's SpaceX. After the Falcon 9 rocket has ignited its second-stage boosters and completed a four-and-a-half day journey to the moon, the Pocari Sweat-branded canister will be deposited on the surface by private company Astrobotic Technology's 'Griffin' lander. The firm is developing the lander (above) to try and win Google's $20-million prize for the first company to land a device on the moon that can both travel 500 meters on the surface and transmit high-definition pictures back to Earth. Otsuka Pharmaceutical said the capsule will launch from Florida in October 2015. 'Until now, the space travel was only possible at a national project level,' the firm said. 'Now, we want to realize it privately and get to the moon.' The capsule to be delivered to the moon is made out of titanium, shaped like a Pocari sweat can, and weighs 1,000g. To continuously endure the harsh environment of the moon where the temperature shifts from minus 170â at night to 110â during the day, the capsule was developed specifically for this project. The capsule will be conveyed to the moon by the Falcon 9 rocket during a four and a half day journey. How it works: Messages will be included alongside a powdered form of the drink . The Falcon 9, designed to be a potentially reusable means of space travel by Elon Musk's SpaceX, has already made three successful supply runs to the International Space Station. However, the planned mission in October 2015 would be the first time one of its rockets has successfully provided propulsion to the moon. After the Falcon 9 rocket has ignited its second-stage boosters and completed a four-and-a-half day journey to the moon, the Pocari Sweat-branded canister will be deposited on the surface by private company Astrobotic Technology's 'Griffin' lander. The Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket lifts off from space launch complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, America. The Falcon 9, designed to be a potentially reusable means of space travel by Elon Musk's SpaceX, has already made three successful supply runs to the International Space Station and will be used as part of the new project. The company hopes the missiopn could help it win Google's Lunar X prize, a $20-million bounty for the first company to land a device on the moon that can both travel 500 meters on the surface and transmit high-definition pictures back to Earth. Astrobotic's deal with Otsuka will provide them with funds to achieve this goal â the company reportedly charges upwards of half a million dollars for lunar delivery.","Project set to launch in October 2015 .

"The lead singer of a popular Argentinian rock band has died after getting a massive electric shock as he opened his set to promote the band's first album. Faulty wiring on his microphone led to Agustin Briolini, from Krebs, getting an electrical shock to the head as he performed at the Theatre of the Sun, in the city of Villa Carlos Paz. Briolini was moving towards theÂ microphoneÂ during the band's opening song, when the accident happened. Agustin Briolini, the lead singer of a popular Argentinian rock band has died after getting a massive electric shock as he opened his set to promote the band's first album . Medics rushed to the 21-year-old's aid, but after spending an hour trying to revive him, the singer was taken to hospital where doctors pronounced him dead. Briolini's bandmates, drummer Diego Regali, 21, and guitarist Gustavo Escober, 22, said they could not believe it when they saw the singer collapse on stage, let alone when they were later told he had died. Pico Moyano, the lead singer of Iceberg, who also performed on the night, said he was shocked that an accident like this could still occur. He said 'It really defies belief. We are in the 21st century and these sort of things should simply not happen, I find it absolutely incredible.' Mr Mayano said Krebs had been 'rising fast' and had developed a huge following locally, 'they were doing some great work'.

He said: 'For us, making music is a cyclical process. The music we make we give to people who get energy as a result, they accept that energy and they transform it, and what they create to be sent back to us, we in turn except and throw it back again with even more power in our music.

"With their own fashion empire, a combined wealth of Â£130million and a starring role in Prince William and Kateâs love story, John and Belle Robinson seemed to have assembled the perfect life. But the founders of the Jigsaw clothing chain have decided that their marriage is no longer the perfect fit â and are set to divorce today. More than 20 years after their relationship began, Mrs Robinson, 50, and her 67-year-old husband will formalise their separation with a âquickieâ divorce hearing at Londonâs High Court. Scroll down for video . Jigsaw founders: John and Belle Robinson, who have a combined wealth of Â£130million, are set to divorce . The Robinsons are close friends with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and hired Kate (pictured wearing a Jigsaw cardigan) in 2006 at their head office when she first moved to London after graduating from university . The pair count the Middleton family among their close friends, and their instrumental role in the royal courtship began when they hired Kate to work at their head office in 2006 when she first came to London after graduating from university. They regularly gave their glamorous young employee the use of their luxurious villa on Mustique in the Caribbean for private romantic holidays with the prince. Today, District Judge Aitken is expected to accept that their marriage has irretrievably broken down and grant the couple a decree nisi at the Royal Courts of Justice. The couple will then have to wait for a decree absolute, which is usually issued six weeks and a day later, ending their marriage. Neither Mr nor Mrs Robinson or their legal representatives are expected to attend the hearing. Mrs Robinson is understood to have spent much of her time recently at the pairâs sumptuous flat â believed to be worth around Â£3million â in the heart of Chelsea. Mr Robinson is understood to have been based at their Â£5million manor house in Chippenham, Wiltshire. The coupleâs wealth has been estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List at Â£130million. The Robinsons were instrumental inÂ the royal courtship and subsequent wedding after regularly giving Kate the use of their luxurious villa on Mustique in the Caribbean for private romantic holidays with Prince William . When she revealed a year ago that they were separated, mother-of-five Mrs Robinson said: âIâm absolutely devastated. âItâs not something I wanted, but we seem to have drifted apart. We actually split up five months ago, but weâve managed to carry on keeping up appearances and keeping it fairly quiet. âMy life is changing and Iâm having a rethink. Those golden days when Kate [Middleton] came over and I fixed her up with a job seem a long way off. Iâm still trying to fathom out what went wrong with me and John.â Mrs Robinson was previously married to an army officer and was a struggling single mother of two when she met Mr Robinson. By 1993, she was pregnant with the first of their three children together, although they did not marry until 2004. The Robinsons have founded a total of 60 Jigsaw stores in Britain, as well as others in the U.S. and Australia . Together, they built Jigsaw into a thriving success story, with 60 shops in Britain and others in America and Australia. They soon had the money to buy their luxury holiday home, Villa Hibiscus, on Mustique. When the pair separated, Mrs Robinson said: âI want to be able to stay friends and have a drink with him one day. âI suppose John and I will divorce eventually, but I will always love him. After three children together and the life weâve shared, nothing will change that.â Last night neither Mr nor Mrs Robinson was available for comment.","Jigsaw founders John and Belle Robinson have combined wealth of Â£130m .

"Best-selling Scottish author Ian Rankin has lashed out at Edinburgh Airport security after he was caught in a lengthy queue with other angry travellers. The 54-year-old Inspector Rebus author vented his frustration on Twitter, where he complained about the airportâs âoverrunâ system while he was delayed today. In a tweet sent to the airport and his 80,000 followers, he wrote: âHey, @EDI_Airport, one x-Ray machine in use at 7.30am? Having to lock passengers out because you're overrun? Embarrassing.â Scottish crime author Ian Rankin became upset while he was stuck in a queue at Edinburgh Airport . Mr Rankin called the situation 'embarrassing' as he wrote to his 80,000 Twitter followers . Edinburgh Airport is currently trialling a new Â£25m security hall alongside its existing one. This involves an âairlock systemâ which allows some passengers through the new lounge, then closes the doors to allow other passengers through the old lounge. Around 30 minutes after Mr Rankin published his angry tweet, the airport responded and denied his claim, saying: âWe're currently testing our new security hall and running 2 halls. We have an airlock process so we can do that safely.â It added: âWe're not locking anyone out. Sorry your experience wasn't what you're used to. We'll be fully operational in the new hall soon.â A photo taken by a frustrated traveller shows a lengthy queue at Edinburgh Airport .

"Jeremy Hunt has admitted taking his children to A&E over a weekend because he didnât want to wait for a GP appointment. The Health Secretary revealed he had ignored his own departmentâs advice that casualty should be used for urgent or life-threatening cases. He tried to explain why he had not heeded NHS guidance, saying that it is not always clear when emergency care is necessary. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted going to A&E instead of his local GP surgery. He is pictured  with his wife Lucia Guo and two of their children . But Labourâs health spokesman Andy Burnham accused him of being âirresponsibleâ by suggesting it was acceptable to use A&E as a way to bypass busy surgeries. Mr Hunt was responding to a point raised in the Commons yesterday by Tory MP Lorraine Fullbrook that pressure in A&E units could be alleviated by GPs opening for longer hours. He said: âI do agree with you. Iâve taken my own children to an A&E department at the weekend precisely because I didnât want to wait until later on to take them to see a GP. I think we have to recognise that society is changing and people donât always know whether the care that they need is urgent or whether it is an emergency, and making GPs available at weekends will relieve a lot of pressure in A&E departments.â He did not say which of his three children he had taken â Jack, four, Anna, two, or Eleanor, who is just four months â when they went, or why. But in an angry exchange with Andy Burnham on Twitter later he added: âIf parents have an unwell child needing medical attention, A&E provides a trusted service.â Professor Bruce Keogh who has urged the public to go to pharmacies if they are unwell rather than A&E or their GP surgeries . Mr Burnham replied: âIf all âunwellâ people went to A&E, NHS would collapse. Surprised you continue to contradict official advice. Irresponsible.â He subsequently wrote a letter to the Health Secretary which said: âYour statement in the House implies that it is acceptable for the public to use A&E on an on-demand basis or as a substitute for GP services.â The Prime Ministerâs official spokesman later said: âIâm not sure the Secretary of State for Health was giving advice. He was describing a challenge which I think many people up and down the country will recognise in terms of access to GPs. 'Itâs perfectly understandable, particularly those with young children, will want to see a doctor as quickly as possible.â Earlier this month the NHSâs medical director Professor Bruce Keogh urged the public to stay away from A&E over concerns that many units are overcrowded. The numbers arriving in casualty have soared by 50 per cent in a decade â which has partly been blamed on patients being unable to see a GP. Meanwhile a damning report by the Care Quality Commission has warned that patients at Medway A&E unit in Gillingham, Kent are routinely having to wait more than 12 hours. The report described the unit as âchaoticâ and âunsafeâ and warned that it could be downgraded or closed if urgent changes are not made. Medway is one of 11 NHS trusts to have been placed in special measures last year but unlike the others it has failed to make progress to improve care. And in a separate intervention, one of the countryâs most senior doctors said that queues in A&E and GP surgeries will only grow unless the Government invests more in the NHS.

"Sony has been accused of demeaning women and pandering to the sleaziest urges of teenage boys with a new advert comparing playing video games to masturbation. The online clip, reportedly published to Sony Europe's YouTube channel on Friday, features an attractive woman dressed as a doctor who gives an entire monologue of double entendres. 'I know you've already done it today, and I bet you really enjoyed yourself,' says the woman, who for the purposes of this promotional fantasy is identified as Dr Grace Powels. 'I know you've already done it today': This is the face of the 'doctor' in the suggestive new PlayStation 4 advert than was apparently published on Sony's YouTube channel then set to private as a backlash grew . She pulls off her spectacles, pouts, leans into the camera and breathes: 'How many times did you do it yesterday? Are you afraid you're doing it too often? 'In the bedroom under your blankets? Or perhaps you prefer the kitchen or in the toilet? Or do you like it out in the garden?' she continues, climbing onto her desk as close-up shots focus on her full lips. 'You no longer have to feel ashamed. Everybody's doing it, because it's fantastic. And now you can keep going all day long. Don't you like that? You don't even need to stop. And if you want to, you could even join me.' At the point the punchline is revealed. 'Dr Powels' wasn't being sexually suggestive, she was merely talking about a new remote control feature for her PS Vita hand-held games console. Reg Bailey, Chief Executive of Mothersâ Union and author of the government review on Letting Children be Children said: 'Itâs a sad poor use of advertising using the innuendo and sex sells type of argument; the advertising industry is capable of doing much better. 'Really good advertising recognises that the way individuals are portrayed in any public space influences the way we behave in our private lives, and therefore that advertising takes a responsible role in protecting the dignity of all people and ensuring that all are treated with equal respect. 'Mothersâ Union believes that it is not right to sexually objectify a person or base their value solely on their sexual identity at any age.' 'Problematic': Commentators have said the advert plays into old-fashioned ideas about video gamers . The Verge's Kwame Opam called the themes exploited by the advert 'problematic'. 'Our sexy doctor is pretty clearly designed to entice the straight teen male demographic gaming companies have been pandering to for decades,' he wrote. 'The innuendo makes that clear, even if Sony subverts it. That's alienating enough, since gaming has struggled so long for inclusivity. 'And even if the doctor merrily joins in on the fun (gaming, that is), it's after the fact â she's a sexy lady first and a gamer second, never fully eroding what the target always is.' Rob Beschizza wrote on BoingBoing that Sony's Playstation advertising had gone from 'clever and weird' to making him 'think of a ship burning faster than it can sink.' MailOnline contacted Sony Computer Entertainment UK for comment, but had received no response by the time of publication.","Online clip reportedly appeared briefly on Sony Europe's YouTube channel .

"Hundreds of mourners have gathered to pay tribute to two girls who were among five teenagers killed in a car crash earlier this month. Megan Storey and Jordanna Goodwin, both 16, died alongside Blake Cairns, 16, Arpad Kore, 18, and Bartosz Bortniczak, 18, in a two-car accident at Conisbrough, south Yorkshire. The girls' pink coffins were taken to the Salvation Army's Lakeside Community Church in Doncaster today by two horse-drawn hearses. Family and friends gathered to mourn Megan Storey and Jordanna Goodwin at the Salvation Army Hall in Doncaster today following their deaths in a car crash earlier this month . The two girls, who were both 16, were among five killed in a two-car crashÂ Conisbrough, south Yorkshire . The service included a poem read by friends of Jordanna (left) and Megan (right), whose headteacher described them both as 'bubbly and beautiful' The black horses each sported pink feathers and many of the scores of youngsters who packed into the building were wearing pink and carrying pink flowers. Fuschia flowers spelling 'Princess' and 'Sister', and respectively 'Jordy' and 'Megz' adorned the intricate black carriages. A final goodbye from Jordanna's mother Vicki McCarthy, read by friend Vicki Swiffen, said: 'Jordy has always made me so proud to be her mother. 'We've always had a loyal, close relationship. Her smile was captivating and lit up any room she went into, even though she only had one dimple. 'I have not only lost Jordy but I have lost my adopted daughter Megz, too. Jordy, you are loved by so many people and I am overwhelmed and so proud to call you my daughter. 'You are my best friend, my rock, my left arm, my daughter. I promise I will make you proud. 'I will dream of you with every dream I have. You always loved your sleep, so sleep tight. I love you so much.'

Sleep tight - I love you' Megan's father Gary Storey remained composed as he read out his moving tribute and shared his memories of the pretty teenager. Mr Storey said: 'I never thought I would be here doing this. Megan, my baby, my angel. I will never forget the time you first sat on my lap. 'I will never forget the first time you told me you supported Sheffield Wednesday, and the first time we went to a match together. 'Arriving at Hillsborough you told my the hairs on the back of your neck were stood up, and it made me so proud. 'I will share all of the memories like this. You will forever be in my thoughts until the day we meet again. Sleep tight - I love you.'

Megan Storey's parents (left) and peers of the youngsters (right) are comforted ahead of the service . Around 500 mourners attended the event, after an accident the school said has left the community in shock . Megan's sister Becky also shared her memories of growing up with younger sister, saying: 'You were always borrowing my clothes. You drove me crazy. 'You couldn't wait for me to go to university so you could take my bedroom. Then ironically days after I left, you were ringing me up because you missed me.' Around 450 people are thought to have attended the ceremony which includingÂ a video made by the girls and some of their favourite music, including All of Me by John Legend and I Wanna Grow Old by DJ Cammy. Their headteacher Rebecca Staples has said of the girls: 'Jordanna Goodwin never missed a single day of school from primary to the end of Year 11 and had received a special reward from the local authority. 'She was a joyful, bubbly girl who had a fantastic rapport with staff. She was our prom queen this year, and looked so beautiful on the evening. 'Megan Storey was a really bubbly young woman.She was totally reliable for all her friends and truly loyal. 'She was a very caring, mature young woman who was a joy to be with. She too looked stunning at our prom.' Family and friends gathered to pay tribute to the two girls at an emotional service in Doncaster today . A police officer struggled to hold back the tears as the young girls' coffins were taken to the service . Jordanna and Megan were sixth-formers at Danum Academy in Doncaster, as were two of the other teenagers who died - Arpad and Blake. Warehouse worker Bartosz, whose funeral took place yesterday, was a former pupil. Students have laid scores of tributes to their friends outside the school's sixth-form common room and at the spot where the crash happened, on the A630 Doncaster to Rotherham road, about five miles from their school. South Yorkshire Police believe a third car - a black Vauxhall Corsa - may also have been involved in the latest incident. A 21-year-old Doncaster man, who was driving the Corsa, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and later released on bail while police continue their investigation. The funerals of Blake and Arpad will take place later this week. Blake Cairns, 16 (left) and and Arpad Kore, 18, were also in the blue Toyota Corolla and died in the crash .

"They are the bane of many office worker - colleagues who come in coughing and spluttering when they should really be in bed. Now, a leading microbiologist has spoken out against the 'stiff upper lip brigade' - instructing them to stay at home - even when illness is in the early stages. Dr Charles Gerba, a leading microbiologist, has warned that coming into work even at the start of feeling ill can wreak havoc around the office. Staff at Cardiff council have been sacked for taking too many sick days, as the average rose to 10 a year . If you are even starting to feel symptoms, this is when you're most likely to be contagious, he says. And other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more . ill. 'We see a lot of worsening symptoms because people will just . not stop and rest,' said Catherine . Cummins, a health sciences assistant clinical professor at the . University of California-Irvine School of Medicine. She told WedMD: 'They want to go; they want to be able to do . everything they normally do. If you are healthy but others around you at work are sick, there are some measures you can take to protect yourself. Dr Gerba suggests frequent hand washing, for 15 to 20 seconds each time, and then drying them with a clean paper towel. This alone can reduce the spread of germs by nearly 80 per cent. If there is no water around, use instant hand sanitiser if available. Disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces have also been shown to reduce viruses by up to 62 per cent. The Arizona scientists found that using . tissues to wipe the face, hand sanitiserÂ  and washing hands before lunch and after a big meeting . resulted in an 80 per cent reduction across the board, for all three . viruses, in their risk of infection. 'What they don't . understand is that they're pushing themselves to the point where they're . actually a lot sicker at the end of two to four days than they would . have been if they had just taken that first day off and let their body . fight the infection.' And while taking cold and flu remedies can help ease symptoms, they can affect work quality by causing drowsiness. 'This . is when you just get a fever and are starting to feel under the . weather. And if you go to work in this state, any medication you take . will interfere in how well you do your job,' added Cummins. Earlier this year, scientists at the University of Arizona found it really is better to stay at home, such is the speed that germs . spread around an office. They discovered when even one person comes to work sick, more than half . of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected . with the virus by lunchtime. When someone comes to work sick, about . half of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected . with the virus by lunchtime. Some of the likeliest germ hotpots . include telephones, desktops, tabletops, doorknobs, photocopier and lift . buttons and the office fridge. However . the study also revealed that simple interventions, such as hand washing . and the use of hand sanitiser or wipes, can drastically reduce . employees' risk of infection. Conducted . in an office, the study included about 80 participants, some of whom . received droplets on their hands at the start of a normal work day. While . most of those droplets were plain water, one person unknowingly . received a droplet containing artificial viruses mimicking the cold, the . flu and a stomach bug. Other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more ill - and it's better to take a day off at the start of an illness . Employees were instructed to go about . their day as usual. After about four hours, researchers sampled commonly . touched surfaces in the office, as well as employees' hands, and found . that more than 50 per cent of surfaces and employees were infected with . at least one of the viruses. 'We were actually quite surprised by . how effectively everything spread,' said Kelly Reynolds, UA associate . professor of public health at the university. 'I didn't expect to find . it as much as I did.' And that was in an office environment where people work primarily in isolated spaces, she added. Touching . surfaces - rather than coughing and sneezing over people - is how most . germs in an office are spread, say the researchers. These viruses can last . anywhere from a few hours to up to a month. Researchers . swabbed surfaces and hands again at the end of the work day. By then, . the cold and flu viruses, known for their short survival time, had . dissipated, but the stomach virus had continued to spread, infecting up . to 70 per cent of surfaces tested. 'We really felt that the hand . was quicker than the sneeze in the spread of disease,' said Charles . Gerba, co-principal investigator on the study. Most people think . it's coughing and sneezing that spreads germs, but the number of . objects you touch is incredible, especially in this push-button . generation. We push more buttons than any other generation in history. The key message is to stay at home when you're sick.' The same . study then was repeated with a 'Healthy Workplace Intervention' in . place. Employees were provided free tissues, disinfecting wipes and a . bottle of hand sanitizer and were instructed to wash their hands before . eating lunch and after meeting with a large number of people. With those simple interventions in place, risk of infection dropped below 10 per cent.","Dr Charles Gerba says we are most contagious in early stages of illness .

"A set of Lego instructions dating back to 1974 has emerged online which gently urged parents not to slap gender stereotypes onto their children. The pamphlet, which was posted toÂ RedditÂ on Saturday and won widespread praise, reads: 'To parents... A lot of boys like dolls houses. They're more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They're more exciting than dolls houses.' It concludes: 'The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.' Winning praise: A photo of a set of Lego instructions dating back to 1974 was posted to Reddit which gently urged parents not to slap gender stereotypes onto their children . The uplifting instructions were posted by Reddit user Fryd_, who claims it was found it at his or her partner's grandmother's house. Initially, the photo aroused suspicions that it was fake, but Lego has since confirmed its authenticity. In a statement made to io9, a company representative said: 'The text is from 1974 and was a part of a pamphlet showing a variety of LEGO doll house products targeted girls aged 4 and up from the 1970âs. 'The text remains relevant to this day â our focus has always been, and remains to bring creative play experiences to all children in the world.' Despite a great deal of approval for the 1974 instructions, however, many commentators argue that these gender-neutral ideals are no longer a part of the brand's DNA. Popular angle: A Lego advert from the early 80s for 'Universal Building Sets' also positions itself as a brand for girls and boys alike . 'It's too bad Lego products are now packaged and marketed to specific gender roles,' one Twitter user wrote in response to a photo of the pamphlet. 'They seem to have lost their way over the last 15 years,' echoed another. Indeed, the Danish-founded company, which was launched in 1932, has landed itself in hot water a number of times in the past few years over issues of gender equality. In 2011, it debuted its very pink-dominated Lego Friends range, aimed at girls, which came with ads including such strap-lines as, 'Cupcakes are ready!' and 'Time to chill with the girls at the beauty shop!' Times have changed: Lego sparked much criticism when it launched its girl-targeted Lego Friends collection in 2011 for its patronizing gender stereotyping . Turn-around: The company then released its 'Research Institute' collection in August (pictured), featuring a female chemist, paleontologist and astronomer, which sold out in a matter of days . Earlier this year, a seven-year-old American girl called Charlotte Benjamin wrote a letter to Lego which promptly went viral. In it, Charlotte complains of the few 'girl' Lego characters, writing: 'All the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs. She added: 'But the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people... even swam with sharks.' Following an apology from Lego, the company released its 'Research Institute' collection in August, featuring a female chemist, paleontologist and astronomer. None of the characters, it should be noted, wore pink; and the $19.99 set sold out in a matter of days.",Many commentators have pointed out that Lego products today are packaged and marketed to specific gender roles .

"A Morrisons employee has been arrested after the bank details of about 100,000 members of staff were stolen and published online. The man was arrested in Leeds - close to the supermarket's headquarters in Bradford - earlier this morning following the theft of payroll information from a central database. West Yorkshire Police confirmed that a man had been arrested on suspicion of making or supplying an article for use in fraud and said he remains in custody. Leak: The man was arrested in Leeds - close to the supermarket's headquarters in Bradford - earlier this morning following the theft of payroll information from a central database . Detective Chief Inspector Gary Hooks of West Yorkshire Police said: 'An employee of Morrisons has been arrested in Leeds this morning in connection with an investigation into the theft of data from the company.' The theft was seen as a fresh blow to Morrisons, especially as it came just one day after Britainâs fourth biggest supermarket tumbled to a Â£176million annual loss and issued a profits warning. The warning sent shares down by 12 per cent and saw the supermarket pledge to cut prices to compete with Aldi and Lidl. The company said the data theft affected staff from all levels of the organisation including the board, but would not comment on whether chief executive Dalton Philips was among them. Probe: Chief executive Dalton Philips is heading the company's investigation into the hack . The supermarket said it became aware . of the data theft last Thursday, hours after it announced financial . results to the City and that Mr Philips was leading the response. It . wrote to all employees with an email address to inform them of the data . theft, while managers were also informing workers at its sites. Morrisons . did not say how many of its 130,000 employees were affected, although . initial reports suggested it could be as many as 100,000. The . leak was revealed by the Telegraph and Argus, a local newspaper based . in Morrisons' home town of Bradford, after 'a concerned Morrisons . shopper' sent the data to it. It is not known for how long the information was available. Morrisons . said: 'We can confirm there has been no loss of customer data and no . colleague will be left financially disadvantaged.' It added that it was urgently reviewing internal data security measures, with an . investigation into the incident to be led by Mr Phillips. Employees took to social media to vent their anger at the company after the publication was revealed. Many criticised the company for announcing the news on Facebook before all staff had been personally informed. One wrote: 'A hack? So why weren't these details encrypted and what not?'

"Unhappy customer: Lorraine Fisher and Creme de la Mer's Lifting Contour Serum . Theyâre the promise of âyouth in a bottleâ that no woman should be without. Over the past year, you havenât been able to open a magazine or pass a beauty counter without seeing adverts for facial serums. Almost every cosmetics brand is doing them, from Boots No 7 to Clarins and Guerlain. These light, fast-absorbing creams are designed to be used as an alternative, or addition, to our usual skincare regimes. The theory is that because the molecules in their formulas are so much smaller than those in a moisturiser, they penetrate deeply into the skin. And they contain more active ingredients, vitamins and minerals than a normal face cream to help target problems such as fine lines, brown spots or oiliness. Itâs because they use more expensive ingredients that serums cost a lot (you wonât get much change out of Â£20 for the cheapest). But do they work or are they just another cosmetic company plot to part us from our hard-earned cash? I decided to try one to find out. I chose the latest on the market: luxury brand Creme de la Merâs Lifting Contour Serum. At Â£230 for a 30ml bottle, itâs one of the most expensive. Itâs claimed to be âa high-performance sculpting serum for the face and neckâ that âgives skin a tighter feeling from the first touch and helps define and reshape the look of contours, significantly transforming skinâs appearanceâ. The active ingredients include perennial brown algae, which has been dubbed âthe fountain of youthâ, and marine peptides (or proteins) to âenhance the look of skinâs density andÂ dimensionâ. To help ascertain whether itâs working during the recommended two months I sample it, I enlist London skin expert Lesley Reynolds to scan my face every fortnight using a Visia machine. Before we start, the machine shows that for my age (Iâm 44), I have incredibly few wrinkles. The machine works by comparing you to 100 women of your age group. For wrinkles, Iâm in the best 1 per cent. I also do well in the pore test â mine are quite small, which means my skin looks better. But the machine says my face is a bit too red. Itâs no surprise: Iâve always flushed easily and had pink cheeks, though Iâve thought of myself as having an English rose complexion. Worst, though, is the sun damage â Iâm in the bottom 11 per cent. While I put that down to having spent the past eight months travelling around the world in temperatures of over 100 degrees, Lesley isnât convinced. She says my type of skin, so pale I could be Scottish or Irish, is more prone to sun damage than darker shades. Lorraine Fisher says: 'So it seems that Creme de la Mer was right. The Lifting Contour Serum could 'significantly transform' skin's appearance: except in my experience, it made it worse . So, even though I never sunbathe, enough has filtered through over the years to give me UV damage. It means that while my skin may be in good condition now, age may creep up quickly. That night, I put on the Lifting Contour Serum for the first time, massaging in an upward motion as detailed in the instructions. I also press four acupressure points (on my forehead, between my eyes, under my nose and on my chin) for three seconds each, as the instructions tell you to. This is supposed to help stimulate blood flow and improve the serumâs effectiveness. A few minutes after I put it on, my face begins to tingle. Not unpleasantly, just a bit tickly. Iâm pleased â it means the serum is actually doing something, though a quick check in the mirror doesnât reveal a 25-year-old staring back at me. By day five, I am seeing results â just not the positive ones I expected. My face hasnât tingled since that first night, but my chin is dry and flakey. The next day, my nose and cheeks start peeling and my whole face is red and patchy. That night, I slather on thick, unctuous Nivea â my go-to product when my skinâs a bit unhappy. After a fortnight, I return to see Lesley. The results are worrying. Iâm now in the top 14 per cent of British women for wrinkles â down from the top 1 per cent. Iâm horrified: the last thing I want is for this serum to damage my skin and make me look older. 'Iâm horrified: the last thing I want is for this serum to damage my skin and make me look older.' âDonât worry, this sometimes happens,â she reassures me. âThings get worse before they get better.âBut while they might get worse, they certainly donât get better. A couple of days later my skin feels so waxy in places and dry in others it no longer feels like mine. By day 17, the fine lines around my mouth are no longer fine.Â  Thereâs no good news from Lesley at the halfway point nor after six weeks. I must admit that at this point Iâm so furious at the thought I might be damaging my skin I want to stop the experiment. I canât wait to throw away the trendy green and silver bottle with its tiny writing that can be seen only by those young enough not to need Lifting Contour Serum. But I carry on: maybe it does take eight weeks toÂ work. I canât describe my relief as the trial comes to an end and I visit Lesley in her Harley Street clinic for the last time. The Visia machine has some horrifying results for me. The only real improvement has been the sun damage (I moved from the bottom 11 per cent of British women up to 29 per cent). âThis could be due to the fact thereâs not much sun around,â says Lesley. âAnd the serum may have helped.â My wrinkles arenât as good as they were eight weeks before: Iâm in the top 3 per cent, down from 1Â per cent. Lorraine Fisher (pictured) tried the Creme de la Mer serum for the recommended two months and enlisted the help of London skin expert Lesley Reynolds who scanned Lorraine's face every fortnight using a Visia machine . And heaven knows what this serum has done to my pores because theyâve got much, much worse. I was in the top 22 per cent when I started this experiment; Iâm now in the bottom 39pc. But itâs the redness thatâs the real problem. The day before my last Visia session, I was at a friendâs when I noticed my entire face was bright red. Not gently flushed, but pillar-box red. âThe redness in your skin is much worse and due to a flare-up of rosacea,â says Lesley. âSo the serum would probably not be something that I would recommend to sensitive skin types.â Not much is known about rosacea except that itâs incurable, though pretty harmless. But it is embarrassing â believe me, itâs not very nice walking around with a bright red face. You feel as if everyoneâs staring at you. Lesley believes Iâve had rosacea mildly for a while, but something in the serum caused it to flare-up â we donât know what. She recommends a treatment called photodynamic therapy â usually used on skin cancer sufferers â which uses laser light to help reduce the redness. I leave her office at my witsâ end. This serum was meant to help my skin, not hurt it. A few weeks later, my skin is still much redder than it used to be. Not all the time â it comes and goes. I have to work out what triggers it â usually such things as heat, cold or alcohol are to blame â and try to avoid them. In the meantime, I use thick foundation every day to try to cover it up, something Iâve never had to do before. So it seems that Creme de la Mer was right. The Lifting Contour Serum could âsignificantly transformâ skinâs appearance: except in my experience, it made it worse. And to think that they charge Â£230 for it.","Luxury brand Creme de la Merâs Lifting Contour Serum is Â£230 for 30ml .

"It may look like the control panel from a sci-fi spaceship, but this plethora of buttons and futuristic steering wheel is the cockpit of the Bloodhound supersonic car. This is the view that driver Andy Green will see when he aims to become the first person in history to hit 1,000mphÂ (1,609kph) on land.

This is the view that driver Andy Green will see when he aims to become the first person in history to hit 1,000mph (1,609kph) on land. Click and drag to take a tour of Bloodhound SSC's cockpit . The SSC stands for âSuperSonic Carâ because the Bloodhound will be going faster than the speed of sound. The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both a jet and rocket. It is designed to go over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour. The slender body, 44 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic. It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower. Thatâs more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together. In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a newÂ  land speed record. The current land speed record stands at 763.035 miles (1,227.985 kilometres) per hour, set by former RAF pilot Andy Green (who will also drive the Bloodhound) back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. The Bloodhound will beat this record by some distance if it is successful. The complex cockpit has been tailored to the needs of Wing Commander Green - an RAF fighter pilot - who will make his bid to smash the world record next year. It has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave and two different resins. It has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total. Sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core, which provide additional strength. At its thickest point the hi-tech material is made up of 13 layers but measures just 24mm thick. The structure weighs 441lbs (200kg) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet, rocket and racing car engine. It has to be so strong as this front . section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes . per square metre at 1,000mph (1,609kph) as well the considerable forces . generated by the front wheels and suspension. The 51-year-old RAF pilot hopes to break the world land speed record  - and with it the sound barrier - with the Â£10 million rocket-powered car. A model is pictured . It will also carry ballistic armour to protect Wing Commander Green should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds. The roof of the cockpit has been designed to create a series of shockwaves that will channel the air into the Eurojet EJ200 jet engine. The pencil-shaped car is 44ft (14 metres) long, 6.2 feet (1.9 metres) wide and weighs 14,158lbs (6,422kg) when fully fuelled. In its ultimate form, it is expected to generate the combined output of 95 Formula One cars. âCarbon fibre is an extraordinary material,â said Wing Commander Green. âIt is the same high-tech material from which we make jet fighters, F1 cars and in this particular case, the strongest safety cell in the history of motorsport. âIt is a fantastic piece of technology and it needs to be phenomenally strong to take the load and thrust from 210 kilonewtons and 130,000 horsepower of engine thrust from the back of the car and to take the aerodynamic load of up to 12 tonnes per metre.â The complex cockpit (pictured) has been tailored to the needs of Wing Commander Green, an RAF fighter pilot, who will make his bid to smash the world record next year . The car will also use a highly specialised windscreen, which has been custom-made from acrylic. The plastic is heated, stretched and then two layers are bonded together to create a 25mm section - thicker than a fighter jetâs windscreen and sufficient to withstand an impact from a 2.2lbs (1kg) bird at 900mph (1,448kph). âI am actually looking through two inches (5cm) of plastic which needs to be optimally perfect so I can see what I am doing,â he said. âThat kind of plastic is that thick and strong to survive a 1,000mph airflow and also, worst case, to take a bird strike from a big bird, maybe 4.4lbs (2kg) at 650mph (1,046kph) or half that weight approaching 1,000mph (1,609kph).â The cockpit is positioned in front of three incredibly loud motors - the jet, a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocketâs oxidiser pump, which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast. Wing Commander Green (pictured left) will wear a . specially made in-ear communications system to protect his hearing and . to ensure that he can communicate with mission control during his blisteringly fast drive (illustrated right) The structure (pictured) weighs 441lbs (200kg) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet, rocket and racing car engine . Wing Commander Green will wear a specially made in-ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control. He has drawn on his experience of flying fast jets and driving world land speed record winners Thrust SSC and JCB Dieselmax to design the dashboard and cockpit layout. He will climb into the Bloodhound via a carbon fibre hatch, eight inches (50cm) in diameter, just below the jet air intake. During a 1,000mph (1,609kph) run, Bloodhound will cover 12 miles (19km) in two minutes, exerting an acceleration force of almost 2G and peak deceleration force of 3G on its driver. This long-duration G force is another experience unique to Bloodhound. Formula One drivers may experience higher G forces, but they only do so for a few seconds at a time. Wing Commander Green said: âAll of this technology will give me the most extraordinary working environment with which to get Bloodhound up to 1,000mph and also the highest level of protection we can possibly get. Itâs a brilliant piece of engineering.â The Bristol-based Bloodhound team will be attempting to break the 1,000mph (1,609kph) barrier on a purpose-built 12-mile track in the South African desert in 2015 and 2016. The Bristol-based Bloodhound team will be attempting to break the 1,000mph (1,609kph) barrier on a purpose-built 12-mile track in the South African desert in 2015 and 2016. An illustration of the attempt is pictured . The team behind the Bloodhound SSC have revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour to zero. The engineers based in Bristol have been trying to find brakes that can withstand the huge temperatures and stresses of the vehicle - and they might now have the answer. After the car reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes will slow it to 160 miles (260 kilometres) per hour. Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60 miles (95 kilometres) per hour in a normal car to zero in one second - for 20 seconds. This last stint to zero is where the problem lies, however. Even at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute. Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer AP Racing. In tests these proved much more promising, withstanding temperatures of up to 850Â°C (1,560Â°F). They even survived to such an extent that they can be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced. But hopes are high that they could be the solution to bring the Bloodhound safely to a halt.","The cockpit of Bloodhound SSC is made from layers of carbon fibre .

"Russia's gangster violence exploded on to the streets of London when a banker was gunned down entering his luxury Docklands home. German Gorbuntsov was in the foyer of his apartment block near Canary Wharf when a would-be assassin sprayed shots at him with a submachine gun. The 45-year-old collapsed at the scene. Today he was said to be in a 'critical but stable condition' under armed guard at a hospital where he remains in a coma. Coma: German Gorbuntsov was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near Canary Wharf in an attempted assassination attempt . Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf . Friends of Mr Gorbuntsov fear that a mafia contract has been taken out on his life because he was a witness in the case of an attempted murder of another banker in 2009. It is feared there could now be further attempts on his life. His neighbours in Byng Street on the Isle of Dogs, where serviced apartments costÂ  up to Â£200 a day, said a tearful blonde tried to reach the bankerâs prone body. Emma Key, 30, said the woman â in her 20s and thought to be his wife â was being held back by police officers. âShe was obviously upset, she was crying. She was trying to get into the ambulance. A policeman was trying to hold her back. âThe concierge told us he had been shot three times and that that was his wife.â Tony Smith, a 26-year-old estate agent, drove down Byng Street only moments after the murder attempt. He said: âI pulled my car up and looked down and saw his body, saw him. âPolice were surrounding him but there were only two police cars, and the rest came later. âThe window was shot out on the door. I thought he had been stabbed at first. I didnât expect this to happen in this block.â Bart Fogler, 27, a worker on the front desk of a nearby block also saw the aftermath of the shooting. He told The Sun that he ran to the scene after hearing the shots and saw Mr Gorbuntsov bleeding heavily from his injuries. Murdered: Alexander Litvinenko, 43, died after being poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in November 2006 . 'He was trying to stand but he fell to the ground,' Mr Fogler said. Lynette Johnson, 43, a nearby resident saw the lobby after the shooting. She told The Sun: 'There was blood everywhere, all over the walls. 'The windows were smashed so he may have been shot through them.' Mr Gorbuntsov has been linked to an investigation into a gun attack on Alexander Antonov, whose son Vladimir once owned Portsmouth Football Club. New evidence from Mr Gorbuntsov led to the case being reopened by the judicial authorities in Moscow. The case had been put on ice because the mastermind behind the attack remained unidentified even afterÂ  three Chechens had been convicted of trying to kill Mr Antonov. The same gang was also found guilty of assassinating Ruslan Yamadayev, one of five brothers from a clan that had challenged the power of ChechnyaâsÂ  Kremlin-backed president, Ramzan Kadyrov. Vadim Vedenin, Mr Gorbuntsovâs lawyer, told Kommersant newspaper in Moscow that his clientâs new testimony in the Antonov case had implicated two of his former business partners. The Russian banker had himself been suspected of involvement at one point. According to a neighbour, the man who attempted to murder Mr Gorbuntsov 'was known' to his victim. The 54-year-old management consultant was at home when the shooting took place. He said: 'I arrived home at 6.30pm and went upstairs, and around 9pm that night the police knocked on the door and mentioned there had been an incident, and that someone was critically injured and taken to hospital. 'They mentioned that the attacker was known to the person who'd been attacked. 'The morning after, I came down to go to work just before 7am and the glass here in the door was all smashed in. 'When the police mentioned the incident they hadn't said it was physically in the foyer,' added the man, who gave his name only as John. The inquiry into Tuesday eveningâs shooting is being led by the Metropolitan Police Trident gang crime command, which is said to be liaising with counter-terrorism officers. Yesterday a spokesman for Scotland Yard said it was too early to speculate on whether the attack was linked to the Antonov investigation of 2009. He also refused to reveal what weapon was used. The attempted assassination will prompt comparisons with the murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London in November 2006. British prosecutors have named his fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the main suspect in his poisoning with radioactive polonium-210. Shooting: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was attacked on the Isle of Dogs close to Canary Wharf . However, the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK.Last night Mr Litvinenkoâs widow, Marina, sent her thoughts to Mr Gorbuntsovâs family. She said: âThis must obviously be a very difficult time. I donât think it is very easy to say what has happened at this stage â they will be hoping for some clarity very soon.â Mr Gorbuntsov, who used to own a number of banks in Russia and Moldova, has been living in exile in Britain. He is on Moldovaâs wanted list over allegations of involvement in an illegal bank takeover and embezzlement. Another of his lawyers, Valery Andronik, told Kommersant that the attack was unlikely to have been planned from within the former Soviet republic. âHe told me several times, âIf I go back to Russia, they will kill meâ,â said Mr Andronik. It is understood that Mr Gorbuntsov spent time in jail before becoming a businessman in the early 1990s. He set up nearly 40 companies involved in security, construction, real estate and finance.Although counter-terror officers are involved, Mr GorbuntsovâsÂ  shooting is being put down to organised crime. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: âA man was shot a number of times as he entered a block of flats by a suspect who is described as white, six feet tall and of slim build. âHe was wearing dark clothing and seen running away.â","German Gorbuntsov was 'blasted with a submachine gun' as he entered a block of flats near Canary Wharf .

"Hekla volcano, one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, is on the verge ofÂ  a major eruption that could impact air travel, experts have warned. A University of Iceland geoscientist believes a 'bulge' on the northern sign of the volcano is caused by huge deposits of magma rising. In 2010 the eruption of Iceland's EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano hampered air travel due to the ash and gas it has spewed into the atmosphere, and there are fears another eruption could cause the same issues. The Hekla volcano, which experts warn is on the verge of erupting for the first time since 2000. Researchers say there is now more magma than in 2000, the last time the Hekla volcano erupted. University of Iceland geophysicist Pll Einarsson said in a report published in the Icelandic newspaper Morgunblai on Monday that according to GPS monitoring of the expanding surface, there is now more magma underneath Hekla than before the volcano's last eruption in 2000, . Hekla volcano 'could erupt soon,' Einarsson said. The last eruption at Hekla started on Feb. 26, 2000, and lasted for nearly two weeks. Then, it took just 79 minutes from the first warning earthquake until the volcano exploded, Einarsson said. Hekla volcano has blasted more than 20 times in the last 1,200 years, blanketing southern Iceland with thick layers of ash and lava. Some of the eruptions are short and small, while others continue for months, pumping enough ash into the atmosphere to chill temporarily the northern latitudes. Lava explodes from the Hekla volcano in an unpopulated area about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Iceland's capital Reykjavik on Sunday Feb. 27, 2000. The Hekla volcano is in an unpopulated area about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Iceland's capital Reykjavik. Volcano watchers have anticipated a new eruption at Hekla since 2006, when tiny earthquakes and surface swelling first hinted that new magma had appeared. Media reports warned of similar surface swelling at Hekla in 2011 and 2013, without a subsequent eruption. Hekla, in the background, was believed to be the gateway to purgatory. .

"Israel's president on Tuesday canceled the appearance of a local pop star at a high-profile public event following the singer's release of a new song focusing on a fictional Arab who stabs Jews. The release of the song by singer Amir Benayoun reflects the recent tensions between Jews and Muslims, connected in large part to competing claims to the most sensitive holy site in Jerusalem. President Reuven Rivlin, whose largely ceremonial role is meant to serve as a moral compass for the country, repeatedly has appealed for calm. Israel's president Reuven Rivlin canceled the appearance of a local pop star Amir BenayounÂ at a high-profile public event following the singer's release of a new song focusing on a fictional Arab who stabs Jews. Rivlin's office said Tuesday it canceled its invitation for Benayoun to perform at an event next week marking the expulsion and exile of Jews from Arab countries and Iran. The office said the sentiments expressed by Benayoun in the song 'Ahmed Loves Israel' are 'inconsistent with the responsibility required of the president's residence.' 'His statements made at this time of conflict and tension ... do not, to say the least, help bring calm to the streets,' it said. 'Ahmed Loves Israel' tells of a fictional Arab who wants to 'send to hell a Jew or two' despite his moderate appearance. 'I wasn't brought up on love,' the song goes. 'It's true that the moment will come when you will turn your back on me, and I'll stab you right in the back.' Rivlin's office said the sentiments expressed by Benayoun in the song 'Ahmed Loves Israel' are 'inconsistent with the responsibility required of the president's residence' Over the past month, Palestinian attackers have killed 11 people. Five Palestinian assailants have died at the hands of Israeli security forces, and an Arab-Israeli man was fatally shot by police during a violent protest. Against this backdrop, the Israeli government is pushing new legislation that would codify Israel's status as 'the Jewish state.' Critics, including Arab rights groups and many Jewish Israelis, believe it would undercut Israel's democratic character. Officials have delayed a parliamentary vote, originally scheduled for Wednesday, by a week while legislators search for compromise language. The bill still threatens to fracture Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition. The U.S. State Department called Monday on Israel to preserve its democracy in a clear reference to the legislation.","Amir Benayoun was due to perform at an event next week .

She said that Hollande has suffered recordÂ low popularity because he has failed to deliver promised reforms and left left-wing voters feeling betrayed. Trierweiler suggested the president was selfish and sometimes stretched the truth. 'It's not revenge, it's not about destroying him, it's about me rebuilding myself,' she said of her book, which accuses Hollande of dismissively describing the poor as ""the toothless"".' She said in a BBC television interview that politicians 'do not become president if they are not self-centred or if they are not sometimes economical with the truth. I don't think President Hollande has more faults than another president.' Half-way into his five-year mandate, the popularity of the 60-year-old Socialist hit a new low this month as business leaders rounded on him for what they said were his faltering efforts to kickstart the eurozone's second largest economy. A scrum of photographers greeted her at Hatchards, where she was promoting her book, Thank You For This Moment: A Story Of Love, Power And Betrayal, which charts her time as the French first lady . Trierweiler, 49, said his unpopularity was due to his failure to deliver on policy. 'The problem is that the results are not forthcoming and the French people are waiting for them,' she said. 'He committed himself to a certain number of reforms, notably in the fight against unemployment. He promised that the figures would come down and they haven't. His falling popularity is as much to do with that as anything else.' Trierweiler lived with Hollande at the Elysee presidential palace for a year and a half until a gossip magazine exposed his secret relationship with actress Julie Gayet, 42, in January. Hollande's Elysee Palace has refused to comment on her book. The president broke his own silence on the matter earlier this month, saying he realised Trierweiler had suffered because of the nature of their separation. He said he forgave her for expressing her pain.

"A Frenchman claims he has invented a pill that makes bodily gases smell like chocolate. Christian Poincheval, 65, from Gesvres, north-west France, says his capsules will not only ease indigestion but also eliminate foul odours from flatulence. In place of such malodorous whiffs, he says, users of his herbal concoctions will instead emit sweet smelling and inoffensive scents. Chocolate body odour: A Frenchman has invented a pill to make users' flatulence smell like chocolate . Previously Mr Poincheval has sold pills to scent silent but deadly olfactory outrages with rose or violet, but now he has brought out a chocolate version just in time for Christmas. 'The Father Christmas fart pill that gives your farts the scent of chocolate' retails at â¬9.99 for a jar of 60 and offers benefits including 'the reduction of gas and bloating'. 'Itâs a nice present for the festive season,' he told newspaper Ouest France. Mr Poincheval sells his products direct to the public on his website pilulepet.com (pilulepet translates to 'fart-pill'), where he appears in photographs posing as an imp. The pills are a concoction of charcoal, fennel, seaweed, plant resin and blueberry, with added cocoa peel for the Christmas chocolate editions. Mr Poincheval says he came up with the idea for his fart pills after a heavy meal with friends.

"It is definitely a unique way to get an office with a view. California design firm Ideo has revealed three visions for the future or cars - all transparent. They include a smart car that can turn its seats to form a living room, a delivery 'tube' that can drop off goods, and the moving office can can let you work from anywhere. Scroll down for video . WorkOnWheels, a concept which could see mobile office driving around the city to turn parking lots and even beachfronts into mobile offices for firms. The firm says it hopes the vehicles will cut people's commute time. The mobile office comes complete with a desk that can double as a meeting table. The firm says it can be driven to the beach for brainstorming sessions, or even linked toogether to form bigger spaces. 'As confidence grows in autonomous ways of delivering goods and autonomous driving becomes more mainstream, a third stage of automobility will come into existence,' Ideo says. 'It will involve inverse commutes, where working spaces come closer to where people live instead of commuters heading to pre-determined workplaces. Food trucks, laundry, mobile dentistry, and other ad hoc services can pop up around a 'Work On Wheels' site, ready to serve people working there, the firm believes. The designers predict that more companies will start using mobile offices that can make use of parking spaces or other temporarily vacant space in crowded cities, such as using a baseball stadium lot in the off season. At the end of the day, the office would head back to a garage to recharge. The firm also says delivery trucks are set for major changes - and have even given them a name, Cody. 'As we look ahead, we see self-driving delivery trucksâ we call them 21st-Century mulesâ delivering everything from your new jeans to a hot lunch, almost instantly,' they says. 'After receiving notification that 'Cody' has arrived, you'll simply walk to the curb, do a biometric scan, and receive your package. No tips required.' The tubular transparent trucks would come on demand, so if you need a dress or lunch delivered, you could get it almost instantly. A robot in the back would sort and resort packages as the route changes throughout the day. The truck would serve as a drop-off spot for packages when it's parked. By optimizing routes and delivering during off-peak hours, the trucks could reduce traffic and help save over $100 billion in gas costs in the U.S, the firm says.

"Having a son makes mother more sociable - at least if you're a chimpanzee, researchers have found. Nearly four decades of observations of Tanzanian chimpanzees in the foundÂ that the mothers of sons are about 25 percent more social than the mothers of daughters. They say the mother's social life is influenced from the second they give birth. Scroll down for video . Mothers of males were found to spend about two hours more per day with other chimpanzees than those with female offspring. For the study, researchers measured gregariousness based on three kinds of analyses. TheyÂ looked at how much time a mother spent with other adults who were not immediate family members; the average size of the mother's party and its composition; and the proportion of time a mother spent in mixed-sex and female-only parties. 'It is really intriguing that the sex of her infant influences the mother's behavior right from birth and that the same female is more social when she has a son than when she has a daughter,' said Anne Pusey, chair of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke, who led the study. Mothers of males were found to spend about two hours more per day with other chimpanzees than those with female offspring. The researchers believe that the mothers are giving the young males the opportunity to observe males in social situations, even while still clinging to their mothers. This gives the youngsters a start on developing the social skills they'll need to thrive in the competitive world of adults. Chimpanzees have a male-dominated society in which rank is a constant struggle and females with infants might face physical violence and even infanticide. It would be safer in general to just avoid groups where aggressive males are present, yet the mothers of sons choose to do so anyway. 'Drawing from the long-term datasets, we were able to investigate patterns within the same mother, examining how she behaved with her sons versus with her daughters,' said Carson Murray, an assistant professor at George Washington University, who was a PhD student under Pusey. 'These results are even more compelling than a general pattern, demonstrating that the same female behaves very differently depending on the sex of her offspring.' For the study, researchers measured gregariousness based on three kinds of analyses. TheyÂ looked at how much time a mother spent with other adults who were not immediate family members; the average size of the mother's party and its composition; and the proportion of time a mother spent in mixed-sex and female-only parties. Researchers usedÂ data all the way back to Jane Goodall's first hand-written observations from the early 1960s. The findings are based on an analysis of 37 years of daily observations of East African chimpanzeess from the Gombe National Park in Tanzania. Duke University houses all of the data from the famous Kasekela chimpanzee community in the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center, which contains more than 50 years of observational data all the way back to Jane Goodall's first hand-written observations from the early 1960s. The data largely consist of 'follows,' in which a researcher focuses on one chimpanzee and notes her behaviors and interactions with others throughout the day. Duke scholars led by Pusey are now working on digitizing the entire collection of Gombe data in the Goodall archive to enable more longitudinal studies of this kind. During the first six months of an infant's life, mothers with sons spend significantly more time in mixed-sex parties than mothers with daughters. For the most part, mothers with offspring spend their time alone or with adult daughters and other dependents. Adult males are the more gregarious sex, forming coalitions with other males to assert rank, defend their territory and hunt as a group. Mothers with sons were found to spend more time with others and to associate with more of their kin. During the first six months of an infant's life, mothers with sons spend significantly more time in mixed-sex parties than mothers with daughters. At 30 to 36 months, chimpanzee infants start moving around more on their own without being carried and spend most of their time out of mother's reach. At this age, the male infants start having more interactions with unrelated chimpanzees, especially adult males. Their female counterparts are significantly less social. As the offspring get older and range further from their mothers, the young males have more social partners over the course of the day. Juvenile and adolescent males watch their adult counterparts carefully and often mimic the behaviors they see, including charging displays and copulation. 'Mothers obviously increase social exposure for their young male infants,' Murray said. 'This finding leads to a larger question about how social exposure might shape gender-typical behavior in humans as well.' This study also suggests it is possible the sons themselves are driving the increased gregariousness later in life. In early infancy, the boy mothers spend about the same time in female-only groups that the girl moms do. But as their sons become older, boy moms spend more time in female-only, nursery groups, probably because the young males are attracted to the offspring of other females as playmates. 'One of the most surprising results to me was that mothers with young females still have lower association with their relatives,' Murray said. 'As we argue in the paper, this suggests that social exposure is less critical to females in general.' Social exposure has a potential downside too. Females with low rank are known to experience more social stress in large groups, and there is always a risk of infanticide against the young chimpanzees. Perhaps the best way to avoid having infants killed is to steer clear of groups, which the mothers do up to 70 percent of the time. 'Mothers with infant daughters were likely to be avoiding competitive and stressful situations,' Murray said. 'While mothers with sons seem willing to incur those costs for the benefit of having their sons socialized.'","Four decades of observations of Tanzanian chimpanzees analysed .

"Most people can recognize Microsoft founder Bill Gates and know that hashtags belong in tweets, but are confused about whether having a privacy policy means that a company actually keeps consumer information confidential, according to a new Pew Research study released Tuesday. The results underscore what many techies say is a growing problem for the U.S.: a generation reliant on the convenience that technology brings, but with little understanding of the risks of conducting nearly every transaction digitally. Aaron Smith, senior researcher at Pew and author of the report, said he thought it would be interesting for policy makers and tech designers to find what knowledge gaps existed in modern life. Worrying trend: We may be the Internet generation, but we don't know much about how it works, according to a new Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday that found most people can recognize Microsoft founder Bill Gates (pictured) 'Just because people use these gadgets a lot doesn't necessarily mean they know everything about how they work and where they came from,' he said. The 17-question quiz is available online at www.pewinternet.org/quiz/web-iq-quiz/ . Not surprisingly, people under 30 seemed to do better on some of the questions than older Internet users, such as knowing what a 'Wiki' or 'captcha' is. But young or old, only about 6 in 10 Internet users understood that 'net neutrality' refers to the equal treatment of digital content by service providers. The Federal Communications Commission is considering whether it should regulate the broadband industry more aggressively to prevent providers from playing favorites among content sites like Google, YouTube, Amazon or Netflix. Another area where age didn't seem to matter was the false assumption that the existence of a privacy policy means that a company keeps the data it collects on consumers confidential. More than half â 52 percent â of Internet users thought that was the case, whereas privacy policies often explain that a company reserves the right to sell a person's information to advertisers or other third parties. Three-fourths of people surveyed thought the 'Internet' was the same thing as the 'World Wide Web.' The Internet refers to the infrastructure that uses specific protocols to connect various networks; the web is one application that uses that architecture to share information using web pages. The online survey was conducted Sept. 12-18 among a sample of 1,066 adult Internet users 18 years of age or older. The survey was conducted by the GfK Group using KnowledgePanel.

"England's players have had plenty of excuses to lose sleep through their woeful on-field displays in recent months but paranormal activity in their hotel bedrooms is surely taking things to an extreme. While the ghost of ousted Kevin Pietersen may be haunting the power-brokers at the ECB, it has emerged that the current team are convinced their five-star central London hotel is haunted, causing several stars to have difficulty sleeping at night. Sportsmail has learned that a number of players have requested to move rooms, while some wives and girlfriends have refused to stay at the world-renowned Langham Hotel during London Test matches this summer after complaints of mysterious goings-on at night. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stuart Broad take a sensational catch in England training . Spooked: Ben Stokes is among the England players who have been unnerved by ghostly goings-on . Who you gonna call? Stuart Broad is also scared by the possible presence of ghosts at the Langham Hotel . âDuring the Sri Lanka Test I had to move rooms,â said fast bowler Stuart Broad. âIt was so hot in the room I just couldnât sleep. All of a sudden the taps in the bathroom came on for no reason. I turned the lights on and the taps turned themselves off. Then when I turned the lights off again the taps came on. It was very weird. âIt really freaked me out. I ended up asking to move rooms. Bealey (Broadâs girlfriend) was pretty spooked, too, and I know Moeen Aliâs other half wonât stay there because sheâs so frightened of the ghosts. âBen Stokes has had some problems sleeping as well. Heâs on the third floor, which is where a lot of the issues are. Iâm telling you, something weird is going on.â The Langham Hotel - renowned as one of the finest in London - was opened in 1865 by The Prince of Wales and subsequently frequented by the cream of Victorian society including literary luminaries such as Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Oscar Wilde. Favourite haunt: England have been staying at the world-renowned Langham Hotel in London for recent Tests . Ghostly goings-on: Broad (left), Stokes (right) and several England WAGs have been scared by the ghouls . But it has also been reported that as many as seven ghosts have been seen stalking the corridors and bedrooms - including a German doctor who reportedly murdered his wife while on honeymoon at the hotel before committing suicide and a soldier who committed suicide by throwing himself off a balcony. Room 333 is believed to be the most haunted room with the hotelâs own website stating: âIn 1973 a BBC radio announcer James Alexander-Gordon awoke suddenly in the night to see a fluorescent ball which slowly took on the shape of a man wearing Victorian evening wear. The announcer asked the ghost what it wanted and it began to float towards him, with its legs cut off some two feet below the ground, arms outstretched, eyes staring emptily. At this point the announcer got up and fled.â The hotelâs history has clearly affected Alastair Cookâs men, too, with some of the most senior players in the team convinced the hotel is haunted. Safety in numbers: Broad (left) shared a twin room with wicketkeeper Matt Prior (right) in the hotel . Ghostly presence: England have been spooked both on and off the pitch so far this summer . âIâve slept okay during the current Test (against India) but the Sri Lanka Test (last month) was not great,â added Broad. âOne night I woke up in the middle of the night, around 1.30am and I was convinced there was a presence in the room. It was the weirdest feeling. âI turned the light on and looked online and could see Matt Prior was online, too. I went to his room and he said exactly the same thing! He was wide awake as well. Neither of us could sleep because we were so spooked out. âMatt was in a twin room so I ended up sharing with him. I donât know if itâs because weâre talking about it more that we sensing more is going on but itâs weird. Itâs definitely caused a few sleepless nights.â The hotel declined to comment.

The Times reports Ms Le Pen as saying: 'We signed with the First (bank) who agreed and we're very happy about it.' She insisted that it was 'ridiculous to suggest that gaining a loan would determine our international position'. And added that the accusations were 'outrageous and offensive', and that her party had long held pro-Russian views. Despite her comments the party's treasurer, Wallerand de Saint Just, admitted he would have preferred the party had chosen a French bank. According to the party the money was needed to prepare for the coming elections, leading up to the presidential campaign of 2017 in which Ms Le Pen would run.

"Not even half of Australia's 16-year-olds can correctly identify what event Anzac Day commemorates. Only 46 per cent of Year 10 students can correctly name Gallipoli or a battle in World War One as the reason for Anzac Day memorials across the country.

Scroll down for video . Only 46 percent of Year 10 students can correctly name Gallipoli or a battle in World War One as the reason for Anzac Day memorials across the country . The students answered the question as part of a civics and citizenship test for the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA). The majority of Year 10 students said Prime Minister Tony Abbott was Australia's head of state instead of the correct answer which is the Queen. Almost half of Year 6 students could correctly name the Governor-General as the Queen's representative here in Australia. Despite thousands of Australians heading to Gallipoli each year for Anzac Day commemorations, less than half of the country's 16 years old can recall the reason for it . 'It's pleasing to see that half of our young Australians have met or exceeded the challenging but achievable proficiency standard in civics and citizenship although the remaining half have yet to do so,' ACARA CEO Rob Randall said. The test highlighted the positive attitude students have towards citizenship in the country. More than 90 percent of students endorsed the notion that Australia should support the cultural traditions and languages of Indigenous Australians. More than 5,000 students were asked: 'On Anzac Day each year Australians remember an event that happened on 25 April, 1915. What happened on that day that Australians remember?' Two-thirds of Year 6 students reported an interest in what was happening in other countries, 70 percent for global issues, 69 percent for environmental issues in Australia and 65 percent were concerned about what happens in the local community. When asked about important behaviours for good citizenship, 80 percent of students rated participation in activities such as protecting the environment, promoting human rights and learning about Australia's history and activities. 'Students tend to experience civic engagement first within their school context, with these experiences important for fostering future participation in a democratic society. It is pleasing to see that so many students have positive attitudes to participation as active citizens,'Â ACARA Chair, Professor Barry McGaw said.","Only 46 per cent of Year 10 students know Anzac Day is to commemorate Gallipoli or a battle in World War One .

"Leaders of the legal profession yesterday dropped their controversial advice to lawyers on how to draw up wills according to Islamic sharia law. The Law Society apologised for putting out a guidance note which told solicitors to draw up sharia wills that give male heirs double the amounts inherited by women. It also told lawyers they should cut illegitimate and adopted children out of any inheritance. The Law Society apologised for putting out a guidance note which told solicitors to draw up sharia wills that give male heirs double the amounts inherited by women. Pictured: TheÂ Sharia Council of Britain in London . Andrew Caplen, president of the professional body for solicitors, said: âWe reviewed the note in the light of criticism. We have withdrawn the note and we are sorry.â The guidance, issued to lawyers amid deep controversy in the spring, was seen as a major advance for sharia law. The religious legal code is seen by critics as discriminating against women and running contrary to basic principles of English law. It told solicitors drawing up wills for Muslim clients who wanted their estates distributed according to sharia rules: âThe male heirs in most cases receive double the amount inherited by a female heir of the same class. âNon-Muslims may not inherit at all, and only Muslim marriages are recognised.â The guidance said divorced husbands or wives cannot inherit under sharia rules, and instructed lawyers: âYou should amend clauses which define the term children or issue to exclude those who are illegitimate or adopted.â Inheritance law allows people to leave as much as they like to whoever they like in their wills. But the Law Society came under heavy criticism after issuing the advice. The organisation, which operates firm equality rules, was seen as encouraging its members to collude in discriminating against women and others who are disadvantaged under sharia law. Inheritance law allows people to leave as much as they like to whoever they like in wills (file picture) Mr Caplen said: âOur practice note was intended to support members to better serve their clients as far as is allowed by the law of England and Wales.â The National Secular Society, which had been pressing the Law Society to withdraw the advice, said it welcomed the decision. Director Keith Porteous Wood said: âThis is an important reversal for what had seemed to be the relentless march of sharia to becoming British law. 'Until now, politicians and the legal establishment either encouraged this process or spinelessly recoiled from acknowledging what was happening. âThis is particularly good news for women who fare so badly under sharia law, which is a non-democratically determined, non-human rights compliant and discriminatory code.â Sharia rulings are made by an estimated 85 tribunals attached to mosques throughout the country. The decisions made in them have no force in English law, but operate on a voluntary basis, with all parties agreeing to be bound by rulings. English courts often rubber stamp sharia court decisions. In divorce cases, for example, a judge will in many cases examine documents and forms submitted after a decision in a sharia tribunal and declare the divorce official in English law . Sharia law has gained growing respectability, particularly on the political left, since 2003, when the then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said British courts might recognise sharia tribunals and that official acceptance of sharia âseems unavoidableâ.","Law Society has apologised for putting out a guidance note in the spring .

"David Cameron vowed last night to âexportâ gay marriage around the world as he held a party to celebrate the passage of legislation in Britain. The Prime Minister told a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender reception in Downing Street of his personal pride at legalising gay marriage. Addressing an audience that included BBC presenter Clare Balding and her partner, the former newsreader Alice Arnold, Mr Cameron boasted that Britain was now âthe best place to be gay, lesbian or transgender anywhere in Europeâ.

Street of his personal pride at legalising gay marriage and vowed to . export it around the world. (File picture) But he risked controversy by suggesting that his ministers should now fan out across the globe to spread gay marriage around the world. âIâm personally proud of this,â he said. âI think itâs a really good step. Iâve told the Bill team Iâm now going to reassign them because, of course, all over the world people would have been watching this and weâve set something of an example of how to pass good legislation in good time. âMany countries are going to want to copy this. I talk about how weâve got to export more, so Iâm going to export the Bill team. 'I think they can take it around the world.â 'A very good speech': Clare Balding was among the prominent gay figures who attended, along with her partner, former newsreader Alice Arnold . Gay marriage was passed by Parliament despite fierce opposition from some Tory MPs and grassroots members, who were angered by the Prime Minister prioritising the issue over economic problems. But Mr Cameron signalled that he wants to go further in pressing gay rights. He told the gathering: âThereâs still a lot more work to be done. 'Thereâs work to be done talking to our Commonwealth partners about decriminalising homosexuality in various countries. âThereâs a lot of work to be done on homophobic bullying in schools, which is still a scourge in our country. Thereâs a lot of work to be done in terms of hate crimes and how we stop and stamp that out in our society.â The reception was also attended by gay rights campaigners and senior Tories including International Development Minister Alan Duncan and former prisons minister Crispin Blunt. Miss Balding, who is set to marry Miss Arnold, said: âIt was great â a very good speech by the Prime Minister. âHe said that he had delivered on a promise and he was very proud to have done so.â During the event Mr Cameron, together with his team of ministers behind the legislation, signed a copy of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. He said: âI think of young children growing up at school, who might be uncertain about their sexuality, knowing that now, in the highest place in the land â in Parliament â weâve passed this law that says that marriage is for you, whether youâre gay or whether youâre straight. And that is so important to young people growing up.â Legal at last: Gay marriage was passed by Parliament despite fierce opposition from some Tory MPs and grassroots members, who were angered by the Prime Minister prioritising the issue over economic problems . But some of his MPs remain angry. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the issue was âdeeply divisiveâ for the party.

"The worldâs oldest bottle of mineral water has been uncovered from the depths of the Baltic Sea by Polish scuba divers . The worldâs oldest bottle of mineral water has been uncovered from the depths of the Baltic Sea by Polish divers. The 200-year-old flask, described as in a âgood condition and still corkedâ, has the name âSeltersâ inscribed in its stoneware. Polish archaeologists found the 12 inch (30cm) bottle in shipwreck lying 12.2 metres (40ft) below water in the GdaÅsk Bay close to the Polish coast. Produced between 1806 and 1830, the brown bottle is an extremely rare find as most sealed flasks from that period contain either beer or wine. 'We have not opened the bottle, we are not sure what it contains and what is the taste of the water which is 200 years old,' said Tomasz Bednarz, National Maritime Museum archaeologist. Apart from the bottle, the team managed to recover parts of ceramics, a small bowl and a few pieces of dinnerware. Dr Bednarz said that while itâs likely the bottle contains original Selters water, he doesnât rule out the possibility it was filled with wine. Selters is a German luxury mineral water brand which gained popularity with Europeâs wealthy during the nineteenth century. Scroll down for video . The 19th century corked stoneware bottle is pictured here with underwater archaeologist Tomasz Bednarz . The 200 year-old flask has the name âSeltersâ inscribed in its stoneware (left). Selters (right) is a German luxury mineral water brand, still sold today, which gained popularity with Europeâs wealthy during the nineteenth century . Its springs were discovered around 1000 on the northern slopes of the Taunus mountain range, in Hesse, Germany. Many people claim that a few sips of Selters water, also known as 'fluid treasure', can boost strength and health. The springs of this mineral water went dry in the beginning of the 19th century and the characteristic stoneware bottles became rationed goods. In 1896, a group of enthusiasts from Selters organised a quest in order to find springs of the legendary water. Produced between 1806 and 1830, the brown bottle is an extremely rare find as most sealed flasks from that period contain either beer or wine. Pictured here is the team recovering the 19th Century bottle . The scuba divers prepare to jump into the waters of GdaÅsk Bay which is close to the Polish coast .

Apart from the bottle, the team managed to recover parts of ceramics, a small bowl and a few pieces of dinnerware . After making a number boreholes, a fountain of crystal clear water exploded from one of the wells below Laneburg castle. Archaeologists hope the bottle will help identify the shipwreck in which it was found, which is currently only known only as F-33-31. They suspect the ship may have been a cargo vessel used for transporting goods such as along the Baltic coast. âSo far, due to its preserved state and historical background, the stoneware bottle is our most valuable find,â said Dr Bednarz. A man caused outrage in September after finding the world's oldest message in a bottle - and refusing to open it. Worn and battered, but still sealed, the elusive note has finally reached a reader - 1,115 miles and one century later. The green glass artefact was spotted sitting on the shore of the secluded Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada. Strolling along the recently excavated beach on a Monday morning, Steve Thurber noticed the bottle lying in the middle of an open stretch of sand. Determined to preserve what has stayed intact since September 29 1906, he has decided to leave the details of the message shrouded in mystery. All that can be read through the bottle - the cap of which is rusted over - is the date it was thrown into the sea, September 29 1906 and that it is signed by Earl Willard. It lists Willard's address and states that he was a passenger on a steamer from San Francisco to Washington and that he threw the bottle into the sea 76 hours into the voyage. The envelope, visible through the bottle, shows Earl Willard's address and where the letter was sent from .","The 12 inch (30cm) bottle was found in a shipwreck in the GdaÅsk Bay .

"Pope Francis has warned the European Union that it is seen as âaloofâ, âinsensitiveâ, 'if not downright harmfulâ by those it seeks to represent, who resent its bureaucracy and the creeping expansion of its powers. Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the pope said there was âgrowing mistrustâ by Europeans citizens at the expansion of the EU. He said the âgreat ideasâ, which once moved Europeans to unite seem to have lost their appeal, only to be replaced by the âbureaucratic technicalities of its institutionsâ.

Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the pope said there was âgrowing mistrustâ by Europeans citizens at the expansion of the EU . He said that Europe is seen as an 'aged' and 'haggard' âgrandmotherâ by the rest of the planet and felt 'less and less a protagonist', in a world that regarded it 'with detachment, diffidence and even suspicion'. The speech drew repeated applause from MEPs but Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commissionâs new president, and Martin Schulz, the parliamentâs socialist president, were less than impressed. The pair looked uncomfortable when the pope denounced the organisationâs promotion of a 'rather selfish lifestyle marked by an opulence that is no longer sustainable and which is frequently indifferent to the world around us'. Francis said: 'In recent years, as the European Union has expanded, there has been growing mistrust on the part of citizens towards institutions considered to be aloof, engaged in laying down rules perceived as insensitive to individual peoples, if not downright harmful.' He added: 'In many quarters we encounter a general impression of weariness and ageing, of a Europe which is now a âgrandmotherâ, no longer fertile and vibrant.'

The pope has previously called Europe 'a tired continent'. Francis also used his visit, his first to France, to call for a âunited responseâ to boatloads of poor and desperate migrants arriving in Europe, saying that we cannot allow the Mediterranean âto become a vast cemeteryâ. He said:âThe boats landing daily on the shores of Europe are filled with men and women who need acceptance and assistance.' Francis condemned the scaling back of the Mediterranean migrant rescue mission last month. A new mission by EU border agency Frontex has taken over the Italian Navy rescue efforts this month but has just one third of the funding and will patrol only in EU waters. Francis condemned an âabsence of mutual supportâ from EU states saying it would âcontribute to slave labour and continuing social tensionsâ. Each person was entitled to the 'dignity' of work and food, he said. The pope urged the parliamentarians to confront immigration problems only by adopting âfair, courageous and realistic policiesâ rather than those motivated by self-interest. Francis' visit to Strasbourg has annoyed some who have accused him of neglecting Europe since his election last year. It is only his second European trip after Albania.","Pope Francis said their was a 'growing mistrust' by European citizens .

"Ben Purdy, 18, has been named locally as the teenager who died after being shot in the eye on Sunday afternoon in Bermondsey, south London . This is the London teenager who died  after being shot in the eye by mace-wielding attackers in an apparent dispute over a girl. Ben Purdy, 18, died in hospital yesterday with his family and friends at his bedside, after being gunned down during a violent row while walking through south east London on Sunday. The teenager, who was studying plumbing at Lewisham College, was cutting through the Abbeyfield Estate in Bermondsey, Southwark, when he was shot through the eye at close range. Ben, an avid Arsenal fan, was found slumped on the ground in a pool of blood and was rushed to hospital in east London with gunshot wounds. He died the next day. His 19-year-old friend was also injured during the attack, after being allegedly ambushed with what witnesses described as a 'medieval-style mace' and a baseball bat. He has since been released from hospital. Tributes have now poured in for the teenager - the tenth teenager to be murdered in the capital this year - on social media. His best friend Jack Walker described Ben as 'one in a million', while Connor Lucas tweeted: 'R.I.P Ben Purdy, so unfortunate that it happened to a nice lad'. Eskii Boy tweeted: 'My Condolences to Ben Purdy's Family.' Another tweeted: 'Rest In Peace Ben Purdy, I still can't believe you left us. We are going to miss you so much.' Grace Rosie Day also tweeted: 'so young and not a fair way to go.' Police announced this morning that a murder inquiry had been launched  after Ben's death on Monday afternoon. Two men, one aged 36 and the other aged 21, both from south London, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 36-year-old man was arrested at an address in south London in the early hours of Monday. 'A 21-year-old man was arrested after he handed himself in at a south London police station late on Monday afternoon. 'Both men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody at a south London police station.' Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn, of the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command based at Lewisham, is leading the investigation. The teenager, who was studying plumbing at Lewisham College, was shot through the eye at close range during an apparent dispute over a girl . He said: 'We are retaining an open mind as to the motive behind this incident, but there is nothing to suggest at this stage that it was gang related. 'A crime scene remains in place at the scene.' It is understood detectives are investigating the possibility the shooting was over an argument about a girl. A friend of the teenager told the Evening Standard: 'Ben was a good guy and would play football in Southwark Park with his mates. He loved football and loved chasing girls. 'He had been with his girlfriend a few months, but she already had a baby with another man.' Earlier, witnesses had told how 18-year-old was initially knocked unconscious by the shot before coming around, as residents on the estate raced to help. Nigel Fletcher, 46, said he saw the victim lying in a pool of blood wearing trainers, jeans and black coat. He said: 'I looked out and saw the guy lying on the floor in a pool of blood. The others obviously fled as quick as they could. Ben was taken to hospital after being shot in on Sunday afternoon while walking through the Abbeyfield Estate. Pictured: A forensic tent at the scene of the incident . Police said investigations remain ongoing at the scene and confirmed a murder probe had been launched . 'He was just lying there still as a bat - he wasn't moving at all. I just assumed he was dead, dead instantly. There was blood everywhere. 'I heard the shooting, it sounded like two shots. There was a big bang, like a firework, but it was obviously a gun. It echoed around the estate. 'My missus came down and just said 'someone's been shot.' She told me she's heard arguing outside and then heard the shots and saw one or two of them running away. 'I've never seen anything like it. Things like this don't happen around here.' The road and footpath remained shut to the public yesterday as police investigations continued at the scene . Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'I looked out of my window because I heard a noise. 'A blue car sped away and there was a lot of shouting. One group ran one way and others ran through the car park. 'I didn't realise someone had been shot. I only realised when my neighbour said. I called for an ambulance and went down with a towel. 'He was white and I did see he had an injury to his eye. He was huddled over. He was alive but he was groaning. He was conscious. 'It all happened so quickly. I have lived here for two-and-a-half years and never seen anything like this before.'

"A barrister has been fined Â£2,000 for an online attack on witnesses who were due to give evidence at the rape trial of his Tory MP friend. Henry Hendron was disciplined for a blog in which he called alleged victims âmanipulative and duplicitousâ. Law chiefs said the 33-year-old was guilty of professional misconduct when he made the âdisparaging statementsâ the day before the high-profile trial of former Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was due to start. Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans was cleared of nine sexual offences against Parliamentary researchers. Mr Evans' friend Henry Hendron attacked witnesses in a blog post written on the eve of his trial . Mr Hendron, a civil barrister who has represented clients including Tory MP Nadine Dorries and Apprentice winner Stella English, wrote about Mr Evansâ accusers: âMost of the complainants are known largely as self-serving, with their own political agendas, with a manipulative and selfish streak.â He added: âIn my view... some of these people are not victims but duplicitous individuals, acting together in a pack-like mentality to bring down a well-respected and well-known politician.â Mr Hendron, who charges up to Â£1,750 a day and is described on his website as âimpressive, determined and tenaciousâ, was forced to grovel to the trial judge for almost jeopardising the case. The barrister was told his actions had caused at least one alleged victim to consider pulling out of the trial. Apologising for his âhuge misjudgmentâ, Mr Hendron said he got the idea from the way paralympian Oscar Pistorius was supported by friends during his murder case. The Attorney General decided not to bring charges of contempt of court. But Mr Hendron, who works at Strand Chambers in London, reported himself to the Bar Council and has now been found guilty of professional misconduct by The Bar Standards Board. A ruling says he risked harming the publicâs âtrust and confidenceâ. Last night Mr Hendron said: âObviously with hindsight I should not have put up the blog and I took it down as soon as it was drawn to my attention that there was a problem. 'It was a rather expensive blog post and one that I will never repeat.â Mr Evans, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, was cleared in April of nine sexual offences against Parliamentary researchers, including raping a young man at his Lancashire home.","Henry Hendron's blog post called witnesses 'manipulative and duplicitous'

"Women are far more likely to buy a set of lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a blonde, or on a plus-size model rather than an 'in-betweenie' - according to new market research. Adore Me, a fast-growing online lingerie retailer, has built its business around painstakingly testing which models, themes and poses lead to more sales, and the results are somewhat surprising. According to its findings, published by Fast Company, photos featuring boudoir props get fewer clicks, as do 'open-mouthed' models, but when a model touches her hair rather than puts her hand on her hip, sales can double. Who makes you want to buy? Adore Me, a fast-growing online lingerie retailer, has built its business around painstakingly testing which models sell its products better, and found brunettes did much better than blondes . Adore Me uses a marketing ploy called A/B testing, which involves shooting every set of underwear in a variety of ways - on two different models for example - and randomly serving half its online audience with one photo and half with the other. Whichever picture invites more clicks and leads to more sales is then used going forward, and each month, underwear that hasn't sold well will be re-shot using different models, poses or themes. According to the company, using the right model is crucial, and matters more than the price of its lingerie. Switching the same set of underwear to a different model can halt sales, even with a $10 discount. Bra wars: Adore Me uses A/B testing, which involves shooting every set of underwear in a variety of ways (pictured), and randomly serving half its online audience with one photo and half with the other . Subtle tweaks: Poses which involve models touching their hair lead to higher sales than when they place their hands on their hips. Pictured (left) the site's most popular model, Simone Villas Boas . Notably, Adore Me's most popular and thus most lucrative model is Brazilian beauty Simone Villas Boas, 27, who has golden brown hair, blue eyes, washboard abs, an ample bosom and puffy lips. 'No-one' with blonde hair has so far sold well, the research shows. For its plus-size collection, A/B testing has revealed that using genuinely plus-sized models - U.S. size 12 and up by definition - works much better than using 'in-betweenies', who are in between teeny sample-sized and plus-sized. And the ethnicity of its models bears little influence on buying patterns. Consumer-driven: The brand also posts side-by-side shots to its Instagram account and asks its followers to state their preferences (pictured) 'We had some super strong sellers on the African American model, and we had some super bad sellers on the African American model, it was all about the way she behaves in the picture,' says Adore Me's founder, Morgan Hermand-Waiche. 'That's what makes the beauty of the A/B testing. It doesn't cancel out an ethnicity and a genre; it's all about the emotion.' Mr Hermand-Waiche, a self-confessed 'geek', was born in France and studied math and computer science at Ecole de Mines, before attending Harvard Business School and launching Adore Me in 2010. His stringent testing methods are clearly working. In just four years, the company has hauled in $5.6million in revenue.","Lingerie retailer Adore Me shoots every product in two ways and tests which photo sells more of it online .

"For the first time, a female chef is in charge of dessert at the White House.

Morrison will create desserts for all White House social events, including the Gingerbread White House that will be on display during the holidays. She is the seventh White House executive pastry chef. The previous six were men. She started at the White House in 1995 as a contractor from the Ritz-Carlton in McLean, Virginia, and was hired as an assistant White House pastry chef in 2002. The White House says Morrison has a special interest in honey production and will continue to tend the White House bee hive. The Washington PostÂ notes that his job might be a little more difficult compared to predecessors who didn't have to contend with first lady Michelle's healthy bent.

"Care Minister Norman Lamb (pictured) said the Government is looking at how to modernise children and young people's mental health care . Teenagers suffering from mental health problems will be encouraged to use online apps to treat themselves as part of Government plans to transform how depression is dealt with. Care Minister Norman Lamb said the Government is currently looking at how to modernise children and young people's mental health care and warned that GPs must not put patients on anti-depressants as a 'sort of default position'. Mr Lamb has previously criticised services for young people as being 'stuck in the dark ages' and 'not fit for purpose'. The aim of new programmes being developed in mental health care is to provide a 'seamless' service, Mr Lamb told The Times. 'If you're a teenager and your world revolves around digital access we must make sure you get access to therapy online,' he said. 'What I want to achieve is a much more seamless service that allows you access online, face to face or over the telephone, whichever is appropriate.' He added that a 'worry' exists about doctors putting people on medication because they think there is no alternative. He said the online tools made available to young people could include computerised cognitive behavioural therapy, online counselling and peer support networks for the mentally ill. Lucie Russell, of YoungMinds charity, said services do need to be adapted for modern society, but warned of a risk of some people not seeking help from their GP and getting the medication they need. She added: 'What we need is a plethora of different responses to young people who are struggling. 'Sometimes young people can be scared or feel intimidated about phoning their doctor whereas online they are able to engage more freely. 'What there does need to be though is some regularity and I would say that the online support, while very useful, should never take the place of face-to-face therapies. 'Apps should always lead onto phone or face-to-face support, working as a signpost for young people and enabling them to get the help they need. 'If the NHS plans to work on apps, the most important thing is that they speak to the young people, to those who have the first-hand experience. That way they can work out what sort of services they're looking for.' Earlier this month the Commons' Health Select Committee said graphic online content had resulted in a direct increase in mental health problems among young people, including stress and anxiety. In their report, MPs said there were 'major problems' with access to inpatient mental health services and an unacceptable variation in the quality of services, with families facing 'battles' to have their children treated. They heard evidence from children who had spent months on a waiting list for therapy while some services admitted to being so overwhelmed that they only treated children once they had seriously self-harmed. In the report, they highlighted figures from several NHS trusts, including Cornwall where referrals to clinics have increased by between 20 and 25 per cent since last year. Referrals were for conditions including depression, anxiety, self-harming, eating disorders and attempted suicide. Scroll down for video . Online tools made available to children and young people could include computerised cognitive behavioural therapy, online counselling and peer support networks for the mentally ill (file picture, posed by model) The MPs said the popularity of websites such as Facebook meant that bullying âfollows children homeâ. At the time, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health Select Committee, said: âWhat children face now is that the bullying follows them way beyond the walk home from school. âFor some young people itâs clearly a new source of distress.â âYoung women are finding they have shared an image in good faith but then it widely distributed online by young men in the classroom . âItâs become normalised within some school environments.â The report also highlighted figures from the charity Childline showing that there had been an 87 per cent increase in the numbers of calls from children about online bullying. Overall, it warned that there are âseriousâ and âingrainedâ problems in the NHSâs care for children and teenagers with psychological problems.","Minister Norman Lamb wants better online tools to help treat depression .

"Scientists have revealed that Earth came perilously close to a solar storm that could have 'changed life as we know it', causing widespread power failures and knocking out GPS and communication networks. On July 23, 2012, a plasma cloud or 'CME' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s, more than four times faster than a typical eruption. Had the eruption occurred just one week earlier, the blast site would have been facing Earth, rather than off to the side. Scroll down for video . The storm that could have changed life as we know it: On July 23, 2012, a plasma cloud or 'CME' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s, more than four times faster than a typical eruption. According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the total economic impact could exceed $2 trillion or 20 times greater than the costs of a Hurricane Katrina. Multi-ton transformers fried by such a storm could take years to repair and impact national security. Analysts believe that a direct hit could cause widespread power blackouts, disabling everything that plugs into a wall socket. Most people wouldnât even be able to flush their toilet because urban water supplies largely rely on electric pumps, one report warned. Solar flares can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere creating disruptions with signal transmission from, for example, a GPS satellite to Earth. Another phenomenon produced by the sun could be even more disruptive. Known as a coronal mass ejection or CME these solar explosions propel bursts of particles into Earth's atmosphere. Those fluctuations could induce electric fluctuations at ground level that could blow out transformers in power grids. A CME's particles can also collide with crucial electronics onboard a satellite and disrupt its systems. Scientists say the eruption may have been the most violent ever recorded. Analysts believe that a direct hit could cause widespread power blackouts, disabling everything that plugs into a wall socket. Most people wouldnât even be able to flush their toilet because urban water supplies largely rely on electric pumps, one report warned. 'If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,' says Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado, who presented a talk entitled The Major Solar Eruptive Event in July 2012: Defining Extreme Space Weather Scenarios at the NOAA's Space Weather Workshop - an annual gathering to discuss the perils and probabilities of solar storms. 'We need to be prepared,' said Baker. A recent paper in Nature Communications authored by UC Berkeley space physicist Janet G. Luhmann and former postdoc Ying D. Liu uncovered what gave the storm its potency. For one thing, the CME was actually two CMEs separated by only 10 to 15 minutes. This double storm cloud traveled through a region of space that had been cleared out by another CME only four days earlier. As a result, the CMEs were not decelerated as much as usual by their transit through the interplanetary medium. On July 23, 2012, a plasma cloud or 'CME' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s, more than four times faster than a typical eruption. The storm tore through Earth orbit, but fortunately Earth wasn't there. Instead it hit the STEREO-A spacecraft. Researchers have been analyzing the data ever since, and they have concluded that the storm was one of the strongest in recorded history. 'It might have been stronger than the Carrington Event itself,' says Baker. The Carrington Event of Sept. 1859 was a series of powerful CMEs that hit Earth head-on, sparking Northern Lights as far south as Tahiti. Intense geomagnetic storms caused global telegraph lines to spark, setting fire to some telegraph offices and disabling the 'Victorian Internet."" A similar storm today could have a catastrophic effect on modern power grids and telecommunication networks. According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the total economic impact could exceed $2 trillion or 20 times greater than the costs of a Hurricane Katrina. Multi-ton transformers fried by such a storm could take years to repair and impact national security. When the Carrington Event enveloped Earth in the 19th century, technologies of the day were hardly sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. Modern society, on the other hand, is deeply dependent on sun-sensitive technologies such as GPS, satellite communications and the internet. 'The effect of such a storm on our modern technologies would be tremendous,' says Luhmann. During informal discussions at the workshop, Nat Gopalswamy of the Goddard Space Flight Center noted that 'without NASA's STEREO probes, we might never have known the severity of the 2012 superstorm. 'This shows the value of having 'space weather buoys' located all around the sun.' It also highlights the potency of the sun even during so-called 'quiet times.' Many observers have noted that the current solar cycle is weak, perhaps the weakest in 100 years. Clearly, even a weak solar cycle can produce a very strong storm. Says Baker, .","Plasma cloud or 'CME' rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s on July 23, 2012 .

"Itâs a New York hotel offering 'cages' for just $10 a night - and you get what you pay for. The single rooms at Chinatown's The Sun Bright Hotel have been described as 'animal shelters', where more than 100 disadvantaged men live side by side in cockroach-infested chicken wire boxes. Only men are allowed in the 'kennels' on the . third and fourth floors, and the rooms are just seven by five feet - smaller than a prison's solitary-confinement cell. And at least one resident reported the body of a . man was left to rot in his room for 15 days before it was removed - and . the room wasn't even cleaned afterward. Heinous: John Arkue sits in his tiny room at the Sun Bright Hotel . Suffering: Double leg amputee Michael Fidler, 66, has lived in this room for 11 years . The allegations come from the New York Post, which sent a reporter to check out the cut-rate hotel. 'It was horrible - like an animal shelter,' a first responder recently called to the hotel told . 'I picked up a suit on the wall and roaches fell out. Hundreds of them.' More . than 100 men on the floor share one . bathroom with two shower stalls, four toilets and one urinal. Cockroaches, vermin and fleas infest the dilapidated building, and black . mold covers most of the walls, according to the Post. The owners of the hotel have not responded to allegations. Managers were not available for comment to MailOnline early Monday. The six-story building doesn't have an elevator, and most floors lack air conditioning, according to reports. New York Post reports the city Department of Buildings has . issued the budget hotel with 46 summonses since 1988. It has 22 open . violations for converting the second and . fifth floors into a hostel and installing laundry equipment on the . second floor.

The story about a dead man being left inside a room for more than two weeks has not been verified. However many of the dorm rooms which aren't occupied by long-term tenants are rented out to backpackers. The hotel boasts on its website that rooms are 'cozy' and affordable. 'Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, Sun Bright Hotel offers a variety of room types to ensure comfort for your needs at low prices,' the website states. 'Our rooms are clean, affordable and very cozy.' However the promotional pictures of the rooms it has posted, which have also been uploaded to online review guide Yelp, do not paint the full picture. The rooms are small, but clean, with white walls and spotless toilet facilities. One . Yelp reviewer wrote: 'The place is a total dump.

"When she found herself suffering from anxiety attacks brought on by the menopause, Mariella Frostrup was relieved to learn they could be treated. She was rather less happy, however, when her insurer refused to pay â on the grounds that menopause-related ailments are considered ânaturalâ. Now the presenter, 52, has accused AXA PPP of ageism and sexism after it declined to fund her treatment despite the fact she forks out Â£400 a month to cover her family against medical problems. Miss Frostrup, who also suffers from insomnia, said she cannot turn to the NHS as it does not offer the combination of treatments she requires â leaving her âcaught between a rock and a hard placeâ. Mariella Frostrup, 52, suffers from anxiety attacks due to the menopause. While there is medication available to help, she has been told her health insurer won't cover 'anything to do with the menopause' Speaking to a gathering of advertising experts, she said: âI am going to tell you something very intimate. âLike a lot of people my age, I had been suffering from sleeplessness and strange anxiety about things like the Ocado shopping list â stuff that really doesnât matter in the great scheme of things. I wake at 2am and think: âDid I put carrots on the list?ââ Miss Frostrup, who presents BBC Radio 4âs Open Book and is an editor of High50 magazine for older people, said her GP recommended she see a âbrilliant gynaecologistâ specialising in the menopause. But before having an appointment, she had to ask AXA PPP for âpre-authorisationâ to make sure it would pay for the treatment. She said: âThe girl who answered the phone went away, came back around three minutes later and said âhas anyone mentioned early menopause to you?â 'I said, âNo oneâs mentioned early menopause, but they have mentioned menopause, and it is something weâre looking into. Hence the reason I need the pre-authorisation for this appointmentâ. âAnd she said, âSorry, we donât cover anything to do with the menopauseâ.â The presenter claimed she was told this is because the menopause is ânaturalâ. But she said she could not find the clause in the small-print of her insurance booklet. âI would say the majority of ailments are natural,â she said. âThere are so many side effects of menopause, and it affects different women differently, so the insurers can use this as a blanket ban.â Miss Frostrup requires a personally tailored combination of adrenal stimulants, sleep and anxiety medications, and diet supplements administered by a specialist â which is not available on the NHS. Miss Frostrup says she was told by the call handler at AXA PPP Healthcare that because the menopause is 'natural' the company will not cover any treatments (image posed by model) She added: âThe NHS solution is hormone replacement therapy patches, which is a blunt mallet, so women are stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. âThe woman on the phone agreed it would be better if my symptoms were a mental health issue as they could cover that. Clearly madness is more palatable to them than menopause. âI have had a health insurance policy for 32 years. To discover that at the point when, for the first time in your life, you may want a little bit of help with your medical situation they point blank refuse is extraordinary. âFor me, it was a moment of clarification in terms of ageism in society, in terms of attitudes to women in society, in terms of attitudes of companies to women. 'They think we are so powerless we canât respond to a situation like that.â Miss Frostrup was speaking at the launch of new research by communications agency JWT. It found 65 per cent of over-50s felt ignored by the fashion industry. She criticised the use of younger fashion models, saying it had made her daughter Molly, ten, insecure about her body. âWe live in a world where everything is soft focus â make everyone look beautiful, make them look like theyâre 12 years old,â she said. âItâs bad for everybody.â An AXA PPP spokesman said: âWe have started an investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further until we have completed it.â","Radio presenter suffers from anxiety attacks linked to the menopause .

"An 11-year-old Mexican boy with a massive tumor, who drew international attention when U.S. officials helped him get treatment in New Mexico, is still recovering after the 11-hour surgery. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez visited Jose Antonio Ramirez Serrano on Monday, a week after the Ciudad Juarez-born boy underwent the risky procedure in Albuquerque. Doctors had to remove the multiple cysts, spongy-soft tissue and a conglomeration of blood vessels from his shoulder and neck. Scroll down for video . Jose Antonio Ramirez Serrano (pictured) is recovering a week after an 11-hour surgery to remove a large portion of a massive tumor on his shoulder and neck . Around a third of the watermelon-sized tumor was expunged and the boy now faces months of physical therapy, according to doctors at University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. 'In the operating room, we encountered more bleeding than expected,' said Pediatric Surgeon Cynthia Reyes, who led the surgery team. But Reyes said the team was able to get the bleeding under control and the 97-pound boy is recovering in an intensive care unit. 'He's had an amazing attitude during the whole thing,' said Jimmy Windsor, director of Pediatric Cardiac Anesthesia at the hospital. In July 2012, U.S. Homeland Security Investigations assisted in picking up the boy and his parents from a neighborhood in Ciudad Juarez â one of the deadliest cities in the world due to drug cartels. Jose Antonio Ramirez pictured with the tumor before surgery at his favorite restaurant . Federal agents helped the family seek care for Jose after First Baptist Church of Rio Rancho members saw him during a missionary visit. After stories and images of the boy went viral, First Baptist Church officials reported a jump in donations to help him raise money for the surgeries. Martinez then got involved and sought an extended visa for the boy to receive treatment in New Mexico. During her visit with Jose on Monday, the Republican governor softly touched the boy's knee as she spoke to his parents in Spanish. She asked about his condition and asked his parents to keep her updated. Though unconscious, Jose's heart rate rose slightly when told that the governor had stopped by to visit. 'He knows you are here,' his mother told the governor.

"EU 'enthusiast': David Cameron . David Cameron was branded an EU âenthusiastâ by Tory Eurosceptics last night as he said Britain must let eurozone countries move towards a United States of Europe with a common economic policy. The Prime Minister admitted he was not sure whether Germany and other countries had the political will to prevent a break-up of the single currency, but insisted they must be allowed to try â even if that meant closer integration. The tumult on global financial markets intensified yesterday ahead of a crunch ruling by the German constitutional court on the legality of bailouts for debt-crippled nations. Mr Cameron, appearing before MPs, repeated his pledge that Britain would never join the euro while he is in charge. But he and the Chancellor have reversed decades of opposition to a two-speed Europe, in which Britain and others would stand apart from a closer-knit inner core of nations. George Osborne yesterday urged governments in the single currency nations to follow the âremorseless logicâ of further financial fusion. But he suggested there was âno immediate prospect of major treaty renegotiationâ that would allow Britain to try to claw back some powers already transferred to Brussels. In the zone: The PM said he wasn't sure if European countries had the political will to prevent a break-up of the single currency, but insisted they must be allowed to try - even if that meant closer integration . Do you want to see a United States of Europe? Do you want to see a United States of Europe? Now share your opinion . âThe Chancellor and I have both said that . the logic of monetary union is a greater fiscal union and we see the . eurozone countries moving in that direction,â Mr Cameron said. âI donât . think we should stand in the way of them making some progress.â Eurosceptics insist Britain must demand concessions and exemptions from the union in exchange for standing back. Mr Cameron, appearing before the liaison . committee of senior MPs, suggested that opportunity might come further . in the future if a new treaty is deemed necessary. He raised the . possibility of seeking to extract the UK from limits on working hours. Bill Cash, the Eurosceptic Tory MP who chairs the Commons European scrutiny committee, told the Prime Minister that while he had âcertain reservationsâ about the EU, it was clear that he was âactually rather an enthusiastâ for keeping the union together through integration. Mr Cameron insisted he was a âpractical Euroscepticâ â but warned of economic disaster for Britain if the euro is allowed to collapse. He also rejected calls for either an âin-outâ referendum on membership of the EU, or one on integration. âTo say you have to have a referendum in Britain about something other countries are doing, and going ahead with anyway, I think would be rather an odd approach,â he said. Today, Germanyâs constitutional court is due to decide whether the countryâs participation in the rescue of Greece, Ireland and Portugal with huge EU bailouts breached its laws. Economists and politicians bringing the legal case argue the government was required to vote in its parliament beforehand. 'Plotting': Steve Hilton secretly hired a top QC . One of David Cameronâs closest aides was branded a ârenegadeâ yesterday for plotting a legal challenge to new EU employment laws behind the Prime Ministerâs back. Sources have made it clear that Mr Cameron will not try to block rights for temporary workers which were agreed by Labour and must now be enforced by the Coalition. But yesterday it emerged that his strategy chief, Steve Hilton, secretly hired a top QC to explore whether the regulations could be challenged or watered down. The Prime Minister is understood to have been frustrated earlier this year that Business Secretary Vince Cable failed to halt a tide of legislation from Brussels which will hit struggling businesses. The regulations are due to come into force in October, and will entitle Britainâs 1.3million temporary staff to the same salaries, holidays and overtime pay asÂ  permanent workers after 12 weeks in the job. Mr Hilton is said to have concluded the Government could simply defy the EU directive â but Downing Street sources say it will go ahead. A Liberal Democrat source said: âHilton is just a renegade.â","Prime Minister repeats pledge that Britain will not join euro while he is in charge .

"A gay couple who wed earlier this month on a Maryland airfield after more than 20 years together have secured a legal victory which means their marriage is recognized in their home state of Ohio. The decision by federal judge Timothy Black to grant John Arthur and his husband Jim Obergefell a temporary restraining order against the 2004 Ohio law banning recognition of their marriage came despite a warning from the state's attorney general that it could contribute to a broad rewriting of Ohio law in favor of such unions, which are currently banned in the state. The victory has added significance for the couple because Arthur is expected to die soon from Lou Gehrig's disease and the decision means his death certificate will show that he was married and that James Obergefell is his surviving spouse. Just married: John Arthur (right), who suffers from ALS, grins alongside his partner of 20 years, Jim Obergefell, just moments after they married aboard a plane in Maryland earlier this month . The ruling also means the pair can be buried next to each other in Arthur's family plot, located at a cemetery that only allows descendants and spouses. The couple filed a lawsuit on Friday against Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Attorney General Mike DeWine and a Cincinnati official responsible for filing death certificates which stated that âthey very much want the world to officially remember and record their union as a married coupleâ. Though Black's order was specific to the couple's case, opponents of Ohio's ban on gay marriage were encouraged by it. âThis is one more step toward marriage equality in the state of Ohio,â said the couple's attorney, Al Gerhardstein, who said he's gotten calls from other same-sex couples who married in other states and are exploring their options to have their marriage recognized in Ohio. Only Jim Obergefell was in court last Friday to file the lawsuit as his husband John Arthur is seriously ill and close to death . He said that when he told Arthur and Obergefell about Monday's ruling, they were overjoyed. âThis is more than just a legal form,â Gerhardstein said. âIt's the state where these men have built their lives, the city where they built their lives, finally turning to them and saying, âYes, we do recognize that you're a couple as much as any opposite-sex couple and that your life and now your death will be honored in a way that other married couples would be treated.ââ The couple, determined to marry before Arthur died, flew in a special jet with medical equipment to Maryland, which recognizes gay marriage. They wed July 11 inside the plane on an airport tarmac before returning to Cincinnati the same day, according to court records. In his ruling, Black said that historically, Ohio law has recognized out-of-state marriages as valid as long as they were legal where they took place, pointing to marriages between cousins and involving minors. âHow then can Ohio, especially given the historical status of Ohio law, single out same-sex marriages as ones it will not recognize?â Black wrote. âThe short answer is that Ohio cannot.â The ruling means the couple can be buried next to each other in Arthur's, left, family plot, located at a cemetery that only allows descendants and spouses . DeWine's spokesman, Dan Tierney, said in a statement that âthis is a temporary ruling at a preliminary stage under sad circumstances.â He said DeWine's office will defend the right of Ohioans to define marriage and that the U.S. Supreme Court has recently emphasized that it is a definition that traditionally lies with states. âOhio's voters are entitled to the choice they have made on this fundamental issue,â he said. Kasich spokesman Robert Nichols said in a statement that the office doesn't comment on pending litigation, âother than to say that the governor believes that marriage is between a man and a woman.â Black wrote that the couple would experience irreparable harm without his timely ruling. âThe uncertainty around this issue during Mr. Arthur's final illness is the cause of extreme emotional hardship to the couple,â Black wrote. âDying with an incorrect death certificate that prohibits Mr. Arthur from being buried with dignity constitutes irreparable harm.â Together: The couple, pictured with Arthur's aunt - who married them - decided to exchange vows after the Defense of Marriage Act was defeated by the Supreme Court but could still not do it in Ohio . In an emotional ceremony, John Arthur married Jim Obergefell from his stretcher earlier this month - just two weeks after the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. 'I'm overjoyed,' Arthur told The Cincinnati Enquirer after the ceremony. 'I'm very . proud to be an American and be able to openly share my love for the . record. I feel like the luckiest guy in the world.' When faced with where to go, their options were limited due to Arthur's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - or ALS - a . progressive neurological disease that affects patients' speech and movement, and eventually their breathing. He is bedridden and had not left their home since March. They decided to marry in Maryland as only one . partner had to go for the license before both went for the wedding. Arthur knew he would be unable to make the journey twice. They chartered a small medical plane which cost $12,700 to rent with the help of generous donations from relatives and friends - and people they barely knew. Obergefell flew to Baltimore before the ceremony to obtain the marriage license and flew back just two days later with Arthur so their lengthy relationship could finally be legally recognized. Strong: A sticker on the back of their van shows Arthur who is confined to a wheelchair due to his ALS . John . Arthur suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or . Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player who had the illness. In . sufferers of the disease, nerve cells waste away or die, which leads to . muscle weakening, twitching and an inability to move limbs. The condition means it is impossible to carry out day-to-day tasks such as walking or swallowing. As . the condition worsens, the muscles in the chest area stop working and . it becomes hard for the sufferer to breathe on their own. The disease in incurable and 90 per cent of sufferers die within three to five years of their diagnosis. The condition affects around five in 100,000 people worldwide. After the 90-minute flight, they arrived in Baltimore with a nurse, two pilots and Arthur's aunt, Paulette Roberts, who had been ordained to marry the two men. Remaining inside the plane, they listened to Roberts speak as they gripped hands. 'Twenty-six months ago John was diagnosed with ALS,' she said. 'Since then the amazing relationship between John and Jim has become even closer, even more devoted, even more loving - and it was pretty damn great before John became ill.' After the seven-and-a-half minute ceremony was finished, they drank Champagne and headed back to Cincinnati, finally legally recognized as married - although they had felt they were for years. 'In our minds we've always been married, . but now I can actually say John's my husband and have a piece of paper, . and a Supreme Court ruling, and a federal government that says yes, he . is your husband,' Obergefell told the Enquirer. 'I'm overjoyed that weâll now have a . piece of paper that confirms what we've always known in our hearts - . that we're an old, married couple who still love each other.' The . couple met twice through a friend in 1992 before meeting again at a New . Year's Eve party and experiencing 'love at third sight'. Within weeks, they had swapped rings and months later they moved in together. Wedding venue: They stayed inside the plane and married on the tarmac at Signature Flight Support at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport . Just over two years ago, Arthur felt his . left leg dragging during a trip to Finland, and when he returned to the . U.S., he was promptly diagnosed with ALS. His . condition has worsened and is no longer able to walk. There is no cure . for the illness, which eventually affects breathing and claims the . sufferer's life within two to five years after diagnosis. With . the onset of Arthur's illness, the couple felt the weight of not being . able to marry; some employers did not allow them to share a health . insurance policy, and they had to prepare powers of attorney, which they . would not need had they been able to marry. They also sold their home and put their new one in Obergefell's name to avoid future problems. Although their exact rights have not yet been defined, when DOMA was defeated they knew it was time to get married - and devised their plan. 'Had the Supreme Court made this decision one year ago, this would've been as simple as us taking a trip because I could still walk,' Arthur said ahead of the marriage. 'It's the progression for me of the ALS, it's just compounded everything. I don't live in a world of regret but I sure wish we were a year in the past.' Next year, residents of Ohio will most likely be able to vote on whether to repeal the 2004 ban on gay marriage.","John Arthur and Jim Obergefell, both 47, married earlier this month after DOMA was struck down by the Supreme Court .

His death certificate will now show he was married and that husband Obergefell is his surviving spouse .
The pair will also be able to be buried next to each other in Arthur's family plot - which only allowed for spouses to be buried there ."
"Violet has vanished again. Take your eyes off her for a second and sheâs darted behind a table or started to climb up the sofa. Her brother, Viking, is sleeping peacefully, but Victor, the third little bundle of fluff, is having none of it. He pounces on Vikingâs legs, beseeching him to come and play. This charming scene is being played out at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home in London, where these three 12-week-old kittens, with their gorgeous olive eyes, sleek black coats (Violet less so, perhaps â she looks as if sheâs plugged herself into an electric socket) and inquisitive natures are waiting to be rehomed. Scroll down for video . Playing for time: 12-week old Violet was brought into Battersea Cats' Home last week as part of a little of five . Unwanted: Victor (left) and Viking (right) were part of the same litter. Their owner managed to find new homes for their other siblings, a ginger and a tabby, but they were left behind . Except theyâll wait. And theyâll wait. For despite their tender age, these innocent creatures have already committed what equates to a cardinal sin when it comes to finding a new home: theyâve been born with black fur. Sadly, people just donât want black cats â no matter how cute. The RSPCA revealed this week that 70 per cent of more than 1,000 cats in care in Britain are black, or black and white. The problem has got so bad itâs been dubbed âBlack Cat Syndromeâ. The charity claims that black catsâ diminishing popularity is down to our modern obsession with photographing our lives and putting the snaps on social networking sites â the âselfieâ phenomenon. It seems black cats donât photograph well, so would-be pet owners are opting for more photogenic colours. While this may be something of an overstatement, our preoccupation with image is certainly behind the worrying trend that is seeing so many black cats abandoned. Pick me! Marley found himself taken to Blue Cross Lewknor, Oxon, because he was being bullied by other cats in his old home. Now he's a confident and friendly little chap, who loves to explore . I need love: Zedd, nine (left), has been at Battersea for a month. He's timid and gentle, but no one has given him and his sister Cara a second glance. Missy (right) and her kittens were taken in by Cats Protection Hereford. The kittens are gone - but not playful Missy . Fluffy stuff: Brothers Matty (left) and Rupert (right), now 15 weeks old, have been left behind at the Guilford branch of Cats Protection while their tortoiseshell sister and ginger brother have gone to new homes . âThe problem for black cats is that theyâre a bit too plain compared to the many other interesting colours available,â says Steve Crow, chairman of the governing council of the Cat Fancy, the UKâs premier cat registration body. âBlack cats are seen as just too dull.â Consequently, animal shelters get potential adopters refusing even to look at them. Others dump them, complaining they âdonât match the furnitureâ, theyâve âjustâ discovered theyâre not allowed to keep animals in their home or that theyâll âfrighten the childrenâ.

But those cats are the lucky ones. Other black cats have been thrown off balconies or shot with air rifles. Earlier this week, nine black kittens were found dumped near a football stadium in Oxfordshire â starving, soaking wet and crawling with fleas. Two have since died. At Battersea, black cats spend longer at the shelter â 34 days compared to the average 25 â while they wait for a new home. âAbout one in five people who come in say: âI donât want to see any black cats,â â says Lindsey Quinlan, head of the centreâs cattery. âItâs frustrating, because it shouldnât be about what a cat looks like. What really matters is the chemistry it has with the owner.â Cats Protection, the UKâs biggest cat charity, has even launched National Black Cat Day in an attempt to convince people that sleek black felines can be as cute as other varieties. Staff at Battersea believe Violet, Viking and Victor, who were brought in last week, would already have found their âfor ever homesâ if theyâd been a different colour. Doubly cuddly: Brothers Nutkins (left) and Ricky (right) were dumped at Blue Cross in Cambridge and are two months old. They are very sociable and would be good for a family with children . No takers: Quattro (left), now a lively six months old, was part of an unwanted litter. His owner failed to sell him online, so she's left him in care at Battersea. Poor Ziggey (right), who is at Blue Cross in Torbay, lost an eye in a car crash five years ago. Potential adopters seem put off by his appearance . Their mother had five kittens: one tabby, one ginger and the three black ones. âThe owner tried to sell them online: two went, but the black ones didnât, so she brought them to us,â says Lindsey. âThatâs quite common. Black kittens are the least desirable â you canât give them away.â The most sought-after colour at Battersea is grey, followed by tabby or ginger. While cattery staff keep a âlook-out listâ of what types of feline adopters are searching for, black cats are rarely requested. âThey tell us a black cat would look too much like their neighbourâs pet,â says Lindsey. âOne person said, âIâm worried Iâll trip over it in the night,â and people still bring up the superstition that black cats are unlucky.â Of course, black cats didnât always have an image problem. The Ancient Egyptians adored the species, and sailors traditionally venerated black cats because they were thought to bring good luck to the ship. No one knows how many black cats there are in Britain or what percentage of the cat population they make up â but theyâre certainly over-represented in animal shelters. The Blue Cross, which runs four animal hospitals and 12 rehoming centres across the country, has seen a 65 per cent rise in the number of black cats needing new homes in recent years. In 2007, 540 were brought through their doors, while last year it was 895. Already this year theyâve helped 506.Â They, too, blame our modern obsession with looks and creating attention-grabbing photographs for social media. âBlack cats have always been trickier to photograph, and this may have made them less popular with the selfie generation,â says Mandy Jones, head of rehoming services. As with Battersea, so Blue Crossâs darker charges spend a lot longer waiting for a home: on average, 40 per cent longer. Esme, 13, has spent even longer than that â a staggering 300 days in a Cumbria shelter. If she were a different colour, it would have been nearer 35 days. Lovely 17-year-old Molly has been languishing at the Lewknor centre in Oxfordshire, for two months, ever since her owner died. Lost soul: Sarah was an abandoned kitten found wandering around a local garden and sent to Battersea. She's only a year old and would certainly make someone a loving and friendly pet. Purdy (right) is a serene, nine-year-old cat who just longs to live with a young family. Unlike many cats, she loves being with children. She's been patiently waiting at Battersea for three weeks . Appealing: Part of an unwanted litter taken to Millwood Cat Rescue in Nottinghamshire six weeks ago, this 12-week-old female (left) doesn't have a name yet, but the inquisitive little girl is desperate to be cared for. Tinks, three (right), was abandoned at Blue Cross in Lewknor, Oxon, and has been there of seven months. All he wants is a loving home . Of course, she is elderly, too â something which also counts against her. Some cats donât just spend months waiting for a new home, but years. Brother and sister Kai and Esme were timid strays when they were brought into the Celia Hammond centre outside Hastings, East Sussex, as six-month-olds. Now, four years on, theyâve blossomed into delightful, playful creatures to be adopted together, but no one wants them because of their dark colour. The prejudice against black cats is particularly silly, says Hayley Plows, who works for the RSPCA in London, because they often make far more affectionate pets than other colours, so potential homers are missing out. âSo many times, our black cats have been overlooked purely because of their colour, even when theyâve done everything they can to win over the adopter,â she says. âBlack cats, in our experience, are often the ones that have been the worst sufferers of abuse and neglect. Yet some of the nicest cats here have had the hardest start in life.â The RSPCAâs roll call of abused black cats is as heart-breaking as it is long. Thereâs 15-week-old Molly and Polly, best friends left starving in a cat carrier in a bush in Central London; ten-week-old Dappy and Dora, who were thrown off a third-floor balcony together; and nine-month-old Helga, who was found minus an eye â possibly because of an air gun pellet. Meanwhile, 14-week-old Natalie was abandoned in a park in a box. âShe loves her tummy being stroked and under her chin, too,â says a member of staff. âShe just loves to be fussed over.â Sadly, a charming personality isnât enough to win over potential owners who have decided they definitely donât want a black cat for aesthetic reasons. All deserve the chance of a better life â if only someone would give them a chance.","Around 70 per cent of cats in care are either black or black and white .

"A once-a-day tablet that harnesses a chemical found in pine cones shows great promise in both preventing and slowing the progress of Alzheimer's disease. The drug, known as NIC5-15, has been shown in animal studies to be effective in preventing the formation of amyloid plaques. These are believed to coat the brain cells stopping them from working effectively. A chemical compound found in pine cones could slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease in the brain . The degenerative disease is the most common form of dementia and affects more than 300,000 people in the UK. Early symptoms include minor memory problems and forgetting the right words. Later symptoms include severe confusion and dramatic changes of personality. A sufferer can also experience delusions. It is estimated that it affects on in 14 people over the age of 65. It can be inherited in some cases. The company Humanetics Corporation, which developed the drug alongside researchers from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, have already completed a number of early clinical trials on healthy volunteers, which have shown it to be safe. An artificial ingredient that gives popcorn a buttery flavour has been linked to a key Alzheimerâs brain process. Researchers from the University of Minnesota tested the effect of the ingredient diacetyl (DA) in a lab at exposure levels common in food factories. They found DA increased the level of amyloid clumping - a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. It also easily penetrated the 'blood-brain- barrier', which keeps many harmful substances from entering the brain. The team, led by Robert Vince,Â  said considering how exposed industry workers were to DA 'this study raises the troubling possibility of long-term neurological toxicity.' They are now recruiting a few hundred sufferers in New York for the next stage that will test the optimum dose at which the drug will work with the minimum side-effects. NIC5-15 is  a natural chemical compound found in fruits such as grape seeds as well as pine cones. Current Alzheimer's treatments treat the symptoms of the disease, such as memory loss and mood swings, but do not stop it from progressing. Ronald Zenk, President and CEO of Humanetics, said: 'There is an urgent need . for safe and effective disease modifying agents to lessen the . debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. We are hopeful that . NIC5-15 will satisfy that need.' It is estimated that it affects on in 14 people over the age of 65. It can be inherited in some cases. Author Terry Pratchett is a high profile person with the disease. The condition is caused by parts of the brain wasting away, particularly in the cerebral cortex. As the grey matter wastes away, clumps of protein, known as âplaquesâ and âtanglesâ, start to form . in the brain. The plaques and tangles start to destroy even more brain cells. The . disease can shorten life-expectancy as sufferers can lose interest in . eating and maintaining personal hygiene, leading to other illnesses. Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimerâs Research UK, said:'With over half a million people in the UK living with Alzheimerâs, there is a desperate need for effective treatments. Whereas current drugs only act to relieve symptoms, this drug aims to slow or stop the underlying disease. This would be a huge step forward, but we will only know whether the drug has real benefits for Alzheimerâs after it has been rigorously tested in clinical trials.'",Compound found to prevent formation of plaques that stop brain cells from working effectively in Alzheimer's patients .
"It is the day to put fathers first, the day to tell your dad what he means to you. But for the O'Bryne siblings, like thousands across the country, their dad is missing. Paul O'Bryne lost his battle with a rare form of bone cancer five years ago, but his four children are determined to dedicate this Father's Day to him. Each year as the poignant date arrives, Laura, Katie, Luke and Frankie joined by their mother Daniela put on their running shoes and take part in charity runs in honour of the chartered accountant. Laura O'Byrne, her sister and two brothers are taking part in a charity run this Father's Day in memory of the father, Paul O'Byrne they lost to a rare form of bone cancer. On their last Father's Day together Laura and her father took part in a 10k charity run (pictured) Mr O'Byrne, pictured with his daughter Katie, was diagnosed with the rare bone cancer Ewing's Sarcoma in April 2007. He lost his battle 18 months later in November 2008 . Mr O'Byrne's four children, Frankie, 21, Katie, 28, his widow Daniela, Laura, 29 and Luke 26, have raised nearly Â£10,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support in the five years since his death . To date they have raised a staggering Â£9,500 in his memory, donating the funds to Macmillan Cancer Support, the charity who supported the family through their ordeal. This Father's Day the charity is encouraging people to tweet a picture of their father with three words to describe him. But for Laura O'Bryne summing her father up in three words is almost impossible. 'My dad was a character,' she said. 'He could juggle and use a unicycle, . loved a fry-up with chips and listening to the Eagles but mostly he also . loved running and competed in triathlons. 'Dad was unique, he was incredibly generous, very witty and always had time for people. 'He was quite bold, and liked to do things a bit differently. He was a real family man. 'He . encouraged me to be sporty and he doted on my mum Daniela, 55, . me, my sister Katie, 28, and brothers Luke, 26, and Frankie, 21.' In April 2007, after suffering back pain, Mr O'Byrne was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer - Ewing's Sarcoma, a type of bone cancer. Despite doctors telling the family, his cancer was terminal, the father-of-four was determined to live life to the full. Avid runner Mr O'Byrne, pictured with his family, was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma in April 2007. He had been suffering back pain, prompting him to go and see a doctor . On Father's Day in 2008, just months before he died, My O'Byrne (left) and his daughter Laura took part in a 10k race to raise money for charity. Each year since his death, they have hung their medals on his grave (right) Ewing's sarcoma is a primary bone cancer, which starts in the bone. Bone cancers are rare with only around 530 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. The most common bones affected are the pelvis, thigh (femur) and shins (tibia). This sarcoma is most commonly diagnosed in teenagers and young adults but in rare cases can be seen in older people. It is slightly more common in males than females. Ewing's Sarcoma - named after the scientist who first described the tumour in the 1920s - can also affect the soft tissues, happening in around one in 10 cases. The exact causes of bone cancer are unknown, but experts believe Ewing's Sarcoma could be related to rapid bone growth, explaining the high prevalence of cases in teenagers. Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer, though symptoms will vary depending on the position of the cancer in the body and its size. There may be some swelling in the affected area and it may become tender to touch. Primary bone cancer is often detected when a bone that has been weakened by the disease breaks after a minor fall or accident. Patients diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma are treated at specialist hospitals because the cancer is so rare. A combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy is commonly used to target the tumour. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . In September 2008, months before the disease claimed his life, Mr O'Bryne took the decision to stop treatment. 'Dad was having aggressive chemotherapy treatment for about aÂ  year,' said Miss O'Bryne. 'In around April 2008 he had a scheduled break before starting maintenance chemo afterwards. 'His tumours had shrunk hugely, so the chemo had been working. 'But we always knew it was going to be terminal. 'Over the year he was having the aggressive chemo, it was really difficult on him but also on my mum and the rest of the family. 'Despite everything he was always so upbeat, from the point he was diagnosed he was really determined to make the most of it. 'As . his tumours shrunk and he came off the aggressive treatment he had a . couple of months where he was actually well. It was odd, but amazing at . the same time. 'He wasn't really on any treatment and that was when my dad and I decided to do our first run together. 'Dad . and I had always run together, it was our thing. 'My sister played . football and we would often drop her off at the match and then go for a . run together. 'For . Father's Day that year we entered a 10k run to raise money for Cancer . Backup. We had a really lovely day, I have wonderful memories of the . run. 'It was more a jog and a chat rather than running in earnest. 'It was an amazing day, very emotional, and the last time weâd ever race together.' As the summer progressed Mr O'Byrne's tumours began to grow again, not tamed by the maintenance levels of chemotherapy. Mr O'Byrne lost his battle with the disease in November 2008, just 18 months after he was diagnosed. His family said they received a huge amount of support from Macmillan, praising Mr O'Byrne's Macmillan nurse Eileen Hogan who nursed him at home in his last few weeks . Under . the care of the Royal Marsden Hospital, he was entered on to a drugs . trial. But after completing two cycles of the test drug, it became clear . the medication was not working. It was then, in August 2008, that Mr O'Bryne, took the decision to stop treatment. His daughter said: 'It was difficult, and it wasn't. He was deteriorating so quickly before our eyes. 'It . was clear the new drug wasn't working and we had had 18 months to get . used to the idea that dad was dying. 'Dad was unique, he was incredibly generous, very witty and always had time for people' - Laura O'Byrne . 'That sounds terrible, but his . prognosis was never good and we were really grateful he had that period . of good health that we were able to enjoy together as a family. 'It was really hard but almost immediately Macmillan were there to help. A nurse came to visit the next day, she was brilliant, she was great with all the family and quickly got the measure of dad. 'She was open and honest with us all, something dad really appreciated. 'Thank God for Eileen Hogan who nursed him in the last six weeks of his life and helped him to die at home. 'As a family we obviously found it incredibly difficult. Katie and I moved home so we were all together as a family. 'We felt well equipped to deal with what was happening and to keep him at home, something he was adamant he wanted.' Mr O'Byrne passed away at the family's North London home in November 2008. Knowing Father's Day without their dad . would be tough, the family decided to do something positive in his . memory, carrying on his love of running. They all signed up to run in memory of Mr O'Byrne on Father's Day in 2010. Laura O'Byrne said: 'Dad was unique, he was incredibly generous, very witty and always had time for people. He was quite bold, and liked to do things a bit differently. He was a real family man' 'It was very emotional and we ran with pictures of Dad on our back. It was particularly tough for Mum who isnât sporty,' said Laura. 'Afterwards, . we went to Dadâs grave where we hung our medals on it. It felt like he . was looking down on us and wouldâve been proud.' This is the fifth year raising money for the cancer charity, having raised nearly Â£10,000 to date. 'It is a brilliant legacy to dad,' added Laura. 'He would've loved to see us all out running together and know that so many people have donated in his memory. His daughter Laura, said: 'Right from the very start we had a huge amount of support from Macmillan and the charity, Cancer Backup, which is now a part of Macmillan. 'They were there with advice, support, how to break it to your family. Dad always wanted to know everything and be in control of his disease as much as possible.' - Laura is supporting #thatsmydad for Macmillan Cancer Support. - Tweet a picture of your father with three words that describe him to @macmillancancer using #thatsmydad and text DAD to 70550 to give Â£3 so no father faces cancer alone.","Runner Paul O'Byrne never suspected his back pain was anything more than an injury - but doctors revealed it was a symptom of Ewing's Sarcoma .

Colleagues at the Spire Wirral Hospital in Merseyside said Dr Somdutt Prasad looked like he 'had been out partying until 6am' when he stopped the cataract operation, leaving his patient with a bleeding eye. The surgeon later went to a business meeting where he startled colleagues by giggling and slumping forward, before a blood test revealed he was three times over the legal alcohol limit for driving. Somdutt Prasad was suspended for six months after he performed a cataract operation at Spire Wirral Hospital in Merseyside after drinking alcohol, and he later turned up to a hospital meeting after drinking . Prasad, 50, was suspended for six months after a panel of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) found he presented a 'real risk of harm to patients.' The panel found he had been under the influence of alcohol on 28 June 2012 after a scrub nurse said he seemed to be intoxicated. âShe said said that if Mr Prasad had been a younger man, she might have described his demeanor that day as being as if he had partied til 6 am and then come to work,â MPTS panel chairman Neil Sykes said. At the time colleagues said they could smell alcohol on Prasad's breath but the doctor claimed he had only been drinking the night before. The doctor, who also worked at the NHS Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, agreed to absent himself from work a few days after the incident. But on 18 October 2012 he went to St Georgeâs Medical Centre, Wirral, for a business meeting before his regular out-patient clinic. Two doctors at the meeting had to be escorted away after Prasad started to âtalk in a bizarre manner, was giggling and slumped forwardâ, the tribunal heard. Colleagues smelt alcohol and a blood test revealed he was three times the legal limit for driving. Prasad was seen as a 'risk of harm' to his patients . The panel found professionals at the meeting would have found Prasad's conduct 'deplorable' and said his actions undermined the profession. Just two weeks later the talented eye surgeon was banned from the road after he was found guilty of drink driving a second time. Mr Sykes said: 'The panel took the view that it was self-evident that the public expects that doctors will not work whilst under the influence of alcohol. âIt noted that, on these two occasions, there was no evidence of actual harm to patients. âHowever, the panel considered that there was a very real risk of harm to patients. âIn working whilst under the influence of alcohol, Mr Prasad ignored the potential harm his actions could cause to patients as well as to his colleagues, the Spire Hospital and St Georgeâs. âThe panel took the view that because Mr Prasad was unable to perform his duties as a surgeon at the Spire Hospital that day owing to being under the influence of alcohol, his conduct fell well below the standards expected of a medical professional. âHis actions undermined the reputation of the profession.' Prasad also has two convictions for drink driving. The tribunal heard he had been found asleep in his car with the engine running with a three-quarter empty litre bottle of vodka in the footwell in December 2012. He had earlier been seen swigging from a bottle at the traffic lights near junction four of the M53 motorway. Prasad had to stop the operation at the Spire Wirral Hospital because he could not focus the microscope . Prasad also worked at Arrowe Park Hospital but has been suspended from the profession for 6 months . Prasad was jailed for six weeks and banned from the roads for four years in December 2013 for failing to provide a breath specimen, at Wirral Magistratesâ Court. Merseyside Police had informed the General Medical Council that the doctor had been charged with the offence and summonsed over an earlier drink-driving incident. He was caught more than twice over the legal limit after crashing head-on into a car carrying a retired couple while on the wrong side of the road on 13 July 2012. The crash happened about two weeks after he was found working under the influence of alcohol at the hospital. Prasad, who was not present at the hearing, told the panel he was 'ashamed' by his actions. The surgeon could have been struck off, but the panel said this was felt to be a 'disproportionate response' as he was a talented ophthalmic surgeon. He will have to attend a review hearing before he is allowed back to practice.","Dr Somdutt Prasad did a cataract operation while smelling of alcohol .

Daniel and Julien Sireau, aged 10 and 12, have black bone disease â also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU) â which will cause them to develop severe early-onset osteoarthritis unless a cure can be found. The genetic disease causes the bones, cartilage, urine and earwax to turn black. It also results in brittle bones and heart disease. Desperate to prevent his children suffering, in April this year he launched a clinical trial into a treatment he believes could stop their rare disease progressing.

"A squad of miniature chocolate Terracotta warriors wearing marzipan Santa hats is ready to wage sweet war this Christmas in China. The 300 warriors were crafted by bakers at Xi'an Shangri-La hotel in Xi'an city, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province. Made from 100kg of Belgian chocolate, the edible versions are modelled on the country's Terracotta Army, a set of life-size ancient Chinese army sculptures from 3rd century BC. Good enough to eat: Bakers at Xi'an Shangri-La hotel in Xi'an city, China, created miniature chocolate models of the country's iconic Terracotta Army sculptures from 3rd century BC . The idea to combine a traditional Christmas symbol in the form of a Santa hat with the image of a Chinese Terracotta warrior formed from chocolate has proved a real hit for the upcoming festival. The chocolate army took bakers ten days to create and was on display at the hotel. It has proved so successful that confectioners all over the country have made their own versions. With less than one percent of the country Christian, Christmas is not a public holiday in China. But in recent years it has become a massive commercial success with Christmas gifts proving hugely popular with local consumers. The chocolate army took bakers ten days to create and was on display at the hotel. The idea has now been copied by confectioners all across China . Bakers used 100kg of Belgium chocolate to make 300 Terracotta Warriors. The hats are made from marzipan . The original Terracotta Warriors are clay sculptures that were buried with imperial rulers over 2,000 years ago. They were rediscovered in 1974 by farmers in Lintong District, in Xi'an in Shaanxi province. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest warriors representing the generals. The army also includes 8,000 warriors and 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses. The chocolate versions with Santa hats have not been welcomed by all with some Chinese social media users saying that they were a 'massive insult to Chinese people everywhere' But the chocolate versions with Santa hats have not been welcomed by all. After these images were posted on Chinese social media website Weibo, user LanWeiYu said: 'The Emperor would be turning in his grave if he knew what was happening with his funeral guard.' Another user added that the cheap commercialisation of one of the most spectacular parts of the country's heritage was a 'massive insult to Chinese people everywhere'. User LuBay said: 'Christmas here is only about making money, and this is one of the worst examples I've seen.' The confectioners however are continuing selling the Santa hat-wearing figures, which according to some users, not only look good but taste good as well.","Bakers in Xi'an City in northwest China'sÂ Shaanxi Province made the army .

"She parachuted behind Nazi lines and risked her life gathering vital information on enemy positions ahead of the D-Day landings. British spy Phyllis Latour Doyle, then 23, toured occupied Normandy by bicycle disguised as a 14-year-old French girl selling soap to German soldiers. But hidden on pieces of silk among the brave young womanâs knitting were the secret codes used by the slightly-built agent â codename Paulette â to send back her messages to Allied Command. For decades after the war Mrs Doyle, known as Pippa, kept her extraordinary past hidden too, only telling her children 15 years ago. Scroll down for video . French Ambassador to New Zealand Laurent Contini speaks to Phyllis (Pippa) Doyle before presenting her with France's highest honour award in Auckland on Tuesday . Mrs Doyle, 93,Â spied on German troops and risked her life to send 135 coded messages back to Britain during World War Two . But yesterday the modest heroine, now 93 and living in a rest home in New Zealand, made a rare foray into the spotlight of public acclaim as she was presented in Auckland with the Legion of Honour, Franceâs highest award for bravery. With a Parachute Regiment wings badge and honours including the MBE she was awarded after the war and Franceâs Croix de Guerre pinned to her cardigan, Mrs Doyle received the award from the French ambassador to New Zealand, Laurent Contini. âPippa stands out as a formidable example for younger and older generations alike,â he said. As part of its commemorations of the 70th anniversary of D-Day, France is recognising military veterans and civilians who fought in the Second World War. 'At the age of 21, she decided to join the resistance movement in a foreign country, held dangerous positions and undertook perilous missions to prepare the grounds for the allied troops to march on,' MrÂ Contini said . Mr Contini said that when mother-of-four Mrs Doyle, who moved to Auckland in the 1970s, was told of her award she was âsurprised that we have found her and said ââbut what did I do to merit that?âââ. What she did began when she joined the RAF to train as a flight mechanic in 1941 and the secret services spotted her potential. With an English mother and a French father, a doctor, she was fluent in French and was whisked away to be trained as one of the few women agents working for the Special Operations Executive. Reluctant: Mrs Doyle said that she spent years hiding her wartime actions and only told her children about her vital role in the liberation 15 years ago. They encouraged her to request her medals, pictured above . Spy: While living in France in 1944, Mrs Doyle was known by the codename Paulette . âI did it for revenge,â she told New Zealandâs Army News magazine in 2009, explaining that she joined SOE because her godmotherâs father was shot by the Germans and her godmother committed suicide after being imprisoned by them. As well as extensive physical fitness training, Mrs Doyle told in the rare interview how one of their instructors was âa cat burglar who had been taken out of prison to train usâ. She said: âWe learned how to get in a high window and down drainpipes, how to climb over roofs without being caught.â She first deployed in Aquitaine in Vichy France from 1942, then dropped into the Calvados area of Normandy on May 1, 1944, sleeping rough in forests or staying with Allied sympathisers. In total, she transmitted 135 secret messages to Britain via radio sets after linking up with the French Resistance. If she encountered the enemy she would âtalk so much about anything and everything trying to be ââhelpfulââ, and theyâd get sick of meâ. Mrs Doyle also told Army News how she once sent a message requesting a German listening post be taken out by bombers, but a German woman and two children died. âI heard I was responsible for their deaths. It was a horrible feeling,â she said. âI can imagine the bomber pilots patting each other on the back and offering congratulations after a strike. But they never saw the carnage that was left. I always saw it, and I donât think I will ever forget it.â After the war Mrs Doyle, who was born in South Africa, married an Australian engineer and lived for spells in Fiji and Australia before settling in New Zealand. Yesterday Mr Contini said Mrs Doyle âheld dangerous positions and undertook perilous missions to prepare the grounds for the Allied troops to march onâ and told of his âdeep admiration for her bravery and her unshakeable commitment to ending the warâ. Mrs Doyle, who was helped by two of her sons, said nothing publicly beyond remarking that it was a âprivilege and honourâ to receive the medal. Speaking to Army News in 2009, Mrs Doyle said that she joined the SEO 'for revenge'.Â She explained that her godmother committed suicide after being taken prisoner by the Nazis and that her father was shot by the Germans . Bill Henry Apiata, a New Zealand war hero who recieved the Victoria Cross for New Zealand in 2007, speaks to Mrs Doyle after she recieved her Knight of the national Order of the Legion of Honour award .

"Reindeer meat may be considered a delicacy in some countries, but 30,000 years ago our European ancestors preferred eating mammoths. Cuts of reindeer were instead saved for their canine companions, according to research at PÅedmostÃ­, a prehistoric site in the Czech Republic. The Gravettian people  used the bones of more than 1,000 mammoths to build their settlement, as well as creating incredible ivory sculptures. Scroll down for video . Researchers at University of TÃ¼bingen wanted to know whether the Gravettian culture harvested the bones from already dead mammoths, or if they hunted them for food. Artist's impression of a mammoth pictured . But researchers at the University of TÃ¼bingen wanted to know whether the Gravettian culture harvested the bones from already dead mammoths, or if they hunted them for food. Scientists carried out an analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in human and animal fossil bones from the site. They then tested to see whether the Gravettian people ate mammoth meat by examining the bones alongside bones from dogs at the site. Reindeer meat may be considered a delicacy in some countries, but 30,000 years ago our European ancestors preferred eating mammoths. Cuts of reindeer were instead saved for their canine companions, according to research at PÅedmostÃ­, a prehistoric site in the Czech Republic . Pictured is a Gravettian Upper Paleolithic Venus figure holding horn or cornucopia . Gravettian culture flourished 31,000 â 22,000 years ago in the European Upper Paleolithic era. The phase was characterised by a stone-tool industry with small pointed blades used for big-game hunting, such as bison, horse, reindeer and mammoth. It is divided into two regional groups: the western Gravettian, mostly known from cave sites in France, and the eastern Gravettian, with sites for mammoth hunters on the plains of central Europe and Russia. The culture appeared at a time when Neanderthals were being displaced by modern humans, who had entered Europe from Africa and the Middle East some 15,000 years before. During this process, Neanderthals retreated to the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. The Gravettian people are famous for the many Venus figurines they created, which are widely distributed in Europe. Another famous prehistoric discovery of this period are the hand stencils in Cosquer Cave close to Marseilles. They discovered that the culture probably left behind large amounts of mammoth carcasses as shown by the finding that brown bears, wolves and wolverines also ate mammoths. Surprisingly, dogs in the settlement did not show a high level of mammoth consumption, but rather consumed reindeer meat. Scientists believe reindeers were hunted by the Gravettian people for their antlers to make tools, and their meat was also a small part of their diet. The culture appeared at a time when Neanderthals were being displaced by modern humans, who had entered Europe from Africa and the Middle East some 15,000 years before. The study confirms that mammoths were a key component of the prehistoric diet in Europe 30,000 years ago, and that dogs were already being looked after by humans. Separate research has found that the sudden appearance of dwellings built from mammoth bones was due to humans hunting alongside the earliest domesticated dogs. In May, Pat Shipman of Penn State University took a fresh look at European archaeological sites built with mammoth bones. 'One of the greatest puzzles about these sites is how such large numbers of mammoths could have been killed with the weapons available during that time,' she said. Professor Shipman used information about how humans hunt with dogs to formulate a series of testable predictions about these mammoth sites. 'Dogs help hunters find prey faster and more often and dogs also can surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters move in. Both of these effects would increase hunting success,' she said. 'Large dogs like those identified by GermonprÃ© either can help carry the prey home or, by guarding the carcass from other carnivores, can make it possible for the hunters to camp at the kill sites.'

"Residents who live near the famous Hollywood sign have been accused of trying to stop tourists from reaching the spot by removing it off Google Maps. Although the Hollywood Sign is clearly visible on Google, once tourists keen to see the landmark asks for directions to it, they are led miles away. It has now emerged that the directions to the sign have been changed on Google Maps and other GPS services following residents complaints that the number of visitors had become a safety hazard. Wrong way: Directions to the famous Hollywood Sign have been changed on Google Maps and other GPS services following local residents complaints that the number of visitors had become a safety hazard . For several years, people living in Beachwood Canyon had a steady but manageable flow of tourists, but with the advent of GPS and smartphones, roads started becoming clogged with cars. Neighbors said the cars parked in the streets were not just a nuisance, but were blocking the narrow roads from access by emergency vehicles. Residents would demand tourists moved their vehicles and put up signs accusing them of trespassing. Following pressure from the residents, local council member Tom LaBonge made a deal with Google and GPS company Garmin to change the directions to the sign, Gizmodo reports. When asking Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing, or any search engine for directions to the Hollywood Sign, tourists are given directions to a number of lookout points, instead of to the physical sign. Hidden treasure: Location of the Hollywood sign is visible on Google Maps, and it is possible to deduce how to get there by looking at the map . However, once you ask Google Maps for directions, it guides you to a lookout spot several miles away . Even asking for directions on how to talk to the sign from Lake Hollywood Park, just below the sign, Google Maps suggest a 1.5hour trek to the lookout spot instead of the Hollywood Sign . Garmin confirmed to Gizmodo that the changes were made in spring 2012, while Google said the new directions were part of a November 2014 update. The Hollywood Sign Trust, a non-profit organisation which maintains the sign, told Gizmondo that the initial goal had been to 'hide' the sign from the internet. 'At one point we were successful in getting Google to take the address down, but it appears so many other places like the city council offices and the city of LA that they put it back up,'Â Betsy Isroelit Â told the website. The disappearance of the Hollywood Sign has been highlighted by Gizmodo after one of its writers received abuse from residents after posting an actual guide on how to get to the sign. Three years ago, Alissa Walker wrote a guide called 'The best way to see the Hollywood sign', advising tourists not to drive to the sign, but to hike there. However, following the recent changes on Google Maps, residents in Beachwood Canyon, threatened Ms Walker with legal action if she did not take down the guide.","Residents in Beachwood Canyon, LA, claim tourists pose a safety hazard .

"Colours may be the same around the world, but the language in which they are described can have a significant impact on how they are perceived. In English, the most popular base colours are blue, pink and green, while in China red, blue and green are more prominent. A data scientist wanted to put this theory to the test and, in doing so, has created a graphic that reveals how few ways there are in certain Eastern cultures to talk about colours, compared to the West. Language lessons: On the left, you can see the number of English names for colour hues, and the right shows how there are much fewer names for colours in Chinese.Â In English, the most popular base colours are blue, pink and green, while in China red, blue and green are more prominent . Muyueh Lee from Taipei designed theÂ infographic toÂ show the range of names for colours and hues on Wikipedia, in English and then in Chinese. His method is biased as there are more Wikipedia users that are English speakers, but it does reveal the importance of certain colours in both languages. In Chinese, most popular base colours are ç´ (red), è (blue) and ç¶  (green). Colours can also relate to objects like salmon, stone and pine tree. This may be telling as red in Chinese cultures symbolises good fortune and joy. It remains a popular colour in the country and is affiliated with the current government. This graphic shows the number of different words for each colour shade in Chinese. One of the most popular colours is red, which symbolises good fortune and joy in Chinese culture . There are far more words for blue and green in English than there are in Chinese.Â 'I was fascinated by the urban legend that Eskimo has 50 words for snow, and the idea that a culture will develop a richer vocabulary for things it cares,' said Mr Lee on Reddit .

'I was fascinated by the urban legend that Eskimo has 50 words for snow, and the idea that a culture will develop a richer vocabulary for things it cares,' said Mr Lee onÂ Reddit. Mr Lee's graphic highlights the debate over whether speaking a certain language allows people to 'see' more colours, because they have more descriptions. A number of studies seem to suggest this may be the case. The left image shows the use of light colours in English, and the right image shows its use in Chinese. Â Mr Lee's graphic highlights the debate over whether speaking a certain language allows people to 'see' more colours, because they have more descriptions . A 1954 study found that ZuÃ±i speakers, a tribe of Pueblo Native Americans, found they do not differentiate between orange and yellow. As a result, they have trouble telling them apart. A separate study focused on how Russian speakers have separate words for light blue (goluboy) and dark blue (siniy). MIT recruited 50 people from the Boston area in Massachusetts, half of whom were native Russian speakers. They found they were 10 per cent faster at distinguishing between light (goluboy) blues and dark (siniy) blues than at discriminating between blues within the same shade category. The University of Sussex has devised a training programme to see if adults without synaesthesia can develop the key hallmarks of the condition . Synaesthetes, including singers Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga, report an overlap in their senses; they see smells, taste colours or feel sounds. The neurological condition, which can affect as many as one in 23 people, has long been linked with creativity. And now scientists believe the condition correlates to an increase in intelligence - and they claim people can even be taught to experience it. The University of Sussex has devised a nine-week training programme to see if adults without synaesthesia can develop the key hallmarks of the condition. They found, in a sample study of 14, that the participants were able to develop strong letter-colour associations to pass all the standard tests for synaesthesia. Most experienced sensations such as letters seeming 'coloured' or having individual personas, for instance, 'x is boring', 'w is calm'. One of the most surprising outcomes of the study was that those who underwent the training also saw their IQ jump by an average of 12 points, compared to a control group that didn't undergo training.","In Chinese, popular base colours are ç´ (red), è (blue) and ç¶  (green)

"Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh arriving at Croydon Crown Court in south London, where he is accused of multiple counts of voyeurism . A top doctor was unmasked yesterday as a depraved voyeur who secretly filmed more than 1,000 victims across the country. NHS consultant Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh, 62, spent three years capturing patients, colleagues, friends and even children as young as three in intimate moments. The world-renowned hearing specialist used tiny cameras hidden in lavatories to feed his obsession. He installed them at NHS and private hospitals across Britain, his offices, the bathrooms at his Â£750,000 detached home in Banstead, Surrey, and even trains as he travelled to appointments. But Yeoh, who boasted to friends that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon actress Michelle Yeoh was his half-sister, was caught red-handed when one of the devices fell off a toilet at a Surrey hospital and a colleague found it. Police discovered Yeoh had inadvertently filmed himself installing it and searches of his offices and home revealed he had amassed a collection of footage. Investigators said it would take at least two years to examine the huge hoard of digital material on 17 computers, laptops, external hard-drives and memory sticks. In a sinister twist, the doctor created compilations of his colleagues using the toilets and carefully labelled them with their names, actions and the date. He also edited together footage of him interviewing patients with intimate shots from the toilet, including in some cases images shot from multiple cameras. One of his closest colleagues was unwittingly filmed more than 300 times. Yesterday, the weeping father of three clutched a Bible and buried his head in his hands as he was warned he faces a âsignificantâ jail sentence. Prosecutor Peter Clement said: âThis was a sophisticated, organised, planned and long-running campaign of voyeurism, the scale of which was vast. âIt was beyond anything previously encountered by the Metropolitan Police. His voyeurism targeted colleagues, friends, patients and patientsâ children, male and female. His intention was sinister, indecent and criminal. âHe grossly abused the very high degree of trust placed in him as a consultant physician as well as a friend and colleague.â Yeoh worked as a consultant vestibular physician, specialising in hearing complaints such as tinnitus, vertigo and dizziness, after coming to Britain from Malaysia aged 25. He rose through the ranks to become an honorary senior lecturer, expert High Court witness and director of two companies. His two daughters attend Cambridge University and the family were known to neighbours as respected professionals and devout Christians. But his career came crashing down when a camera was found in a communal toilet at the privately run St Anthonyâs Hospital, in Cheam, Surrey, on April 14. When police confronted Yeoh, he said: âWill I go to jail? I was so stupid, donât tell my family. Itâs not serious â I canât go to jail.â Yeoh has admitted using a sophisticated network of cameras hidden in hospital toilets to spy on 1,000 patients including children at St Anthony's hospital . They found 23 covert cameras, which were disguised as computer memory sticks, pens and watches, including three hidden in hearing aid boxes in his car. A memory stick he was carrying on a lanyard around his neck when he was arrested carried a short film entitled: âCardiff train teenager.â Computer experts found that Yeoh had used the cameras to film at medical facilities including the private Portland Hospital, in Central London, St Helier Hospital and clinics in Exeter, Nottingham, Sutton, and Thames Ditton, Surrey. Hours of footage was also captured on trains, including a girl, believed to be just three years old. Other victims included friends and colleagues who were invited to his home for social events. Police were able to identify only 32 victims, many of them staff at St Anthonyâs Hospital. There are at least a further 1,084 unknown victims. Yeoh gave detailed labels to the recordings, which included phrases such as âsweet young teenâ and âthin young blonde, Exeterâ. In mitigation, Yeohâs barrister said he was an obsessive âcollectorâ who recorded so much material he was unable to view it all. Yeoh admitted seven counts of voyeurism, six charges of making an indecent image of a child and one of possessing extreme pornography. He will be sentenced today. Miss Yeoh, 52, who also starred in the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, has 15 half-brothers and sisters. Her spokesman was not available for comment yesterday. The voyeurism charges relate to 30 identified victims and 1,084 unidentified victims, while the charge of making indecent images of children relates to six children . Colleagues of the voyeur doctor told of their horror yesterday at discovering he had been secretly filming them for years â and even giving some video clips a star rating system. The three women, who worked at a top private hospital in Central London, said Dr Lam Hoe Yeohâs actions had left them feeling âviolatedâ. They also told in excruciating detail how they had to watch Dr Yeohâs videos to identify themselves. In them, he had edited together clips of them chatting to him at work with clips of them using the toilet. The women were told in April that Dr Yeoh had been arrested but it was not until October that they found out they featured in his videos. One victim, in her forties, said: âHe would write a name then a brief description on each video. Some descriptions we didnât understand because it was your name and then, for example, five stars next to it. Apparently that was how on show you were. It is so surreal and shocking, it is hard to actually believe it.â Describing how she had to watch the videos with two policemen, she said: âI felt shocked, traumatised and then very sick. âI could not finish watching the video. I was not prepared for what I saw. I think there were 43 videos of me, in the office, on the toilet. When the police left I felt disgusted. I felt dirty. I was utterly disgusted. I wanted it to go away.â Another victim, in her thirties, said: âYou have lots of emotions â if you use public toilets, you look around a bit more. âYou should feel comfortable doing that. I donât work there any more but I donât think I could return.â The two women who have returned to work said they found it âvery difficultâ. âWhen we returned to work, we found the Blu-tack he had used to fix the cameras,â said one. âLuckily the toilets where he filmed are being refurbished now.â All three women described Dr Yeoh as âcreepyâ and âsocially awkwardâ. The woman in her forties, who had worked with Dr Yeoh for 12 years, said: âI was absolutely convinced from the very beginning [that I was one of his victims] because of his very creepy behaviour. He would come into my office many times and would stay in the office on his own after I had left and I was thinking, âwhat is he doing on his own in the room for two minutes?â â The three women were among 19 of Dr Yeohâs victims who were in court yesterday. One said: âIt did help. He was in a vulnerable position â the roles were reversed.â","Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh  secretly filmedÂ hundredsÂ of patients including children .

"The syrup is used in processed foods because it improves appearance, providing a consistent browning after oven heating . A sweetener used in food manufacture could be partly to blame for rising rates of type 2 diabetes, say scientists. Countries that use large amounts of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) have higher rates of the disease than those that consume little, says a new study. Among 42 countries studied, rates of diabetes were 8 per cent in high-consuming nations and 6.7 among low consumers - a difference of 20 per cent. Professor Stanley Ulijaszek, from Oxford University, who co-led the study, said: âThis research suggests that HFCS can increase the risk of type-2 diabetes, which is one of the most common causes of death in the world today.â In the UK, foods containing fructose syrup include McVitieâs HobNobs, McVitieâs Jaffa Cakes, Carte DâOr ice cream and Mr Kipling Bakewell Slices. It often appears in ingredients lists as âglucose-fructose syrupâ, âhigh fructose corn syrupâ or âHFCSâ. HFCS has a greater proportion of fructose sugar than sucrose, which contains an equal amount of glucose. The syrup is widely used in drinks and processed foods such as biscuits and ice cream because it acts as a sweetener and improves appearance, providing a consistent browning after oven heating. Of the countries studied, the US had far and away the greatest consumption per head of HFCS, amounting toÂ  55lb per year per year, says a report in the journal Global Public Health. Hungary, Canada, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Belgium, Argentina, Korea, Japan and Mexico were also high consumers. UK consumption was very low at less than 1lb per person per year, placing it alongside Australia, China, Denmark, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and Uruguay. But Professor Ulijaszek said the UK was a high consumer of total sugar at some 88lb per person per year. Sugar consumption, irrespective of the type, was strongly linked to diabetes, he added. He said: âAlthough this syrup can be found in many of our processed foods and drinks, this varies enormously from country to country.â He said there was relatively little fructose consumed in the UK, with Hobnob biscuits being an exception. Consumption of high fructose corn per person per year . âBut eating fructose at low levels is OKâ he added. âYou would have to eat very many biscuits to get high fructose levels into your system.â He said the UK had relatively high diabetes rates and was a high consumer of total sugar at almost 40kilos per person per year. Sugar consumption, irrespective of the type, was strongly linked to diabetes, he said. âThere are many factors involved in developing diabetes. The novel point of our paper is the link with fructose but other forms of sugar have been linked with it in the past.' British people love their sugar which goes back to colonial times and there is also a very strong sugar industry here. Consumers . should have better labelling with regards to sugar consumption, and . public health strategies aimed at diabetes prevention should incorporate . efforts to limit sugar consumptionâ he added. Tim . Lobstein, director of policy for the UK-based International Association . for the Study of Obesity, said âIf HFCS is a risk factor for . diabetes-one of the worldâs most serious chronic diseases-then we need . to rewrite national dietary guidelines and review agriculture trade . polices. Consumption of high fructose corn per person per year. The U.S consumed by far the most . âHFCS will join trans fats and salt as ingredients to avoid, and foods should carry warning labels.â A spokesman for the British Soft Drinks Association said âYou canât draw any conclusions from this research because it does not actually look at the relationship between consumption of HFCS and diabetes. âThose studies that have looked at this relationship find that there isnât one. âThe risk factors for type 2 diabetes have been assessed by the International Diabetes Federation as being overweight/obesity, aging, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, previous gestational diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle. âThe way to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes is to control oneâs weight and live a physically active lifestyle. There is a place for soft drinks as part of a balanced diet.â","Countries that use large amounts of fructose corn syrup have diabetes rates 20% higher than those that consume little .
U.S has greatest consumption of the syrup by far amounting to 25kg per person a year, compared to 0.5kg in the UK ."
"Heartbreaking photographs have emerged of an abandoned dog with dirty white fur so matted it was unable to relieve itself. The male terrier, possibly a Maltese mix, was found in a plastic pet carrier at the Pelton Pond womenâs restroom in Clarence Fahnestock State Park, New York, on Saturday morning. Vets at Putnam County SPCA animal shelter say the pooch was in a 'severe state of neglect', with serious ear infections and signs of malnutrition. State of neglect: Heartbreaking photographs have emerged of an abandoned dog with dirty white fur so matted it was unable to relieve itself . SPCA chief, Ken Ross, said that its tangled coat was 'causing extreme discomfort and actually prevented the dog from defecating.' The pup, believed to be three or four years old, has since had its body shaved and is on the mend. 'He's doing great . . . he's a happy little dog. His ears are healing too,' a status update posted to Facebook read. Ross said due to the dogâs 'severe case of neglect and its apparent abandonment,' the SPCA is treating the case as a criminal matter. Abandoned: The male terrier, possibly a Maltese mix, was found in a plastic pet carrier at the Pelton Pond womenâs restroom in Clarence Fahnestock State Park, New York, on Saturday morning .

"The teenaged Texas Tech cheerleader who created a social media firestorm with photos of the African big game she hunted has fired back at her online attackers. In a typo-laden defense that invokes the safari-loving 26th U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt, Kendall Jones, 19, claims that killing rare rhinos and elephants actually helps to save them. 'This is a conservation effort to assure [sic] that they never do become extinct,' the teen from Cleburne, Texas posted to Facebook. 'This is a conservation effort!': 19-year-old Texas Tech cheerleader Kendall Jones is firing back at the critics who say her hunting safaris to Africa are just poaching expeditions disguised as conservations . Unfairly targeted? Kendall Jones, far right, loves Jesus, cheerleading, and hunting African big game . Facebook, of course, is where the controversy began. By Wednesday evening, 150,000 global animal lovers had signed a petition urging CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take down the photos in which Jones smiles proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from extinction. '[Roosevelt] was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure. 'Yet, how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless Teddy,' wrote Jones. Jones' Facebook remains active, the photos that started the controversy have vanished. Meanwhile, a Facebook account has now been created as part of Jones' defense called Support Kendall Jones. 'Support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in Africa,' reads the page. Conserving by killing? 19-year-old Texas cheerleader Kendall Jones really likes to kill rare animals in Africa. While she pays for her legal hunts, her critics says she's not the conservationist she claims to be . Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion) Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals . Jones claims photos of dead hippos, elephants, lions and other . beasts on Facebook are a testament to her hunting skills and dedication . to game preservation. But . critics are appalled by the teen and are calling . Kendall sick and depraved for killing the rare animals and boasting . about it online. 'For the sake of all animals,' reads the petition against Jones as it implores . animal lovers to sign, 'especially the animals in the African region... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal!' Jones, whose Facebook indicates . she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' maintains she is . doing what's best for the preserves, where there isn't always space for . even threatened species like elephants or lions. 'Controlling the male lion population . is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes. 'Funds . from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but . also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their . property.' Hungry: Jones defends her killing of elephants by saying their meat goes on to feed hundreds of thankful village families . Jones's photos show her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she's killed. One . particular photo, in which she's posing alongside a an extremely . endangered rhinoceros, has her critics especially steaming, but the . Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well. 'The . vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, . treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to . be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino . population through conservation,' she wrote. However, Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a white rhino, which number around 20,000. 'The first animal I ever shot was a White Rhino with a .416 Remington!!' the teen writes on her Facebook page. Because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be banned from hunting in Africa completely. family pride: Jones first learned to love the hunt when she started following her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9 . 'Harvest': 'Another harvest for today,' wrote Jones with this photo. 'White springbok, it's 1 of the 4 color shades of this animal! And let me tell you it's one of my favorite kinds of meat so far!' A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that. 'Kendall Jones is an American born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting African wildlife under the facade of conservation,' reads the petition. It continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.' Critics say the 19-year-old is not conservationist and is simply reaping the benefits of her Facebook photos with African animals to help get a television deal . 'This time I got my leopard,' writes Jones of a third safari she took at age 14.  'And also took down a hippo to get 6 of the Dangerous 7'","Kendall Jones, 19, drew the ire of thousands with her Facebook photos showing her smiling alongside rare African beasts .

"Immigration is responsible for 84 per cent of the surge in Britainâs population this century, a report claims today. It suggests the true impact of immigration has been âsubstantially understatedâ because the Office for National Statistics did not count 1.3million children born to foreign parents as migrants. The report concludes that of the 4.6million population rise between 2001 and 2012, 3.8million is due to the biggest wave of immigration the country has faced. Not including children born in the UK meant net migration was recorded at a much lower 2.5million. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, pictured, said official figures underestimated the scale of immigration as they do not count the British-born children of recent migrants as immigrants . MigrationWatch UK, the think-tank that carried out the study using official data, said it was âundeniableâ that migration had driven population growth, putting pressure on public services and depressing wages. It shows how Labourâs decision at the turn of the century to make it easier for migrants to come to Britain has changed the face of the country. In its most recent publication, the ONS said that, on average, 57 per cent of the UKâs population increase since 2001 has been due to net migration. The statisticians, whose figures comply with international standards, attribute the remainder to the excess of births over deaths â the ânatural increaseâ â as people live longer. But research by MigrationWatch UK has revealed the figure does not include children born to immigrants arriving over the last decade. When counted, the figure rises to 84 per cent. The report criticised the ONS prediction that 60 per cent of future population growth until 2037 will be down to migration as a âserious understatementâ. This suggested 43 per cent of the increase would be due to immigrants arriving after 2012, and 17 per cent to any children they have. But this did not take into account the future children of migrants already here, which would make the figure âmuch higherâ, the think-tank said. Moreover, the estimate was based on net migration of 165,000 a year, while it is currently at around 245,000. MigrationWatch UK pointed out that the birth rate is 1.83 children per woman, compared with the 2.1 needed to sustain the population. The ONS said 57 per cent of the UK's population increase since 2001 is due to immigration . Official figures have shown that birth rates among migrants often increase when they arrive in the UK, possibly as a result of better living conditions here. MigrationWatch UK said the birth rates meant that within 25 years any population increase would âbe entirely due to net migrationâ. ONS figures to be released tomorrow will confirm that the Government is missing its target to reduce net migration to the âtens of thousandsâ. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: âThis is about population growth, not about citizenship. âThose born in the UK to settled immigrant parents are British citizens, irrespective of their parentsâ country of birth. âThat said, it is now undeniable that the massive scale of net migration has been the main cause of our population growth and that, in the future, our population growth is likely to be almost entirely due to migration.â He added that official ONS statistics did not make this clear. An ONS spokesman said: âIn accordance with the UN international standards, the ONS does not define children who are born in the UK as immigrants. âMigrationWatch UK has used a different definition which produces a higher total.â","MigrationWatch UK said 1.3 million children have been born to immigrants .

"If you reach for a biscuit or a chocolate bar when you're a bit fed up, you're not alone. Workers who are having a bad day at the office are more likely to devour lardy lunches and junk food, according to a new survey. Comparably, workers with a positive approach to their job pick up healthy lunches like salads and low calorie sandwiches. More than three quarters (77 per cent) of the 2,000 British workers surveyed, said their mood in the office 'definitely' impacted on the food they eat at lunch time. Scroll down for video . Workers  having a rough day at the office are more likely to gorge on junk food at lunch. Half said they abandoned plans for a healthy lunch as soon as they were having a bad day . Half claim they always opt for a super healthy lunch on days their mood is happy and upbeat. However, as soon as they were having a rough day, more than half (54 per cent) abandoned plans to eat healthy lunches like sushi and salads in favour of burgers, curries and pizza. A bad day in the office was by far the most popular excuse for comfort eating, with 72 per cent of adults admitting they do this. Roughly four meals a week are selected on the basis of the mood we are in, the poll found. Dietitian Azmina Govindji, said: 'We all experience stressful, busy days, but missing meals altogether to save time is a false economy, as is rushing your food at your desk, or substituting a meal for a bar of chocolate or copious amounts of strong coffee. 'It's important to take some time out to savour your food, instead of devouring a sandwich in five minutes so you can get back to work. 'These habits can make you more prone to problems such as heartburn or indigestion, which could leave you feeling uncomfortable in the afternoon. 'Both heartburn and indigestion tend to be more common when we over-indulge on rich fatty food, have irregular eating habits and are more stressed.' The typical worker will scoff on fast-food at their desk 38 times in an average year because they are in a foul mood, with 45 per cent claiming the worse their mood, the more indulgent their food choice. The typical worker forks out Â£222 a year on junk food to improve their mood . Fortunately, 45 per cent of those quizzed said their typical weekday lunch is 'quite fresh', but 30 per cent described their work lunches as 'fatty' and 'greasy'. The survey showed that reaching for fatty foods is not only bad for our waistlines, but our bank balances too â with the typical worker forking out Â£221.76 a year on junk food to improve their mood. Not only do workers admit to eating poor quality food, 47 per cent said they rush their food down if they are having a busy or stressful day. The average person said they consumed their lunch in just six minutes with an average three meals per week eaten at desks. At the other end of the spectrum, a worrying 14 per cent of those surveyed report missing lunch all together as they simply don't have time to eat. The humble sandwich is still the most popular meal to reach for, with chocolate voted the most desirable lunch. Arguments with their other half, money worries and a bad nights' sleep were also triggers for reaching for sugary snacks and unhealthy foods. Four in ten (41 per cent) adults encourage the rest of their family to join them in eating takeaways and fast food if they have experienced a bad day at work. A spokesman for Gaviscon, who commissioned the survey, said: 'We can all relate to reaching for comfort food if we have had a bad day. 'If you are feeling stressed out, the default seems to be to reach for chocolate, crisps and indulgent foods as a 'treat'. 'However, it's not a treat and the 'high' you get from these foods rarely lasts long. Gorging on indulgent foods and heavy lunches often leaves you feeling bloated, sluggish and guilty.' Almost half (45 per cent) of those quizzed said their typical weekday lunch is 'quite fresh'. However, most rush down their meals, with the average person eating their lunch in six minutes .","Majority of people say the mood in the office impacts on the food they eat .

"When their older brother Jeremy died in Afghanistan, Ben and Beau Wise did what loyal brothers and soldiers do. They stood solemnly in uniform at his memorial, laid red roses in front of his picture, and Ben spoke bravely to a chapel full of loved ones who came to mourn. Soldiers themselves, Ben and Beau knew what their fallen brother had experienced and seen. They knew the difficulties of being a warrior and a devoted husband, and what a testament it was to Jeremy's character that he had excelled at both. Band of brothers: From left, Ben, Beau and Jeremy Wise, deep in conversation. Ben and Jeremy died while serving their country in Afghanistan . 'Jeremy, I miss you and I love you, brother,' Ben said. 'And see you again.' Two . years later, Ben died at a hospital in Germany after an insurgent . attack left him with injuries that first cost him his legs, then his life. He was . 34, a year younger than Jeremy was when a suicide bomber killed him at a . CIA base where he was working as a defense contractor. For a family that had already paid the highest price of war, it was time for another funeral, another eulogy, another grave. The . eldest Wise boys are two of the thousands of Americans who have died . since the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan began. But they share a link . that most do not: They were brothers. 'They laid down their lives, both of them, so that others could live,' their mother, Mary Wise, said. Jeremy, Ben and Beau played with soldiers long before they became soldiers themselves. Devastating loss: The Wise family in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Mother Mary Wise (right) poses with her children, from left, Beau, Heather, Ben and Jeremy . Playtime was something of a . battlefield rehearsal. When the G.I. Joes were idle, their toys morphed . into land mines, waiting to be stepped on in the carpet at the family's . home in southern Arkansas. The . three Wise boys and their sister, Heather, grew up in a small town . called El Dorado. It wasn't a far drive from the country, where their . father, Jean, taught the boys to hunt squirrels and deer when he wasn't . treating patients as an ear, nose and throat doctor. The . house was always full of something: the smell of mom's venison fried up . with lemon pepper, the sound of the kids riffing on guitars or banging . on drums. Amid the . chaos, though, was harmony. A friend once asked why they didn't have . cable. Ben looked at him and said: 'We've got each other.' At . night, when Beau was tucked into bed, the big kids would have story . time. Ben and Heather would sit with legs crossed and listen to Jeremy, . who even as a teenager, saw himself as a protector: sword in hand, clad . in armor, crossing bridges to battle monsters with glowing eyes and . yellow breath. Hero: Army Sgt Ben Wise died on January 15, 2012, in a hospital in Germany after being wounded in Afghanistan . Courage: Navy Seal Jeremy Wise on the cover of a video of his 2009 memorial service and a newspaper obituary kept by his sister in Prescott, Arkansas . 'In the story, of course, he's always the hero,' their sister Heather Skaleski said. As they grew older, military dreams turned into career plans. Ben aired his by the time he was in Sunday school. Most of his classmates raised their hands when a teacher asked what they wanted to do when they grew up. Not Ben. He got up from his seat and drew a picture of a soldier on the board. Years later, in 2000, he enlisted in the Army - and then told his mother. 'I was indignant because I was Mommy and I thought he should talk with me, which I realize now was laughable,' his mother said. Jeremy signed up next, dropping out of medical school to become a Navy SEAL. The last to join the military was Beau. Determined to keep her last son out of harm's way, his mother refused to cook for him for two weeks when he announced he was going to become a Marine. Pride: Beau Wise in his  U. S. Marine Corps uniform - he lost two brothers in Afghanistan . 'I was just so mad because I wanted to protect him,' Mary Wise said. Her protests didn't work. He followed his brothers. Once the deployments began, they seemed constant. Beau shipped off to Afghanistan for the first time in 2009. Ben had finished a deployment earlier that year and was preparing for another with his Special Forces unit in 2010. 'One was always coming or two were there and one was home,' their mother said. Jeremy had just retired as a Navy SEAL and was working as a defense contractor in Afghanistan. He thought he could spend more time with his family that way and still serve his country. When he was home in Virginia, he played ninjas with his stepson, Ethan, and hung around his wife, Dana, even if she was doing something as mundane as laundry. 'He loved us almost suffocatingly so,' she said. When he was working in Afghanistan, Jeremy called home often and made the adventure sound like a vacation. He talked about the food, the hotels - not the danger. 'He wouldn't tell me anything about it because he didn't want me to worry,' his sister, Heather, said. The risk became real at the end of 2009, when the Wise parents were celebrating the birth of Ben's baby boy in Washington state. Amid the celebration, word came from overseas: A suicide bomber had killed Jeremy at a CIA base in Afghanistan. His family met his remains in Dover, Delaware. It was a cold, gray day and the family waited inside a bus that felt like a funeral parlor, Heather recalled. Ben took Heather's hand in his and they whispered memories about their brother. Deployments were harder after that. Ben and Beau headed back overseas not long after the funeral. The war started wearing on Ben, a medic who repaired the wounds that men inflict on each other. He worried about his younger brother serving in another part of Afghanistan. 'I was just so mad because I wanted to protect him.' Mary Wise, mother . '(Beau's) heading home here in the next few days, which is a huge load off my mind,' Ben wrote in a Facebook message to a friend. He waited for his own homecoming. During his final deployment, Ben would tell his sister stories about his son, Luke. Then he would cut himself off, unable to talk about the baby boy he couldn't hold in his arms. 'The pain comes in when you have to think about home, think about the people you love and then just try to block it out ... for your family and for your fellow soldiers,' Heather recalled him saying. He prayed. He had faith that he would come home. So much faith that he turned down a friend's offer to ship him a care package in December, telling him that he would be packing up by the time it arrived. The next month, an insurgent shot Ben after he and his fellow soldiers saved a number of women and children in Afghanistan. A medic unto the end, he helped tend to his own wounds before he was flown to a hospital in Germany. Beau caught a flight and accompanied Ben's wife to the hospital, where she saw her husband for the last time. Ben fought to stay alive, even after doctors cut off his legs, even as his body failed, even as his organs started shutting down. He died on January 15, shortly before his parents arrived to say goodbye. Beau called Heather. 'We were crying and I said, ''It's just you and me now, bro,'"" she said. 'Just us two.' Again, the family found themselves in the same chapel, the same veterans cemetery, to say goodbye.They moved Jeremy's grave so that the brothers could lie side by side in Suffolk, Virginia. 'To lose Jeremy was devastating,' his widow, Dana, said. 'To lose Ben was just ... you throw your hands up in the air.' Each brother's tombstone cites part of the Bible. Jeremy's points to a chapter that's often read at happier times: 1 Corinthians 13. Part of it reads: 'When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.' The family still calls them boys. The youngest, Beau, is planning to move closer to Ben's family. Later this year, his mother says, he'll transfer from his base in Hawaii to one on the mainland. He'll remain in the military, at least for now. He will not deploy for war again. Though the Marines will not talk specifically about Beau's case, the military has policies in place to protect surviving sons like Beau and families like the Wises. It's rare for brothers to die in the same war, but not unheard of. One of the most famous cases of siblings dying in war is the five Sullivan brothers, who died together at sea during a battle in World War II. Mary Wise said the military assured her that Beau won't be sent into conflict again. Their family has sacrificed enough.","Jeremy Wise, 35, killed by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan in 2009 .

"Russia is demanding an investigation into the alleged use of âchemical weaponsâ against separatists in the east of Ukraine as the two countries agreed to extend their ceasefire. Pro-separatist rebels have claimed that people showing symptoms of chlorine poisoning had been admitted to hospital following an alleged attack carried out by Ukrainian Special Forces near Slavyansk. The accusations, which follow claims of 'phosphorous fire bombs' being dropped on villages in southeastern Ukraine this month, led to Russian diplomats urging an investigation. Scroll down for video . What ceasefire? A woman cries in front of her house destroyed by shelling carried out by government forces in Slolyansk, Donetsk region as leaders of Ukraine and Russia agreed to work towards ceasefire . âThis is horrible. This case must be investigated,â said Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin. The Russian ambassador to Holland, Roman Kolodkin, said a complaint could be submitted to the Organisation for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons amid claims that Chloropicrin was used by pro-Kiev forces. Earlier there was claims that âphosphorus fumesâ led to poisoning. One rebel leader in Donetsk, Igor Strelkov, said there had been a number of cases. âWe are collecting sample materials and are going to present them as evidence.â The demands came as the leaders of Russia and Ukraine agreed to work towards extending a fragile ceasefire between Kiev and pro-Kremlin militias. Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko also promised to set up effective border controls, French president Francois Hollande's office said on Monday. Head to head: Vladimir Putin and newly elected Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko will now try to work towards extending ceasefire and to work on the liberation of more hostages and prisoners . Under fire: A man rescues his cat from his house, destroyed by government shelling in Slovyansk on Monday morning, ahead of the talks between Poroshenko and Putin . Still fighting: Both sides have been accused of ignoring the agreement of ceasefire, particularly in the eastern regions where support for rebels is strong . The two men spoke during a four-way teleconference call that also included Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. After . what Hollande's office said was a long conversation, Putin and . Poroshenko also agreed to work on the liberation of more hostages and . prisoners and the organisation of 'substantial tripartite negotiations,' the statement said. Petro . had urged Putin on Sunday to strengthen Russian control over its borders . to prevent militants and arms entering Ukraine after violence broke a . truce there. The ceasefire, . declared by Poroshenko on June 20 to allow for peace talks with the . pro-Russian rebels, was due to expire on Monday, a deadline also set by . EU leaders considering new sanctions against Russia. However, just Monday morning, the city of Slovyansk, in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine came under shelling from government forces. The . European Union, which signed an historic free-trade pact with Ukraine . on Friday, has warned it could impose more sanctions on Moscow unless . pro-Russian rebels act to wind down the crisis in the east of the . country by Monday. Potential proof: This video was released by  Russian media earlier this month, and allegedly shows white phosphorous bombs being dropped on a Ukranian city . White light: According to witnesses of the shelling on June 12, the bombs dropped were incendiary phosphorous bombs, a type of weapon which is banned by the UN, something  firmly denied by Kiev . Putin again urged an extension of the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and setting up a control mechanism to monitor the truce with the participation of the OSCE security body , the Kremlin said in a separate statement after the talks. 'The leaders spoke in favour of convening a third round of consultations between Kiev and south-eastern regions as soon as possible,' it added. Killed: Russian cameraman Anatoly Klyan, 68, died from injuries after being shot in the stomach outside a military compound in Donetsk . However, later on Monday, Moscow accused Ukraine of breaking the ceasefire after a cameraman working for Russian state television was killed. Anatoly Klyan, 68, was shot in the stomach outside a military compound in the city of Donetsk, Moscowâs Channel One TV reported. He was among a group of journalists that had been allowed to enter compound to film soldiers being picked up by their mothers, when an unidentified gunman opened fire. Mr Klyan, 68, who had worked for the state channel for 40 years, is the fifth journalist to be killed since the fighting began in April between Ukrainian government troops and armed pro-Russia separatists. Russia's Foreign Ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian soldiers and demanded an objective investigation into the attack and for those responsible to be punished. Video footage of the attack broadcast on Channel One showed Klyan continuing to film inside the bus even after he was shot in the stomach, stopping only when he grew weak and telling his colleagues: 'I can't hold the camera any longer.' Other journalists helped him into a passing car to be taken to a nearby medical center, but the television station said doctors were unable to save him.","Pro-separatist rebels accuse Kiev of using 'chemical weapons'

"An Iraq War veteran started an online fundraiser earlier this month hoping to raise $4,000 for what was described as his final trip home before he succumbs of cancer. But a California news station has uncovered that Kevin Fish, of Joshua Tree, had used a picture of an X-ray showing a patient suffering from bone cancer taken from a medical journal and presented it as his own on his GoFundMe account. When confronted by a reporter from KESQ Monday, the retired Army Ranger insisted that the image used on the online fundraiser was taken with his cell phone during a medical examination, and that he was told by his doctor that it was his MRI showing cancer ravaging his body. Sad tale: Retired Army Ranger Kevin Fish set up a fundraising page in mid-November asking for $4,000 in donations to be used towards one final trip to visit his family before he dies of cancer . 'Rip-off:' A California news station confronted Fish Monday saying that the 'MRI' image posted on the GoFundMe page allegedly showing his body ravaged by bone cancer was not Fish's . Looks familiar: The X-ray image used on Fish's donations page was taken from a medical journal published in 2007 . 'I'm telling you what happened, as God as my witness,' Fish, a member of a local biker club, told the station. 'I was in the office, he [doctor] put this up on there, after I sat in an MRI box for 30 minutes taking pictures of my body.' The Joshua Tree resident sought to put the blame on the doctor, claiming that he must have accidentally put up an X-ray image from a 2007 medical journal instead of his actual MRI. Pointing fingers: Fish insisted that his doctor must have accidentally put up an X-ray from the journal instead of his MRI image . Lack of evidence: Fish could not produce any documentation showing his two-year battle with cancer . According to Fish, a native of Houma, Louisiana, he was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in 2012, but during the Monday interview he was unable to produce any medical files proving that he has been battling the deadly disease for the past two years. When pressed on that issue, Fish said that he does not keep his medical records at home. On November 16, the veteran launched a GoFundMe account asking for $4,000 in donations so he could travel to his hometown in Louisiana to visit his family one last time. By Monday, Fish had raised $1,650. While being interviewed by KESQ, the retired ranger erased his crowdfunding page, but according to GoFundMe.com, even with the account removed he still would be able to access the funds. Wes Wilson, senior pastor at Sword of the Lord church where Fish is a member, said that he believes some members of the community may have donated money to help the veteran. Deleted: Fish erased his GoFundMe account Monday, after being confronted about the possible scam, but the website site he could still access the collected funds . 'It's going to sound terrible, but I hope he has cancer,' the clergyman said. â I hope he really is sick. I hope the deception doesn't go so far and it doesn't go so deep that he doesn't have cancer at all.â Earlier this year, Kevin Fish made headlines in the local media after launching a campaign to raise awareness about the homelessness epidemic among service members in the Hi Desert area. Speaking to the radio station Z1077 in March, Fish said that he owns a thrift shop called Change for Vets and asked for donations of food, clothing and cash to purchase necessities for veterans in need.","Retired Army Ranger Kevin Fish, from California, started GoFundMe page asking for $4,000 in donations towards one final trip home .

"A new activewear line uses crab and shrimp shells to prevent odor, fading, pulls and wrinkles. Strongbody Apparel garments are treated with Chitosante, environmentally friendly and nontoxic antibacterial nanotechnology from the ocean to make the fabric more breathable and moisture wicking. Most importantly though, it makes each piece of clothing odourless. Vancouver-based personal trainer Quincy Samycia, who founded the company with girlfriend Meghan Conyers, told MailOnline: 'We ended up loving the Chitosante technology, as its performance is unbeatable and the fabric keeps its original feel and drape. Fishy business: Strongbody Apparel garments are treated with nanotechnology made from crab and shrimp shells which prevents odor, fading, pulls and wrinkles . âChitosante is anti-microbial, and when combined with the fabric it kills the bacteria which is actually what causes the odor on our clothing.' The couple launched their label because they thought that the current activewear available was either unfashionable, not functional, or both so they took matters into their own hands. Mr Samycia continued: 'We were inspired to start Strongbody as we wanted to create something we were comfortable enough in to workout, as well as walk our dog and grab a coffee - all while looking good. That's our lifestyle, and we couldn't find anything that did that for us.' Mr Samycia and Ms Conyers have been self-funding Strongbody Apparel so far, but recently turned to Kickstarter for funding. Multitasking: Vancouver personal trainers Quincy Samycia and Meghan Conyers are behind Strongbody Apparel which promises to be both comfortable and stylish enough workout in, as well as walk the dog or grab a coffee .

"A former monk hanged himself in the Catholic church where he worshipped after becoming convinced he was possessed by demons, an inquest heard today. Dominic Bell, 47, was found dead at St John the Evangelist Church in Horsham, West Sussex, shortly after telling psychiatrists he needed to harm himself to save his loved ones. The devoted Catholic had been a regular worshipper at the church, attending confession in the run up to his death. His body was found by a young parishioner who had gone to the church to pray. Discovery: The former monk was found dead at St John the Evangelist Church (above) in Horsham, West Sussex . An inquest heard today how Mr Bell had lived as a monk and head gardener at an historic monastery on the Isle of Wight before returning to the family home in Horsham. His emotional mother, Julia James, told the inquest that her son was a âgentle childâ who had spiralled into depression after getting into financial difficulties and being declared bankrupt. It was then that he turned to religion and travelled to Quarr Abbey to become a monk and decided to take a job as head gardener and tended the monasteryâs manicured grounds for a decade. She told the coroner that, after becoming disillusioned with monastery life, her son briefly moved to the Orkney Islands but this left him feeling depressed and âin need of support.â The inquest jury heard that after returning to live with his mother he would take to his room for long periods and she regularly heard him crying. Shortly afterwards he left home and stabbed himself in the chest in an apparent suicide attempt, telling her: âYou need to let me go.â Change of location: After becoming disillusioned with monastery life, Dominic Bell briefly moved to the Orkney Islands (file picture) but this left him feeling depressed and 'in need of support', the inquest heard . The worshipper was sectioned under the Mental Health Act in September 2013 and detained at Langley Green Hospital in Crawley, where he was said to be a quiet but popular figure who got on well with other patients. However the jury heard that Mr Bell, who was subsequently released on the basis that he would continue to live at the hospital voluntarily, walked out on day leave on the morning of January 2 this year and was found dead at the church seven hours later. Student worshipper Andrew Penson described the moment be made the discovery, saying be entered the church and approached the font before turning around and seeing the body of a man hanging. Psychiatrist Dr Mihaela Bucur told the hearing in Horsham today: âHe didnât have any insight into what was going on in his life. He thought everything was real and that he was possessed by demons. âHe said that he wanted to protect people around him by hurting himself. He thought that he had to hurt himself because at that point he thought he was evil and he was doing bad things to people around him.â However she said Mr Bell had shown significant improvements in the three weeks before his death and that staff had believed he was no longer psychotic or depressed. A jury concluded that Mr Bell died of self-inflicted injuries but that his intention that day was unclear. Assistant Coroner for West Sussex Michael Burgess said: âIâm sure he will be remembered for the better moments in his life rather than how he died.â","Dominic Bell found dead at church in Horsham, West Sussex .

"'It shouldn't be five white men': Danny Cohen, the BBC's director of television, singled out Match of the Day for fresh criticism over the racial mix of pundits . Match Of The Day needs to become more diverse with fewer white men on its panel of pundits, the BBC has said. Days after announcing its dramas would include more black and gay actors to reflect modern Britain, the corporation turned its sights on sports shows. Danny Cohen, the BBCâs director of television, singled out BBC1âs Saturday football highlights programme for fresh criticism. He said: âIf we have five people on a panel show, it shouldnât be five white men. I think the same thing of Match Of The Day. Itâs a very diverse sport and it shouldnât be like that.â Although Mr Cohen stopped short of calling for a diversity quota for Match of the Day hosts, he made it clear he expects to see changes to the make-up of sports panels in the near future. His comments may cause some anxiety for the programmeâs current team of presenters. The weekly show is normally fronted by former England footballer Gary Lineker, 53, who is paid Â£1.5million-a-year for his services. He is often paired with his former teammate Alan Shearer, 43, and retired Scotland player Alan Hansen, 58, and they are frequently joined by a string of other white male pundits, including Robbie Fowler, 38, and Michael Owen, 34. The corporation does have some prominent black football pundits and has lined up Manchester United player Rio Ferdinand to join its World Cup team in Brazil this summer. The first female commentator to appear on Match of the Day was Jacqui Oatley in 2007, while Radio Five Live appointed Charlotte Green as the new voice of its classified sports results last year. Last month, Mr Cohen was embroiled in a row with one of the BBCâs top comics after he said it was ânot acceptableâ to have all-male comedy panel shows and said every one filmed from now on will have at least one woman. His remarks were criticised by Mock the Week presenter Dara OâBriain, who said the move would make female guests appear to be âtoken womenâ. 'ItÂ¿s a very diverse sport and it shouldnÂ¿t be like that': Although Mr Cohen stopped short of calling for a diversity quota, he made it clear he expects to see changes to the make-up of sports panels soon . But Mr Cohen reiterated his determination to change the gender balance of TV this week, saying: âThere isnât a problem on some of the panel shows - they try to have a good gender balance all the time. Others, it was like pushing water up a hill and we kept saying it, and it wasnât happening. âWe got to the point where we thought, this is not acceptable anymore, this doesnât reflect the world we live in. âIn a leadership role, I can either keep pushing and hope itâs going to evolve, or I can set some really clear examples to provide a beacon for what our expectations are.â Speaking at a separate event, drama controller Ben Stephenson said he wants more black and gay actors on TV in a bid to âreflect Britain as it really isâ.",Comes after BBC said dramas should have more black and gay actors .

"A Cabinet minister today accused the BBC of being 'utterly negative' about the government's flagship welfare reforms. Iain Duncan Smith hit back at Radio 4 interviewer Mishal Husain's claims that the Universal Credit system had been 'dogged' with problems. The Work and Pensions Secretary claimed the Corporation was determined to look for problems in his changes to the benefit system, but insisted they remain on track. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today accused BBC Radio 4 presenter Mishal Husain of being 'utterly negative' about the government's welfare reforms . Mr Duncan Smith admitted making mistakes in the plans to roll out flagship benefit reforms and said the original 2017 deadline had been 'artificial'. Universal Credit is now being rolled out to families in the north west of England but it is expected to take until 2019 to put all claimants on to the system. He said the original plans for rolling out the welfare changes, which combine benefits into a single payment, had been wrong and he had taken the decision two years ago to 'reset' the timings of the project because he recognised that it needed a longer timescale. But being interviewed on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Duncan Smith repeatedly hit back at the idea that the Universal Credit programme was in crisis. Miss Husain suggested that ministers had so far only tackled the easy claimants â or the 'low hanging fruit' â and as time goes on it will take longer. But Mr Duncan Smith insisted: 'I know you want to try and look at this in an utterly negative way. ' Let me explain to you... what we are doing. This is not about low-hanging fruit; we have deliberately set out to roll it out so that each bit of it is tested. 'There is nothing low-hanging about an individual looking for work needing better support. 'So a single person, we get that right; we've then got couples, that's right, that's rolling out; we're now doing families. 'This is deliberately done like this so that we can ensure that as we roll it out we get all the complexities ironed out.' As the exchange became more fraught, Mr Duncan Smith went on: 'You've said that it's constantly dogged. That's not correct. 'I decided two years ago, having had some outside work look at this, that the wrong way to roll it out, as was originally planned, was to roll it out like tax credits, which as you may remember had been a disaster. They crashed and 400,000 people didn't get their payments. 'I hope anyone listening will recognise that if we do it carefully and we land it safely, they are far better off than trying to rush something for a simple deadline, which actually was artificial in the first place.' Mr Duncan Smith announced to the Conservative conference in September that he was planning to accelerate the national roll-out of Universal Credit to every community in Britain by the end of 2015-16. A BBC spokesman defended the interview, adding: 'The roll-out of Universal Credit is a key policy of the Government, and it was relevant to raise some recent criticisms with the Cabinet Minister responsible. Iain Duncan Smith was given ample opportunity to put his point across.' The exchange happened as Miss Husain tackled the Tory minister over the progress of Universal Credit during the Today programme on Radio 4 . The Department for Work and Pensions said today that this will mean one in three of the country's Jobcentres taking claims for the new benefit by spring 2015. And six Jobcentres in the North West are now taking claims from couples with children and lone parents, who will receive support for childcare via Universal Credit for the first time. Payments will initially cover 70 per cent of childcare costs, rising to 85 per cent in 2016, as announced in the March Budget. Universal Credit is already available to single and couple claimants in more than 80 Jobcentres in England, Wales and Scotland and will be available in nearly 100 Jobcentres by Christmas, said the DWP. The department cited research suggesting that claimants find Universal Credit easier to understand than the previous array of benefits and considered that it provided better financial incentives to work. But shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the Universal Credit programme had become 'a complete shambles'. 'The latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show just 17,850 people are claiming Universal Credit - less than 1 per cent of the million people Iain Duncan Smith said would be on the new benefit in April 2014,' said Ms Reeves. 'Labour wants Universal Credit to succeed but the Government's mishandling of the programme has led to huge waste and delays with over Â£130 million of taxpayers' money wasted on failed IT. It's another example of Tory welfare waste. 'A Labour government would pause Universal Credit for three months to examine whether the programme can be rescued from the shambles David Cameron's Government has left it in.'","Iain Duncan Smith hits back at claims Universal Credit is in trouble .

"Helen Jones, 31, is said to have posed as an on-duty officer in Merseyside. When this photograph was taken, Helen Jones was a PCSO with Cheshire Constabulary . CCTV footage of a street brawl allegedly involving Liverpool FC captain Steven Gerrard was seized by an off-duty police officer as a 'as a tool for blackmail', a court heard. Gerrard was out with friends celebrating his testimonial match at a wine bar in Formby, Merseyside, when trouble flared. Helen Jones, 33, who worked for Merseyside Police for eight years, was on a career break when she used her warrant card at a bank in Formby to obtain footage of the dispute. A court today heard how there was an 'irresistible inference' that Jones took the footage on behalf of others intent on blackmailing the Liverpool and England star. Jones, of Chatham, Kent, has admitted misconduct at Preston Crown Court but the prosecution rejects Jones's account that she was unaware of any criminal purpose behind obtaining the recording. Describing the events that were captured on camera on August 4, Richard Haworth, prosecuting, said: 'The professional footballer Steven Gerrard, and it will not need me to remind the court of his position and status, was celebrating his testimonial match on an evening out in Formby with a group of friends at Woodwards Bar in Chapel Lane. 'The group included a man called Lee McPartland. In the course of the late evening there was a dispute between Mr Gerrard's group of friends and another group and it moved out on to Chapel Lane, outside Lloyds Bank where an altercation was captured on CCTV which showed the involvement of a man called Paul Lloyd. 'The Crown's case remains that Mr Gerrard was seeking to avoid any involvement, or any form of aggression or confrontation, and as far as he was concerned was attempting to defuse the situation.' On August 8, three days later, Jones went to Lloyds Bank on Chapel Lane and asked to speak to the manager, Sharon Allen. She retrieved the footage after showing her warrant card and telling the bank manager that she was in plain clothes because 'the job I do, no people would talk to me'. The prosecution said that a phone call made through a Merseyside Police call operator to Lloyds Bank at Jones's request was to 'provide a smokescreen' and 'add authenticity' to her actions. CCTV: The video is alleged to show a dispute involving former England captain Steven Gerrard (left, in 2007), his wife Alex (right) and another man . Mr Haworth added: 'In the weeks that followed Mr Lloyd contacted Mr McPartland and arranged a meeting of the two men. 'Paul Lloyd showed Mr McPartland CCTV of the incident on a laptop, gave his interpretation of the footage and requested Mr McPartland relay this to Mr Gerrard. 'The only copy of the CCTV had been provided to the defendant (Jones). It could not have been obtained by anyone else but the defendant. 'Paul Lloyd said he had been offered a substantial amount of money by the press for his story.' The court heard that Gerrard's and Liverpool FC's solicitor was later contacted by the head of press at Anfield to say that The Sun newspaper had been provided with a copy of the footage. PCSO Jones is said to have pretended she was on-duty in order to get the footage from a bank in the village of Formby, Merseyside (above) Mr Haworth added: 'Whether that is right or wrong is perhaps unimportant ... but it was reported to the police and an investigation got under way as to how the CCTV had passed into the hands, ostensibly, of a civilian. Those enquiries led to the defendant, who by this time was in London, being arrested on October 2, 2013.' Jones at first denied any knowledge of any of the parties involved, handling the footage or entering the bank. She claimed that she was in Liverpool with her niece on the day the footage was seized. It was only in September this year, days before her trial was due to begin, that Jones admitted taking the footage, saying she acted out of concern for someone who had claimed to have been assaulted by a group 'that included a well-known individual' who intended to use it for 'civil redress through the courts if necessary'. Footballer: Gerrard (right) in action for Liverpool against West Ham United in a Premier League match at Upton Park. West Ham player Stewart Downing is pictured (left), but is not related to this case . She claimed in a defence statement: 'I had been assured that there was no intention to use any evidence criminally. I wasn't made aware that the recording may be offered to the press.' Jones was due to give evidence later as her defence team argued that she was unaware of any criminal purpose to be carried out by others with the film. But Mr Haworth added: 'The nature of what's being sought, the individuals who are alleged to have been involved in the incident which took place and the means by which this defendant was asked to obtain the item concerned, gives rise to the inference that ultimately this item would be used as a tool to blackmail parties involved in the incident of August 4.' Jones was suspended from duty and then resigned in December last year. The case continues.

"Nasa has revealed one of the most complete maps of an asteroid ever created - and it helps reveal how the huge body was formed. Images from Nasa's Dawn Mission have been used to create a series of high-resolution geological maps of the large asteroid Vesta, revealing the variety of surface features in unprecedented detail. They show the towering mountains at the south pole â more than twice the height of Mount Everest, and huge craters that litter the surface. This high-resolution geological map of Vesta was made using data from the Dawn spacecraft. Brown colors represent the oldest, most heavily cratered surface. Purple colors in the north and light blue represent terrains modified by the Veneneia and Rheasilvia impacts, respectively. Light purples and dark blue colors below the equator represent the interior of the Rheasilvia and Veneneia basins. Greens and yellows represent relatively young landslides or other downhill movement and crater impact materials. Asteroids like Vesta are remnants of the formation of the solar system, giving scientists a peek at its history. Asteroids could also harbor molecules that are the building blocks of life and reveal clues about the origins of life on Earth. Vesta is one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System, with a mean diameter of 525 kilometres (326 mi). It was discovered by Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on 29 March 1807 and is named after Vesta, the virgin goddess of home and hearth from Roman mythology. The peak of Vesta's tallest mountain rises up nearly 13 miles (22 kilometers) above the rough surrounding terrain. 'The geologic mapping campaign at Vesta took about two-and-a-half years to complete, and the resulting maps enabled us to recognize a geologic timescale of Vesta for comparison to other planets,' said David A. Williams of Arizona State University, who led the study. The mapping was carried out using images from NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which orbited Vesta between June 2011 and September 2012. The images let scientists create high-resolution geological maps, revealing the variety of Vesta's surface features in unprecedented detail. 'The geologic mapping campaign at Vesta took about two and a half years to complete,' says Williams. 'The resulting maps enabled us to construct a geologic time scale of Vesta for comparison to other planets and moons.' The geologic map and timescale appear in a paper by Williams and others in the December 2014 issue of the journal Icarus. Scientists discovered through these maps that impacts from several large meteorites have shaped Vesta's history. Asteroids like Vesta are remnants of the formation of the solar system, giving scientists a peek at its history. Asteroids could also harbor molecules that are the building blocks of life and reveal clues about the origins of life on Earth. Vesta's geologic timescale is determined by the sequence of large impact events, primarily by the Veneneia and Rheasilvia impacts in Vesta's early history and the Marcia impact in its late history. The oldest crust on Vesta pre-dates the Veneneia impact. A previous mission created these images of the Northern (left) and southern (right) hemispheres. The 'Snowman' craters are at the top of the left image; Rheasilvia and Veneneia (green and blue) dominate the right. Parallel troughs are seen in both. The relative timescale is supplemented by model-based absolute ages from two different approaches that apply crater statistics to date the surface. 'This mapping was crucial for getting a better understanding of Vesta's geological history, as well as providing context for the compositional information that we received from other instruments on the spacecraft: the visible and infrared (VIR) mapping spectrometer and the gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND),' said Carol Raymond, Dawn's deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Dawn spacecraft is currently on its way to Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt. Dawn will arrive at Ceres in March 2015. The mappers found that Vesta's geologic time scale has been shaped by a sequence of large impact events. The biggest of these were the impacts that blasted the large Veneneia and Rheasilvia craters early in Vesta's history, and the Marcia crater late in its history. The towering mountain at the south pole â more than twice the height of Mount Everest â is visible at the bottom of the image. The set of three craters known as the 'snowman' can be seen at the top left. In mapping an extraterrestrial object, scientists begin by studying its surface features to develop a relative chronology of events. They look to see which feature interrupts or disturbs other features, thereby placing them in a relative time sequence. Then, crater by crater, fracture by fracture, scientists build up a chronology of events. 'Figuring out an actual date in years is a step-by-step-by-step process,' explains Williams. 'We work with rock samples from the moon, mostly from Apollo missions decades ago. 'These give actual dates for large lunar impacts.' The tricky part, he says, lies in creating a model that links the lunar impact time scale to the rest of the solar system. In the case of Vesta, scientists have developed two different models to estimate surface ages. One is based on the lunar impact rate, the other on the frequency of asteroid impacts. Thus scientists can use two approaches with crater statistics to date Vesta's surface, but these yield two different age ranges. Applying the models to Vesta, Williams' team concluded that the oldest surviving crust on Vesta predates the Veneneia impact, which has an age of 2.1 billion years (asteroid system) or 3.7 billion years (lunar system). The Rheasilvia impact likely has an age of around 1 billion years (asteroids) or 3.5 billion years (lunar). 'Vesta's last big event, the Marcia impact, has an age that's still uncertain,' says Williams. 'But our current best estimates suggest an age between roughly 120 and 390 million years.' The difference, he explains, comes from which cratering model is used.","Images from Nasa's Dawn Mission have been used to create a series of high-resolution geological maps .

"A Melbourne man has prompted concern after offering  women money for sex on the dating site OKCupid. Daniel, 28, asked several women if they have 'ever been offered money', before naming prices and urging them to consider the offer. None of the women reported the messages to police, as the messages are not considered illegal in Australia, reportsÂ The Age. Daniel, 28, asked several women on OKCupid if they have 'ever been offered money', before naming prices and urging them to consider the offer . On his profile, Daniel said that he was from Melbourne, with the personal description that he was 'extremely unlucky in love and not your average guy.' Daniel, who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja, has since deleted the offending OKCupid account. In all of the proposals towards Melbourne based women, Daniel offered $500 then raised the sum to $1000 then $2000. One of the women said he had been messaging her intermittently from different accounts for years. However, none of the women who were messaged by Daniel reported him to police. Daniel is seen urging the women to consider his offer of money for sex . Daniel, who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja, has since deleted the offending OKCupid account . A police spokesperson said that no offence had been committed in the messages: in Australia, it is legal to offer money for sex. Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of feminism and prostitution at Melbourne University, told The Age laws should be tightened up on dating sites. 'Women are in no position to know whether men who they have never met are going to be dangerous to them or not,' she told The Age. She said Daniel's messages would have been deemed illegal in Ireland, Canada, Sweden and Norway, where it is unlawful to offer money for sex.

"Nurse David Hadfield had denied attacking the elderly patient but was found guilty by a jury five weeks ago . A nurse has been jailed for 15 months for headbutting a vulnerable patient in his care. David Hadfield, 54, struck  72-year-old Thomas Bretherton three times while he was being treated at Royal Blackburn Hospital. The vicious attack left the seriously ill patient with cuts to his forehead. Mr Bretherton was admitted to hospital in August last year with acute pancreatitis and Hadfield was assigned to look after him, a court heard. The pensioner, who was confused and having trouble breathing, was attacked after he became distressed when Hadfield changed his sheets. Father-of-two Hadfield, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, who had been a nurse for 30 years before the incident on August 6 last year, denied attacking the pensioner but was found guilty by a jury following a trial five weeks ago. Jailing him for just 15 months, Judge Simon Newell said the attack, which lasted a few seconds, happened when Hadfield 'lost control'. He said: 'You were dealing with an elderly, vulnerable and very ill man. 'Ordinary members of the community would find this a gross violation of trust. 'When Mr Bretherton was admitted to hospital, he would have expected care and compassion. 'You were part of that respected team but on that night you caused harm and damage to Mr Bretherton. 'You caused distress and upset to his family. His wife and children would have expected their father to be treated well and professionally. 'They had to face his death for wholly separate reasons, which is difficult for any family, but the difficulty was compounded by this incident and still to this day isn't over. 'There is no doubt that his family will have concerns over what would have happened to their father if you hadn't assaulted him that day.' Mr Bretherton was admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital in August last year with acute pancreatits and Hadfield was assigned to look after him . Mr Bretherton died shortly after the alleged attack, although his passing was not related at all to the incident. But his family said they felt 'devastated' at Hadfield's short sentence. Speaking after the sentencing at PrestonÂ Crown Court today, Mr Bretherton's wife Marie, who cried as she walked out of court, said: 'The sentence is far too short. 'It doesn't bring my husband back or change what has happened. 'As a family, I don't think we'll feel any sense of closure because he's been sent to prison for a few months. I feel devastated.' The court heard how Mr Bretherton, of Blackburn, Lancs., had been 'calm and sleeping' when Hadfield entered the room at around midnight during a night shift to change his sheet. Judge Simon Newell told the nurse he had 'lost control' before jailing him for 15 months at Preston Crown Court . But, when the grandfather-of-five became distressed and tried to get out of bed, Hadfield became 'aggressive'. Judge Newell added: 'You went in to see Mr Bretherton and he became difficult but nothing that is out of the ordinary with patients in hospital environments. 'There was a clash of heads and for whatever reason, to the disbelief of others present, you responded by saying 'come on then'. 'You headbutted him three times. For whatever reason, your loss of control lasted for seconds only. 'It was brief, unexplained and wholly out of character.' The court heard how nurses witnessed the incident on a monitor located near to where they were standing at the time. Hadfield was found guilty of unlawful wounding following a four-day trial.","David Hadfield, 54, struck vulnerable Thomas Bretherton three times .

"A callous thief stole a pot of money belonging to a severely disabled man by posing as his carer. Patrick McKinlay, 25, who has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, accidentally left his pot of money at the Tesco Extra cafÃ© in Barrow, Cumbria. Staff at the store, where Mr McKinlay is a regular, noticed the pot had been left behind on the table and put it behind the counter for safe-keeping. The pot contained between Â£8 and Â£9. A thief stole a pot of money belonging to Patrick McKinlay, 25, who has spina bifida, after he left it on the table at a Tesco cafÃ© in Barrow, Cumbria. He is pictured with his personal support worker Andrea Foster . Staff at the store, where Mr McKinlay (pictured with his mother) is a regular, noticed the pot had been left behind and put it behind the counter for safe-keeping, but a man falsely claimed to be the young man's carer . But, minutes later, a thief tricked staff into handing over the money, by claiming he was Mr McKinlay's carer. The man even gave a detailed description of the pot in order to convince staff that the item should be handed over.Â He then left the store. The young man's mother Carole McKinlay, 58, said it was 'frightening' to think that the thief could have been watching her son and his carer before carrying out the crime. Carole McKinlay, 58, said it was 'frightening' to think the thief could have been watching her son before the incident . She said: 'Patrick has a little pot of money that he carries with him whenever he goes to town so he can buy DVDs or a bag of chips or a cup of tea. 'It's his little thing that he does. It upset him because he couldn't get the DVD that he wanted because he didn't have the money. 'He couldn't understand that he didn't have the money any more. 'I was quite frightened that someone would pretend to be his carer, they must have been watching him. 'I was quite disgusted that someone could do that to be honest.' The suspect is described as a slim white male with black hair. The incident occurred between 2.30pm and 3pm on Friday, November 14. Mrs McKinlay has now urged any witnesses to come forward. She said: 'I'd just like to say if anyone knows anything about it or if they were there on the day and might have seen something please come forward.' Sergeant John McIntosh of Barrow Police said: 'What makes this crime so unusual is the impact it's had on the victim. 'Hopefully this appeal to the members of the public will help bring the perpetrator to justice.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Cumbria Police on 101 and ask to speak to PC 2063 Callum Lennox. A Tesco spokesman said: 'We were sorry to hear about this incident and we value Patrick as a regular visitor to our store. Weâll be helping the Police with their investigation.'","Patrick McKinlay, who has spina bifida, visited Tesco Extra cafÃ© in Barrow .

"Attacker: Shaqueil Samuels repeatedly punched a passenger on a train who glanced at him . A teenager who attacked two strangers in just three days and blamed his behaviour on being a âyoung black maleâ was spared jail today. Shaqueil Samuels, 19, was one of three thugs who turned on night bus passenger Bronson Maisey, 39, after he told them to stop pressing the stop button. The security officer was repeatedly punched and had to cling to a pole to prevent his assailants from dragging him onto the street. Samuels, of Manor Park in East London, had jumped off the bus but got back on after seeing his friends Tesco employee Adebambo Karumwi, 18, and fitness instructor Roland Mubenga, 19, also from Manor Park, start the fight. Mr Maisey lost a tooth and has had to have extensive dental work since the assault on the N25 night bus as it made its way towards Stratford, east London, in the early hours of December 30, 2012. Just three days earlier Samuels repeatedly punched a passenger on a train going from Ilford to Liverpool Street just before it pulled in to Stratford, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. When he put his bag down next to 49-year-old Hamadi Nebili, the passenger looked up from his newspaper. Samuels stared at Mr Nebili and said: âAre you looking? Are you gay?â He then unloaded a barrage of punches at the terrified passenger, leaving him with serious head wounds which required stitches. In a letter to the court Mr Nebili said he now feels anxious every time he leaves his home while Mr Maisey said he has lost his confidence when out and about. Judge Sarah Paneth said: âThese were two serious assaults on public transport without provocation of justification. âIâve been told and reject the notion that your actions (Samuels) were due to what you believed to be othersâ perception of yourself as a young black male - you cannot be defended on circumstances that are habitual. âWhat you all did was conform to the stereotype you so despise and brought shame to the black community and to your families. âYou all come from stable and supportive families but you do not deserve medals for travelling on public transport since the offence with no problems - millions of people do that every day. Roland Mubenga, who with Adebambo Karumwi, repeatedly punched a security officer, who had to cling to a pole to prevent his assailants from dragging him onto the street . âIt was a group attack on a lone person and you are all responsible. Look at it this way, I am sure the three of you would not have chosen to attack a young man with a group of friends. Mr Maisey was an easy target. âI had adjourned this sentencing to see your remorse and to see whether you were really willing to pay compensation. âI accept this was out of character as there is no evidence of this behaviour before or after these incidents. âAll three of you have before and since been entirely law-abiding and a credit to your community and families. âI note that you are prepared to back that up by paying compensation and you are all still in your teens. The effect long term for you and for society are extremely important factors to consider.â Judge Paneth sentenced Samuels to serve two years in prison, Mubenga to 12 months and Karumwi to 15 months. All three sentences were suspended for two years with a condition of unpaid work. Samuels must do 200 hours while the other two defendants have to do 100 hours each. Samuels must also pay Mr Nebili and Mr Maisey Â£500 each in compensation while Mubenga and Karumwi were ordered to pay Mr Maisey Â£500 each. Judge Paneth added: âI make it clear the only reason you are all not going into custody today is that these incidents are extremely out of character and isolated.â The three defendants were all friends and used to go to the same gym together, the court was told. Samuels, who cares for his arthritis-suffering mother, is now said to feel ashamed by how he reacted to the situations.","Shaqueil Samuels, 19, punched a bus passenger who glanced at him .

"Family and friends desperately searching for a British father who vanished ten days ago on a stag do in Prague have accused police of not doing enough to find him. Karl Law, 34, disappeared in the Czech capital on November 15 and friends who were with him said it was a complete mystery what happened to him. But Prague police have rejected the family's claims, insisting they started the search 24 hours after the man was reported missing. Missing: Karl Law, 34, a builder from Fareham, Hampshire, in the same clothes he was wearing when he disappeared after getting separated from his cousin's stag do on November 15 . Devastated: Karl has missed the birthday of his son, Lenny, three. He has now been missing for ten days . Prague police even claimed he had been sighted twice on separate occasions a day and two days after he vanished, and that he seemed to be either drunk or on drugs. The builder, from Fareham, Hampshire, went missing at 11.30pm after becoming separated from a 13-strong stag party in Prague's Old Town Square. His friends only realised he was missing when they returned to their hotel at 3am on Sunday and discovered that he was not with them. Then when he didn't turn up for their flight home, panic began to set in. The father-of-one did not have a passport, mobile phone or bank card with him but was carrying around Â£170 in cash. He has now missed the birthday of his son Lenny.Â His fiancee, Amanda Collins, 30, who he's dated for eight years until getting engaged after their son was born, toldÂ The Mirror: 'I am just really, really worried. For him to miss our son's birthday is really worrying. I have no idea what could have happened to him. He absolutely doted on Lenny.' His family and friends set up a Facebook page on which news and pictures about the search for Karl have been shared. On Sunday, seven days after the search was launched, the page's creators posted: 'Please keep sharing, we need all the awareness as we can get. Police in Prague just don't want to play ball.' Last picture: Karl with his friends on the stag do just before he vanished on Prague's Old Town Square . Popular: A flyer from the bar where Karl was last seen on the night he disappeared. Prague has been a favourite for stag dos for a decade as it offers cheap drink, lively bars and it is inexpensive to fly there . The wife of one of the stag night revellers, Louise Thorton-Turp who has also been searching for Karl told MailOnline: 'They don't seem to be doing a lot, we have had to hire a private detective as even the local police station didn't appear to know anything about it since we reported it and they have not been helpful at all. 'We feel like we are being left to sort it out ourselves which isn't great as we can't speak Czech.' But Prague police spokesman Tomas Hulan told MailOnline: 'We reject the claim that Prague policemen are not searching for the missing man and are not co-operating with the family. 'Our investigators have been doing their best to find the 34-year-old man as soon as possible.' He said they had been working round the clock to try and trace him and that they had confirmed he had been sighted a day later, on November 16, in the city's Palackeho Square and a day after that near the National Theatre. He said: 'In both cases he showed obvious signs of drunkenness and some kind of confusion.' Mr Hulan went on to claim that Czech police had been told by Hampshire police, who have been supporting the hunt, that Karl had been on drugs 'at least one or two days before his vanishing'. But Karl's brother, Craig, denied he had been taking drugs. When asked about the claims he said: 'This is none of your business. But no, it's not true.' A Hampshire police spokesman said: 'Our role in this is to support the family and give them as much assistance as possible. Whether he has been taking drugs or not is really not relevant to that role.' The spokesman added: 'We don't routinely pass on details of what information our detectives have passed on with other police.' Craig, 30, alerted both the police and the British embassy in Prague and has remained in the Czech capital this week to try and find his brother. He said: 'We have contacted the police and visited local hospitals but cannot find any trace of him. We have put up posters all over the place appealing for information. Dismay: Karl's brother Craig, 30, is among a group of family and friends who have stayed in Prague and vow to bring him home. They have now hired a private detective to help with the search . Sick with worry: Karl's fiance, Amanda Collins (pictured with Karl above) said she has no idea what has happened, adding: 'For him to miss our son's birthday is really worrying' Devoted: Karl's shocked family told the BBC that he 'dotes on his son' and was the 'nicest lad' 'I will stay here as long as it takes to find him. We just want him to make contact with us.' Karl flew out to Prague with friends and family to celebrate his cousin Lee Cross's impending wedding. His worried cousin and his fiancee Natalie Grainger, 34, have now postponed their wedding until they find Karl, and said it would not be right to celebrate when he was missing. She said: 'We're all just so worried, I can't get married when I know he's not there. I can't believe he would miss his little boy's birthday, he was telling everyone how excited he was about it.' Lee, 41, said: 'I couldn't even think about getting married until Karl is found safe and well.' Craig added that Karl lost his mobile phone on Friday night. The following evening the group left their Jury's Inn hotel and visited bars in the Old Town Square including one in which they took a group photograph which included Karl. Shortly afterwards the group split, and eight of them went on to the Maxim Bar nightclub. It was at this point that Karl was last seen, they say. Karl has been pictured in Czech national newspapers and TV stations with an appeal for witnesses. Luke, from Fareham, currently staying in Prague wrote on Facebook: 'Today I was approached by the Police in Prague on my way to work, they were asking about and showing pictures of Karl, there were actually a few of them walking around the Andel area.

"As the leader of the worldâs most feared and brutal terrorist organisation, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi emerged from hiding hoping to strike fear into his opponents. But the elusive head of the Al-Qaeda aligned Islamic State group found himself the subject of mockery after delivering his sermon wearing a bulky designer watch. Dressed in black robes and turban, Baghdadiâs appearance was the first since he declared himself the caliph, or leader, of the worldâs 1.2 billion Muslims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Public address: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was mocked for demanding loyalty from Muslims worldwide while sporting a flashy watch . Zoom: Some speculated online that it was a Rolex or Omega piece costing thousands of pounds . His decision to wear the silver . accessory, thought to be a Rolex or Sekonda costing up to Â£4,000, as he . asked followers to âobeyâ him, was ridiculed by commentators. The . costly timepiece was said to jar with his choice of black outfit, . believed to be an attempt to mimic Islamic leaders from over 1,000 years . ago. One Twitter user wrote . said:Â  âThe funny thing about Caliph Baghdadi is that he has a very . sophisticated watch and he still can tell which millennium it is. Another said: âOur caliph, bless him, was probably wearing a Swiss watch. Which brand and where did it come from?â And a third tweeted: âI mean the caliph looks like heâs doing alright.â Watch me: The self-anointed 'Caliph Ibrahim' conducted a 20-minute sermon wearing the watch this week . Alternative: Despite the criticism some have claimed it is in fact a pious Islamic model . Others said that it was contradictory to the content of his speech in which he described his followers as equals. Described . as the worldâs most wanted man, militants operating under Baghdadiâs . control have spread terror through Syria and Iraq in an attempt to form a . new Islamic state in the Middle East. The . Sunni fighters, responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands, have . vowed to expand the so-called caliphate to huge swathes of Europe and . Africa. Video footage of . Baghdadi, who has garnered the nickname âthe invisible sheikhâ due to . his elusive nature, emerged online on Friday and was quickly spread by . jihadi websites. Fighters . from the group â previously known as ISIS - were among those who joined a . packed congregation at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraqâs second largest . city, as he delivered the 21-minute speech. Referring . to himself as âthe leader who presides over youâ, Baghdadi said that he . could return the Muslim world to âdignity, might, rights and . leadership.â He said: âI am . the wali (leader) who presides over you, though I am not the best of . you, so if you see that I am right, assist me.â âI am not better than you or more virtuous than you,â he added. People were quick to spot the watch being worn by al-Baghdadi as he conducted the 20-minute sermon . Another asked on Twitter what make watch the Caliph was wearing during the video . He . also used the sermon to praise his army of fighters, who have taken . control of Mosul only one month before, and called for the strict . interpretation of Islamic law. âGod . gave your mujahedeen brothers victory after long years of jihad and . patience... so they declared the caliphate and placed the caliph in . charge,â he said. âThis is a duty on Muslims that has been lost for centuries.â Analysis of the video suggests that the black-faced watch could be an Omega Seamaster, which can cost up to Â£4,000. Omega has been associated with James Bond movies since 1995. When Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond he wore the Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional in the movie GoldenEye. In all later films, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Chronometer. Daniel Craig, who starred in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, also wears the Omega Seamaster. The watch is believed to be either a Rolex, Sekonda or Â£4,000 Omega Seamaster (pictured) Fit for a spy: Actor Pierce Brosnan as James Bond 007 wearing the Omega Seamaster watch . Only . two images of Baghdadi â who was the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq - are . thought to have existed before his appearance in the video.

Iraqi . officials last night said they were still working to authenticate the . video but it is understood initial investigations have concluded the . preacher is Baghdadi. The US offered Â£5.8million for information leading to his capture or death in 2011 .

"The outspoken teenage sister of Bristol Palinâs ex-fiancÃ© certainly has an agenda to dish up dirt on the family that she claims âscrewed upâ hers.

Mercede, whose brother Levi Johnston, 21, was twice engaged to Bristol, also alleged the young woman's brother Track Palin, 22, was a drug user.

"Schools are teaching on the cheap by using unqualified staff, a teachersâ union claims. Teaching assistants and support staff are being drafted in to take classes, according to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). It says many are asked to provide cover for teachers, with some taking lessons for three days or more. 'On the cheap': Almost a quarter of assistants said they had been asked to cover lessons . It questioned 1,435 of its school support members in state-funded schools in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. They are often hired to oversee classes while teachers are doing work such as lesson planning. Some 25.4 per cent of the teaching assistants and learning support workers questioned, 49.1 per cent of higher level teaching assistants and 96.1 per cent of cover supervisors said they were asked to cover lessons. Of all of those surveyed, . two-fifths said they had been asked to provide more or the same amount . of cover for absent teachers in 2012/13 than the year before. The rest said they had been asked to provide less, or the question was not relevant.

'We are totally opposed to this exploitation of support staff who are being used as a cheap option to teachers. 'It is grossly unfair on them and on the children and their parents who rightly expect their children to be taught by qualified teachers.' A Department for Education spokeswoman said: 'The Government's recent review of school efficiency showed that, when properly trained and deployed, teaching assistants play an important role in helping to improve learning. 'But the rules are clear - they should not be teaching.

"The fascinating surface of Jupiter's icy moon looms large in this newly-reprocessed image, which is exactly how Europa would appear to the human eye. The image, remastered from one captured by Galileo in the late 1990s, shows the largest portion of the moon's surface at the highest resolution ever seen. Long cracks crisscross the surface, interrupted by dramatic ridges where the surface ice crust has been broken up and re-frozen into new patterns. Scroll down for video . The fascinating surface of Jupiter's icy moon looms large in this newly-reprocessed image, which is exactly how Europa would appear to the human eye. The image, remastered from one captured by Galileo in the late 1990s, shows the largest portion of the moon's surface at the highest resolution ever seen. It has scale of one mile (1.6 km) per pixel . North on Europa is shown on the right, and the colours across the surface are associated with differences in geologic feature and location. For instance, areas that appear blue or white contain relatively pure water ice, while reddish and brown areas include non-ice components in higher concentrations. It is not yet known what these components are, although Nasa has speculated that it may be a clay-like material. The polar regions, visible at the left and right of this view, are noticeably bluer than the more equatorial latitudes, due to differences in ice grain size. Galileo images taken through near-infrared, green and violet filters have been combined to produce this view, which has a scale of one mile (1.6 km) per pixel. Nasa attempted to create a similar image in 2001 (pictured). This features colour profiles that had been increased to make contrast across the surface more obvious. The latest image, however, is more similar to what a human would see with the naked eye . Jupiter's icy moon Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's moon. Europa orbits Jupiter every 3.5 days and is tidally locked - just like Earth's Moon - so that the same side of Europa faces Jupiter at all times. It is thought to have an iron core, a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water, like Earth. Unlike on Earth, however, this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of Europa, and being far from the sun, the ocean surface is globally frozen over. Many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable for life. Scientists claim that hidden beneath the icy surface of this incredible landscape is perhaps the most promising place in our solar system beyond Earth for life to exist. They are eager to learn if the reddish-brown fractures, and other markings spattered across the surface, contain clues about the geological history of Europa and the chemistry of the global ocean that is thought to exist beneath the ice. The Galileo mission found strong evidence that a subsurface ocean of salty water is in contact with a rocky seafloor. Scientists believe the cycling of material between the ocean and ice shell could potentially provide sources of chemical energy that could sustain simple life forms. It is believed that geysers spurting out of Jupiterâs moon may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface. This was based on observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon, lending evidence to the existence of jets. In September, Jupiterâs moon Europa has been found to have tectonic activity like Earth. This was the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet. The surface of Europa is slightly smaller than the Earthâs moon. Blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the San Andreas Fault move past each other on Earth. Earlier this year, scientists found evidence of plate tectonics on Jupiter's moon Europa. This conceptual illustration of the subduction process - where one plate is forced under another - shows how a cold, brittle, outer portion of Europa's ice shell moved into the warmer shell interior . This view an impact crater on Europa was created in 2013 using 3D stereo images taken by the Galileo spacecraft, combined with advanced image processing techniques. The crater has a diameter of about 11 miles (18km.) Young, well-preserved craters, like this Cilix crater, are rare on Europa's surface, where ongoing geologic activity is thought to disrupt most surface features over timescales of tens of millions of years .","The stunning image shows the largest portion of Jupiter's moon's surface at the highest resolution ever seen .

"Scrapped: A collection about Winston Churchill is to be taken down at Bletchley Park . The new chief executive of a museum dedicated to the Second World War code-breakers has sparked anger after announcing plans to remove Winston Churchill memorabilia. Iain Standen said having a collection about the wartime prime minister was 'not synonymous' with Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire, and likened it to having 'Charles and Diana mugs in someone's house'. The trustees plan to take down the collection of pictures, posters, books, pamphlets and busts because they are not see as relevant. Churchill once described the code-breakers who cracked the German's Enigma code as 'the geese that laid the golden eggs - but never cackled.' According to the museum's website, the privately-owned collection has many rare and interesting pieces and fascinating stories that enthrall visiting pupils. The displays chronologically illustrate events and episodes in Churchillâs life. A selection of Churchillâs broadcast speeches is also available for students to hear. Examples of his literary works and reproductions of his paintings can be seen, and the displays span from his birth in 1874 through to his schooling, military career, political life, premiership, his likes and leisure pursuits, and finally his state funeral. Vital: Bletchley Park played a crucial role in ensuring an Allied victory in World War Two . Students are also allowed to ring the bell of The Havengore, the launch used to carry Sir Winstonâs coffin up the river Thames. Historian Sarah Lambert, of Goldsmith's, University of London, said the exhibition must be protected and remain accessible to the public. She told the Daily Express: 'This shows that history needs more funding so people are not put in the position of choosing one thing over another.' Historic: Wrens working on the Enigma code-breaking operation in Bletchley Park . Getting the message: One of Bletchley Park's computing machines in action during World War Two . Instead, the Churchill exhibition will be replaced with stories of the people who worked at the intelligence-gathering station near Milton Keynes during the war. Mr Standen said the Churchill Collection was not museum-standard but just 'one man's obsession'. It is feared other displays such as the Pigeons At War exhibition could also be scrapped following a Â£7.5million restoration of the site. The code-breakers wrote to Churchill in 1941 pleading for more resources. The prime minister ordered immediate action to make sure they had everything needed to carry out their vital work. Father of the modern computer Alan Turing who led the team of Enigma code-breakers at Bletchley Park . But Mr Standen said: 'Bletchley Park is moving into a very exciting period in its development as we begin to undertake a partly publicly funded major restoration project which will start the process of turning the Park into a national, and in time we hope world class, heritage attraction. 'Part of this process involves working towards achieving national museum accreditation and as such we no longer have the space or are in the position to play host to a number of privately owned collections which are not focused on the World War Two Code-breaking story. 'As a result we have reviewed the terms on which a number of such collections occupy space in the Park and have recently written to all outlining the specific conditions pertinent to each. 'Winston Churchillâs unerring support for Bletchley Park and the value of signals intelligence during World War Two, were clearly vital to the success of the operation. 'However, an individualâs collection of Churchill memorabilia does not tell this story. 'In short this is an interesting and exciting time for the Bletchley Park Trust, but with such developments as we are currently undergoing, there will inevitably be change. 'This may not please everyone, but the Bletchley Park Trustees are clear that what we are doing at the moment is necessary and important for the long-term future of the Park.' During the war Bletchley Park housed the government's secret Code and Cypher School, which obtained signals intelligence by breaking high-level encrypted enemy communications. It was also home to the Colossus machine, the first programmable electronic computer. The Colossus and the Turing Bombe Machine, an an electromechanical device designed by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, were used to break codes created by the German Enigma encryption and decryption machine, which is also on display at Bletchley Park. The importance of the code-breaking operations at Bletchley Park cannot be underestimated. They produced vital intelligence that played a huge part in swinging the war in the Alliesâ favour. By 1944 British and American commanders knew the location of 58 out of 60 German divisions across the Western Front. In addition, a great deal of information was decrypted about General Erwin Rommelâs Nazi forces in North Africa. The German commander enjoyed a great deal of success against the British but with the help of intelligence from the code-breakers General Bernard Montgomery's British forces were able to drive him back in 1942. Discussions with the owners of all the other private collections on the Bletchley Park site are ongoing.","Chief executive of museum likened collection to 'Charles and Diana mugs'

"Labour is losing is claim to be the party of the working class to Ukip, according to a devastating poll which will make grim reading for Ed Miliband. The survey shows more voters believe Nigel Farageâs party is in touch with the concerns of white, working class people across the country than the Labour party, which has long claimed to represent them. It comes after Mr Miliband sacked frontbencher Emily Thornberry after being accused of sneering at working class voters after posting a photograph online of a house in Rochester with three England flags and a white van outside. Labourâs hopes of securing victory in next yearâs general election depend on holding on to their core working class vote in the north, and building support in the south. But Mr Miliband has been stung by claims he is an out-of-touch North London intellectual with little in common with millions of working class voters. Just 21 per cent of voters believe Labour is most in touch with the white working-class compared to 27 per cent who said the same of Ukip, according to a YouGov poll for The Times. Among white working class voters the gap was even wider: 29 per cent thought Ukip best represented them, while just 20 per cent thought Labour was most in tune with their lives. It is a major boost for Ukip which hopes to build on the success of getting MPs in Clacton and Rochester and Strood by making in-roads into Labour heartlands. There is growing unease in the Labour leadership that it is seen as out of touch with working voters. Mr Miliband sought to burnish his working class credentials, declaring that when he saw a white van he thought: âRespect.â Ukip leader Nigel Farage hopes to build on his success against the Tories by taking on Ed Miliband's Labour party in their working class heartlands . On Thursday night he demanded Mrs Thornberry quit the shadow Cabinet after telling MailOnline she had 'never seen anything like it' when she tweeted a picture of a terrace home in Rochester with three England flags and a white van parked in the drive. The Islington South MP faced a barrage of criticism including from outraged Labour colleagues who accused her of being 'derogatory'. One senior Labour insider said it was 'worse than the Gillian Duffy moment' when Gordon Brown was recorded calling a voter a 'bigoted woman' after she raised concerns about immigration. Labour frontbenchers have been ordered to hold town hall meetings in their constituencies to discuss the issue of immigration. There are fears the party has failed to do enough to tackle the threat of Ukip, which came within 617 votes of beating Labour to win the Heywood and Middleton by-election. Emily Thornberry quit the Labour frontbench last week after tweeting this picture of a house in Rochester . The Islington South MP faced a barrage of criticism including from outraged Labour colleagues who accused her of being 'derogatory' However, yesterday a separate poll showed Â quarter of Britons would fall out with their friends if they discovered they were Ukip supporters. Despite a surge in support Ukip remains by the far the most toxic of the all the main political parties. Three times as many people said they would âfind it harder to stay close with a good friendâ if they voted Ukip than if they supported the Tories. Just one in 14 Britons said they would struggle to stay friends with a Conservative supporter â compared to one in four who admitted they would not be able to remain close to a Ukip voter. Labour is the least âtoxicâ of all the main Westminster parties â with just three per cent of the public admitting that they would stop being friends with someone who backed Ed Miliband.

"A Romanian MP was stunned after a family of millionaire gypsies moved into his mansion after he was late paying back a loan secured on a 20 percent share in his property, and the bank sold it off to the gypsies to recover the debt.

Details of the case were revealed in papers filed by Agrigoroaei at court and with local police from which he also requested protection. He said he also made the same request to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Gabriel Oprea. The intimidation included the discovery one morning that the gypsies had made a hole as a grave in his back garden, and warned him that he would soon be filling it. The intimidation, it's claimed, included the discovery one morning that the gypsies had made a hole as a grave in Agrigoroaei's back garden, and warned him that he would soon be filling it . Violent: Alleged ringleaderÂ Vandam Constantin was apparently filmed on CCTV attacking representatives of a car service . Vandam is said to have posted pictures of his son online with what looks like a handgun . Bragging: Vandam apparently also posted a picture of his baby covered in money on the internet . Agrigoroaei said: 'I feel very much that my life is in danger and that of my wife. Only last week they told my wife Antonela it was a shame she was going to die so young. And they told my brother Danut they would paralyse him and that he should stay away from me. 'In the past few weeks I've been threatened with death or I was told I would be left paralysed at least 30 times. It is clear they want me to leave the house so they can use the whole building.' MP Agrigoroaei said that the grave and the other threats were being coordinated by 18-year-old gypsy Vandam Constantin. According to locals his family wanted to name him after Jean-Claude Van Damme, but because none of them could spell properly the baby had ended up with the name Vandam. The Piraeus Bank that sold the stake in the property has declined to comment on the case. There is also currently no investigation as to where the teenager, who apparently has no income, managed to find 37,000 euros (Â£29,000) to pay for it. He said: 'The police don't have to look very hard for proof of the intimidation, they are even conducting the campaign online.' For example, Vandam recently posted on Facebook: 'Any beginning has an end, but for some people the end will be tragic.' He also posted snaps of his son with what looks like a real handgun and with bundles of cash. It is not Vandam's first brush with the law. The 18-year-old was in the middle of another scandal in March when he attacked the employees of a car service firm with an axe after they asked him why he had crossed into an employee only service area and was rummaging through things. Even though a complaint by the car firm included CCTV images backing up the allegation, the complaint was later withdrawn after the manager suddenly changed their mind and police were forced to drop the matter. And last year he reportedly attacked a barber with a knife because he did not like the haircut he got.","Romanian MP Ionel Agrigoroaei alleges a gypsy gang has made his life hell .

"Jim Murphy (pictured) said he would introduce a 50p top rate of tax for the wealthiest in Scotland should he become First Minister . The frontrunner to be Labourâs new leader in Scotland yesterday demanded full control over income tax for Edinburgh despite deep splits in the party over the implications of the move. Jim Murphy, a former shadow Cabinet minister, said he was backing full devolution to dispel the idea that senior figures in the party were âmore interested in Labour than Scotlandâ. He said he would introduce a new 50p top rate of tax for the wealthiest in Scotland if he becomes First Minister â and he added that Ed Miliband and Ed Balls âcan read about it in the papers like everyone elseâ. Mr Murphy made the announcement before the publication tomorrow of a cross-party commission on which extra powers should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament following the No vote in Septemberâs independence referendum. The Smith Commission, which was charged by David Cameron with getting an agreement among parties, is expected to recommend devolving extra power over income tax. Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats support the idea, but senior Labour figures have warned it will undermine the integrity of the UK. Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls is said to have warned colleagues it is also likely to mean Scottish MPs being barred from voting on tax affairs at Westminster â a move that could make it impossible for a future Labour government to pass Budgets. Instead, Labour has previously backed the idea of devolving control of 75 per cent of the basic rate of income tax to Scotland. Former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay, who represented an Essex constituency, said: âIf Labour agree that the Scots Parliament shall fix income tax rates in Scotland, it must also accept that Scots MPs in Westminster can longer vote on income taxation levels for the rest of the United Kingdom. âA commitment this week to devolve income tax levels is a step which has major constitutional and economic ramifications for the entire Union, upon which the peoples of England,Wales and Northern Ireland have a right to be consulted.â Under reforms in the recently passed Scotland Act, members of the Scottish parliament will soon take control of a 10p share of income tax, with a corresponding cut in the block grant from Westminster.","Former shadow Cabinet minister Jim Murphy is backing full devolution .

"After a long lull, terrorists struck in Hyderabad with three bomb explosions in the thickly populated Dilsukhnagar area, killing at least 11 people and injuring more than 80 on Thursday evening. Unofficially, 22 people were killed in the blasts. A fourth bomb was defused before it could detonate. Although no group claimed the responsibility for the blasts, the use of bombs mounted on cycles had the imprint of Indian Mujahideen. There was no official word on who was behind the blasts, either. The state police department put the preliminary toll at 11. ""The condition of another seven to eight persons is said to be highly critical,"" Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy told media late at night. Horror in Hyderabad: People search for survivors after three bomb blasts strike Dilsukhnagar . Caught in the blasts: The first explosion took place shortly before 7pm when office workers were making their way home . The blasts took place at two places within a distance of 100-120 metres at Dilsukhnagar on the National Highway No. 9. The area is an extremely busy commercial zone with several shopping malls, cinema theatres, hospitals and educational institutions. Both locations are near the Dilsukhnagar bus terminus, which is a major junction carrying buses to the coastal Andhra region, as well as different parts of the city. The upcoming Hyderabad Metro Rail Project work is also in full swing in the area. According to eye-witness accounts, the first blast took place at around 6.58pm at a snack kiosk in front of Anand Tiffin Centre, an eatery located close to Konark theatre adjacent to the traffic circle, referred to as Rajiv Gandhi Chowk. At around 7.01pm, before passersby could realise what exactly had happened, there were two other loud explosions at a bus stand adjacent to Venkatadri theatre. The bus stand where passengers were waiting to return to their homes was blown off completely, sending victims' body parts flying into the air. ""I was standing on the other side of the road waiting for a bus when I heard the bomb explode. The sound was so deafening that I could not understand what was going on. I jumped over the road divider and reached the spot only to find blood-soaked bodies strewn all around and others writhing in pain. ""It was then I realised that there was a bomb explosion. Immediately, with the help of the others, we stopped a few auto rickshaws and sent the injured to the Yashoda Hospital,"" a local businessman Shivaji told Mail Today. Raju, another eye-witness, said he had seen the mangled bodies of three girls at the bus stand, where the blast took place. ""It was all blood and gore in the area and the scene was horrific. I had to pick up courage and shift the bodies into private vehicles to be taken to Osmania Hospital,"" he said. Within minutes of the incident, the police reached the spot and cordoned off the area. ""We got the information that there were three more bombs planted in the locality and we immediately called for the bomb squad to search for them,"" a police official said. According to the preliminary investigation, the bombs were mounted on bicycles â one behind the bus stand and another near the Tiffin Centre, a kiosk selling tea and snacks. Both the bicycles were mangled completely. The LPG cylinder at the snack kiosk also exploded due to the blast. The intensity of the explosion was so strong that the glass panes of the adjacent shopping malls were broken to pieces. While some of the injured were rushed to Osmania Hospital, others were taken to nearby corporate and other private hospitals. The condition of several of them is said to be very serious. Some of the victims who died in the explosion were identified as: Izad Ahmed, Vijaya Kumar, Rajasekhar, Ramulu, Mohammad Ali, Andalu, Krishnakanth, Rafi and Tirupati. Strongly condemning the blasts in Hyderabad, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tonight said those responsible for the dastardly act would not go unpunished as he appealed for peace. Singh sanctioned Rs 2 lakh each to next of kin of those killed in the blasts and Rs 50,000 each to those seriously injured from the PM's Relief Fund. By A. Srinivasa Rao in Hyderabad . ""My brother went to the other side of the road to buy footwear. He has not returned so far. He is also not responding to my calls. Where has he gone?"" Lakshmaiah, a private employee, was asking the police at Dilsukhnagar, an hour after three bomb explosions ripped through the area on Thursday evening. Lakshmaiah, who belonged to Timmapur village of Karimnagar district, said his brother Mahesh, 32, had crossed the road to reach a footwear shop adjacent to Venkatadri theatre. ""He told me to wait for some time. Both of us were planning to return home by an autorickshaw. In the meantime, loud explosions took place. I don't know what happened to him,"" he said, crying loudly. Distraught: A relative reacts at the Omini hospital as panic spread through the city following the blasts . Doctors treat a man injured during the bomb blasts at a Hyderabad hospital . A bus shelter has been ripped to pieces by the bomb blast . Babu Rao, a local Lok Satta Party leader, was one of the first people to reach the spot. ""I was just going to Shirdi Sai Baba temple, a furlong away. As I was walking through, I heard the explosions. Immediately, I rushed to the spot only to find pieces of flesh strewn all around. Several people were seriously injured crying for help. I tried to shift as many people as possible to the nearby Omni Hospital,"" he said. Two youths from Adilabad district, Vijay and Rajasekhar, who were being tutored for the sub-inspector recruitment test in Dilsukhnagar and were having snacks at a kiosk near Anand tiffin centre, died on the spot.

"'Murdered': Pictured is Shafilea Ahmed - her parents are on trial for her killing . A teenager was killed by her Pakistan-born parents because they believed her Westernised lifestyle had brought shame on the family, a court heard yesterday. Nine years after their daughter Shafilea vanished, Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed have gone on trial accused of murder. The court heard that police made a breakthrough in the case when Shafileaâs sister told them she saw them kill the 17-year-old. Shafilea had wanted to go to university to study law and have boyfriends like other girls her age, a jury was told. But her parents are alleged to have resorted to violence in trying to force her to follow a traditional lifestyle, sending her to Pakistan for an arranged marriage. There she swallowed bleach and was flown back to Britain for medical treatment. She vanished from the family home in September 2003 just days after she enrolled at college and started a part-time job. Her parents failed to report her missing, and the alarm was raised a week later by a teacher. Her decomposed body was found five months later in undergrowth on the banks of a river. Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, said Shafilea had been âa thoroughly Westernised young British girl of Pakistani originâ who was subjected to violence for refusing to conform to her parentsâ expectations. Accused of murder: Shafelia's mother Farzana Ahmed, left, andÂ  Iftikhar Ahmed, right, arriving at Chester Crown Court today . âThe defendants, having spent the best part of 12 months trying to crush her will, realised they were never going to be able to succeed and finally killed her because her conduct dishonoured the family, bringing shame on them,â he added. The eldest of five children, Shafilea was a keen student at her school in Warrington, Cheshire, and enjoyed trips to shopping centres and wearing Western clothes, Chester Crown Court was told. âIn particular she wanted to have boyfriends â as most 16 and 17-year-old girls do,â Mr Edis said. âThat caused intense friction, stress and anger in this family. Her parents began to seek to control her.â 'Killing': Shafilea Ahmed's family home in Warrington, Cheshire . They would take away her mobile phone to stop her ringing boys and she complained that they stole money from her bank account. Friends and teachers became concerned when she went to school with injuries that she said had been caused by her parents, Mr Edis added. Shafilea then began to run away from home. 'Domestic abuse': The victim suffered at the hands of her parents in the year before she died, it was claimed . In February 2003, she fled in the night and attempted to cut her ties with her parents entirely, only for her father to âabductâ her in his taxi when he saw her walking to school, the prosecutor said. Mr Edis said it was at that point that her parents put together a âhastily arrangedâ plan to fly to Pakistan with Shafilea and persuade her into an arranged marriage with a cousin. However while staying with her grandparents in rural Pakistan, she drank from a bottle of bleach, causing severe damage to her throat. âIf it was not a suicide attempt, it was an act of desperation,â Mr Edis said. âIt put an end to the idea that she was going to get married and live in Pakistan.â Shafilea flew home in May and spent the summer receiving regular hospital treatment before enrolling at sixth-form college to studyÂ  A-levels while also working in telesales. The court heard she resumed her Western lifestyle, bringing her into fresh conflict with her parentsâ âconcept of shame and honourâ. She was last seen alive on the evening of September 11 when her 49-year-old mother picked her up from work. A week later, Mr Edis said, one of Shafileaâs teachers reported her missing after hearing that her sister Alesha had told friends her parents had killed her. But Alesha â then 15 â retracted her claim, and her parents insisted they did not know where Shafilea was. Mr Edis said the family made no effort to find Shafilea and even put their home on sale. One potential buyer was told by Mr Ahmed, 52, that they were moving because their daughter had âbrought shameâ on the family. Shafileaâs remains were found in February 2004 near Sedgwick in Cumbria, close to where the M6 leads north from Warrington. Mr Edis said analysis of the scene showed she had been dumped there shortly after going missing.No more light was shed on her killing until two years ago when Alesha â then 22 â was arrested over a robbery at the family home. She later told police âshe had witnessed the killing of her elder sister by her two parents, both of them acting togetherâ, Mr Edis said. In the dock: Iftikhar Ahmed and his wife Farazna leaving Chester courts after the start of their murder trial . Accused: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are said to have killed their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to obey them . Witness: Alesha Ahmed kept quiet for seven years and only told police when she was arrested over a robbery . âHer evidence was the final piece of the puzzle which the police had been trying to solve for many years with careful and thorough inquiries.â The jury was told officers bugged the Ahmedsâ home and recorded them discussing the possibility that they were under surveillance. At one point Mrs Ahmed was taped warning 13-year-old Junyade to keep quiet and not talk about events to anyone, he added. She said: âIf the slightest thing comes out of your mouth, for all of our lives we will be stuck in real trouble. You will not find your mum or dad. âRemember that â they take people away.â Searches also found song lyrics written by Shafilea about her predicament. In one, entitled Happy Families, she wrote:Â  âAll they think about is honour ... I jusâ wanted to fit in, but my culture was different.â The jury heard that Mr Ahmed had been married in Denmark and had a son, but had been instructed by an uncle to marry Farzana. Mr Edis said his acceptance that he had to do his âdutyâ in this case could suggest that he would expect his daughter âwould likewise do as she was toldâ when a husband was found for her. Dressed in a brown headscarf, Mrs Ahmed sat next to a translator interpreting into Punjabi for her. Her husband was seated on the other side of the interpreter. The couple both deny murder and the case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Shafilea Ahmed's decomposed remains were found in February 2004 .

"A new and potentially more accurate test for prostate cancer is being trialled across the UK. The new multi parametric (MP) MRI scans could give accurate and detailed images making it easier to identify whether or not a patient has prostate cancer. The new scans could also predict the size of a tumour and how aggressive it is. The trial is testing whether the use of these advanced MRI scans can detect the condition, without the need for painful and invasive biopsies. Currently, men with suspected prostate cancer have a blood test to see if a higher level of protein - known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) - is found. A new and potentially more accurate test for prostate cancer is being trialled across the UK. Multi parametric (MP) MRI scans can give accurate and detailed images making it easier to diagnose cancer, without a biopsy . If the protein is found, they are referred on for a transrectal ultrasound (Trus) guided biopsy. This procedure involves using an ultrasound probe to guide a needle through the walls of the rectum and into the prostate gland to take samples to be analysed. It is performed under local anaesthetic. However, a spokesman for Southampton General Hospital, one of the centres trialling the new technique, said the current test is invasive but not always accurate. He said: 'As the ultrasound cannot always reliably identify the disease, it can miss some cancers or lead to over-diagnosis, frequently resulting in unnecessary surgery. 'However, the latest imaging technology, known as multi parametric (MP) MRI, can produce accurate and detailed scans that could make it easier to identify whether or not a patient has cancer and, if so, the specific size, position and aggressiveness of it. To protect against prostate cancer, take a lover - or 20. Men who sleep with multiple women are almost a third less likely to develop the disease, according to Canadian research published in October. Researchers found men who have more than 20 notches on their bedpost slashed their risk of prostate cancer by 28 per cent. And the study also revealed that men who have slept with more than 20 women reduced their chances of getting the most aggressive tumours by 19 per cent. Celibacy, on the other hand, doubles the risk of the disease. 'This could enable clinicians to either rule out the need for further testing or, if cancer is found, give a clearer understanding of which part of the prostate is affected.' At the moment, all men with raised PSA or an abnormal feeling prostate are advised to have a biopsy. But many will not have cancer. Most will be suffering another condition which raises PSA levels in the blood, such as enlarged prostate. Tim Dudderidge, a consultant urological surgeon at Southampton General Hospital, said these biopsies miss some cancers, and falsely diagnose others, leading to unnecessary treatment. He said: 'These biopsies can miss cancers in some areas of the prostate which the needle cannot reach, or pick up tiny traces of cancer that might be slow-growing and harmless. 'This leads to men having unnecessary surgery to remove the prostate gland.' Mr Dudderidge is now working with colleagues at another nine sites across the country to recruit 700 men with suspected prostate cancer for the study by October 2015. He said: 'If, as we think, the study shows us that (MP) MRI can accurately identify those who have cancer and those who don't, it will truly revolutionise diagnosis for men with prostate cancer. 'It will mean those with a negative scan will avoid undergoing potentially painful and invasive biopsies, while those with positive scans will benefit from their specialists having much greater detail of their cancer at the earliest possible stage.' Prostate cancer, which mainly affects men over 50, is the most common type of cancer in men with around 37,000 new cases diagnosed in the UK every year. Currently, prostate cancer is diagnosed with a painful and invasive biopsy which involves using an ultrasound probe to guide a needle through the walls of the rectum and into the prostate gland. Here, cancerous cells are pictured under a microscope .","New technique being trialled usesÂ multi parametric (MP) MRI scans .
